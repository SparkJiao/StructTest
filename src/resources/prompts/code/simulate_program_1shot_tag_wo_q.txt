## Instruction

I will show you a program as well as a group of inputs. Please simulate the execution process of this function, and return me back to the outputs.

## Response Format

Please include your final results following the expected output format within <ans> and </ans> tags.


## Notes:

- You can simulate the program step by step via arbitrary formats. Just remember to tag the final results last.
- Please follow the expected output format defined by the program.
- The output(s) should be in proper python object so that we can use `eval(x)` to initialize it/them.
- The values of different arguments are separated by commas.

Here is an example for your reference:

### Code snippet

```
def maxScore(cardPoints: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    max_score = 0
    curr_score= 0
    init_hand = cardPoints[len(cardPoints)-k:]
    max_score = sum(init_hand)
    curr_score = max_score
    for i in range(k):
        curr_score -= init_hand[i]
        curr_score += cardPoints[i]
        if curr_score > max_score:
            max_score = curr_score
    return max_score
```

### Inputs

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,1], 3
```

### Response

Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `max_score` and `curr_score` to 0.
2. Initialize `init_hand` to the last `k` elements of `cardPoints`. As a result, we have `init_hand = [5,6,1]`.
3. Initialize `max_score` to the sum of `init_hand`. As a result, we have `max_score = 12`.
4. Initialize `curr_score` to `max_score`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 12`.
5. Iterate over the range of `k`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Update `curr_score` by subtracting the first element of `init_hand` and adding the first element of `cardPoints`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 12 - 5 + 1 = 8`.
    - Check if `curr_score` is greater than `max_score`. Since `8` is not greater than `12`, we don't update `max_score`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Update `curr_score` by subtracting the second element of `init_hand` and adding the second element of `cardPoints`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 8 - 6 + 2 = 4`.
    - Check if `curr_score` is greater than `max_score`. Since `4` is not greater than `12`, we don't update `max_score`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.
    - Update `curr_score` by subtracting the third element of `init_hand` and adding the third element of `cardPoints`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 4 - 1 + 3 = 6`.
    - Check if `curr_score` is greater than `max_score`. Since `6` is not greater than `12`, we don't update `max_score`.
6. Return `max_score`. As a result, we have `12`.

So the final result is
<ans>
12
</ans>
