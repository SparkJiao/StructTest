## Instruction

I will show you a code snippet. Please add a print statement whenever a new variable is defined, following the format below:

print(“X: ”, str(x), “Y: ”: str(Y), …)

where `X` and `Y` should be the newly defined variables.

### Notes:

- If there is no newly defined variables, do not add any print statements.
- If some variables that were initialized previously are assigned with new values, add print statements for these variables after the newest assignments, too.
- Do not change any content of the other code
- Overlook the temperature variables like those defined in for loops.

### Response Format

Please include your answer within <ans> and </ans> tags.

### Example

Here is an example for your reference:

#### The code to add print statements

```
def get_last_checkpoint(folder):
    content = os.listdir(folder)
    checkpoints = [
        path
        for path in content
        if _re_checkpoint.search(path) is not None and os.path.isdir(os.path.join(folder, path))
    ]
    if len(checkpoints) == 0:
        return None
    return os.path.join(folder, max(checkpoints, key=lambda x: int(_re_checkpoint.search(x).groups()[0])))
```
