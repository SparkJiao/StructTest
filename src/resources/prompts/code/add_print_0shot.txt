### Instruction

I will show you a code snippet. Please add a print statement whenever a new variable is defined, following the format below:

print(“X: ”, str(x), “Y: ”: str(Y), …)

where `X` and `Y` should be the newly defined variables.

#### Notes:

- If there is no newly defined variables, do not add any print statements.
- If some variables that were initialized previously are assigned with new values, add print statements for these variables after the newest assignments, too.
- Do not change any content of the other code

#### Response Format
