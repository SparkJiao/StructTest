## Instruction

You are an expert programmer. I will show you a programming problem as well as one solution program. Please help me to generate **5** groups of test case inputs to this function.

### Response format

1. Your test case inputs should be in the correct python object format so that we can initialize them into an argument list by calling `func(*eval(inputs))`.
2. Separate each group of test case inputs simply by new lines.
3. Include all the generated test case inputs within `<ans>` and `</ans>` tags.

Here is an example for your reference:

#### Problem description

Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:

Every song is played at least once
A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played

Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

#### Solution program

```
def numMusicPlaylists(N: int, L: int, K: int) -> int:
    s=0
    c=0
    r=0
    x=math.factorial(N)
    while(True):
        c=x*((N-r-K)**(L-K))*(-1)**(r)//(math.factorial(N-r-K)*math.factorial(r))
        if(c!=0):
            s=(s+c)%(10**9+7)
            r+=1
        else:
            return s
```
