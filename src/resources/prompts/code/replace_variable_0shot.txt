## Instruction

I will show you a code snippet. Your task is to replace the name of variables to different ones according to the mapping I give to you, and return me back the new code snippet after replacement.

### Response format

Please include your answer within <ans> and </ans> tags.

Note that you should not replace the variables reserved as internal attributes or function names. For example, in python, you could replace `path` with `ppp`, but you should not change `os.path` as `os.ppp` since `path` in an attribute of `os`.
