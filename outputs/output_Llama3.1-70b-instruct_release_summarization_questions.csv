[What is the main point?]: The main point of the text is the discovery of a super-orbital period in the X-ray binary XB158, which is associated with the M31 globular cluster B158. The super-orbital period is found to be 5.65 days, and the 0.3-10 keV luminosity varies by a factor of 15.

The Bureau is implementing a new strategy, known as the ""three-legged stool,"" which includes the American Community Survey (ACS), the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) enhancements, and a short-form-only census. However, the Bureau faces challenges in securing congressional approval, addressing methodological questions, and ensuring the accuracy of the census data.

[Why is it happening]: The Census Bureau is required by the Constitution to conduct a census every 10 years to apportion seats in the House of Representatives.

[What is the main point?]: The study investigates the relationship between habitual physical activity, sedentary behavior, and metabolically detrimental fat depots, such as visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL), in adults with overweight or obesity.
