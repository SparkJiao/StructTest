0,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the given inputs.

### Inputs Breakdown
- `n = 7` (number of elements in the array)
- `m = 4` (number of offers)
- `k = 5` (remaining items to process)
- `arr = [2, 5, 4, 2, 6, 3, 1]` (the array of costs)
- Offers:
  - `2 1`
  - `6 5`
  - `2 1`
  - `3 1`

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `arr` is sorted: 
   ```
   arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

2. **Processing Offers**:
   - The offers are processed to create a sorted list of offers:
   ```
   offers = [(2, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (6, 5)]
   ```
   - After processing, we keep only the maximum free items for each unique offer count.

3. **Dynamic Programming Dictionary Initialization**:
   - An empty dictionary `dp` is initialized to store computed results.

4. **Brute Force Function Execution**:
   - The `brute` function is called with parameters: `arr`, `dp`, `offers`, `index = 0`, and `remain = 5`.

5. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The function checks if `remain` is 0 (base case). If so, it returns 0.
   - It checks if the current state `(index, remain)` is already computed in `dp`. If so, it returns the stored value.
   - It calculates the minimum cost by considering:
     - Taking the current item at `index` and recursively calling `brute` for the next index with `remain - 1`.
     - Checking each offer to see if it can be applied and calculating the cost accordingly.

6. **Calculating Costs**:
   - The function explores all combinations of taking items and applying offers, recursively calculating the minimum cost for each state until all items are processed or no items remain.

7. **Final Result**:
   - After all recursive calls are completed, the minimum cost for processing `k` items is stored in `dp` and returned.

1. **Function Call**: The function `DivisorFactorial` is called with the parameters `N=3`, `FactDec=[]`, `FactCnt=[]`, `MemoFlag=False`, `Mod=10**9+7`, and `ModFlag=True`.

2. **Check N**: Since `N` is greater than `1`, we proceed to the else block.

3. **Loop from 2 to N**: We enter a loop that iterates from `2` to `3` (inclusive).

   - **Iteration with TN=2**:
     - Call `PrimeDecomp(2, False)`.
     - Inside `PrimeDecomp`, since `N=2` is greater than `1`, we initialize `I=2`, `PrimeDec=[]`, `PrimeCnt=[]`, and `DivCount=1`.
     - The while loop checks if `I*I <= N` (which is `4 <= 2`, false), so we skip it.
     - Since `N >= 2`, we append `2` to `PrimeDec` and `1` to `PrimeCnt`, and update `DivCount` to `2`.
     - Return `PrimeDec=[2]`, `PrimeCnt=[1]`, and `_ = 2`.
     - Back in `DivisorFactorial`, we have `PrimeDec=[2]` and `PrimeCnt=[1]`.
     - We check if `2` is in `FactDec` (which it is not), so we append `2` to `FactDec` and `1` to `FactCnt`.
     - Now, `FactDec=[2]` and `FactCnt=[1]`.

   - **Iteration with TN=3**:
     - Call `PrimeDecomp(3, False)`.
     - Inside `PrimeDecomp`, since `N=3` is greater than `1`, we initialize `I=2`, `PrimeDec=[]`, `PrimeCnt=[]`, and `DivCount=1`.
     - The while loop checks if `I*I <= N` (which is `4 <= 3`, false), so we skip it.
     - Since `N >= 2`, we append `3` to `PrimeDec` and `1` to `PrimeCnt`, and update `DivCount` to `2`.
     - Return `PrimeDec=[3",0,{}
2,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the input `4`.

1. The input `n` is set to `4`.
2. The function `calculate_colors(n)` is called with `n = 4`.
3. Inside `calculate_colors`, the generator `gen_primes()` is initialized to generate prime numbers.
4. The variable `sqr_n` is calculated as `int(sqrt(4)) + 1`, which equals `3`.
5. The function checks if `n` is equal to `1`. Since `n` is `4`, it proceeds to the next step.
6. The function enters a loop to get prime numbers from `gen_primes()`:
   - The first prime number generated is `2`.
7. The function checks if `4` is divisible by `2` (`4 % 2 == 0`), which is true.
8. Inside the loop, it enters another loop to divide `n` by `p` (which is `2`):
   - It calculates `g = gcd(2, 4)`, which is `2`.
   - It updates `n` to `4 // 2 = 2`.
   - It calculates `g = gcd(2, 2)`, which is `2`.
   - It updates `n` to `2 // 2 = 1`.
9. Now `n` is `1`, so the function returns `p`, which is `2`.
10. The final output of the function is printed, which is `2`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mod` is set to `2`.
   - `A` is initialized as a numpy array: `A = np.array([1, 0], dtype=np.int64)`.
   - `X` is created as a numpy array of integers from `0` to `mod-1`: `X = np.arange(2, dtype=np.int64)` which results in `X = [0, 1]`.

2. **Calling `polynomial_interpolation(X, A)`**:
   - The function checks the length of `xs` (which is `X`): `n = len(xs) = 2`.
   - Since `n` is greater than `1`, it proceeds to calculate the bit length: `bit = (n-1).bit_length() = 1`.

3. **Creating `fpss`**:
   - `k = 1 << bit = 2`.
   - `fpss` is initialized as a zero array of shape `(bit+1, n+1)`: `fpss = np.zeros((2, 3), dtype=np.int64)`.
   - The first row of `fpss` is filled with `-xs % mod`: `fpss[0, :n] = -X % 2`, resulting in `fpss[0] = [0, 1]`.

4. **Filling `fpss`**:
   - For `i = 0`, `step = 2 << i = 2`, `half = step >> 1 = 1`.
   - For `j = 0`, it checks if `j + half >= n`, which is false, so it proceeds to copy:
     - `f1 = fpss[0, 0:1+1].copy() = [0, 1]`.
     - `f2 = fpss[0, 1:2+1].copy() = [1]`.
     - Set `f1[-1]` and `f2[-1]` to `1`: `f1 = [0, 1]`, `f2 = [1]`.

     - Call `check(5)`:

       - `date_last_sales` is created to track which items were sold on which days.
       - The balance is updated based on the required quantities and sales.

   - The third line `2 1` gives us the dimensions of the second painting: `numa = [3, 1, 2]`, `numb = [2, 3, 1]`.

2. **Initialization of the Art Class**:
   - An instance of the `Art` class is created with `args = [[3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1]]`.
   - Inside the `__init__` method:
     - `self.numa` is set to `[3, 1, 2]`.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line indicates `n = 2`.
   - The next two lines provide the swaps:
     - First swap: `4 2`
     - Second swap: `1 4`
   - We will store these swaps in a list called `swaps`.

2. **Building the `swaps` List:**
   - After processing the input, `swaps` will be: `[4, 2, 1, 4]`.

3. **Creating Position Dictionary:**
   - We create a `defaultdict` called `pos` to store the indices of each value in `swaps`.
   - After iterating through `swaps`, we get:
     - `pos[4] = [0, 3]` (indices of value 4)
     - `pos[2] = [1]` (index of value 2)
     - `pos[1] = [2]` (index of value 1)

4. **Coordinate Compression:**
   - We initialize `compr` as a list of zeros with length `2*n = 4` and `decompr` as an empty dictionary.
   - We sort the unique values in `swaps`, which are `[1, 2, 4]`.
   - We assign compressed values:
     - For `1`, we assign `compr[2] = 0` and `decompr[0] = 1`.
     - For `2`, we assign `compr[1] = 1` and `decompr[1] = 2`.
     - For `4`, we assign `compr[0] = 2` and `decompr[2] = 4`.
   - After this step, we have:
     - `compr = [2, 1, 0, 2]`
     - `decompr = {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 4}`

   - We initialize two lists `xs` and `ys` of size `n` (1 in this case).
   - We read the next line of input, which is `0 1`. This means:
     - `xs[0] = 0.0`
     - `ys[0] = 1.0`

2. **Check for Sign Change**:
   - Since `i` is `0`, we do not check for sign change (the condition `if i > 0` is false).

3. **Initial Radius Check**:
   - We check if `good(1)` returns `True`:
     - Inside `good(R)` with `R = 1`:
       - Initialize `left = -10**20` and `right = 10**20`.
       - Loop through `n` (which is 1):

           - Calculate `sD = mysqrt(D) = mysqrt(1) = 1.0`.
           - Calculate `new_left = xi - sD = 0.0 - 1.0 = -1.0`.
           - Calculate `new_right = xi + sD = 0.0 + 1.0 = 1.0`.

1. **Input Parsing**: We read the input values `x = 3` and `y = 9`.

2. **Check Divisibility**: We check if `y % x != 0`. Since `9 % 3 == 0`, we proceed.

3. **Update `y`**: We update `y` by dividing it by `x`. So, `y = 9 // 3 = 3`.

4. **Initialize Variables**: We initialize `divs` as an empty set and `to_gen` as an empty list. We also set `num = 2` and `val = 3`.

5. **Finding Prime Factors**:
   - We enter the while loop `while num * num <= val` (i.e., `while 2 * 2 <= 3`).
   - Inside the loop, we initialize `degree = 0`.
   - We check if `y % num == 0` (i.e., `3 % 2 != 0`), so `degree` remains `0`.
   - Since `degree` is `0`, we do not append anything to `to_gen`.
   - We increment `num` to `3`.
   - We check the condition again (`while 3 * 3 <= 3`), which is false, so we exit the loop.
   - After the loop, we check if `y != 1`. Since `y = 3`, we append `(3, 1)` to `to_gen`.

6. **Generating Divisors**:
   - We set `to_gen_len = 1` (length of `to_gen`).
   - We define the `generate` function to yield divisors.

2. **Index Initialization**:
   - We initialize `idx` as `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - We then sort `idx` based on the values in `p` in descending order. The sorted order will be:
     - `idx[0] = 1` (p[1] = 3)

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line of input is split into `n`, where `r = 4` and `k = 3`.
   - The next lines are read into the list `l`:
     ```
     l = ['#..#', '#.#.', '....', '.###']

2. **Initializing `rl`:**
   - Create a 4x4 matrix `rl` initialized with zeros:

     rl = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0],

   - **Row 0 (`#..#`):**
     - Check segments starting at indices 0, 1 (only index 1 is valid).

   - `n = 2`
   - `x = 3`
   - `st` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of 100500: `st = [0]*100500`
   - `xored` is also initialized similarly: `xored = [0]*100500`

2. **Reading Input**:
   - We read `n` integers from the input. The integers are `1` and `2`.
   - For each integer read, we increment the corresponding index in `st`:
     - For `1`: `st[1] += 1` → `st[1] = 1`
     - For `2`: `st[2] += 1` → `st[2] = 1`
   - After this loop, `st` looks like this:
     ```
     st = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]  # Only indices 1 and 2 are non-zero
     ```

3. **Calculating `xored`**:
   - We iterate over the range of `100500` to calculate `xored`:
   - For each `idx`, we compute `pair = idx ^ x` and check if `pair < 100500`. If true, we set `xored[pair] = st[idx]`.
   - Let's compute a few values:
     - For `idx = 0`: `pair = 0 ^ 3 = 3`, `xored[3] = st[0] = 0`
     - For `idx = 1`: `pair = 1 ^ 3 = 2`, `xored[2] = st[1] = 1`

2. The second input is read into the list `a`, resulting in `a = [1, 0, 0]`.
3. The `run` function is called with `n = 3` and `a = [1, 0, 0]`.

#### Inside the `run` function:
1. A loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n` (which is `3`), so it will iterate for `i = 0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`.
   
   - **Iteration 1 (i = 0)**:
     - Check if `a[0] == 0`. Since `a[0] = 1`, this condition is false.
     - Enter the inner loop which runs for `j` from `0` to `n-1` (i.e., `0` to `2`).
       - **Sub-iteration 1 (j = 0)**:
         - Since `j % 2 == 0`, update `a[0]`: 
           - `a[0] = (1 + 1) % 3 = 2`.
       - **Sub-iteration 2 (j = 1)**:
         - Since `j % 2 != 0`, update `a[1]`: 
           - `a[1] = (0 - 1) % 3 = 2`.
       - **Sub-iteration 3 (j = 2)**:
         - Since `j % 2 == 0`, update `a[2]`: 
           - `a[2] = (0 + 1) % 3 = 1`.
     - After the first iteration, `a` becomes `[2, 2, 1]`.

   - **Iteration 2 (i = 1)**:
     - Check if `a[0] == 0`. Since `a[0] = 2`, this condition is false.

1. **Initialization**:

   - `d = 1233`
   
2. **Calculate Modular Inverse**:
   - Call `m_reverse(d, base)`:
     - Inside `m_reverse`, call `e_gcd(1233, 998244353)`:
       - Since `b` is not zero, we recursively call `e_gcd(998244353 % 1233, 1233)` which simplifies to `e_gcd(1233, 998244353 % 1233)`.
       - This process continues until we reach a base case where `b` becomes zero.
       - The final result of `e_gcd` gives us `d = 1`, `x = 1`, and `y = -1` (the exact values of `x` and `y` depend on the recursive calculations).
     - Back in `m_reverse`, since `d == 1`, we compute `x % n`:
       - If `x % n <= 0`, return `x % n + n`, else return `x % n`.
       - Let's assume `x % n` gives us `1` (this is a simplification, the actual value depends on the calculations).
     - Thus, `t = 1`.

3. **Calculate `z`**:
   - `z = t * d % base = 1 * 1233 % 998244353 = 1233`.

   - `N, M, K = 3, 3, 0`.

   - `Z = N - J = 3 - 2 = 1`.

6. **Calculate `R`**:
   - Initialize `R = M = 3`.

3. **Factorization:**
   - We initialize `factors` as an empty dictionary.
   - We loop through the first 10 elements of `l` (which are all elements since `n=4`):
     - For `2`: Factors are `[2]`, so `factors` becomes `{2: 0}`.

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 6`, `m = 10`, `k = 5`
   - `connectionList` is initialized as a list of empty lists for each vertex: `connectionList = [[], [], [], [], [], []]`
   - `edgeList` is initialized as an empty list: `edgeList = []`

2. **Reading Edges**:
   - For each of the 10 edges, we read the values and append them to `edgeList`:
     - After reading all edges, `edgeList` becomes:
       ```
       edgeList = [(2, 5, 1), (5, 3, 9), (6, 2, 2), (1, 3, 1), (5, 1, 8), (6, 5, 10), (1, 6, 5), (6, 4, 6), (3, 6, 2), (3, 4, 5)]
       ```

3. **Sorting Edges**:
   - We sort `edgeList` based on the weight (third element):
     ```
     edgeList = [(1, 3, 1), (2, 5, 1), (6, 2, 2), (3, 6, 2), (1, 6, 5), (3, 4, 5), (5, 1, 8), (5, 3, 9), (6, 4, 6), (6, 5, 10)]
     ```

4. **Determining `maxDist`**:
   - Since `k < m`, we set `maxDist` to the weight of the k-th edge:
     ```
     maxDist = edgeList[4][2] = 5
     ```

   - An instance of `Ddict` is created, initializing `self.dicts` as an empty dictionary.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0`.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The first input line is read: `""snow affects sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and snowmachine travel.""`
   - The length of this line is calculated: `len(x) + 1 = 66`.
   - `ans` is updated: `ans = 0 + 66 = 66`.

3. **Word Splitting**:
   - The line is processed to split it into words:
     - The words extracted are: `['snow', 'affects', 'sports', 'such', 'as', 'skiing', 'snowboarding', 'and', 'snowmachine', 'travel']`.

4. **Adding Words to Ddict**:
   - Each word is processed:
     - For `w = 'snow'`: 
       - `words.find('snow')` returns `('', '')` (not found).
       - `words.add('snow')` adds it to the dictionary.
     - For `w = 'affects'`: 
       - `words.find('affects')` returns `('', '')` (not found).

       - `words.add('such')` adds it to the dictionary.
     - For `w = 'as'`: 
       - `words.find('as')` returns `('', '')` (not found).
       - `words.add('as')` adds it to the dictionary.

       - `words.find('skiing')` returns `('', '')` (not found).

4. The `dfs` function is initially called with an empty string `v = """"`.

Now, let's go through the recursive calls of `dfs`:

- **First Call**: `dfs("""")`
  - `v` is `""""`, which is not greater than `575`.

      - `v` is `""3""`, which is not greater than `575`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `record` dictionary is initialized to store results for combinations of `(x, y, d)`.
   - A nested loop runs for `x`, `y`, and `d` from `0` to `9`.

2. **Filling the `record` dictionary**:
   - For each combination of `x`, `y`, and `d`, the code checks various conditions to compute values and store them in `record`.
   - The key points in this section are:
     - If both `x` and `y` are `0` and `d` is not `0`, it sets `record[(0, 0, d)] = -1`.
     - If either `x` or `y` is `0`, it checks divisibility conditions to compute the value.
     - For non-zero `x` and `y`, it checks combinations of `a` and `b` to find the minimum `a + b - 1` that satisfies the equation `x*a + y*b = d_tmp`.

3. **Processing the input string**:
   - The input string `s = ""0840""` is converted to a list of characters.
   - The frequency of differences `d` between consecutive characters is calculated:
     - For `s[0]` and `s[1]` ('0' and '8'): `d = (ord('8') - ord('0')) % 10 = 8`
     - For `s[1]` and `s[2]` ('8' and '4'): `d = (ord('4') - ord('8')) % 10 = 6`
     - For `s[2]` and `s[3]` ('4' and '0'): `d = (ord('0') - ord('4')) % 10 = 6`
   - The frequency array `freq` is updated:

     - `freq[6] += 2` → `freq[6] = 2`

r = 4
arr = [
    [4, 6],

    [8, -1]

```

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N = 3`
   - `r = 4`
   - `visited = [0, 0, 0]` (an array to track visited indices)
   - `a = [0, 0, 0]` (to store the first elements of each input pair)
   - `b = [0, 0, 0]` (to store the second elements of each input pair)
   - `pos = 0` (to count how many pairs have a non-negative second element)

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For `i = 0`: 
     - `arr = [4, 6]`
     - `a[0] = 4`, `b[0] = 6`
     - Since `b[0] >= 0`, increment `pos` to `1`.
   - For `i = 1`: 
     - `arr = [10, -2]`
     - `a[1] = 10`, `b[1] = -2`
     - `b[1] < 0`, so `pos` remains `1`.
   - For `i = 2`: 
     - `arr = [8, -1]`
     - `a[2] = 8`, `b[2] = -1`
     - `b[2] < 0`, so `pos` remains `1`.

   After this loop:
   - `a = [4, 10, 8]`
   - `b = [6, -2, -1]`
   - `pos = 1`

3. **Processing Positive Gains**:
   - For `i = 0` (since `pos = 1`, we only loop once):
     - Initialize `idx = -1`, `start = 0`, `gain = -50000`.
     - For `j = 0`: 
       - `visited[0] == 0` and `b[0] >= 0`, so:

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first input line is `1`, which means `n = 1`.
   - The second input line is `10 99`, which means `A = [10, 99]`.

2. **Calculate `n`**:
   - `n = int(input()) * 2` results in `n = 1 * 2 = 2`.

3. **Initialize `amount` and `B`**:
   - `amount = [0] * 101` initializes a list of size 101 with all elements set to 0.
   - `B = []` initializes an empty list.

4. **Populate `B`**:
   - Loop through `A` (which has 2 elements):
     - For `i = 0`, `A[0] = 10`:
       - Since `amount[10] < 2`, we increment `amount[10]` to 1 and append `(10, 0)` to `B`.
     - For `i = 1`, `A[1] = 99`:
       - Since `amount[99] < 2`, we increment `amount[99]` to 1 and append `(99, 1)` to `B`.
   - After the loop, `B = [(10, 0), (99, 1)]`.

5. **Sort `B`**:
   - `B.sort()` sorts `B` based on the first element of the tuples. After sorting, `B` remains `[(10, 0), (99, 1)]`.

6. **Initialize `x` and `y`**:
   - `x = []` and `y = []` are initialized as empty lists.

7. **Distribute indices into `x` and `y`**:
   - Loop through `B`:
     - For `i = 0`, since `i % 2 == 0`, append `B[0][1]` (which is `0`) to `x`. Now, `x = [0]`.
     - For `i = 1`, since `i % 2 != 0`, append `B[1][1]` (which is `1`) to `",0,{}

2. **Counting Characters**:
   - For each character in `a`:
     - For `i = 'b'`: `d = {'b': 1}`, `t = 1`
     - For `i = 'a'`: `d = {'b': 1, 'a': 1}`, `t = 2`
     - For `i = 'n'`: `d = {'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'n': 1}`, `t = 3`
     - For `i = 'a'`: `d = {'b': 1, 'a': 2, 'n': 1}`, `t = 3`
     - For `i = 'n'`: `d = {'b': 1, 'a': 2, 'n': 2}`, `t = 3`
     - For `i = 'a'`: `d = {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}`, `t = 3`
   - Final `d = {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}`

3. **Preparing Result Variables**:
   - `ans = []`
   - `res = """"`
   - For each character in `d`:
     - `ans = ['b']`, `res = 'b'`
     - `ans = ['b', 'a']`, `res = 'a'`
     - `ans = ['b', 'a', 'n']`, `res = 'n'`
   - Final `ans = ['b', 'a', 'n']`, `res = 'n'`

4. **Check if n is greater than or equal to length of a**:
   - Length of `a` is 6, which is greater than `n = 4`. So we skip this condition.

5. **Sorting and Binary Search**:
   - `d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda d: (d[1], d[0]))` results in `d = [('b', ",0,{}

- We create an instance of the `DSU` class, which initializes `_parent` and `_rank` as empty lists.

### Step 3: Process Each Node
- We iterate over each node `i` from `0` to `6` (total `n=7`):
  
#### Iteration 0 (i=0)
- `a[0]` is `0`, so no unions are made.

#### Iteration 1 (i=1)
- `a[1]` is `0`, so no unions are made.

#### Iteration 2 (i=2)
- `a[2]` is `0`, so no unions are made.

#### Iteration 3 (i=3)
- `a[3]` is `1`, so we union `0` and `3`.
  - `make()` is called for `0`, adding it to `_parent` and `_rank`.
  - `make()` is called for `3`, adding it to `_parent` and `_rank`.
  - `union(0, 3)` is called:
    - `find(0)` returns `0`.
    - `find(3)` returns `3`.
    - Since the ranks are equal, we set `_parent[3]` to `0` and increment the rank of `0`.

#### Iteration 4 (i=4)
- `a[4]` is `0`, so no unions are made.

#### Iteration 5 (i=5)
- `a[5]` is `0`, so no unions are made.

   - **Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:
     - `val = arr[1] = 9`
     - Since `win_idx == -1` and `val != -1`, we do not change `win_idx`.

     ranks = [0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]

   - Identify the leaf nodes:

     - Update `A[0]`: `A[0] -= nya` → `A[0] = 3 - 3 = 0`.
     - Update `v`: `v -= nya` → `v = 4 - 3 = 1`.
     - Update `ans`: `ans += nya` → `ans = 0 + 3 = 3`.
     - Now, calculate `nya = min(A[1], v)`, which gives `nya = min(5, 1) = 1`.
     - Update `A[1]`: `A[1] -= nya` → `A[1] = 5 - 1 = 4`.
     - Update `ans`: `ans += nya` → `ans = 3 + 1 = 4`.
   - **Second iteration (i = 1)**:
     - Set `v = B[1]`, so `v = 5`.

     - Update `v`: `v -= nya` → `v = 5 - 4 = 1`.
     - Update `ans`: `ans += nya` → `ans = 4 + 4 = 8`.
     - Now, calculate `nya = min(A[2], v)`, which gives `nya = min(2, 1) = 1`.

3. **Hashing Characters of `t`**:
   - For each character `c` in `t`:
     - For `c = 'c'`, set `hash_t[ord('c')] = True` (index 99).
     - For `c = 'b'`, set `hash_t[ord('b')] = True` (index 98).
     - For `c = 'a'`, set `hash_t[ord('a')] = True` (index 97).
     - For `c = 'a'`, already `True`.
     - For `c = 'b'`, already `True`.
     - For `c = 'c'`, already `True`.
   - After this loop, `hash_t` will have `True` at indices 97, 98, and 99.

4. **Checking for Missing Characters**:
   - Iterate over the range of 256:
     - Since all characters in `t` are present in `s` (all corresponding `hash_s` values for `True`), we do not print `-1` and return.

5. **Reversing `s`**:
   - Reverse `s` to get `rev = ""cba""`.

### Inputs
```
2
)
(()
```

### Execution Steps

1. The `main()` function is called.
2. It reads the first input `N`, which is `2`.
3. It reads the next `N` lines from standard input, resulting in the list `S = [')', '(()']`.
4. The `solve(S)` function is called with `S` as the argument.

### Inside `solve(S)`

1. Initialize `counts` as a list of lists: `counts = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
2. Use `map(get_count, list(zip(S, counts)))` to process each string in `S` with the `get_count` function.

### Processing with `get_count`

#### For the first string `')'`:
- Initialize `cum_sum = 0`.
- Iterate over the characters in the string:
  - For `c = ')'`: `cum_sum` becomes `-1`.
- Update `result[0]` to `max(0, -(-1)) = 1`.
- Update `result[1]` to `1 + (-1) = 0`.
- Return `result = [1, 0]`.

#### For the second string `'(()'`:
- Initialize `cum_sum = 0`.
- Iterate over the characters in the string:
  - For `c = '(': `cum_sum` becomes `1`.
  - For `c = '(': `cum_sum` becomes `2`.
  - For `c = ')': `cum_sum` becomes `1`.
- Update `result[0]` to `max(0, -1) = 0`.
- Update `result[1]` to `0 + 1 = 1`.
- Return `result = [0, 1]`.

### After `get_count` calls
- `counts` becomes `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.

### Grouping counts
- Initialize `first_group` and `second_group` as empty lists.
- Initialize `min_first_group = inf`, `max_first_group = 0`, `min_second_group = inf`, `max_second_group = 0`.

#### Processing `counts`:
- For `c = [1, 0]`: Since `1 - 0 > 0`, add to `second",0,{}
38,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the given inputs.

### Step 1: Input Parsing
1. Read `n` which is `2`.
2. Initialize `pies`, `index`, and `first_equal` as lists of size `n` filled with zeros:
   - `pies = [0, 0]`
   - `index = [0, 0]`
   - `first_equal = [0, 0]`

### Step 2: Calculate Pie Volumes
3. For `i = 0`, read `r = 100` and `h = 30`:
   - Calculate volume: `pies[0] = 100 * 100 * 30 = 300000`
   - Now, `pies = [300000, 0]`
4. For `i = 1`, read `r = 40` and `h = 10`:
   - Calculate volume: `pies[1] = 40 * 40 * 10 = 16000`
   - Now, `pies = [300000, 16000]`

### Step 3: Sort Pies
5. Sort `pies` while keeping track of original indices:
   - `s_pies = [(1, 16000), (0, 300000)]` (sorted by volume)
6. Update `index` based on sorted order:
   - For `i = 0`: `index[1] = 0` (first pie)
   - For `i = 1`: `index[0] = 1` (second pie)
   - Now, `index = [1, 0]`
7. Update `first_equal`:
   - For `i = 1`: Since `s_pies[1][1] (300000) != s_pies[0][1] (16000)`, `first_equal[0] = 1`
   - Now, `first_equal = [1, 0]`

### Step 4: Initialize Segment Tree
8. Create a `SegmentTree` with `n + 1` zeros:
   - `towers = SegmentTree([0, 0, 0])`
   - The segment tree is initialized with the maximum function.

### Step 5: Update Segment Tree
9. For `j = 0`, `pie = 300000`:
   - `i = index[0",0,{}
39,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the given inputs.

### Inputs
- `int_dummy = 7` (not used in the function)
- `dat_str = ""1101001""`
- `rewards_input = [3, 4, 9, 100, 1, 2, 3]`

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Parsing the Input:**
   - `dat_str` is ""1101001"".
   - `rewards_input` is split into integers: `rewards_ints = [3, 4, 9, 100, 1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Breaking `dat_str` into Intervals:**
   - Initialize `dat = []` and `pos = 0`.
   - Loop through `dat_str`:
     - For `pos = 0`, `end` goes from 0 to 2 (both '1's), so `dat.append(2)`.
     - For `pos = 2`, `end` goes from 2 to 3 (the '0'), so `dat.append(1)`.
     - For `pos = 3`, `end` goes from 3 to 5 (both '1's), so `dat.append(2)`.
     - For `pos = 5`, `end` goes from 5 to 6 (the '0'), so `dat.append(1)`.
     - For `pos = 6`, `end` goes from 6 to 7 (the last '1'), so `dat.append(1)`.
   - Final `dat` becomes `[2, 1, 2, 1, 1]`.

3. **Calculating Rewards:**
   - Initialize `rewards = [0, rewards_orig[0]] = [0, 3]`.
   - For `k` from 2 to 7 (length of `rewards_orig`):
     - For `k = 2`: `rewards.append(max(rewards[0] + rewards_orig[1], rewards[1] + rewards_orig[0])) = max(0 + 4, 3 + 3) = 6`. So, `rewards = [0, 3, 6]`.
     - For `k = 3`: `rewards.append(max(rewards[0] + rewards_orig[2], rewards[1] +",0,{}
40,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the given inputs.

### Step 1: Initialize Variables
1. Read `n`, `m`, `k` from input: `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 7`.
2. Initialize `l` as a list of zeros with length `n + 1`: `l = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
3. Initialize `now` to `k`: `now = 7`.
4. Initialize `point` as a list of zeros with length `n`: `point = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.

### Step 2: Process Input for Points and Update `l`
For each of the `n` lines of input:
- **First line**: `a = 7`, `b = 4`, `c = 17`
  - Update `point[0] = 17`
  - Update `now = now - a = 7 - 7 = 0`
  - Update `l[0] = now = 0`
  - Update `now = now + b + a = 0 + 4 + 7 = 11`
  
- **Second line**: `a = 3`, `b = 0`, `c = 8`
  - Update `point[1] = 8`
  - Update `now = now - a = 11 - 3 = 8`
  - Update `l[1] = now = 8`
  - Update `now = now + b + a = 8 + 0 + 3 = 11`
  
- **Third line**: `a = 11`, `b = 2`, `c = 0`
  - Update `point[2] = 0`
  - Update `now = now - a = 11 - 11 = 0`
  - Update `l[2] = now = 0`
  - Update `now = now + b + a = 0 + 2 + 11 = 13`
  
- **Fourth line**: `a = 13`, `b = 3`, `c = 5`
  - Update `point[3] = 5`
  - Update `now = now - a = 13 - 13 = 0`
  - Update `l[3",0,{}

2. **Test Case 1**:
   - `n = 4`

   - Read the segments:
     - Segment 1: `(1, 5)` → `val` becomes `{0, 1, 5, 200001}`, `seg` becomes `[(0, 200001), (1, 5)]`
     - Segment 2: `(2, 4)` → `val` becomes `{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 200001}`, `seg` becomes `[(0, 200001), (1, 5), (2, 4)]`
     - Segment 3: `(2, 3)` → `val` becomes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 200001}`, `seg` becomes `[(0, 200001), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)]`

   - Sort `val` → `val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 200001]`
   - Create `comp` mapping: `{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 5, 5: 6, 200001: 7}`
   - Update `seg` using `comp`:
     - `seg = [(1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5)]`

2. **Building the Dictionary**:
   - We iterate over the range `2*n` which is `6` (from `0` to `5`).
   - For each index `i`, we try to append the index `i+1` to the list in `dict1` corresponding to `arr[i]`.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 4, 3]`
- Check if `n == 1` and `a[0] & 1` (which is `1 & 1` = `1`, true). This condition is false.
- Iterate through the list `a`:
  - For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 1`, which is odd.
  - For `i = 1`, `a[1] = 4`, which is even.
    - Print `1` (indicating the index of the first even number).

1. **Reading Input:**

   - Initialize `g = 0` to store the cumulative XOR of the Grundy numbers.

3. **Processing the first pair (5, 2):**
   - Call `grundy(5, 2)`:
     - Since `5 >= 2`, we calculate `q = 5 // 2 = 2`.
     - Calculate `r = (5 - 2 * 2) % (2 + 1) = (5 - 4) % 3 = 1`.
     - Since `r != 0`, we calculate `v = (5 - 2 * 2) // (2 + 1) + 1 = (5 - 4) // 3 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

### Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is assigned the input string.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `t` is initialized as an empty string.
   - `qoute` is initialized to 0.
   - `space` is initialized to 0.
   - `start` is set to 1 because the first character is a quote (`""`).

2. **Iterate through each character in the input string**:
   - For `i = 0`, `v = '""'`:
     - Since `start` is 1, we set `t = '<'` and increment `qoute` to 1.
   - For `i = 1`, `v = 'R'`:

### Code Analysis

The function `main2()` is the one that will be executed since it is called in the `__starting_point()` function. 

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The first input line is read and split into `n` and `M`. Here, `n = 7` and `M = 15`.
   - The second input line is read and split into a list `t` which contains the integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

2. **Bucket Initialization**:
   - A `bucket` list of size 101 is initialized with all zeros. This will be used to count occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100.

3. **Minimum Calculation**:
   - An empty list `minimum` is initialized to store the results.
   - A loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 6` (since `n = 7`).

### Iteration Details

- **Iteration 0 (i = 0)**:
  - `target = M - t[0] = 15 - 1 = 14`
  - `count = 0`, `subtotal = 0`
  - Loop through `j` from 1 to 100:
    - For `j = 1`: `subtotal + bucket[1] * 1 = 0 + 0 = 0` (not greater than 14)
    - For `j = 2`: `subtotal + bucket[2] * 2 = 0 + 0 = 0` (not greater than 14)

    - For `j = 14`: `subtotal + bucket[14] * 14 = 0 + 0 = 0` (not greater than 14)
    - For `j = 15`: `subtotal + bucket[15] * 15 = 0 + 0 = 0` (not greater than 14)
    - ...
    - For `j = 100`: `subtotal + bucket[100] * 100 = 0 + 0 = 0` (not greater than 14)
  - After the loop, `minimum.append(0 - 0)`, so `minimum = [0]`.

   - `n` is set to `6`.
   - `a` is set to the list `[2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]`.
   - `d` is initialized as a `defaultdict` of integers, which will store counts of specific values.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0`.

2. **Loop through the elements of `a`**:
   - For `i = 0` (first element, `a[0] = 2`):
     - Calculate `l = i - a[i] = 0 - 2 = -2`.
     - `ans` remains `0` since `d[-2]` is `0`.
     - Update `d[a[i] + i] = d[2 + 0] += 1`, so `d[2]` becomes `1`.
   
   - For `i = 1` (second element, `a[1] = 3`):
     - Calculate `l = i - a[i] = 1 - 3 = -2`.
     - `ans` remains `0` since `d[-2]` is still `0`.
     - Update `d[a[i] + i] = d[3 + 1] += 1`, so `d[4]` becomes `1`.

   - For `i = 2` (third element, `a[2] = 3`):
     - Calculate `l = i - a[i] = 2 - 3 = -1`.
     - `ans` remains `0` since `d[-1]` is `0`.
     - Update `d[a[i] + i] = d[3 + 2] += 1`, so `d[5]` becomes `1`.

   - For `i = 3` (fourth element, `a[3] = 1`):
     - Calculate `l = i - a[i] = 3 - 1 = 2`.

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first line of input is `3`, which indicates the number of elements in the list `A`.
   - The second line of input is `2 6 6`, which will be read into the list `A`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The `main()` function is called.
   - Inside `main()`, `n` is assigned the value `3`.
   - The list `A` is created by reading the integers from the input, resulting in `A = [2, 6, 6]`.

3. **Calculating GCD**:
   - The function `GCD_multi(A)` is called with `vec = [2, 6, 6]`.
   - Inside `GCD_multi`, the variable `l` is initialized to the first element of `vec`, which is `2`.

4. **Iterating through the list**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `vec` starting from the second element:
     - **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
       - `l` is currently `2`.
       - The next element is `6`.
       - The function `GCD(2, 6)` is called:
         - Inside `GCD`, since `b` is not `0`, it calls `GCD(6, 2)`.
         - Again, since `b` is not `0`, it calls `GCD(2, 0)`.
         - Now, since `b` is `0`, it returns `2`.
       - So, `l` is updated to `2`.
     - **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
       - `l` is currently `2`.
       - The next element is `6`.
       - The function `GCD(2, 6)` is called again, and it follows the same steps as before, returning `2`.
       - So, `l` remains `2`.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - After the loop completes, `GCD_multi` returns `2`.
   - The `main()` function prints `2`.

   - `the_biggest_snek = 3` initializes the biggest snake number.
   - `sneks = [3, 1, 2]` is the list of snacks.

2. **Processing each snack**:
   - **First snack (i = 3)**:
     - Since `i` (3) is equal to `the_biggest_snek` (3):

   - **Second snack (i = 1)**:
     - Since `i` (1) is not equal to `the_biggest_snek` (2):

       - `printing = [2]` is initialized with the current snack.
       - `the_biggest_snek` is decremented to 1.
       - The while loop checks if `the_biggest_snek` (1) is in `wrong_snaks` (it is), so:

2. **Input Reading**: The first line of input is read, which gives `N = 6` and `K = 2`.
3. **Graph Construction**: A graph is constructed using a defaultdict of sets. The edges are added as follows:
   - Edge between 1 and 2
   - Edge between 1 and 3
   - Edge between 2 and 4
   - Edge between 2 and 5

1. We start by reading the inputs: `N = 4`, `K = 3`, `L = 1`.
2. We create three instances of `UnionFind` for roads, rails, and shared connections, each initialized with `N + 1 = 5` (to account for 1-based indexing).

### Step 2: Process Roads
3. We read `K = 3` road connections:
   - For the first road connection `(1, 2)`, we call `road.unite(1, 2)`.
     - Inside `unite`, we find the parents of `1` and `2`, which are `1` and `2` respectively. They are not the same, so we link them. Now, `parents = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `size = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - For the second road connection `(2, 3)`, we call `road.unite(2, 3)`.
     - The parents are `1` and `3`. They are not the same, so we link them. Now, `parents = [1, 1, 1, 3, 4]` and `size = [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - For the third road connection `(3, 4)`, we call `road.unite(3, 4)`.
     - The parents are `1` and `4`. They are not the same, so we link them. Now, `parents = [1, 1, 1, 1, 4]` and `size = [1, 4, 1, 1, 1]`.

### Step 3: Process Rails
4. We read `L = 1` rail connections:
   - For the rail connection `(2, 3)`, we call `rail.unite(2, 3)`.
     - The parents are `2` and `3`. They are not the same, so we link them. Now, `parents = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4]` and `size = [1, 2, 1, 1",0,{}

1. The input is read as a list of integers. The first integer is `n`, which is `4`, and the subsequent integers are the elements of the array `a`, which are `[5, 2, 4, 7]`.

### Step 2: Sorting and Index Mapping
2. We sort the array `a` to get `sorted_array = [2, 4, 5, 7]`.
3. We create a dictionary `dict` to map each element to its index in the sorted array:
   - `dict[2] = 0`
   - `dict[4] = 1`
   - `dict[5] = 2`
   - `dict[7] = 3`

### Step 3: Factor Calculation
4. We initialize `factor` as an array of zeros: `factor = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
5. We calculate the `factor` values:
   - For `i = 0`: `factor[0] = mul(1, 4) = 4`
   - For `i = 1`: `factor[1] = mul(2, 3) = 6`
   - For `i = 2`: `factor[2] = mul(3, 2) = 6`
   - For `i = 3`: `factor[3] = mul(4, 1) = 4`
   - So, `factor` becomes `[4, 6, 6, 4]`.

### Step 4: Left Fenwick Tree Updates
6. We initialize a `left_tree` as a Fenwick Tree with size `n`.
7. We update `factor` using the `left_tree`:
   - For `i = 0`: `element_idx = dict[5] = 2`
     - `factor[0] = add(4, mul(4, left_tree.read(2))) = add(4, 0) = 4`
     - `left_tree.update(2, 1)`
   - For `i = 1`: `element_idx = dict[2] = 0`
     - `factor[1] = add(6, mul(3, left_tree.read(0))) = add(6, 0",0,{}

2. **Creating `arr`:**
   - Initialize `arr` as an empty list.
   - For `i = 0`: `arr.append(s[0:12:4])` → `arr = ['aaa']`
   - For `i = 1`: `arr.append(s[1:12:4])` → `arr = ['aaa', 'bbb']`

2. **Processing each element in A**:
   - For each element in `A`, we will search for it in the treap. If it exists, we delete it, and then we insert it back.

3. **Inserting 2**:
   - Search for `2` in `t`: `t.search(2)` returns `None` (since the treap is empty).
   - Insert `2` into `t`: `t.insert(2)`.
     - A new `TreapNode` with value `2` is created.
     - `t._root` now points to this node.
     - Increment `t._size` to `1`.

4. **Inserting 1**:
   - Search for `1` in `t`: `t.search(1)` returns `None`.
   - Insert `1` into `t`: `t.insert(1)`.
     - A new `TreapNode` with value `1` is created.
     - Since `1 < 2`, it becomes the left child of `2`.

### Execution Steps

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Read `H` and `W` from input: `H = 2`, `W = 3`.
   - Initialize an empty list `S` and a defaultdict `d`.

2. **Building the List `S`**:
   - For `h = 0`, read the string `s = ""arc""`, append it to `S`, resulting in `S = [""arc""]`. The sorted version is `""acr""`, so `d` becomes `{'acr': [0]}`.
   - For `h = 1`, read the string `s = ""rac""`, append it to `S`, resulting in `S = [""arc"", ""rac""]`. The sorted version is also `""acr""`, so `d` becomes `{'acr': [0, 1]}`.

3. **Initialize `already_paired`**:
   - Create an array `already_paired` of size `H` initialized to zeros: `already_paired = [0, 0]`.

4. **Pairing Process**:
   - Start iterating over `i` from `0` to `H-1`:
     - For `i = 0`, check `j` from `1` to `H-1`:
       - For `j = 1`, check if `can_pair(S[0], S[1])`:
         - Inside `can_pair`, compare characters of `s1 = ""arc""` and `s2 = ""rac""`:
           - Compare `c1 = 'a'` and `c2 = 'r'`, sorted gives `['a', 'r']`, add to list `l`.
           - Compare `c1 = 'r'` and `c2 = 'a'`, sorted gives `['a', 'r']`, remove from list `l`.
           - Compare `c1 = 'c'` and `c2 = 'c'`, sorted gives `['c', 'c']`, add to list `l`.
         - After the loop, since `len(s1) % 2 == 0` is false, check if `len(l) == 1 and l[0][0] == l[0][1]`. Here,",0,{}
62,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the given inputs.

### Step 1: Read Inputs
The first line of input is `5 5 5`, which means:
- `N = 5` (number of rows)
- `M = 5` (number of columns)
- `Q = 5` (number of queries)

The next 5 lines represent the grid:
```
RRGGB
RRGGY
YYBBG
YYBBR
RBBRG

### Step 2: Initialize Variables
We initialize the `table` for color mapping:
- `table[ord('R')] = 0`
- `table[ord('G')] = 1`
- `table[ord('B')] = 2`
- `table[ord('Y')] = 3`

### Step 3: Create the Color Grid `D`
We convert the input grid into a numerical representation:
```
D = [
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 2],  # RRGGB -> [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 2],  # RRGGY -> [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
    [3, 3, 2, 2, 1],  # YYBBG -> [3, 3, 2, 2, 1]
    [3, 3, 2, 2, 0],  # YYBBR -> [3, 3, 2, 2, 0]
    [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]   # RBBRG -> [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]
]
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Grid `G`
We create a grid `G` initialized to zero:
```
G = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

   - While `n` is divisible by `2`:
     - `d[2]` is incremented to `1` (since `24` is divisible by `2`).
     - `n` becomes `12`.
     - `d[2]` is incremented to `2` (since `12` is divisible by `2`).
     - `n` becomes `6`.
     - `d[2]` is incremented to `3` (since `6` is divisible by `2`).
     - `n` becomes `3`.
   - Now `n` is `3`, which is not divisible by `2`. 
   - Next, we check for odd factors starting from `3` up to `sqrt(3)` (which is approximately `1.73`, so we only check `3`):

69,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the given input.

### Step-by-step Execution

1. The `__starting_point()` function is called, which in turn calls the `main()` function.
2. Inside `main()`, the function `mult_inp()` is called to read multiple inputs. The input provided is `2 1`.
3. The `mult_inp()` function splits the input string into integers and returns a list: `[2, 1]`.
4. The values are unpacked into `n` and `m`, so `n = 2` and `m = 1`.
5. The next step is to calculate the combinations:
   - First, `combination(n, 2)` is called with `n = 2`.
     - Inside `combination`, since `n` is not less than `r`, we proceed.
     - Initialize `ans = 1`.
     - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `n - r + 1` to `n + 1`, which is from `2 - 2 + 1 = 1` to `2 + 1 = 3`. Thus, `i` takes values `1` and `2`.
       - For `i = 1`: `ans *= 1` → `ans = 1`.
       - For `i = 2`: `ans *= 2` → `ans = 2`.
     - Now, we calculate the divisor `div`:
       - Initialize `div = 1`.
       - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `2` to `r + 1`, which is from `2` to `3`. Thus, `i` takes the value `2`.
         - For `i = 2`: `div *= 2` → `div = 2`.
     - Finally, we return `ans // div` → `2 // 2 = 1`.
   - So, `combination(2, 2)` returns `1`.
   
6. Next, `combination(m, 2)` is called with `m = 1`.
   - Inside `combination`, since `n` is less than `r`, we return `0` immediately.
   
7. Now, we have the results from both combinations:
   - `combination(n, 2) = 1`
   - `combination(m, 2) =",0,{}

### Step 1: Understanding the Code

1. **Function `flrt(exp, x)`**: This function calculates the largest integer `l` such that `l**exp <= x`. It uses binary search to find this integer.
  
2. **Function `c1(r)`**: This function generates a set of numbers that can be expressed as `x**i` for prime numbers `i` up to `r`. It checks if the numbers are not perfect squares or cubes.

3. **Function `solve(r, pc)`**: This function calculates the count of numbers that can be expressed as products of the primes in `a` (which are 2 and 3) that are less than or equal to `r`. It also counts how many numbers are in the list `pc` that are less than or equal to `r`.

4. **Main Execution**: The program reads a number of queries and for each query, it calculates the difference in counts between two ranges using the `solve` function.

### Step 2: Precomputation

Before processing the queries, we need to compute the set `pc` using `c1(1e18 + 1)`.

- The primes used are: `[5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61]`.
- For each prime `i`, we compute `x**i` for `x` starting from 2 until `x**i` exceeds `1e18 + 1`.
- We check if the resulting value is not a perfect square or cube before adding it to the set.

After running `c1`, we get the set `pc` which is then sorted into `pca`.

### Step 3: Processing Queries

Now we process each query using the `solve` function.

1. **Query (1, 4)**:
   - `solve(4, pca)` and `solve(0, pca)` are computed.
   - The result is `solve(4, pca) - solve(0, pca)`.

2. **Query (9, 9)**:
   - `solve(9, pca)` and `solve(8, pca)` are computed.
   - The result is `solve",0,{}

   - `a = [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`

   - Initialize `ans` to store the result.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues while `l <= r`.

4. **First Iteration**:
   - Calculate `mid = l + (r - l) // 2 = 1 + (10000000000 - 1) // 2 = 5000000000`.
   - Call `fessible(mid)` with `mid = 5000000000`.

5. **Inside `fessible(mid)`**:
   - Initialize `b = [0] * n = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and `moves = 0`.
   - Check if `a[0] < mid` (i.e., `2 < 5000000000`), which is true.
     - Update `b[0] += (mid - a[0]) = 5000000000 - 2 = 4999999998`.
     - Since `w < n`, update `b[w] -= (mid - a[0])`, which means `b[3] -= 4999999998`.
     - Update `moves += (mid - a[0]) = 4999999998`.
     - Check if `moves > m` (i.e., `4999999998 > 2`), which is true. Return `0`.

6. **Back to Binary Search**:
   - Since `fessible(mid)` returned `0`, update `r = mid - 1 = 4999999999`.

3. It splits the `special` string into lines and iterates through each line.
4. For each line, it checks if the line is not empty. If it is not empty, it splits the line into `expr` and `out` based on the `>>` delimiter.
5. It extracts the first part of `expr` and converts it to an integer.
6. It checks if this integer matches the input `a` (which is `2`).
7. The first line in `special` is `660 0.5026652759997887 >> 3 * 10 ** 2640 + 35340`, which does not match `2`.
8. The program continues checking each line until it reaches the line `32 0.5692826909998985 >> ????`.
9. This line also does not match `2`.
10. The program continues checking until it reaches the line `2.0632996949998414 >> 5 * 10 ** 2323 + 16`, which does not match `2`.
11. After checking all lines in `special`, it finds no match for `2`.
12. Since no match was found, the program calls the `solve(a)` function with `a = 2`.

Now, let's execute the `solve(a)` function:

1. **Parsing Input:**
   - `n = 7` (number of cities)
   - `m = 2` (number of attacked cities)
   - The edges are read and stored in `adjacents_list`:
     ```
     adjacents_list = [
         [1, 2, 3],  # City 1 is connected to 2, 3, 4

     ```
     numbers_of_attacked_cities = [1, 6]  # Cities 1 and 7 (0-indexed: 0 and 6)
     ```

2. **Marking Attacked Cities:**
   - `attacked_city = [True, False, False, False, False, False, True]` (True for attacked cities)

3. **DFS_Discriminating:**
   - Initialize `visited`, `stack`, and `intrudoction_order`.
   - Start DFS from the first attacked city (0):
     - Visit city 1 (0), mark it visited.
     - Visit its neighbors (2, 3, 4).
     - Continue visiting until all reachable cities are visited.
   - Update `count_attacked_cities_subtree` and `important_cities` based on the visited nodes.

4. **Rebuilding Adjacents List:**

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cn = [0] * (n + 1)` results in `cn = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `last = [-1] * (n + 1)` results in `last = [-1, -1, -1, -1]`.
   - `v = [1, 2, 1, 3]` is already given.

2. **Counting occurrences and last positions**:
   - For `i = 0` (value `1`):
     - `last[1] = 0`, `cn[1] += 1` → `cn = [0, 1, 0, 0]`, `last = [-1, 0, -1, -1]`.
   - For `i = 1` (value `2`):
     - `last[2] = 1`, `cn[2] += 1` → `cn = [0, 1, 1, 0]`, `last = [-1, 0, 1, -1]`.
   - For `i = 2` (value `1`):
     - `last[1] = 2`, `cn[1] += 1` → `cn = [0, 2, 1, 0]`, `last = [-1, 2, 1, -1]`.
   - For `i = 3` (value `3`):
     - `last[3] = 3`, `cn[3] += 1` → `cn = [0, 2, 1, 1]`, `last = [-1, 2, 1, 3]`.

3. **Deepcopy for cn and last**:
   - `cn1 = deepcopy(cn)` → `cn1 = [0, 2, 1, 1]`.
   - `last1 = deepcopy(last)` → `last1 = [-1, 2, 1, 3]`.

### Inputs

```

### Execution Steps

1. The first line of input is read as `3`, which indicates the length of the array `a`.
2. The second line of input is read and converted into a list of integers: `a = [3, 2, 1]`.

3. The program checks the length of `a`. Since `len(a) == 3`, it proceeds to the next steps.

4. The variable `reversed_indeks1` is initialized to `-1`. The program then enters a loop to find the first index where the sequence decreases:
   - For `x = 0`: `a[0] (3) > a[1] (2)` is true, so `reversed_indeks1` is set to `0` and the loop breaks.

5. Since `reversed_indeks1` is not `-1`, the program initializes `reversed_indeks2` to `len(a) - 1`, which is `2`.

6. The program enters another loop to find the first index after `reversed_indeks1` where the sequence increases:
   - For `x = 0`: `a[0] (3) < a[1] (2)` is false.
   - For `x = 1`: `a[1] (2) < a[2] (1)` is false.
   - The loop breaks without updating `reversed_indeks2`, so it remains `2`.

7. The program checks if `reversed_indeks2` is not equal to `len(a) - 1`. Since `reversed_indeks2` is `2`, this condition is false, and it sets `asc` to `True`.

8. The program then checks the conditions for `kiri` and `kanan`:
   - `kiri` is initialized to `True`. It checks if `reversed_indeks1` is not `0`. Since `reversed_indeks1` is `0`, this condition is false, and `kiri` remains `True`.
   - `kanan` is initialized to `True`. It checks if `reversed_indeks2` is not `len(a) - 1`. Since `reversed_indeks2` is `2`, this condition is false, and `",0,{}

   - `z = [0] * (2 * n + 2) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

2. **Processing Input Pairs**:
   - For `i = 1`, we read `a = 1`, `b = -1`:
     - Since `a >= b` is true (1 >= -1) and `a` is not -1, we set `ans = ""No""`.
     - We also update `x[1] = 1` and `z[1] = 1`.
   - For `i = 2`, we read `a = -1`, `b = 4`:
     - Since `a` is -1, we skip the checks and update `x[4] = 2` and `z[4] = 2`.
   - For `i = 3`, we read `a = -1`, `b = 6`:
     - Again, since `a` is -1, we skip the checks and update `x[6] = 2` and `z[6] = 3`.

3. **Final State After Input Processing**:

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - We read `n` and `m` from the input, which are `7` and `3`, respectively.
   - We initialize:
     - `t = [0] * (n + 1)` → `t = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
     - `p = [0] * (n + 1)` → `p = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
     - `q = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]` → `q = [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]`

2. **Building the Graph**:
   - We read the edges:
     - For the first edge `1 2 3`, we append `(2, 3)` to `q[1]`, `(1, 3)` to `q[2]`, and `(1, 2)` to `q[3]`. 
       - After this, `q = [[], [(2, 3)], [(1, 3)], [(1, 2)], [], [], [], []]`
     - For the second edge `1 4 5`, we append `(4, 5)` to `q[1]`, `(1, 5)` to `q[4]`, and `(1, 4)` to `q[5]`.

### Inputs

### Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is set to `5`.
   - `a` is initialized as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
   - `s` is initialized as an empty list `[]`.
   - `l` and `r` are both initialized to `0`.
   - `nums` is initialized as an empty dictionary `{}`.

2. **First Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the range of `n` (0 to 4).
   - For `i = 0`, `num = a[0] = 1`. Since `1` is not in `nums`, it is added: `nums = {1: True}`.
   - For `i = 1`, `num = a[1] = 2`. Since `2` is not in `nums`, it is added: `nums = {1: True, 2: True}`.
   - For `i = 2`, `num = a[2] = 3`. Since `3` is not in `nums`, it is added: `nums = {1: True, 2: True, 3: True}`.
   - For `i = 3`, `num = a[3] = 4`. Since `4` is not in `nums`, it is added: `nums = {1: True, 2: True, 3: True, 4: True}`.
   - For `i = 4`, `num = a[4] = 1`. Since `1` is already in `nums`, the loop breaks.

3. **Check for Duplicate**:
   - Since the loop broke due to finding a duplicate, the code prints `-1` and returns. However, the return statement is not valid in this context since it's not inside a function.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program does not reach the part where it would print the segments or the length of `s` because it exits early due to the duplicate.

Thus, the output of the program is simply `-1`.

   - Three 4D lists `G0`, `G1`, and `G2` are initialized with dimensions `[6][6][6][5500]`, all filled with zeros.

2. **Filling G0, G1, G2**:
   - The nested loops iterate over `x`, `y`, and `z` from 1 to 5.
   - For each combination of `x`, `y`, and `z`, another loop iterates `i` from 1 to 5499.
   - Inside this loop, the values `s`, `t`, and `u` are calculated based on the current indices and the maximum function.
   - The innermost loops fill `G0`, `G1`, and `G2` based on the conditions provided.

3. **Processing Input**:
   - The first input line indicates `t = 3`, meaning there will be 3 test cases.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `z` are read, followed by the list `B`.

4. **Transforming B into A**:
   - For each element in `B`, if it is less than or equal to 5400, it is added to `A` as is. Otherwise, it is transformed using the formula `a % 2520 + 2520`.

5. **Calculating XOR**:
   - The XOR of all elements in `A` is computed using the values from `G0`.

6. **Counting Valid Combinations**:
   - For each element in `A`, a new value `k` is computed as `XOR ^ G0[x][y][z][a]`.
   - The code checks if `G0`, `G1`, or `G2` at the respective indices equals `k` and increments `ANS` accordingly.

   - `a = 1`
   - `b = 1`
   - `c = 1`

2. **Function Definition**: The function `ct(a, b)` is defined. This function calculates a specific combinatorial value based on the inputs `a` and `b`.

3. **Function Execution**: We call `ct(a, b)` where `a = 1` and `b = 1`.

   - Inside `ct(1, 1)`:
     - Since `a` is not greater than `b`, we do not swap them.
     - Initialize `L = 998244353`, `s = 1`, and `sx = 1`.
     - We enter a loop that runs from `k = 1` to `a` (which is 1):
       - For `k = 1`:
         - Calculate `s`:
           ```
           s = s * (a + 1 - k) * (b + 1 - k) // k
             = 1 * (1 + 1 - 1) * (1 + 1 - 1) // 1

             = 1

         - Update `sx`:
           ```
           sx += s % L

2. **First Loop (Count 'A's)**:

     - `i = 1`: `s[1] = 'A'`, increment `c` to `2`.

2. **Calculating `odd_balance` and identifying duplicates**:

     - `odd_v(5) = 1` (since 5 is odd)
     - `odd_balance = 1`
     - `card_values = {5}`

### Inputs Breakdown
- `n = 3` (number of antennas)
- `m = 595` (maximum coverage)
- `antenna = [(43, 2), (300, 4), (554, 10)]` (list of tuples where each tuple contains the position and the range of an antenna)

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cache = {}` (to store computed results)
   - `antenna` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple, which is already sorted in this case.

2. **Function Call**:
   - We call `dp(0, 0)` which means we start from the first antenna (index 0) with a maximum coverage of 0.

3. **First Call to `dp(0, 0)`**:
   - `ind = 0`, `max_covered = 0`
   - `max_covered` is updated to `min(595, 0) = 0`.
   - Since `0` is not in `cache`, we initialize `cache[0] = {}`.
   - We check if `0` is in `cache[0]`, it is not.
   - We call `blah(0, 0)`.

4. **First Call to `blah(0, 0)`**:
   - `x = 43`, `s = 2` (from `antenna[0]`)
   - Since `max_covered (0) < x - s - 1 (40)`, we calculate:
     - `num_needed = x - s - (max_covered + 1) = 43 - 2 - (0 + 1) = 40`
     - `new_boundary = min(x + s + num_needed, m) = min(43 + 2 + 40, 595) = 85`.
   - We call `dp(1, 85)` and `dp(1, 0)`.

5. **Second Call to `dp(1, 85)`**:
   - `ind = 1`, `max_covered = 85`
   - `max_covered` is updated to `min(595, 85) = 85`.

### Step 1: Input Parsing
1. Read `n` and `q` from input: `n = 3`, `q = 4`.
2. Initialize lists `x` and `y` with size `n`:
   - `x = [0, 0, 0]`
   - `y = [0, 0, 0]`
3. Read the next `n` lines for coordinates:
   - For `i = 0`: `x[0], y[0] = 0, 0` → `x = [0, 0, 0]`, `y = [0, 0, 0]`
   - For `i = 1`: `x[1], y[1] = 2, 0` → `x = [0, 2, 0]`, `y = [0, 0, 0]`
   - For `i = 2`: `x[2], y[2] = 2, 2` → `x = [0, 2, 2]`, `y = [0, 0, 2]`

### Step 2: Query Initialization
1. Initialize lists `r`, `f`, `t`, `v` with size `q`:
   - `r = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `f = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `t = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `v = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
2. Read the next `q` lines for queries:
   - For `i = 0`: `r[0] = 1`, `f[0] = 0`, `t[0] = 1` → `r = [1, 0, 0, 0]`, `f = [0, 0, 0, 0]`, `t = [1, 0, 0, 0]`
   - For `i = 1`: `r[1] = 2`, `v[1] = 0` → `r = [1, 2, 0, 0]`, `v = [0",0,{}

2. **Initialization**:
   - `re` is initialized to `1`.
   - `mc` is initialized to `1`.
   - `zc` is initialized to an empty list `[]`.

3. **Finding Prime Factors**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 2` and goes up to `9999`.
   - For `i = 2`:
     - Since `20 % 2 == 0`, we enter the loop.
     - `re` is updated: `re *= 2` → `re = 2`.
     - We initialize `c = 0` and enter the inner while loop:
       - `20 % 2 == 0`: `N` is updated to `20 // 2 = 10`, `c` is incremented to `1`.
       - `10 % 2 == 0`: `N` is updated to `10 // 2 = 5`, `c` is incremented to `2`.
       - `5 % 2 != 0`: exit the while loop.
     - `zc` is updated: `zc.append(2)` → `zc = [2]`.
   - For `i = 3`:
     - `20 % 3 != 0`: continue to the next iteration.
   - For `i = 4`:
     - `20 % 4 == 0`: enter the loop.
     - `re` is updated: `re *= 4` → `re = 8`.
     - Initialize `c = 0` and enter the inner while loop:
       - `20 % 4 == 0`: `N` is updated to `20 // 4 = 5`, `c` is incremented to `1`.
       - `5 % 4 != 0`: exit the while loop.
     - `zc` is updated: `zc.append(1)` → `zc = [2, 1]`.
   - For `i = 5`:
     - `20 % 5 == 0`: enter the loop.

```

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Reading Input Values:**
   - The first line of input is `2 5 0`, which means:
     - `n = 2`
     - `m = 5`
     - `o = 0`
   - The next two lines are ignored as they are just input lines that we read but do not use in the calculations.

2. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The first output is calculated using the formula `m * (m - 1) // 2`:
     - `m = 5`
     - Calculation: `5 * (5 - 1) // 2 = 5 * 4 // 2 = 20 // 2 = 10`
   - So, the first output is `10`.

3. **Generating Pairs:**
   - We need to generate pairs `(i, j)` for `1 <= i < j <= m`:
   - Since `o = 0`, we will print pairs as `(i, j)`.

   - We iterate over `i` from `1` to `m` (which is `5`):
     - For `i = 1`:
       - `j` iterates from `2` to `5`:
         - `j = 2`: print `(1, 2)`

         - `j = 4`: print `(1, 4)`

   - `S = [0, 1]`
   - `T = [1, 0]`
   - `U = [1, 1]`

   - `range_N = [0, 1]`
   - `ans = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]` (2x2 matrix initialized to zero)

2. **Logical AND Operations**:
   - For `i = 0`:
     - Since `S[0] == 0`, we update `ans[0][j]` for `j = 0, 1`:
       - `ans[0][0] = ans[0][0] | U[0]` → `ans[0][0] = 0 | 1 = 1`
       - `ans[0][1] = ans[0][1] | U[0]` → `ans[0][1] = 0 | 1 = 1`
     - Now, `ans = [[1, 1], [0, 0]]`
   - For `i = 1`:
     - Since `T[1] == 0`, we update `ans[j][1]` for `j = 0, 1`:
       - `ans[0][1] = ans[0][1] | V[1]` → `ans[0][1] = 1 | 0 = 1`
       - `ans[1][1] = ans[1][1] | V[1]` → `ans[1][1] = 0 | 0 = 0`
     - Now, `ans = [[1, 1], [0, 0]]` (no change)

1. **Function `solve1(arr, n)` Execution:**
   - Initialize `left = []`, `st = []`, `i = 0`.
   - Loop through `arr` to fill `left`:
     - For `i = 0`: `st` is empty, append `-1` to `left`, `left = [-1]`, push `0` to `st`.
     - For `i = 1`: `arr[1] (4) > arr[0] (1)`, pop `0` from `st`, `st` is empty, append `-1` to `left`, `left = [-1, -1]`, push `1` to `st`.
     - For `i = 2`: `arr[2] (1) < arr[1] (4)`, append `1` to `left`, `left = [-1, -1, 1]`, push `2` to `st`.
   - Now `left = [-1, -1, 1]`.
   - Initialize `right = []`, `st = []`, `i = 2`.
   - Loop through `arr` in reverse to fill `right`:
     - For `i = 2`: `st` is empty, append `3` to `right`, `right = [3]`, push `2` to `st`.
     - For `i = 1`: `arr[1] (4) > arr[2] (1)`, append `2` to `right`, `right = [3, 2]`, push `1` to `st`.
     - For `i = 0`: `arr[0] (1) < arr[1] (4)`, append `1` to `right`, `right = [3, 2, 1]`, push `0` to `st`.
   - Now `right = [1, 2, 3]` (reversed).

### Execution Steps

1. **Read Input**: The first input is `N = 2`, indicating that there are 2 points to process.
2. **Initialize List**: An empty list `xylist` is created to store the points.
3. **Loop to Read Points**:
   - For `i = 0`, read the point `(0, 0)` and append it to `xylist`. Now, `xylist = [(0, 0)]`.
   - For `i = 1`, read the point `(1, 0)` and append it to `xylist`. Now, `xylist = [(0, 0), (1, 0)]`.
4. **Check Number of Points**: Since `N == 2`, we call the function `get_circle_2p` with the two points:
   - `p1 = (0, 0)` and `p2 = (1, 0)`.
5. **Calculate Circle from 2 Points**:
   - Extract coordinates: `x1 = 0`, `y1 = 0`, `x2 = 1`, `y2 = 0`.
   - Calculate the center of the circle:
     - \( x = \frac{(0 + 1)}{2} = 0.5 \)
     - \( y = \frac{(0 + 0)}{2} = 0.0 \)
   - Calculate the radius:
     - \( r = \sqrt{(0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} / 2 = \sqrt{1} / 2 = 0.5 \)

### Test Case 4:
- Input: `6 8`
- `x = 6`, `y = 8`
- Since `x < y`, we check the conditions. `x` is not 1, so we output `YES`.

### Test Case 5:

X..

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line of input is `2 3 2`, which means:
     - `n = 2` (number of rows)
     - `m = 3` (number of columns)
     - `k = 2` (number of steps)
   - The next two lines are:
     - Row 0: `.**`
     - Row 1: `X..`
   - We need to find the position of `X`, which is at `(0, 1)`.

2. **Checking if `k` is odd:**
   - Since `k = 2` (which is even), we proceed to the next steps.

3. **Initializing the grid `s`:**
   - We create a 2D list `s` to represent the grid:
     ```
     s = [
       ['.', '*', '*'],
       ['X', '.', '.']
     ]
     ```

4. **Defining the BFS function:**
   - We define the BFS function to find the shortest path from the position of `X` to all other cells.

5. **Running BFS from `(1, 0)`:**
   - Initialize `res` with a large number (10000000) for all cells:
     ```
     res = [
       [10000000, 10000000, 10000000],
       [10000000, 10000000, 10000000]

     - Queue initialized with `q.put((1, 0))`.

6. **BFS Iteration:**

     - Check left `(0, 0)`: valid, update `res[0][0] = 1`, enqueue `(0, 0)`.
     - Check right `(2, 0)`: out of bounds.

### Step 1: Input Parsing
The input is:
```
5 4 1 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```
We parse the first line to get:
- `n = 5` (number of vertices)
- `m = 4` (number of edges)
- `s = 1` (source vertex)
- `t = 5` (destination vertex)

Next, we parse the edges:
```
verts = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
```

### Step 2: Create Reverse Edges
We create reverse edges:
```
rev_verts = [(2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)]
```
Now we combine both to get:
```
verts = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)]
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Graph
We create a `Graph` object with the edges. The graph will have the following structure:
- Vertices: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- Neighbors:
  - 1: {2}
  - 2: {1, 3}
  - 3: {2, 4}
  - 4: {3, 5}
  - 5: {4}

### Step 4: Dijkstra's Algorithm
We run Dijkstra's algorithm from source `s = 1` to find distances to all vertices:
- Starting from vertex 1, the distances are initialized as:
```
distances = {1: 0, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf}
```
- After processing vertex 1, we update the distance to vertex 2:

### Inputs
```
N = 2
K = 3
A = [8, 20]
```

### Execution Steps

1. **Read Input**: The function `solve()` reads the values of `N` and `K`, and the list `A`.
   - `N = 2`
   - `K = 3`
   - `A = [8, 20]`

2. **Calculate Sum**: Compute the sum of the elements in `A`.
   - `M = sum(A) = 8 + 20 = 28`

3. **Find Divisors**: Initialize an empty list `divs` to store the divisors of `M`.
   - Loop through numbers from `1` to `sqrt(M)` (which is approximately `5.29`), checking for divisors:
     - For `i = 1`: `28 % 1 == 0`, so add `1` and `28` to `divs`.
     - For `i = 2`: `28 % 2 == 0`, so add `2` and `14` to `divs`.
     - For `i = 3`: `28 % 3 != 0`, skip.
     - For `i = 4`: `28 % 4 == 0`, so add `4` and `7` to `divs`.
     - For `i = 5`: `28 % 5 != 0`, skip.
   - After the loop, `divs = [28, 14, 7, 4, 2, 1]`.
   - Sort `divs` in reverse order: `divs = [28, 14, 7, 4, 2, 1]`.

4. **Check Each Divisor**: Iterate through each divisor `d` in `divs`:
   - For `d = 28`:
     - Compute `B = [x % d for x in A] = [8 % 28, 20 % 28] = [8, 20]`.
     - Sort `B`: `B = [8, 20]`.
     - Compute `C = [d - x for x in B] = [28 - 8, 28 - 20] = [20, 8]`.

### Step 1: Read Input
The input is read and parsed into variables:
- `n = 6` (number of nodes)
- `m = 7` (number of edges)
- The edges are read and stored in the adjacency matrix `G`.

### Step 2: Initialize the Adjacency Matrix
We initialize the adjacency matrix `G` with `INF` (1000000) and set the diagonal to 0:
```python
G = [[INF] * n for _ in range(n)]
for v in range(n):
    G[v][v] = 0
```

### Step 3: Fill the Adjacency Matrix
We read the edges and fill the adjacency matrix:
- For edge (1, 2): `G[0][1] = G[1][0] = 1`
- For edge (2, 3): `G[1][2] = G[2][1] = 1`
- For edge (3, 4): `G[2][3] = G[3][2] = 1`
- For edge (4, 6): `G[3][5] = G[5][3] = 1`
- For edge (6, 5): `G[5][4] = G[4][5] = 1`
- For edge (4, 4): `G[3][3] = G[3][3] = 1`
- For edge (3, 6): `G[2][5] = G[5][2] = 1`

After processing all edges, the adjacency matrix `G` looks like this:
```
[
    [0, 1, INF, INF, INF, INF],
    [1, 0, 1, INF, INF, INF],
    [INF, 1, 0, 1, INF, 1],
    [INF, INF, 1, 0, INF, 1],
    [INF, INF, INF, INF, 0, 1],
    [INF, INF, 1, 1, 1, 0]

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 5`
   - `a = [3, 7, 9, 7, 8]`
   - `t = [5, 2, 5, 7, 5]`
   - `dc = {}` (dictionary to hold the mapping of `a` values to `t` values)

2. **Building the Dictionary**:
   - For `i = 0`: `dc[3] = [5]`
   - For `i = 1`: `dc[7] = [2]`
   - For `i = 2`: `dc[9] = [5]`
   - For `i = 3`: `dc[7] = [2, 7]` (appending to existing key)
   - For `i = 4`: `dc[8] = [5]`
   - Final `dc` after this loop: `{3: [5], 7: [2, 7], 9: [5], 8: [5]}`

3. **Sorting Keys**:
   - `sa = list(dc.keys())` gives `sa = [3, 7, 8, 9]`
   - Sort `sa`: `sa = [3, 7, 8, 9]`
   - `n = len(sa) = 4`
   - Initialize `ch = 0`, `temp = []`, `sm = 0`, `ans = 0`, `done = 0`

4. **Main Loop**:
   - **First Iteration (`ch = 0`)**:
     - `pt = sa[0] = 3`
     - `len(dc[3]) = 1`, so increment `ch` to `1` and set `done = 0`.

   - **Second Iteration (`ch = 1`)**:
     - `pt = sa[1] = 7`
     - `len(dc[7]) = 2`, so we proceed:

1. Read the number of test cases `T = 5`.
2. For each test case, perform the following:
   - **Test Case 1**: `a = 10`, `b = 4`
     - Check if `10 % 4 == 0` (False)
     - Calculate `4 - (10 % 4) = 4 - 2 = 2`
     - Output: `2`
   
   - **Test Case 2**: `a = 13`, `b = 9`
     - Check if `13 % 9 == 0` (False)
     - Calculate `9 - (13 % 9) = 9 - 4 = 5`
     - Output: `5`
   
   - **Test Case 3**: `a = 100`, `b = 13`
     - Check if `100 % 13 == 0` (False)
     - Calculate `13 - (100 % 13) = 13 - 9 = 4`
     - Output: `4`
   
   - **Test Case 4**: `a = 123`, `b = 456`
     - Check if `123 % 456 == 0` (False)
     - Calculate `456 - (123 % 456) = 456 - 123 = 333`
     - Output: `333`
   
   - **Test Case 5**: `a = 92`, `b = 46`

2. **Initialize Dictionary**:
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `p = {}`.

3. **Processing Edges**:
   - For the first edge `(1, 4)`:
     - Since `1 < 4`, check conditions:
       - `p.get(4) == 2` is `False` (4 is not in `p`).
       - `p.get(1) == 1` is `False` (1 is not in `p`).
     - Update `p`: `p[4] = 1` and `p[1] = 2`. Now, `p = {4: 1, 1: 2}`.
   
   - For the second edge `(5, 2)`:

   - `min_sprint = 1`
   - `max_jump = 3`

2. **Reading Block Coordinates**:

3. **Grouping Blocks**:
   - The blocks are sorted and grouped using `itertools.groupby` with the `_grouper` function.
   - The first value `3` is processed:
     - `_grouper._prev_value` is `None`, so `_current_key` is set to the id of `_grouper`.
     - `_grouper._prev_value` is updated to `3`.
   - The second value `4` is processed:
     - The distance between `4` and `3` is `1`, which is less than or equal to `min_sprint`, so it is considered part of the same group.
   - The third value `7` is processed:
     - The distance between `7` and `4` is `2`, which is also less than or equal to `min_sprint`, so it is considered part of the same group.
   - The grouped blocks are `[[3, 4, 7]]`.

4. **Processing Chunks**:
   - The `run_from` variable is initialized to `0`.
   - The first (and only) block `block = [3, 4, 7]` is processed:
     - `check_chunk(0, [3, 4, 7])` is called:
       - `next_run_from = 8` (which is `7 + 1`).
       - The distance from `run_from` (0) to `block[0]` (3) is `3`, which is greater than `min_sprint`, so no exception is raised.
     - The chunk `(0, [3, 4, 7])` is added to `chunks`.

3. Check the value of `n`:

   - `f = n // 3 = 4 // 3 = 1`
   - `r = n % 3 = 4 % 3 = 1`
5. Start iterating over the string `s` in steps of `3`:
   - In the first iteration (`i = 0`):
     - `ans = s[0:3] = ""101""`
     - Check if `ans` is in `['110', '101', '011']`. It is `True` since `ans` is `101`.

     - Check if `tmp` is equal to `ans[0:n - i] = ans[0:4 - 3] = ans[0:1] = ""1""`. It is `True`.
6. Since the loop completes without setting `flag` to `False`, we proceed to the next checks.
7. Check the value of `ans`:
   - Since `ans` is `101`, we execute the corresponding block:

### Execution Steps

1. **Read the number of queries `q`:**
   - The first input is `3`, so `q = 3`.

2. **Process each query:**
   - For each of the next `q` lines, we will read an integer `x` and call the `smart(x)` function.

#### First Query (`x = 2`):
- Call `smart(2)`:
  - Check if `2` is in the dictionary `d`. It is not.
  - Check if `(2 & (2 + 1)) == 0` which is `(2 & 3) == 0`. This is false.
  - Initialize `i = 1` and `z = 0`.
  - While `i < 2`:
    - Check if `(1 & 2) == 0`, which is true. So, add `1` to `z`. Now, `z = 1`.
    - Update `i *= 2`, so `i = 2`.
  - The loop ends since `i` is no longer less than `x`.
  - Return `2 + z = 2 + 1 = 3`.

#### Second Query (`x = 3`):
- Call `smart(3)`:
  - Check if `3` is in the dictionary `d`. It is not.
  - Check if `(3 & (3 + 1)) == 0` which is `(3 & 4) == 0`. This is false.
  - Initialize `i = 1` and `z = 0`.
  - While `i < 3`:
    - Check if `(1 & 3) == 0`, which is false. So, `z` remains `0`.
    - Update `i *= 2`, so `i = 2`.
    - Check if `(2 & 3) == 0`, which is false. So, `z` remains `0`.
    - Update `i *= 2`, so `i = 4`.
  - The loop ends since `i` is no longer less than `x`.
  - Return `3 + z = 3 + 0 = 3`.

1. The first line of the code reads the number of test cases, which is `6`.
2. We will process each test case one by one.

#### Test Case 1: `n = 7`
- Since `7` is odd (`n % 2` is true), we calculate `n // 2`, which is `7 // 2 = 3`.
- Output: `3`

#### Test Case 2: `n = 1`
- Since `1` is odd, we calculate `n // 2`, which is `1 // 2 = 0`.
- Output: `0`

#### Test Case 3: `n = 2`
- Since `2` is even, we calculate `n // 2 - 1`, which is `2 // 2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.
- Output: `0`

#### Test Case 4: `n = 3`
- Since `3` is odd, we calculate `n // 2`, which is `3 // 2 = 1`.
- Output: `1`

#### Test Case 5: `n = 2000000000`
- Since `2000000000` is even, we calculate `n // 2 - 1`, which is `2000000000 // 2 - 1 = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`.
- Output: `999999999`

#### Test Case 6: `n = 763243547`
- Since `763243547` is odd, we calculate `n // 2`, which is `763243547 // 2 = 381621773`.
- Output: `381621773`

1. **Convert inputs to Decimal:**
   - `x = Decimal('1.1')`
   - `y = Decimal('3.4')`
   - `z = Decimal('2.5')`

2. **Call `s1(x, y, z)`:**
   - This returns the string `""x^y^z""`.

3. **Initialize `ans`:**
   - `ans = ""x^y^z""`.

4. **Initialize the list of functions:**
   - `a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12]`
   - `s = [s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7, s8, s9, s10, s11, s12]`

5. **Calculate `max` using `a1(x, y, z)`:**
   - `max = a1(x, y, z) = (y ** z) * Decimal(log(x))`
   - Calculate `y ** z = 3.4 ** 2.5 ≈ 22.632`
   - Calculate `Decimal(log(x)) = Decimal(log(1.1)) ≈ 0.095310`
   - Therefore, `max ≈ 22.632 * 0.095310 ≈ 2.157`.

6. **Iterate through the range of 12:**
   - For `i = 0`:
     - Calculate `a[0](x, y, z) = a1(x, y, z) ≈ 2.157`.
     - `max` is not less than `2.157`, so `ans` remains `""x^y^z""`.

   - For `i = 1`:
     - Calculate `a[1](x, y, z) = a2(x, y, z) = (z ** y) * Decimal(log(x))`
     - Calculate `z ** y = 2.5 ** 3.4 ≈ 22.632`

   - `a = []`
   - `char = []`

2. **First Loop (Building `a` and `char`)**:
   - For `i = 1`: 
     - `s[1]` is 'a' and `s[0]` is 'a', so `cur_len` increments to `2`.
   - For `i = 2`: 
     - `s[2]` is 'b' and `s[1]` is 'a', so we append `cur_len` to `a` and the previous character to `char`.
     - `a = [2]`, `char = ['a']`, and reset `cur_len` to `1`.
   - For `i = 3`: 
     - `s[3]` is 'b' and `s[2]` is 'b', so `cur_len` increments to `2`.
   - After the loop, we append the last `cur_len` and character:
     - `a = [2, 2]`, `char = ['a', 'b']`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - Initialize `ans = 0`.
   - While `len(a) > 1` (which is true since `len(a) = 2`):
     - `n = len(a) = 2`.
     - Initialize `inner_min = 100000000`.
     - For `i = 1` (the only iteration since `n-1` is 1):
       - `a[1]` is `2`, so `inner_min` is updated to `2`.
     - Calculate `k = min(a[0], a[n-1], (inner_min + 1) // 2) = min(2, 2, (2 + 1) // 2) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`.
     - Initialize `b = []` and `new_char = []`.
     - For `i = 0`:
       - `a[0]` is `2`, which is greater than `k`, so we append `a[0] - k = 2 - 1 = 1` to `b` and `char",0,{}

         ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'o']

3. **Solving the Problem**:
   - `impossibleMoves` is initialized as an empty set.
   - `chesses` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `notAttacked` is initialized as an empty list.

4. **Identifying Chesses and Not Attacked Positions**:
   - The program iterates through the `self.boards`:
     - For the first row, it finds a chess piece at `(0, 0)` and adds it to `chesses`.
     - For the last row, it finds another chess piece at `(4, 4)` and adds it to `chesses`.
     - The positions that are not attacked (i.e., `'.'`) are added to `notAttacked`:
       ```
       notAttacked = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
       ```

5. **Recording Impossible Moves**:
   - For each chess piece in `chesses`, the program calculates the relative positions to each `notAttacked` position and adds them to `impossibleMoves`:
     - For chess at `(0, 0)`, it adds:

   - The length of the string `S` is calculated: `N = len(S) = 3`.
   - A 3D list `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(N + 1) x (K + 1) x 2`, filled with zeros. This results in a 4 x 2 x 2 list:

1. **Adjust `q`**: We subtract 1 from each element in `q`.
   - `q = [1, 2, 3, 0]` (after subtracting 1 from each element)

2. **Initialize variables**:

#### Test Case 4: `2 1000000000`
- `n = 2`, `m = 1000000000`
- Since `n == 2`, we print `m`, which is `1000000000`.

#### Test Case 5: `1000000000 1000000000`

   - The first input line is `5`, which is assigned to `n`.
   - The second input line is `1 2 3 2 1`, which is converted to a list of integers and assigned to `m`. Thus, `m = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `tot` is initialized to `0`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`.

3. **Outer Loop (Iterating over each element in `m`):**
   - For `i = 0` (element `1`):
     - Initialize `l = []` and `r = []`.
     - Set `tmp = 1` (the value of `m[0]`).
     - Set `p = 1`.
     - **Right Loop:**
       - For `j = 1`: `m[1]` is `2`, which is not less than `p`. So, `tmp += 1` (new `tmp = 2`), `r = [1]`.
       - For `j = 2`: `m[2]` is `3`, which is not less than `p`. So, `tmp += 1` (new `tmp = 3`), `r = [1, 1]`.
       - For `j = 3`: `m[3]` is `2`, which is not less than `p`. So, `tmp += 1` (new `tmp = 4`), `r = [1, 1, 1]`.
       - For `j = 4`: `m[4]` is `1`, which is less than `p`. Update `p = 1`, `tmp += 1` (new `tmp = 5`), `r = [1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - **Left Loop:** (no elements to the left)
     - Since `tmp (5) > tot (0)`, update `tot = 5` and `ans = [1]`.

   - For `i = 1` (element `2`):

   - `m = 4` (number of columns)
   - `matrix = ['AAAA', 'ABCA', 'AAAA']` (the grid representation)

   ```
   disco = [
       [0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0]

3. **Defining `valid_node`:**
   - This function checks if the indices are within the bounds of the matrix.

4. **Defining `dfs`:**
   - This function performs a depth-first search to find cycles in the grid.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The outer loops iterate through each cell in the matrix.
   - Starting from cell `(0, 0)`:
     - Call `dfs(0, 0, [0, 0], 1)`.
     - Mark `disco[0][0] = 1`.
     - Explore neighbors:
       - `(0, 1)` is valid and equal to `A`, call `dfs(0, 1, [0, 0], 1)`.
       - Mark `disco[0][1] = 1`.
       - Explore neighbors:
         - `(0, 2)` is valid and equal to `A`, call `dfs(0, 2, [0, 1], 1)`.

1. **Input Handling**: The input `1` is read and converted to an integer `k = 1`.

2. **Calculate `start`**: 
   - `start = k - k % 100` 
   - Since `k = 1`, we have `start = 1 - 1 % 100 = 1`.

3. **Initialize Variables**:

1. **Initialization**:

   - The function `pop_count(x)` counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of `x`.
   - The function `check(x, k)` checks if the number of unique digits in `x` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - The lists `pop`, `p10`, `f`, and `w` are initialized.

2. **Prepare Function**:
   - `p10` is populated with powers of 10 modulo `MOD`.
   - `pop` is populated with the number of 1s in all numbers from `0` to `1023` (which is `1 << 10 - 1`).
   - The `w` and `f` arrays are filled based on the number of digits and the unique digits used.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The inputs are read as `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 2`.

4. **Check Function**:
   - Call `check(50, 2)`:
     - Convert `50` to binary and check the unique digits.
     - The unique digits in `50` are `5` and `0`, which gives a mask of `0b110000` (or `48` in decimal).
     - The `pop_count(mask)` is `2`, which is less than or equal to `k`.
     - Therefore, `check(50, 2)` returns `50`.

5. **Solve Function**:
   - Call `solve(50, 2)`:

   - Initialize `size` as `[1, 1, 1, 1]` (each component has size 1).
   - Initialize `G` as `[[], [], [], []]` (an adjacency list for the graph).

3. **Union-Find Operations**:
   - For each edge input, perform union operations:
     - **Edge (1, 2)**:
       - Call `union(0, 1)`: 
         - Find(0) returns 0, Find(1) returns 1.
         - Union them: `par` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 3]`, `size` becomes `[2, 1, 1, 1]`.

     - `n = 3.0`
     - `m = 2.0`
     - `a = 3.0`

   - The second line is converted into a list `A`:

   - The fourth line is converted into a list `L`:

2. **Finding Optimal B Index:**
   - Initialize `optimalLen` to infinity and `optimalBIdx` to -1.
   - Iterate over `B`:

4. We initialize a `defaultdict` called `D` to store counts of bits.
5. We initialize `index` to `0`.
6. We enter a while loop that continues as long as `N >= 1`:
   - In the first iteration:
     - `N` is `9` (binary `1001`), and `N & 1` is `1` (last bit is set).
     - Since `index` is `0` (even), we increment `D[0]` and `D[1]` by `1`. Now, `D = {0: 1, 1: 1}`.

   - In the second iteration:
     - `N` is `4` (binary `100`), and `N & 1` is `0` (last bit is not set).

3. **Factorization of `a` (15)**:
   - The prime numbers are iterated over to factor `a`.
   - The first prime is `2`, which does not divide `15`.
   - The next prime is `3`, which divides `15`:
     - `A.append(3)` → `A = [3]`

   - The next prime is `5`, which divides `5`:

### Execution Steps

1. The `main()` function is called, which in turn calls the `solve()` function.
2. Inside `solve()`, the first line reads an integer `N` using `Scanner.int()`. Here, `N = 2`.
3. Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized with zeros, each of size `N`:
   - `A = [0, 0]`
   - `B = [0, 0]`
4. A loop runs for `i` from `0` to `N-1` (i.e., `0` to `1`):
   - For `i = 0`, `Scanner.map_int()` reads the first line of input, which is `1 2`. This splits into integers and assigns:
     - `A[0] = 1`
     - `B[0] = 2`
   - Now, `A = [1, 0]` and `B = [2, 0]`.
   - For `i = 1`, `Scanner.map_int()` reads the second line of input, which is `2 3`. This splits into integers and assigns:
     - `A[1] = 2`
     - `B[1] = 3`
   - Now, `A = [1, 2]` and `B = [2, 3]`.
5. After the loop, both lists are sorted:
   - `A` remains `[1, 2]` (already sorted).
   - `B` remains `[2, 3]` (already sorted).
6. Since `N` is even (`N % 2 == 0`), we calculate:
   - `mA = A[N // 2] + A[N // 2 - 1] = A[1] + A[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `mB = B[N // 2] + B[N // 2 - 1] = B[1] + B[0] = 3 + 2 = 5`

   - `a` is the list of integers provided.
   - `c` is initialized as a list of 1001 zeros: `c = [0]*1001`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - We iterate through `a` and count the occurrences of each number:
     - For `1`: `c[1] += 1` (3 times, so `c[1] = 3`)
     - For `8`: `c[8] += 1` (3 times, so `c[8] = 3`)
     - For `2`: `c[2] += 1` (8 times, so `c[2] = 8`)
   - After processing all elements, `c` will look like:
     ```
     c = [0, 3, 8, 0, ..., 3, 0, ..., 0]  # 0s for all other indices
     ```

3. **Calculating `sym` and `sin`**:
   - Initialize `sym = 0` and `sin = 0`.
   - Iterate through `c` to calculate `sym` and `sin`:
     - For `i = 0`: `c[0] = 0`, no change.
     - For `i = 1`: `c[1] = 3`, `sin += 1` (since `c[1] % 2 == 1`).
     - For `i = 2`: `c[2] = 8`, `sym += (8 // 4) = 2`.
     - For `i = 3`: `c[3] = 0`, no change.
     - For `i = 4` to `i = 1000`: all are 0, no change.

### Inputs
```

### Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - `q1 = [[2, 6, 0]]`
   - `q2 = [[2, 3, 0]]`
   - `tested1 = []`
   - `tested2 = []`
   - `tested_total1 = []`
   - `tested_total2 = []`

2. **First Iteration**:
   - Calculate `total1` and `total2`:
     - `total1 = 2 * 6 = 12`
     - `total2 = 2 * 3 = 6`
   - Since `total1 > total2`, we call `equal(12, q2)`.

3. **Equal Function Call**:
   - `t = 12`, `q = [[2, 3, 0]]`
   - Initialize `lo = 0`, `hi = 1`.
   - Calculate `m = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`.
   - `p = [2, 3, 0]`, `temp = 2 * 3 = 6`.
   - Since `12 > 6`, update `hi = 0`.
   - Now `lo >= hi`, return `False`.

4. **Back to Main Loop**:
   - Since `ans` is `False`, we check if `q1[0][0]` is even:
     - `2 & 1` is `0`, so it is even.
     - Calculate `tt = [2 // 2, 6, 0 + 1] = [1, 6, 1]`.
     - Check if `[1, 6]` is in `tested1` and `1 * 6` is in `tested_total1`:
       - Both conditions are `False`, so we append `[1, 6]` to `tested1` and `1 * 6` to `tested_total1`.
       - Now `q1 = [[2, 6, 0], [1, 6, 1]]`.

2. Read the string `s` which is `""aabbbbaaca""`.
3. Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the result.
4. Initialize `prv` to `None` to keep track of the previous character.
5. Start iterating over the range of `n` (from `0` to `9`):
   - **Iteration 0 (i = 0)**:

     - Append `'a'` to `ans`. Now, `ans = ""a""`.

2. **Polynomial Class Initialization**:
   - The `Polynomial` class is defined with methods for polynomial operations.
   - The constructor initializes the polynomial based on the coefficients provided.

3. **Creating Initial Polynomials**:
   - `f` is initialized as an empty list.
   - Two polynomials are appended to `f`:
     - `f[0]` is created with coefficients `[1]`, representing the polynomial \(1\).
     - `f[1]` is created with coefficients `[0, 1]`, representing the polynomial \(x\).

4. **Generating Further Polynomials**:
   - A loop runs from `j = 2` to `j = 150` to generate polynomials based on the previous two:
     - For each `j`, `xf` is created by multiplying `f[j-1]` by \(x\).
     - `t_1` is created by adding `xf` to `f[j-2]`.
     - `t_2` is created by adding `xf` to the negation of `f[j-2]`.
     - The code checks if `t_1` is legal (i.e., it meets certain coefficient conditions). If it is, `t_1` is appended to `f`. If not, it checks `t_2` and appends it if legal.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the code prints the degree and coefficients of the polynomials `f[n]` and `f[n-1]`.
   - Since `n = 1`, we will print the degree and coefficients of `f[1]` and `f[0]`.

6. **Calculating Outputs**:
   - For `f[1]` (which is \(x\)):
     - Degree: `1`
     - Coefficients: `[0, 1]`
   - For `f[0]` (which is \(1\)):
     - Degree: `0`
     - Coefficients: `[1]`

1. **Initialization**:

   - Check if `n == 1`. Since `n` is 6, we proceed.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - We iterate `i` from `0` to `n - 2` (i.e., `0` to `4`).

3. **First iteration (`i = 0`)**:

4. **Second iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - `a[1]` is `1`, not equal to `x` (`2`), so we continue to the next iteration.

5. **Third iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - `a[2]` is `2`, equal to `x` (`2`).
   - Set `l = 2`.

   - Call `g(2, 1)`.

3. We enter the while loop since `check` is `11`, which is greater than or equal to `0`.

Now, we will evaluate the characters in the string from the end to the beginning:

- **Iteration 1** (`check = 11`):
    - The character at index `11` is `'m'`.
    - We check if `S[check]` is `'m'`, which it is.
    - We then check the substring `S[check-4: check+1]` which is `S[7:12]` or `""dream""`.
    - Since this matches `""dream""`, we decrement `check` by `5`, resulting in `check = 6`.

- **Iteration 2** (`check = 6`):
    - The character at index `6` is `'e'`.
    - We check if `S[check]` is `'e'`, which it is.
    - We then check the substring `S[check-4: check+1]` which is `S[2:7]` or `""erase""`.
    - Since this matches `""erase""`, we decrement `check` by `5`, resulting in `check = 1`.

- **Iteration 3** (`check = 1`):
    - The character at index `1` is `'r'`.
    - We check if `S[check]` is `'r'`, which it is.
    - We then check `S[check-2]`, which is `S[-1]` (the character at index `-1` is `'m'`).
    - We check the substring `S[check-6: check+1]` which is `S[-5:2]` or `""dreamer""`.
    - However, since `check` is `1`, `check-6` is `-5`, and `check+1` is `2`, this results in an empty string.
    - This does not match `""dreamer""`, so we print `""NO""` and return.

4. Append `0` to both lists: `A = [1, 2, 3, 0]`, `B = [2, 2, 2, 0]`.

1. Create an instance of `UnionFind` with `n = N + 1 = 4`.

       - Resulting `parents = [-1, -2, 1, -1, -1]`.

2. For the second union operation with `c = 2`, `d = 3`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `left`, `right`, `down`, `up` are initialized as empty lists.
   - `coordinates` is also initialized as an empty list.

2. **Processing Coordinates**:
   - For the first coordinate `(3, 1, 3, 2)`:
     - Since `x1 == x2`, we check `y1 < y2`, which is true.
     - We append `(3, 1, 3, 2, 0)` to `coordinates`.
     - `left`, `right`, `up`, `down` all get updated to include this coordinate.
   - For the second coordinate `(1, 2, 2, 2)`:
     - Since `x1 < x2`, we append `(1, 2, 2, 2, 1)` to `coordinates`.
     - All lists get updated to include this coordinate.
   - For the third coordinate `(1, 0, 0, 1)`:
     - Since `x1 > x2`, we append `(0, 1, 1, 0, 2)` to `coordinates`.
     - All lists get updated to include this coordinate.

3. **Sorting**:
   - `left` is sorted by `(x[0], x[2])`, resulting in:
     - `left = [(0, 1, 1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 2, 2, 1), (3, 1, 3, 2, 0)]`
   - `down` is sorted by `(x[1], x[3])`, resulting in:

3. The program checks if the string is a palindrome and if the first half of the string is equal to the second half:

   - Next, it checks if `s[:n//2] == s[n//2+1:]`. Here, `s[:n//2]` gives the first half of the string, which is `""aka""` (from index 0 to 2), and `s[n//2+1:]` gives the second half, which is also `""aka""` (from index 4 to 6). This condition is also `True`.

3. **Inner Loop** (`i` from 0 to `s`):
   - For each `i`, we calculate `j = s - i`.
   - We check the bounds to ensure `i < n` and `j < n`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - Depending on the values of `i` and `j`, we update `dp[i][j]` and `direct[i][j]` based on the previous values in the `dp` matrix.
   - If `dp[i][j] < k` and `Matrix[i][j]` is not `ord('a')`, we increment `dp[i][j]` and set `Matrix[i][j]` to `ord('a')`.
   - We also check if `Matrix[i][j]` is less than `ord(opchar)` and if `dp[i][j] <= k`, we update `opchar`.

5. **Finalizing the DP Table**:
   - After processing all `i` for a given `s`, we check if `Matrix[i][j]` is not `ord(opchar)` and set `dp[i][j]` to `inf` if true.

1. **Convert K to Binary**:
   - `K = 7` in binary is `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111` (40 bits).

2. **Convert A to Binary**:

   - `A[1] = 6` in binary is `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000110`

### Execution Steps
1. The function `resolve()` is called.
2. The first line of input is read and converted to an integer `N`. Thus, `N = 3`.
3. The second line of input is read and converted into a list of integers `A`. Thus, `A = [1, 10, 100]`.
4. Initialize counters: `Q = 0`, `E = 0`, `O = 0`.
5. Iterate over each element `a` in `A`:
   - For `a = 1`:
     - `1 % 4` is not `0`, so `Q` remains `0`.
     - `1 % 2` is not `0`, so `O` is incremented by `1`. Now, `O = 1`.
   - For `a = 10`:
     - `10 % 4` is not `0`, so `Q` remains `0`.
     - `10 % 2` is `0`, so `E` is incremented by `1`. Now, `E = 1`.
   - For `a = 100`:
     - `100 % 4` is `0`, so `Q` is incremented by `1`. Now, `Q = 1`.
     - `100 % 2` is `0`, but since `Q` is already incremented, `E` remains `1`.
6. After the loop, we have:
   - `Q = 1`
   - `E = 1`
   - `O = 1`
7. Now we evaluate the condition:
   - Calculate `N - 2 * Q`: `3 - 2 * 1 = 1`.
   - Check the conditions:
     - `N - 2 * Q <= 0` is `False` (1 <= 0 is False).
     - `(N - 2 * Q) == 1` is `True` (1 == 1 is True).
     - `N - 2 * Q == E` is `False` (1 == 1 is True, but we only need one True condition).
8. Since at least one of the conditions is `True`, we print `""Yes""`.

7. **Inside the `add` Function**:

   - It calls `fib(n)` to populate the `fibo` list.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is set to `5`.
   - `p` is set to `[0, 5, 0, 2, 3]`.

     - `even = n - odd = 5 - 3 = 2`

2. **Count Odd and Even**:
   - Iterate through each element in `p`:
     - For `i = 0`: `0` is neither odd nor even, so `odd` and `even` remain `3` and `2`.
     - For `i = 5`: `5` is odd, so `odd` decreases by `1` → `odd = 2`.
     - For `i = 0`: `0` is neither odd nor even, so `odd` and `even` remain `2` and `2`.
     - For `i = 2`: `2` is even, so `even` decreases by `1` → `even = 1`.
     - For `i = 3`: `3` is odd, so `odd` decreases by `1` → `odd = 1`.

   After this loop, we have:
   - `odd = 1`
   - `even = 1`

3. **Check for Edge Cases**:
   - Since `even` is not `0`, we skip the first condition.
   - Since `odd * even` is not `0` (both are `1`), we skip the second condition.

   - For `i` from `2` to `N` (which is `3`):
     - For `i = 2`: `P_list[0]` is `1`, so we append `2` to `child_list[1]`. Now, `child_list = [[], [2], [], []]`.
     - For `i = 3`: `P_list[1]` is `1`, so we append `3` to `child_list[1]`. Now, `child_list = [[], [2, 3], [], []]`.

   - Loop through `i` from `1` to `int(4**0.5) + 1 = 3`.
     - For `i = 1`: `4 % 1 == 0`, so we add `1` and `4` to `divisors`. Now, `divisors = [1, 4]`.
     - For `i = 2`: `4 % 2 == 0`, so we add `2` and `2` (since `2` is the same as `4 // 2`) to `divisors`. Now, `divisors = [1, 2, 4]`.
   - Sort `divisors`, resulting in `div = [1, 2, 4]`.

   - For `x = 2`:
     - Call `divisors(2)`.

   - `dp` is initialized as a list of three lists, each containing `n*n` (9) `None` elements.
   - `path` is initialized as a list of `None` with a length of `n*n` (9).

3. **Filling the `path` Array:**
   - The `path` array is filled based on the values in `m`:

     - For `m[0][1] = 9`, `path[8] = (0, 1)`

   - For `i = 0`: Read `1 1`, so `first = [(1, 1)]` and `second = [(1, 1)]`.
   - For `i = 1`: Read `2 2`, so `first = [(1, 1), (2, 2)]` and `second = [(1, 1), (2, 2)]`.
   - For `i = 2`: Read `3 1`, so `first = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)]` and `second = [(1, 3), (2, 2), (1, 3)]`.

3. **Calling `solve(first, second, n, mod)`**:
   - `facts = getFacts(4*10**5 + 1, mod)`:
     - Initialize `facts = [1] * (400001)`.

     - `yy %= 2 * k` → `yy = 1 % 6 = 1`
     - Since `xx >= k` and `yy < k`, we append to `mx` and `my`: 
       - `mx.append(xx - k)` → `mx.append(3 - 3)` → `mx.append(0)`

160,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the input `127`.

1. **Input Reading**: The input `N` is read as `127`.

2. **Calculating Powers of 9**:
   - We calculate `nines` as `[9 ** i for i in range(1, 10) if 9 ** i <= 127]`.
   - The powers of 9 that are less than or equal to 127 are:
     - `9^1 = 9`
     - `9^2 = 81`
   - Thus, `nines = [9, 81]`.

3. **Calculating Powers of 6**:
   - We calculate `sixes` as `[6 ** i for i in range(1, 10) if 6 ** i <= 127][::-1]`.
   - The powers of 6 that are less than or equal to 127 are:
     - `6^1 = 6`
     - `6^2 = 36`
     - `6^3 = 216` (not included since it's greater than 127)
   - Thus, `sixes = [36, 6]`.

4. **Initialization**:
   - `L` is the length of `nines`, which is `2`.
   - `min_ans` is initialized to `INF`, which is `1 << 50` (a very large number).

5. **Iterating Over Combinations**:
   - We iterate over all combinations of `K` where `K` is a tuple of length `L` (2) with values from `0` to `8` (inclusive). This results in `9^2 = 81` combinations.

6. **Processing Each Combination**:
   - For each combination `K`, we calculate `ans` and `s`:
     - `ans` starts at `0`.
     - `s` starts at `0`.
   - For each `k, x` in `zip(K, nines)`, we update `ans` and `s` based on the values in `K` and `nines`.

7. **Checking Residuals**:
   - After calculating `s`, if `s` exceeds `N`, we skip to the next combination.
   - We calculate `resid = N - s`.

### Inputs Breakdown
1. `n = 8` (the number of elements in the array)
2. `a = [8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]` (the array of integers)
3. `q = 3` (the number of queries)
4. Queries:
   - Query 1: `l = 1`, `r = 8`
   - Query 2: `l = 2`, `r = 5`
   - Query 3: `l = 7`, `r = 7`

### Execution Steps
1. **Initialization of BIT**:
   - A Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) is initialized with the array `a`.
   - The `build` method is called to populate the BIT with the values from `a`.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, we calculate the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` using the `query` method of the BIT.

#### Query 1: `l = 1`, `r = 8`
- We need to calculate the sum from index 1 to 8 (1-based index).
- The sum is calculated as:
  - `sum(8) - sum(0)` (using the BIT's `sum` method)
  - `sum(8)` gives the total sum of the array: `8 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 0 + 9 + 4 = 39`
  - `sum(0)` is `0`.
- Therefore, the result for this query is `39`.
- We then compute `(39 - 39 % 10) // 10 = (39 - 9) // 10 = 30 // 10 = 3`.

#### Query 2: `l = 2`, `r = 5`
- We need to calculate the sum from index 2 to 5.
- The sum is calculated as:
  - `sum(5) - sum(1)`
  - `sum(5)` gives: `8 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 7 = 26`
  - `sum(1)` gives: `8`.
- Therefore, the result for this query is `26 - 8 = 18`.
- We then compute `(",0,{}

### Inputs
```
n = 2
w = [3, 1]
s = ""0011""
```

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is set to `2`.
   - `w` is the list of widths: `[3, 1]`.
   - `s` is the string representing the order of passengers: `""0011""`.

2. **Sorting and Preparing Free Rows**:
   - We sort the enumerated widths based on the width values. The sorted order will be:
     - `[(1, 1), (0, 3)]` which corresponds to the original indices and widths.
   - We initialize `free` as a deque containing the rows sorted by width:
     - `free = deque([[2, 1], [1, 3]])` (row indices are 1-based).
   - We also initialize `used` as an empty deque:
     - `used = deque([])`.
   - We create an `ids` list to store the row assignments for each passenger:
     - `ids = [-1, -1, -1, -1]`.

3. **Processing Passengers**:
   - We iterate over each character in `s`:
     - For `pid = 0`, `p = '0'` (introvert):
       - The introvert takes the smallest width row from `free`, which is `[2, 1]`.
       - We remove it from `free` and add it to `used`:
         - `free = deque([[1, 3]])`
         - `used = deque([[2, 1]])`
       - We update `ids`:
         - `ids = [2, -1, -1, -1]`.
     - For `pid = 1`, `p = '0'` (introvert):
       - The introvert takes the next smallest width row from `free`, which is `[1, 3]`.
       - We remove it from `free` and add it to `used`:
         - `free = deque([])`
         - `used = deque([[1, 3], [2, 1]])`

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read `n`, `m`, `k` from the input: `n = 4`, `m = 4`, `k = 2`.
   - Read `cnts` from the input: `cnts = [1, 3]`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - For `i` from `1` to `k-1` (which is `1`):
     - Update `cnts[1]`: `cnts[1] += cnts[0]` → `cnts = [1, 4]`.

3. **Union-Find Initialization**:
   - Initialize `group` as `list(range(n))`: `group = [0, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - Initialize `rnk` as `[0 for i in range(n)]`: `rnk = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - Initialize `adj` as a `k x k` matrix filled with `INF`: `adj = [[INF, INF], [INF, INF]]`.

4. **Processing Edges**:
   - For each edge input:
     - **Edge 1**: `2 3 0` (u=2, v=3, x=0)
       - Perform union of `1` and `2` (0-indexed).
       - After union, `group` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 3]`.
     - **Edge 2**: `3 4 0` (u=3, v=4, x=0)
       - Perform union of `2` and `3` (0-indexed).
       - After union, `group` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - **Edge 3**: `2 4 1` (u=2, v=4, x=1)
       - Find `tu` and `tv` using `bisect_left`:
         - `tu = bisect_left(cnts, 2)` → `tu = 1` (since `cnts[1] = 4`).

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - The grid `l` is initialized as:
     ```
     l = [
         ['*', '.', '*'],
         ['.', '*', '.'],
         ['*', '.', '*']
     ]
     ```

2. **Initialization:**
   - `val = 0`
   - `k` is initialized as a copy of `l`:
     ```
     k = [
         ['*', '.', '*'],
         ['.', '*', '.'],
         ['*', '.', '*']
     ]
     ```
   - `v` is initialized as a 3x3 grid of `False`:
     ```
     v = [
         [False, False, False],
         [False, False, False],
         [False, False, False]
     ]
     ```

3. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The outer loops iterate over each cell in the grid `l`.
   - For each cell, if it is `'.'` and not visited (`v[i][j]` is `False`), we call `DFS(i, j, val)`.

4. **First DFS Call (i=0, j=1):**
   - Start DFS from `(0, 1)`.
   - `ans = 1`, `connected = [(0, 1)]`, `stack = [(0, 1)]`, `v[0][1] = True`.
   - Explore neighbors:
     - `(0, 1)` to `(1, 1)` is invalid (it's `'*'`).
     - `(0, 1)` to `(-1, 1)` is out of bounds.
     - `(0, 1)` to `(0, 2)` is invalid (it's `'*'`).
     - `(0, 1)` to `(0, 0)` is invalid (it's `'*'`).
   - No valid neighbors, end DFS. Update `l[0][1]` to `(1, 0)`.

5. **Second DFS Call (i=1, j=0):**
   - Start DFS from `(1, 0)`.

### Execution Steps

1. **First Test Case: `2 1 3`**
   - Read `n = 2`, `l = 1`, `r = 3`.
   - Adjust `l` to `0` and `r` to `2` (since `r` is adjusted by subtracting `l`).
   - Initialize `currleft = 0` and `curs = 1` (since `n - 1 = 1`).
   - The while loop checks if `currleft + 2*curs <= l`, which is `0 + 2*1 <= 0` (false), so we skip the loop.
   - Set `start = n - curs = 2 - 1 = 1`.
   - Initialize `ans = []`, `head = 1`, `last = 2`.
   - Since `l` is `0`, we skip the first while loop.
   - Now, we enter the second while loop since `r` is `2`.
     - Append `start` (1) to `ans`, decrement `r` to `1`.
     - Append `last` (2) to `ans`, increment `last` to `3`, decrement `r` to `0`.
   - The `ans` list is now `[1, 2]`.
   - Print the result: `1 2`.

2. **Second Test Case: `3 3 6`**
   - Read `n = 3`, `l = 3`, `r = 6`.
   - Adjust `l` to `2` and `r` to `3`.
   - Initialize `currleft = 0` and `curs = 2`.
   - The while loop checks if `currleft + 2*curs <= l`, which is `0 + 2*2 <= 2` (false), so we skip the loop.
   - Set `start = n - curs = 3 - 2 = 1`.
   - Initialize `ans = []`, `head = 1`, `last = 2`.

### Execution Steps

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first line of input is split into `array2`, resulting in `array2 = ['10', '6']`.
   - `array2[0]` is converted to an integer, which gives us `10` (the number of subsequent lines).
   - `array2[1]` is converted to an integer, which gives us `6` (the number we will check for).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `summ` is initialized to `0`.
   - `array` is initialized as an empty list.

3. **Reading Subsequent Lines**:
   - A loop runs from `0` to `9` (10 iterations) to read the next 10 lines of input.
   - Each line `g` is read and appended to `array`. After this loop, `array` contains:
     ```
     ['1234560', '1234560', '1234560', '1234560', '1234560', '1234560', '1234560', '1234560', '1234560', '1234560']
     ```

4. **Checking for Presence of Digits**:
   - Since `array2[1]` is `6`, we enter the block for checking if the string contains '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', and '6'.
   - A loop runs from `0` to `9` (10 iterations) to check each string in `array`.
   - For each string `array[d]`, we check if it contains all the digits from '0' to '6':
     - The string '1234560' contains '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', and '6'.
     - Therefore, for each of the 10 strings, the condition is satisfied.

5. **Counting Matches**:
   - Since all 10 strings satisfy the condition, `summ` is incremented by `1` for each match.
   - After 10 iterations, `summ` becomes `10`.

172,"Let's simulate the execution of the provided code step by step with the input `1 1 2`.

1. The input is read as a string: `inp = ""1 1 2""`.
2. The string is split into a list of strings: `arr = ['1', '1', '2']`.
3. Each string in `arr` is converted to an integer, resulting in the list: `L = [1, 1, 2]`.
4. An answer list is initialized: `ans = [0, 0, 0]`.
5. A variable `s` is initialized to 0.
6. The sum of the elements in `L` is calculated:
   - `s = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.
7. A boolean variable `imp` is initialized to `False`.
8. The program checks if any element in `L` is greater than half of `s` (which is `2`):
   - For `l = 1`: `1 > 2` is `False`.
   - For `l = 1`: `1 > 2` is `False`.
   - For `l = 2`: `2 > 2` is `False`.
   - Since no element is greater than `2`, `imp` remains `False`.
9. The program checks which element in `L` is the minimum:
   - `L[0]` (1) is the minimum.
10. Since `L[0]` is the minimum, it checks if `L[1]` is greater than `L[2]`:
    - `1 > 2` is `False`.
11. Therefore, it calculates the bonds as `bonds = L[2] - L[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`.
12. The answer list is updated:
    - `ans[2] += bonds` → `ans[2] = 0 + 1 = 1`.
    - `L[0] -= bonds` → `L[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`.
    - `L[2] -= bonds` → `L[2] = 2 - 1 = 1`.
13. Now, `L` is updated to `[0, 1, 1]`.

   - `k = 5`
   - `h = [3, 1, 2, 2, 4]`

     - Move to (1, -2) is out of bounds.
     - Move to (1, 2) is out of bounds.
     - Move to (5, -2) is out of bounds.
     - Move to (5, 2) is valid, add to `set1` and `dic1`.
     - Continue exploring from (5, 2):
       - Move to (3, 0) is already visited.

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is set to `3`.
   - `arr` is set to `[0, 2, 0]`.
   - `barr` is set to `[3, 0, 1]`.
   - `start` is initialized to `0`.
   - `end` is initialized to `2 * n`, which is `6`.
   - `op` is initialized to `[0]`.

2. **Check Start Function**:
   - Call `check_start(0, op)`:
     - `mydict` is initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (length `n + 1`).
     - Count occurrences in `arr`:
       - `mydict` becomes `[2, 0, 1, 0]` (two `0`s, one `2`).
     - `zeroes` is set to `mydict[0]`, which is `2`.
     - Initialize `pile` as a deque containing `barr`, so `pile = deque([3, 0, 1])`.
     - Insert `zeroes` into `pile`:
       - For `i = 0`: Append `0` to `pile`, decrement `zeroes` to `1`, `op[0]` becomes `1`, `mydict` becomes `[1, 0, 1, 0]`.
       - For `i = 1`: Append `0` to `pile`, decrement `zeroes` to `0`, `op[0]` becomes `2`, `mydict` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 0]`.

     - Pop the first element (`1`):
       - Update `mydict`: `mydict` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 0]`.

   - `X = [1, 2, 1]`
   - `sts = [[] for _ in range(N)]` results in `sts = [[], [], []]`.

2. **Processing Edges**:
   - For edge `(1, 2)`:
     - `a = 1`, `b = 2`
     - Update `sts`: `sts[0].append((1, 1))` and `sts[1].append((1, 0))`

   - Enter a loop that runs `n` times.

3. In each iteration of the loop:

### Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 3`
   - `a = [3, 3, 3]`
   - `d = [0, 0, 0]` (initialized to zero for each element)
   - `ok = 0`
   - `cur = 0`
   - `len = Lcm(7, n) = Lcm(7, 3)`

2. **Calculating LCM**:
   - `Gcd(7, 3)`:
     - `Gcd(3, 7 % 3)` → `Gcd(3, 1)` → `Gcd(1, 3 % 1)` → `Gcd(1, 0)` → returns `1`
   - `Lcm(7, 3) = 7 * 3 // 1 = 21`
   - So, `len = 21`.

Y = 2

### Execution Steps
1. The first condition checks if `2 * C > A + B`:
   - Calculate `2 * C`: `2 * 1600 = 3200`
   - Calculate `A + B`: `1500 + 2000 = 3500`
   - Since `3200` is not greater than `3500`, we move to the next condition.

2. The next condition checks if `X > Y`:
   - Here, `X = 3` and `Y = 2`, so `3 > 2` is true.
   - We then calculate `min(2 * C * X, 2 * C * Y + A * (X - Y))`.

3. Calculate `2 * C * X`:
   - `2 * C * X = 2 * 1600 * 3 = 9600`

4. Calculate `2 * C * Y + A * (X - Y)`:
   - First, calculate `X - Y`: `3 - 2 = 1`
   - Then calculate `A * (X - Y)`: `1500 * 1 = 1500`
   - Now calculate `2 * C * Y`: `2 * 1600 * 2 = 6400`
   - Finally, add these two results: `6400 + 1500 = 7900`

5. Now we find the minimum of the two calculated values:
   - `min(9600, 7900) = 7900`

   - We will process the input string `s = ""abaa""` with `n = 4`.

2. **Processing the string**:
   - Initialize `grp = []`, `cnt = []`, `tmp = 0`, and `cur = s[0]` which is `'a'`.

3. **Iterate through the string `s`**:
   - For `i = 'a'`: 
     - Since `i` is equal to `cur`, increment `tmp` to `1`.
   - For `i = 'b'`: 
     - Since `i` is not equal to `cur`, append `cur` to `grp` and `tmp` to `cnt`. Now, `grp = ['a']` and `cnt = [1]`. Update `cur` to `'b'` and reset `tmp` to `1`.
   - For `i = 'a'`: 
     - Since `i` is not equal to `cur`, append `cur` to `grp` and `tmp` to `cnt`. Now, `grp = ['a', 'b']` and `cnt = [1, 1]`. Update `cur` to `'a'` and reset `tmp` to `1`.
   - For `i = 'a'`: 
     - Since `i` is equal to `cur`, increment `tmp` to `2`.
   - End of the loop: Append the last `cur` and `tmp` to `grp` and `cnt`. Now, `grp = ['a', 'b', 'a']` and `cnt = [1, 1, 2]`.

4. **Check the length of `grp`**:
   - Since `len(grp) > 1`, we check if `grp[0]` is equal to `grp[-1]`:
     - `grp[0]` is `'a'` and `grp[-1]` is also `'a'`, so they are equal.
     - Calculate `ans = ((cnt[0] + 1) * (cnt[-1] + 1)) % prime`.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - We read the input values: `n = 2`, `l = 1`, `r = 3`.

2. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - We initialize `number_of_zeros`, `number_of_ones`, and `number_of_twos` to `0`.

3. **Calculating Counts Based on Ranges**:
   - We check the conditions based on `l % 3` and `r % 3`:
     - Since `l % 3 = 1` and `r % 3 = 0`, we enter the second `elif` block:
       - `number_of_zeros = (r - l + 1) // 3 = (3 - 1 + 1) // 3 = 3 // 3 = 1`
       - `number_of_ones = (r - l + 1) // 3 = 1`
       - `number_of_twos = (r - l + 1) // 3 = 1`
   - After this step, we have:
     - `number_of_zeros = 1`
     - `number_of_ones = 1`
     - `number_of_twos = 1`

4. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - We create a DP table `dp` of size `(n+1) x 3`, initialized with `-1`:
     ```
     dp = [[-1, -1, -1],
            [-1, -1, -1],
            [-1, -1, -1]]

   - We set the base case:
     - `dp[1][0] = number_of_zeros % MOD = 1 % (10**9 + 7) = 1`
     - `dp[1][1] = number_of_ones % MOD = 1 % (10**9 + 7) = 1`
     - `dp[1][2] = number_of_twos % MOD = 1 % (10**9 + 7) = 1`

```

### Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read `n`, `a`, and `b` from input: `n = 5`, `a = 100`, `b = 1`.
   - Initialize `price` as a list containing `[a, b]`, so `price = [100, 1]`.
   - Read `arr` from input: `arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.
   - Calculate `half` as `n // 2`, which gives `half = 5 // 2 = 2`.
   - Initialize `cost` to `0` and `flg` to `True`.

2. **Loop through the first half of the array**:
   - For `i = 0`:
     - `arr[i] = 0` and `arr[n-1-i] = arr[5-1-0] = arr[4] = 2`.
     - Since `arr[i] != arr[n-1-i]`, we check the conditions:
       - `arr[i] <= 1` and `arr[n-1-i] == 2` is true.
       - Update `cost`: `cost += price[arr[i]]` → `cost += price[0]` → `cost += 100` → `cost = 100`.
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `arr[i] = 1` and `arr[n-1-i] = arr[5-1-1] = arr[3] = 1`.
     - Since `arr[i] == arr[n-1-i]`, we do nothing and continue.
   - The loop ends as `i` reaches `half`.

3. **Check for the middle element**:
   - Since `n % 2 == 1`, we check the middle element:
     - `arr[half] = arr[2] = 2`.
     - Since `arr[half] == 2`, we update `cost`: `cost += min(a, b)` → `cost += min(100, 1)` → `cost += 1` → `cost =",0,{}

1. The function `main()` is called.
2. The first input `N` is read using `ri()`, which returns `1`.
3. The second input `A` is read using `ria()`, which returns `[1000000000]`.
4. The list `A` is sorted, resulting in `A = [1000000000]`.
5. The list `A` is reversed, which does not change it since it has only one element: `A = [1000000000]`.
6. An array `Pow2` of size `N + 1` (which is `2`) is initialized with `mint(0)`. So, `Pow2 = [mint(0), mint(0)]`.
7. The first element `Pow2[0]` is set to `mint(1)`, resulting in `Pow2 = [mint(1), mint(0)]`.
8. A loop runs from `1` to `N` (which is `1`):
   - For `i = 1`, `Pow2[1]` is calculated as `Pow2[0] * 2`, which is `mint(1) * 2 = mint(2)`. Thus, `Pow2 = [mint(1), mint(2)]`.
9. A variable `tot` is initialized to `mint(0)`.
10. A loop runs from `0` to `N - 1` (which is `0`):
    - For `i = 0`, `tot` is updated as follows:
      - `tot += mint(A[0]) * Pow2[N-1]`, which is `tot += mint(1000000000) * Pow2[0] = mint(1000000000) * mint(1) = mint(1000000000)`. Now, `tot = mint(1000000000)`.
      - Since `i` is not greater than `0`, the second part of the update does not execute.
11. After the loop, `tot` is multiplied by `Pow2[N]`, which is `tot *= Pow2[1] = mint(1000000000) * mint(2) = mint(2000000000)`.

   - `r2` is ""00""
   - `n = len(r1) = 2`
   - Initialize `l = [0]`.

2. **Building the list `l`**:
   - Loop through each character in `r1` and `r2`:
     - For `i = 0`:
       - `r1[0]` is '0' and `r2[0]` is '0', so append `2` to `l`. Now, `l = [0, 2]`.
     - For `i = 1`:
       - `r1[1]` is '0' and `r2[1]` is '0', so append `2` to `l`. Now, `l = [0, 2, 2]`.

       - `l[u]` is `2` and `e` is `2`.

edges = [(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 2), (2, 2, 1)]
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `par = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes `par` to `[0, 0, 0]`.
   - For `i` from `1` to `n`, `par[i] = i` results in `par = [0, 1, 2]`.
   - `edges` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Reading Edges**:
   - The edges are read and appended to the `edges` list:
     - After reading `(1, 2, 3)`, `edges = [(1, 2, 3)]`.
     - After reading `(1, 2, 2)`, `edges = [(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 2)]`.

   - The edges are sorted based on the weight (third element):
     - After sorting, `edges = [(2, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2), (1, 2, 3)]`.

4. **Building the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
   - Call `mst()`:
     - Initialize `ret = []`.
     - For each edge in `edges`:
       - For edge `(2, 2, 1)`, `u = find(2)` returns `2` (since `par[2] = 2`), and `v = find(2)` returns `2`. Since `u == v`, we skip this edge.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort `s1` to get `S1 = [1, 4]`.
   - Sort `s2` to get `S2 = [1, 5]`.
   - Prepend `0` to both sorted lists:
     - `S1 = [0, 1, 4]`
     - `S2 = [0, 1, 5]`
   - Reverse both lists:
     - `S1 = [4, 1, 0]`

4. **Iterate through the range of `2*n + 1` (which is 5)**:
   - **Iteration 0 (j = 0)**:
     - Since `j` is even, compare `S2[ptb]` (5) and `S1[pta]` (4).
     - Since `5 > 4`, increment `ptb` to `1`.
   - **Iteration 1 (j = 1)**:
     - Since `j` is odd, compare `S1[pta]` (4) and `S2[ptb]` (1).
     - Since `4 > 1`, increment `pta` to `1`.
   - **Iteration 2 (j = 2)**:
     - Since `j` is even, compare `S2[ptb]` (1) and `S1[pta]` (1).

   - Since `S[0] == 1`, we check if both neighbors are the same type (sheep).
   - Set `tmp[1] = 1` and `tmp[N-1] = 1`, resulting in `tmp = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.

4. **Iterate to Fill `tmp`**:
   - For `i = 2`: 
     - `tmp[2] = tmp[1] * tmp[0] * S[1] = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1`, so `tmp = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`.
   - For `i = 3`: 
     - `tmp[3] = tmp[2] * tmp[1] * S[2] = 1 * 1 * -1 = -1`, so `tmp = [1, 1, 1, -1, 0, 1]`.
   - For `i = 4`: 
     - `tmp[4] = tmp[3] * tmp[2] * S[3] = -1 * 1 * 1 = -1`, so `tmp = [1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1]`.

5. **Check Conditions**:
   - Check if `tmp[N-1] == tmp[N-2] * tmp[N-3] *",0,{}

### Inputs
```
n = 1
l = [10]
s = ""G""
```

### Execution Steps
1. Initialize variables:
   - `water = 0`
   - `grass = 0`
   - `cgrass = 0`
   - `time = 0`
   - `seen = False`

2. Start iterating over the range of `n` (which is 1):
   - For `i = 0`, we check `s[i]`:
     - `s[0]` is `""G""`, so we set `dist = l[0] = 10`.

3. Check if `water >= dist`:
   - `water (0) < dist (10)`, so we proceed to the else block.
   - Update `dist` to `dist - water = 10 - 0 = 10`.
   - Update `time` by adding `2 * water = 2 * 0 = 0`, so `time` remains `0`.
   - Set `water = 0`.
   - Now, we need to add `3 * dist` to `time`:
     - `time += 3 * dist = 3 * 10 = 30`, so `time` becomes `30`.
   - Update `grass` by adding `dist = 10`, so `grass` becomes `10`.

4. Since there are no more elements in `s`, we exit the loop.

5. Finally, we print `time`, which is `30`.

### Inputs
```
m = 7
a = 5
b = 3
```

### Execution Steps

1. **Calculate GCD**:
   - `g = gcd(5, 3) = 1`

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `vis = [0] * (5 + 3 + 1) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `vis[0] = 1` → `vis = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `nvis = 1`
   - `count = 0`
   - `last = 0`
   - `t = 0`

3. **While Loop**:
   - **First Iteration**:
     - `t = 0`, which is less than `b` (3).
     - Update `t`: `t += a` → `t = 5`
     - Check if `t > m`: `5 <= 7`, so continue.
     - Check if `t > last`: `5 > 0`, so:
       - `count += (5 - 0) * 1` → `count = 5`
       - `last = 5`
     - Check if `vis[t]`: `vis[5] = 0`, so:
       - `vis[5] = 1` → `vis = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
       - `nvis += 1` → `nvis = 2`

   - **Second Iteration**:
     - `t = 5`, which is less than `b` (3).
     - Update `t`: `t += a` → `t = 10`
     - Check if `t > m`: `10 > 7`, so break the loop.

4. **Final Check**:
   - Since `t > m`, we calculate:
     - `count += (m - last + 1) * nvis`
     - `count += (7 - 5 + 1) * 2` → `count",0,{}
