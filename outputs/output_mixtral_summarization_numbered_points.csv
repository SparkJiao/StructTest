0,"1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials that cause directed transport of an ensemble of particles. The interest in this field comes from the possibility of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as observed in biological systems.
2. Recent studies have focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets. These systems are sensitive to initial conditions and their behavior can change dramatically as parameters change, leading to changes in transport properties.
3. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the time-averaged velocity of an ensemble of particles, can change direction depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics.
4. A later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals can occur in the absence of bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior. They proposed an alternative origin for current reversal, related to the stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system.
5. However, the arguments presented by Barbi and Salerno are based on the behavior of a single particle, which may not be true for chaotic systems in general due to the possibility of extreme dependence on the statistics of the ensemble being considered.
6. A detailed methodology for understanding transport properties in mixed regular and chaotic systems has been laid out in earlier studies. The specific system under consideration has multiple coexisting periodic or chaotic attractors or a mixture of both, and the behavior of a probability ensemble in such a system is relevant to possible experimental validation of these results.
7. The current investigation studies the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the same system as considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno. The study finds that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and that it is important to discard transients in quantifying the current.
8. The investigation also finds evidence for a generalized version of Mateos's conjecture, that bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the current. However, not all bifurcations lead to current reversal, and",1
1,"1. The text discusses the discovery and analysis of extrasolar planetary systems, specifically those with high eccentricities. These eccentricities challenge existing theories of planet formation and migration.
2. The authors describe various mechanisms that could explain these high eccentricities, including planet-planet scattering, stellar companion interactions, and the Kozai mechanism. They also discuss the possibility of multi-planet systems and the presence of low-mass ""hot Neptunes.""
3. The authors present the results of their study of six eccentric planetary systems, using observational data from the McDonald Observatory and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). They fit the data with Keplerian orbits and perform test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets.
4. The authors find that the test particle simulations can help determine the regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits. They also note that the detection limits vary depending on the observing strategy and the number of observations.
5. The authors conclude that there is no evidence for additional planets in the six systems they studied. However, they note that there are regions where additional objects could exist and that further observations and simulations are needed to constrain the architecture of these systems.",1
2,"1. The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z decay into fermion pairs with high accuracy. The good agreement between LEP data and SM predictions has constrained new physics at the Z pole.
2. The physics of the Z boson is expected to play a central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Z factory is realized, which can generate Z events several orders of magnitude higher than that of LEP.
3. The ILC, a proposed electron-positron collider with tunable energy and polarized beams, can realize this factory by operating on top of the Z boson resonance with a bypass added to its main beam line.
4. The rates of rare Z decays, such as the flavor changing processes and the decay into light Higgs bosons, can be significantly enhanced in new physics models and may be observable at the ILC.
5. Recent studies have shown that new physics models, such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and the Nearly Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), can naturally accommodate a light CP-odd Higgs boson with a singlet-dominant component.
6. These non-minimal supersymmetric models can avoid the muon g-2 problem and alleviate the little hierarchy problem by having such a light Higgs boson.
7. With the latest experiments, the properties of the light Higgs boson are more stringently constrained than before, making it worthwhile to update previous studies.
8. The lower bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass can be significantly relaxed in extensions of the SM, such as the NMSSM, the NMSSM, and the Lepton-Specific Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (L2HDM).
9. In this work, the authors study the rare Z decays Z → γA0, Z → A0A0, and Z → H+H- in a comparative way for four models, namely the Type-II 2HDM, the L2HDM, the NMSSM, and the NMSSM, and examine carefully the constraints on the light A0 from many latest experimental results.",1
3,"1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartners of the SM particles, with their masses expected to be below the TeV range. Mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology.
2. The no-scale type Kähler potential is a type of Kähler potential in which the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes. The only source of SUSY breaking is gaugino masses, making this scenario highly predictive with various phenomenological consequences obtained with a few parameters.
3. The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and the sequestered sector scenario in a five-dimensional setting with two branes. In this scenario, the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other, and the form of the Kähler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed given by eq.([eq : noscalekahler]).
4. In the no-scale scenario, the degrees of freedom of SUSY particle mass spectrum are limited because only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given. Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, mainly focusing on the mass spectrum.
5. Current limits from the lightest Higgs mass and the branching ratio for h → γγ are used to constrain the no-scale scenario. When universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, almost all the parameter region is excluded. However, when the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale, a relatively large parameter region is allowed. The constraints are also important when the higgsino-like neutralino is the LSP.
6. The minimal scenario, where universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, is severely constrained by the cosmological bound and direct search limit at LEP 2. The other two scenarios, where universal gaugino masses are given above the GUT scale or",1
4,"1. Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but this strength is weakened by relative cross polarization prior to collision [1]. However, a solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) possesses a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity [2].
2. CH formed in spacetimes of CPW was shown to be unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations [3, 4]. Any perturbation applied to a CPW spacetime will turn the CH into an essential singularity.
3. The electromagnetic (EM) field itself weakens the strength of a singularity in CPW. Collision of pure EM waves must have a special significance for singularity formation [5].
4. A cross-polarized version of the BS solution (CPBS) was found, which has the nice feature that the Weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region [6, 7]. However, cross polarization does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries.
5. The paper tests the validity of the HK stability conjecture for the CPBS solution with various added test fields. The conjecture is more economical in reaching a direct conclusion about the stability of a CH compared to perturbation analysis.
6. The metric that describes collision of EM waves with cross polarization was found to be a minimal extension of the BS metric, with a conformally non-flat solution generated by the cross polarization [7].
7. The paper investigates the stability of quasiregular (qr) singularities in the cpbs spacetime using geodesics and test EM and scalar field analyses, and presents an exact back reaction calculation for the collision of cross-polarized EM field coupled with scalar field.
8. The conjecture suggests that putting a test field into the background geometry and studying the reaction it will experience can indicate whether certain scalars diverge, which would render a CH unstable and convert it into a scalar singularity.",1
5,"1. X-ray studies of ""normal"" galaxies have been extended to cosmologically interesting distances through deep field surveys, such as the CDF surveys, which have reached 1 ms of exposure. These surveys have detected significant numbers of normal galaxies among the population of X-ray sources contributing to the XRB.
2. Normal galaxies are likely to be the most numerous extragalactic X-ray sources in the universe and are expected to dominate the number counts at 0.52 keV fluxes of ~10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2. The CDF-N survey has reached the depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies at a look-back time of ~12.2 Gyr.
3. The ratio of X-ray luminosity to K-band luminosity is an indicator of the current level of star formation in a galaxy. The study presented here places observational constraints on the evolution of this ratio for normal spiral galaxies up to z~1.2. The study also places constraints on the fraction of the diffuse XRB explained by galaxies lingering just below the CDF-N detection threshold.
4. Stacking techniques have been used to estimate the emission at extremely faint flux levels for normal galaxies. The study found that the X-ray luminosity per unit K-band luminosity is larger at z~1 than in the local universe, indicating a larger contribution from X-ray binary populations at earlier epochs. This can be used to constrain models of X-ray binary production in galaxies.",1
6,"1. Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, which can be categorized into different types: non-separable or entangled states, EPR-steerable states, and Bell-nonlocal states.
2. Non-separable states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states, while EPR-steerable states allow for a demonstration of EPR-steering, which is the ability to remotely prepare a quantum state.
3. Bell-nonlocal states violate Bell inequalities, indicating the presence of non-local correlations.
4. EPR-steering is a necessary condition for Bell-nonlocality, and it is the only way to verify the existence of entanglement if either party or their detectors cannot be trusted.
5. The notion of EPR-steering was formalized eight years ago and is defined as the ability to demonstrate EPR-steering using a hybrid local hidden variable (LHV) and local hidden state (LHS) model.
6. The hierarchy of non-classical correlations for bipartite states is as follows: separable states are a strict subset of non-EPR-steerable states, which are in turn a strict subset of Bell-local states.
7. The steering ellipsoid formalism is used to investigate EPR-steerability of the class of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, known as t-states.
8. A deterministic LHS model for projective measurements on t-states is developed, and two sufficient conditions for t-states to be EPR-steerable are obtained via EPR-steering inequalities.",1
7,"1. The idea of using an electron's spin to encode binary information was first proposed by an unidentified visionary and later popularized by Feynman in the mid-1990s.
2. Encoding information in spin has potential advantages such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation.
3. In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins was proposed.
4. The ground state of the array has an anti-ferromagnetic ordering, and the spin configuration encodes logic 1.
5. If the inputs change rapidly compared to the time it takes for the metastable state to decay, the system can function properly.
6. However, if exchange interaction is bidirectional, it can prevent unidirectional flow of logic signals, which is necessary for any logic device.
7. A proposed solution is to use clocking to impose unidirectionality in time, but this requires lowering adjacent barriers pairwise at the same time.
8. Multi-phase clocking can make these devices work, but it requires fabricating gate pads between every two cells, which is a major lithography challenge.
9. The minimum power dissipation per unit area for a quantum inverter using two exchange coupled spins is 3 kw/cm^2, which is much higher than current chips.",1
8,"1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary star fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.
2. Theoretical models have not been able to accurately reproduce the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off. The minimum period for CVs that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation as the only sink of orbital angular momentum is around 80 minutes.

9,"1. Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of galaxies with a highly disturbed intragroup medium due to a complex sequence of interactions and harassment. A large-scale intergalactic shock wave has been produced as a result of a high-velocity collision between an intruder galaxy and the intergalactic medium of the group.
2. The shock wave is responsible for heating the x-ray emitting gas, as evidenced by optical emission line ratios and observed broad linewidths. The shock wave is also associated with the detection of extremely powerful pure rotational H2 line emission, which has sparked intense interest in the SQ system.
3. The distribution of large-scale x-ray and radio emission, along with optical emission line diagnostics, provides strong evidence that the giant filament seen in SQ is the result of a strong shock. The spectral cubes of the shock region reveal a new H2 structure running eastward from the ""main"" shock ridge, which is observed faintly in X-ray and radio continuum images.
4. The distribution of warm H2 emission along the length of the main north-south (ns) shock ridge and along the ""bridge"" demonstrates the remarkable projected coexistence of hot x-ray plasma and warm H2. The s(3) line exhibits a clear correspondence to the x-ray, notably at the center of the shock, where peaks are found at both wavelengths.
5. The intergalactic star formation region SQ-a is essentially absent in x-ray emission but is strongly detected in H2 emission. The s(0) line demonstrates correspondence with the main shock, but is dominated by emission in the north where less powerful radio emission is observed. The s(3) line presents a much tighter correlation with regions of the shock that are more radio luminous than the lower-j transitions. The radio emission is likely sensitive to the most compressed regions of the shock where cosmic ray particles are accelerated more strongly, while the brightest x-ray patches are likely due to the fastest regions of the shock.",1
10,"1. The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, suggesting that at least some of the solar system's SLRIs may have been injected by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
2. The injection of SLRIs into the presolar cloud or solar nebula would have been a spatially heterogeneous event, potentially reducing their usefulness as a spatially homogeneous chronometer for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation.
3. Previous models have shown how initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles.
4. Other elements and their isotopes suggest a similarly well-mixed solar nebula, but stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous during the early phases of planet formation.
5. The leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula, where self-shielding could lead to isotopic fractionation between gas-phase and solid-phase oxygen atoms.
6. The very existence of refractory particles in comet 81P/Wild 2 implies that these small particles experienced large-scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula.
7. MGU disks offer a means to accomplish this early large-scale transport, and are likely to be involved in the FU Orionis outbursts experienced by young solar-type stars.
8. MGU disk models can easily lead to the high mass accretion rates needed to explain FU Orionis events, and can offer an alternative mechanism for gas giant planet formation.
9. The numerical models used in the study were computed with a three-dimensional, gravitational hydrodynamics code, and the results suggest that the MGU disk masses assumed in the models may be achieved in some fraction of protoplanetary disks, and perhaps in the solar nebula as well.",1
11,"1. The analysis searches for new particles with a narrow natural width that decay to dijets, specifically axigluons, excited states of composite quarks, color octet technirhos, new gauge bosons, and scalar diquarks.
2. Four triggers from run 1a and 1b are used, and dijet mass spectra are combined with integrated luminosities of 7.5, 1.92, 9.52, and 69.8 pb@xmath0.
3. Jets are defined with a fixed cone clustering algorithm, corrected for detector response, energy lost outside the cone, and underlying event.
4. The two highest @xmath15 jets are taken, and it is required that they have pseudorapidity @xmath16 and a cms scattering angle @xmath17| < 2/3.
5. The data is systematically higher than a prediction from pythia plus a CDF detector simulation at high mass, and the QCD background is determined by fitting the data to a smooth function of three parameters.
6. The mass resolution for excited quarks is shown in fig. [fig\_resonance], and a binned maximum likelihood fit of the data to the background parameterization and the mass resonance shape is performed.
7. The angular distribution of the fluctuation in the mass region is studied and found to be compatible with both QCD alone and with QCD + 5% excited quark (best fit).
8. From the likelihood distribution including experimental systematic uncertainties, the 95% CL upper limit on the cross section for new particles is obtained.
9. The cross section for axigluons, excited quarks, technirhos, W, Z, and e6 diquarks is compared to the calculated limits, and the possibility of a new physics beyond the standard model is considered.",1
12,"1. The first observational evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was discovered when supernovae type Ia (SNIA) were found to be fainter than expected. This has been confirmed by various independent observations, including temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), and gamma-ray bursts.
2. Within the framework of General Relativity, the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, known as dark energy (DE). The nature of this unknown matter field has sparked significant scientific effort to understand its properties. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of the DE driving the current epoch of the accelerated expansion of our universe, accompanied by a dark matter (DM) component responsible for galaxies and their large-scale structures' distribution.
3. The interaction between DM and DE has been proposed to alleviate the coincidence problem, which questions the similarity of their current values despite their potentially different time variations. Interacting DM/DE models have been found to be compatible with observations, with some studies suggesting evidence of interaction with low confidence levels. The Planck collaboration also found that coupled DM/DE models agree with observations.
4. The interaction between DM and DE can affect the overall evolution of the universe, expansion history, growth of matter and baryon density perturbations, temperature anisotropies of the CMB, and the evolution of the gravitational potential at late times. These observables are directly linked to the underlying theory of gravity, allowing for constraints on the interaction using observations of the background evolution and the emergence of large-scale structure.",1
13,"1. The spectra of Type 1 AGNs show a variety of broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized and excited gas in the vicinity of the central massive object.
2. Broad emission lines, like Hβ, are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk acting as the fuel reservoir for the central supermassive black hole. There is evidence for two Type 1 AGN populations, A and B, with different broad-line widths and profile characteristics.
3. Population A shows the smallest broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ=1000-4000 km/s) and includes narrow-line Seyfert 1 sources (FWHM < 2000 km/s). The broad Hβ profiles in this population are best fit by a single Lorentz function.
4. Population B sources show larger broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ=4000-12000 km/s) and require two Gaussians (one unshifted and one redshifted) for a reasonable profile description. Broad-line widths in both populations can range from 500 to 40000 km/s.
5. Narrow emission lines, like [OIII]5007, are generally considered a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame, except in the case of ""blue outliers"" found in sources with FWHM Hβ=1500-3500 km/s and weak [OIII] emission. Blue outliers show [OIII] blueshifts as large as 10000 km/s.
6. Careful use of [OIII] and Hβ narrow lines as rest frame measures suggests that broad Hβ in Population A sources rarely shows a systematic red or blue shift above the FWHM profile level. However, a blueshifted component or asymmetry is observed in some extreme FeII strong Population A sources. Population B sources show more complex line shift properties.
7. Broad FeII emission has been found in Type 1 quasars since the 1960s and is almost ubiquitous in bright SDSS quasars. FeII emission appears to correlate with FWHM Hβ, and sources with the",1
14,"1. Nuclear multifragmentation is the study of the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and is being researched both theoretically and experimentally due to the similarities between nucleon-nucleon interactions and van der Waals forces.
2. Experiments have identified a wide plateau in the nuclear caloric curve, which is thought to be indicative of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. However, subsequent experiments have not consistently replicated this plateau, with differences attributed to experimental precision and finite-size effects.
3. Recent reevaluations of experimental data by the ALADIN group have brought to light the presence of a significant nonequilibrium component in measured source excitation energies, which may be due to pre-equilibrium or pre-break-up stages.
4. The SMM and MMMC statistical multifragmentation models have been successful in reproducing some experimental data, but do not strictly adhere to microcanonical rules.
5. A refined version of the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation model has been proposed, with improvements made to both the break-up and secondary particle emission stages. This model has been used to reevaluate caloric curves for the source nucleus (70,32) and to compare model predictions with recent experimental heli isotopic temperature curves.
6. The refined model is able to simultaneously fit the defining characteristics of the nuclear multifragmentation phenomenon and to identify a nonequilibrium part of experimentally evaluated excitation energy. The direct comparison of the calculated heli caloric curve shows excellent agreement with experimental heli curves recently evaluated by the ALADIN group.",1
15,"1. The solar corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere, is heated to a temperature of about 12 million Kelvins, which is significantly higher than the visible surface of the Sun, known as the photosphere, that is roughly 250 times cooler. This heating is believed to be caused by magnetic fields or waves, with the energy source located in the convection zone below the photosphere.
2. The two main theories for this heating are the dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves and numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events, which give rise to nanoflares. MHD waves can be generated by the buffeting of magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere by granulation, and can propagate into magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona. On the other hand, random motions of magnetic loop footpoints can produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines, which generates field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively.
3. The text also describes the setup of an observational system, located at the Lomnicky Peak Observatory, that will be used to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations. The system consists of a 20-cm Lyot-type coronagraph, a special opto-mechanical interface, and two fast-frame-rate CCD cameras, and is designed to observe in the Fe XIV green line using the SECIS instrument. The coronagraph is equipped with a fast optical automatic guider that detects offsets of the actual pointing and precisely stabilizes the relative position of the occulting disk against the solar image, ensuring a stable position of the field of view.",1
16,"1. Water vapor is an important molecule for the chemistry of interstellar and circumstellar clouds, and its 6@xmath8 - 5@xmath9 masing transition at 22 GHz has been used to trace high excitation gas around star forming regions and evolved stars. However, this line does not provide information on the role of H2O at large spatial scales.
2. Other H2O lines have been detected from ground or airborne based telescopes, including the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition at 183 GHz, the 4@xmath13 - 3@xmath14 transition at 380 GHz, the 10@xmath15 - 9@xmath16 transition at 321 GHz, and the 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 transition at 325 GHz. The 1@xmath19 - 2@xmath20 transition of H2O at 547 GHz has also been observed.
3. The 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition at 183 GHz is the only line that has been used to map the emission of H2O at very large spatial scale. This map is 6 orders of magnitude larger than the size of the spots detected at 22 GHz and provides the first estimate of the H2O abundance for the different large scale components of the Orion molecular cloud.
4. The ISO satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared. Mapping of the SgrB2 molecular cloud has shown that water vapor is an ubiquitous molecule in molecular clouds with an abundance of 10@xmath7.
5. Maps of the emission of several H2O lines in Orion IRC2 have been obtained, and observations of the central position have been obtained by several groups. However, the ISO observations of H2O have drawbacks, including limited spectral resolution, high opacity of the thermal lines, and poor angular resolution in the far-infrared.
6. An important aid in deriving H2O abundances could come from the observation of another masing transition of H2O with similar properties to those of the 1",0
17,"1. Threshold nets are obtained by assigning weights to nodes and connecting nodes whose combined weights exceed a certain threshold. They can be produced with arbitrary degree distributions and encompass a wide variety of architectures.
2. Threshold graphs have a modular structure, where a subsequence of consecutive s gives rise to a -clique, and nodes in a subsequence of s connect to s thereafter, but not among one another. This modularity can be highlighted with a diagram of boxes.
3. Given the sequence of a threshold net, important structural benchmarks such as degree distribution, triangles, betweenness centrality, and the spectrum and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian can be computed using fast algorithms. This allows for the design of threshold nets with specific degree distributions and spectral properties.
4. The broader class of nets that can be constructed from a sequence by deterministic rules of connectivity on their own right is being studied. These sequence nets have desired attributes such as modularity, easily computable structural measures, and a high degree of compressibility.
5. Each additional letter to the alphabet allows for an increase of one link in the nets diameter, and sequence nets gain much latitude in the types of nets that can be described while retaining analytical appeal.
6. In a study of two-letter sequence nets, it was found that threshold nets are only one of three equivalence classes, characterized by the highest level of symmetry. The remaining two classes also have a high degree of modularity and various structural properties can be computed easily.
7. At least some of the 3-letter sequence nets can be mapped into threshold nets with two thresholds, instead of one. The structural properties of the new classes of two-letter sequence nets can be analyzed with ease, and an ordering in ensembles of sequence nets is introduced that is useful in visualizing and studying their various attributes.",1
18,"1. The text discusses the use of variable selection methods based on penalty theory in high-dimensional data analysis. A principled approach is the Lasso method, which uses the L1-norm penalty. The Lasso estimate can be viewed as the mode of the posterior distribution, and the L1 penalty can be transformed into the Laplace prior, which can be expressed as a Gaussian scale mixture. This has led to Bayesian developments of the Lasso and its variants.
2. The text also discusses nonconvex penalization under a parametric Bayesian framework. The local linear approximation (LLA) algorithm was derived by combining the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with an inverse Laplace transform. The LLA algorithm can obtain the nonconvex penalty with certain parameters by mixing the Laplace distribution with a stable density. Other authors have shown that the prior induced from a penalty, called the nonconvex log penalty, has an interpretation as a scale mixture of Laplace distributions with an inverse gamma mixing distribution.
3. The text also explores the application of compound poisson subordinators in constructing nonconvex penalty functions. A compound poisson process is a subordinator if and only if the random variables are nonnegative. The text particularly studies two families of nonnegative random variables: nonnegative continuous random variables and nonnegative discrete random variables. The gamma and poisson subordinators are limiting cases of the compound poisson subordinators. The text also discusses the use of subordinators in Bayesian nonconvex penalization problems under supervised learning scenarios, where latent shrinkage parameters are modeled using subordinators, which are defined as stochastic processes of regularization parameters.",1
19,"1. The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and the possibility of exotic gap symmetry with nodal behavior have led to a renewed effort to find novel experimental probes of order parameter symmetry. One proposal is to examine the nonlinear current response of d-wave superconductors, which can reveal a nonanalyticity in the current-velocity relation at a certain temperature due to the presence of nodes in the order parameter.
2. Early experimental work did not verify the predictions of anisotropy in the nonlinear current as a function of the direction of the superfluid velocity relative to the position of the node. However, a more recent reanalysis of experiment has claimed to confirm these predictions. An alternative proposal is to examine the quadratic term in the magnetic response of the penetration depth, which shows a temperature dependence at low temperatures and can provide a clear and unique signature of the nodes in the d-wave gap.
3. The goal is to compare in detail the differences between one-band and two-band s-wave superconductors in terms of their nonlinear response. A heightened interest in two-band superconductivity has led to claims of possible two-band effects in many other materials.
4. The authors use the complete microscopic theory with the parameters and the electron-phonon spectral functions taken from band structure to provide more detailed predictions for the nonlinear coefficient of MgB2.
5. The authors find new effects due to strong coupling at both high and low temperatures in the one-band s-wave case. They also examine the situation for two-band superconductors, starting from a case of highly decoupled bands and looking for signatures of the low energy scale due to the smaller gap, the effect of integration of the bands, and the response to inter- and intraband impurities.
6. The authors use the eliashberg equations to solve for the renormalized gaps and frequencies, which have been generalized to two bands and must also include the effect of the current through the superfluid velocity. They use the standard s-wave eliashberg equations for the renormalized gaps and frequencies, which have been generalized to two bands and must also include the effect of the current through the superfluid velocity.",1
20,"1. The 1-nearest neighbor (1-nn) with dynamic time warping (dtw) distance is a well-performing classifier for time series data, outperforming other approaches such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, and decision tree. The selection of an appropriate distance measure is crucial for 1-nn classification, with dtw distance being more appropriate than the commonly used Euclidean distance for time series data.
2. The paper proposes two novel learning algorithms, band boundary extraction and iterative learning, to address the overfitting problem in the original work of the ratanamahatana-keogh band (r-k band) learning algorithm. These algorithms aim to discover the best multi r-k bands for time series classification, where each band represents a class of data and can be adjusted as needed. The proposed classification algorithm uses 1-nn with dtw distance and multi r-k bands as a global constraint, with the best r-k band selected using the silhouette index as a heuristic function. The lb\_keogh lower bound is used in the data prediction step to speed up computation.",1
21,"1. The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles has been successful in describing nature at the electroweak scale, and the recent discovery of a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) strengthens its correctness.
2. However, there is an anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) that has been precisely measured and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions, with estimated discrepancies consistently more than expected.
3. Although it is too early to conclude that this anomaly is evidence of new physics beyond the SM, new particles and interactions related to the muon sector are expected if it is regarded as a hint of new physics.
4. The paper explores the possibility of a new gauge interaction for the muon beyond the SM.
5. The neutrino mass is determined by yukawa couplings, majorana masses, and yukawa couplings, with the mass terms between the left and right-handed neutrinos being diagonal, resulting in neutrino mixing obtained by mixing among the right-handed neutrinos.
6. The seesaw mechanism provides the observed order one neutrino mixing if the majorana masses are of the same order.
7. Interactions that break lepton symmetry and baryon asymmetry are discussed, with a condition calculated for the washout not to occur if the baryon asymmetry is generated above the electroweak scale.",1
22,"1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems is a unique property that plays an important role in quantum information processing.
2. The study of the essential features and dynamical behavior of entanglement under decoherence has attracted much attention due to its importance in quantum information processing.
3. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) has been observed in qubits under Markovian decoherence, where the entanglement is terminated in a finite time despite the coherence of single qubits being lost asymptotically.
4. Further studies have shown that ESD is not always the eventual fate of qubit entanglement. Entanglement can revive again after some time of ESD, and finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit due to the formation of a bound state between the qubit and its amplitude damping reservoir.
5. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD of qubits is always accompanied by the entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.
6. A similar situation occurs for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom for one of the two particles interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.
7. The entanglement does not go away but changes its location, as shown in a double Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model where the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions of the whole system.
8. A non-identity is satisfied at any time in the double J-C model, and it would be surprising if the identity is still valid in the presence of decoherence.
9. A system consisting of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs shows that the entanglement can be stably distributed among all the bipartite subsystems if the qubit and its reservoir can form a bound state and the non-Markovian effect is important.
10. The identity about the entanglement in the whole system can be satisfied at any time, revealing the profound physics of the entanglement dynamics under decoherence.",1
23,"1. The origin of celestial gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still an unresolved astrophysical phenomenon. These powerful flashes of gamma rays last from less than one second to tens of seconds and are observed to have isotropic distribution in the sky. They are observed above the Earth's atmosphere with X-gamma ray detectors aboard satellites. The BEPPOSAX satellite has discovered afterglow emission at lower wavelengths, and it is now known that at least long GRBs are at cosmological distances. The most likely candidates for the explanation of these events are the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) and the coalescence of one compact binary system. In both cases, emission of gravitational waves (GW) is expected to be associated with them.
2. The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, EXPLORER and NAUTILUS, and they have launched a program to study the presence of correlations between GRB events detected with BEPPOSAX and the output signals from gravitational antennas NAUTILUS and EXPLORER. The analysis uses an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors, thus coping with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts and also of the unmodelled noise. The agreement between the values of the simulated input signals and the values calculated using the model shows that the model is correct. The data is summarized by an observed average squared energy, at a certain standard deviation from the expected value in the case of noise alone. The probability density function of the GW amplitude is plotted, and the highest beliefs are for very small values, while values above a certain threshold are practically ruled out. From this, an expected value and standard deviation for the GW amplitude are obtained, which fully account for what is perceived as a null result. In these circumstances, an upper limit, defined as a value such that there is a given probability for the amplitude of GWs to be below it, can be provided.",1
24,"1. The process of discovering high-quality scientific publications is often facilitated through citation analysis, with the number of citations a paper receives serving as a rough measure of its scientific credibility. However, this method is not foolproof, as some publications may be overlooked or forgotten over time.
2. The citation distribution of scientific publications follows a power-law form, with highly cited papers being more likely to receive further citations in a preferential attachment process. This process has been studied through various network models, although these models tend to focus on the total number of citations without providing information about the issuing publications.
3. The proposed model in the text considers two research areas and referencing within and across each other, making it applicable to the web of human sexual contacts where interactions between males and females can be thought of as two coupled growing networks. The model is analyzed using a rate equation approach and visualized through a figure illustrating the growth mechanism.
4. The model allows for the analysis of the time evolution of network 1 and the application of the results to network 2. The time evolution of the joint distribution of intra-links and cross-links is described by a rate equation, which can be used to find all other distributions mentioned in the text. The model yields power-law distributions for the average number of nodes with a certain number of intra-links and cross-links, with exponents that depend on the initial attractiveness of nodes and the average total incoming links.",1
25,"1. Hadron production at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions is traditionally described in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron. The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
2. This production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for particle production at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions. Instead, recombination of partons is shown to be a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.
3. The purpose of the paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The subject matter is primarily of interest in high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons.
4. The recombination of shower partons is a new component in heavy-ion collisions, especially when semi-hard shower partons initiated by a hard parton recombine with soft partons in the environment. This process should be an important hadronization process in the intermediate transverse momentum region.
5. The main objective of the paper is to quantify the properties of shower partons and illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons. The actual application of the shower parton distributions developed in heavy-ion collisions will be considered elsewhere.
6. The concept of shower partons is not new, but previous attempts to generate such partons in pQCD processes cannot be easily related to shower partons and their hadronization due to the limitation of pQCD down to the hadronization scale.
7. The fragmentation of a parton to a hadron is not a process that can be calculated in pQCD, but the evolution of the fragmentation function is calculable. Fragmentation functions are usually parameterized by fitting data from e+e- annihilations, as well as from pp and p\bar{p} collisions.
8. Shower parton distributions can be determined phenomenologically in much the same way as fragmentation functions, except that they are fitted to the fragmentation functions themselves, rather than to data. The shower parton distributions are defined in the context of the recombination model, which provides a key link between shower partons (",1
26,"1. The text discusses a nonconvex semidefinite programming problem, where the objective function is convex but the constraint functions are nonconvex. The authors are interested in solving this problem using a sequence of inner positive semidefinite convex approximation sets.
2. The authors propose a new local optimization method based on the convex-concave decomposition of the bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints and linearization technique. This method is a generalization of the inner convex approximation method used in scalar optimization.
3. The proposed algorithm is modified by using a regularization technique to ensure strict descent. The advantages of this algorithm are that it is simple to implement and does not require a globalization strategy such as a line-search procedure.
4. The authors prove the convergence of the algorithm to a stationary point under mild conditions. They also provide two particular ways to form an overestimate for bilinear matrix-valued mappings and show many applications in static output feedback.
5. The paper includes an overview of matrix operators, definitions of inner positive semidefinite convex approximation of a nonconvex set, and the concept of a convex overestimate of a nonconvex function. The authors also provide examples of psd-convex overestimates of bilinear forms.",1
27,"1. Differential geometry has been valuable in extracting the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories, particularly in the Dirac-Khler formulation of fermionic field theory.
2. To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, which would ideally have the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit.
3. The Hodge star and wedge product between forms are challenging to define in a discretization, as they should allow the product rule to be satisfied and be local.
4. Several discrete schemes have been proposed, such as Becher and Joos' lattice-based approach, which introduced non-local operators, and Kanamori and Kawamoto's lattice-based approach with non-commutativity between fields and discrete forms.
5. Balachandran et al. used a quantized phase space to regularize their system, leading to a fuzzy coordinate space.
6. Adams proposed using two parallel lattices to maintain the locality of the Hodge star and capture the properties of the wedge product using a finite element scheme.
7. In lattice quantum chromodynamics (Lattice QCD) calculations, the staggered fermion formulation is commonly used to describe fermions, addressing the problem of fermion doubling and frequently used with the quarter-root trick to provide a description of a single fermion on the lattice.
8. The continuous Dirac-Khler formulation is regarded as providing the continuum limit for the staggered fermion formulation, and a discrete Dirac-Khler formulation with continuum properties can offer insight into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice.
9. The two lattices of Adams' proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Khler formulation, and the idea of using more than one lattice can be extended to describe an exact flavour projection.
10. This necessitates the introduction of two new structures of lattice and a new operator, and the path integral for this formulation is evaluated, considering the effects of chiral and flavour projection.",1
28,"1. The text discusses the use of cognitive radio networks and information-theoretic security to ensure secure wireless communication. Cognitive radio networks allow secondary users to transmit on the same frequency band as primary users, as long as the interference power at the primary receivers is kept below a certain limit. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions also makes these networks vulnerable to eavesdropping.
2. Information-theoretic security has been studied in the context of wiretap channel models, where the secrecy capacity is defined as the maximum achievable rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver that can be attained while keeping the eavesdropper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages. This concept has been extended to the Gaussian channel and more complex multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) channels.
3. The text then focuses on collaborative relay beamforming in cognitive radio networks, where a secondary user source tries to transmit confidential messages to a destination with the help of relay nodes, while keeping the interference on the primary user below a certain limit and keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the information. The authors formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a quasiconvex optimization problem, which can be solved through convex semidefinite programming (SDP). They also propose two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes to reduce computational complexity.
4. The authors assume a two-hop relay network, where the source transmits to relays in the first hop, and the relays forward the signal to the destination in the second hop. They consider two kinds of power constraints for relays: a total relay power constraint and individual power constraints for each relay node. The received signals at the destination and eavesdropper, and the interference on the primary user, are expressed in terms of the mutual information and channel fading coefficients. The optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the secrecy rate while satisfying the power constraints and interference limitation. The optimal beamforming solution can be obtained using semidefinite programming with a two-dimensional search for both total and individual power constraints.",1
29,"1. The text discusses the quantization of the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS), which are realized as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. The quantum field is constructed using the Gupta-Bleuler canonical quantization scheme, and the Wightman two-point functions are given. The price to pay for this simplicity and the maintenance of the conformal invariance during the whole quantization process is the introduction of two auxiliary fields.
2. The text explains how to obtain the conformally invariant Maxwell field in a CFS from a six-dimensional one-form using Dirac's six-cone formalism. A one-form is defined in the six-dimensional space, which is homogeneous of degree -1 and decomposes on the basis as the sum of five homogeneous components. The one-form is then decomposed on the basis corresponding to the system ([coord+muc]), with a slight but capital modification on the fifth component.
3. The text identifies the components of the two decompositions and obtains the relation between the fields through the equation ([eq-1]) and ([eq-2]). The fields are projected on the null cone, which yields the fields in the CFS and Minkowski space. The fields are auxiliary fields, and the field is, up to a condition, the Maxwell field.
4. The text applies the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to solve the dynamical equations, obtain the modes, determine the quantum field, the subspace of physical states and finally compute the two-point functions. The solutions of the Minkowskian system are obtained from [xcite] and read ([modes-a]), where αm are polarization vectors whose components are given by ([scalarps-a]).
5. The text shows how to get the Wightman two-point functions on CFS from their Minkowskian counterparts. The Wightman functions related to the Minkowskian fields are defined through ([wightman-a]), and their expressions are given in [xcite]. The Wightman two-point functions related to the field are given by ([maxwelds2ptdef]) and ([wightman-k]).

30,"1. The parallel chip-firing game is a chip-distributing process on graphs where vertices simultaneously distribute chips to their neighbors if they have enough chips to do so. The game has been shown to have deep connections to number theory, algebra, and combinatorics, and has been used to simulate various computational problems and physical phenomena.
2. The game has been studied on the complete bipartite graph, where it has been shown that the only possible periods for the game are of length 1, 2, or a divisor of the number of vertices in the graph. Additionally, positions on the complete bipartite graph with these periods have been constructed.
3. The game has also been studied on the complete k-partite graph, where a representation of a position with a desired period length has been constructed. It has been shown that this position has the desired period by analyzing the firing pattern of the vertices in the graph.
4. The study of the parallel chip-firing game has led to several conjectures and open problems, including the relationship between period lengths and the activity or lengths of subcycles of the graph. Additionally, the reduction of the game and the study of transient positions have been suggested as fruitful areas for further research.",1
31,"1. The observation and analysis of GRB 090510 have been made possible by the combined data from various satellites and telescopes, including AGILE, Fermi, Swift, VLT/FORS2, and the Nordic Optical Telescope. This has allowed for detailed temporal and spectral analyses of the event, extending from optical-UV to high energy (GEV) emission.
2. The broadband emission of GRB 090510 has been analyzed using the synchrotron/self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) and traditional afterglow models. The same methodology has been applied to other distinct types of sources, such as low and high energetic long GRBs and short GRBs.
3. GRBs can be classified into various categories and sub-classes, each characterized by specific progenitors and different astrophysical processes. The analysis of GRB 090510, considered a prototype for short GRBs (s-GRBs), reveals a new time-resolved spectral analysis that agrees with previous temporal and spectral analyses.
4. The analysis identifies a new structure in the thermal emission of the precursor GRB (p-GRB) emission, the onset of GEV emission linked to black hole (BH) formation, and the derivation of the circumburst medium structure from the spiky structure of the prompt emission.
5. The formation process of a BH is illustrated for the first time, which could potentially lead to a better understanding of jetted GEV emission in various systems harboring a Kerr BH, such as binary X-ray sources, microquasars, and active galactic nuclei.
6. The text also discusses the role of binary systems in the origin of long GRBs, which have been traditionally interpreted as single events in the jetted collapsar fireball model. However, recent discoveries suggest that binary sources play a crucial role in the long GRB-SN connection.
7. The induced gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm explains the GRB-SN connection in terms of interactions between an evolved carbon-oxygen core undergoing a SN explosion and its hypercritical accretion on a binary neutron star (NS) companion.

32,"1. Precision measurements at LEP, SLD, and the Tevatron have been used to limit models with physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) by performing global fits to a series of precision measurements. This allows for the inference of information about the parameters of new models. A simple example of this approach is the prediction of the SM Higgs boson mass, which is strongly correlated with the experimentally measured value of the top quark mass and increases quadratically as the top quark mass is increased.
2. In models with Higgs particles in representations other than SM doublets and singlets, there are more parameters in the gauge/Higgs sector than in the SM. When the theory is renormalized at one loop, these models will require extra input parameters.
3. The possibility of a heavy Higgs boson consistent with precision electroweak data has been considered in the context of oblique corrections. A large contribution to isospin violation can offset the contribution of a heavy Higgs boson to electroweak observables such as the W boson mass.
4. The renormalization of the SM has been extensively studied, and the SM satisfies the relation MW^2/MZ^2 = c\_theta^2 at tree level. However, in the SM, the weak mixing angle, c\_theta, is not a free parameter, but is derived from g, g', and v.
5. The counterterms of the SM are given by eq. ([drdef]), and the contribution to the W boson mass, MW, is given by eq. ([drsm]). The dominant contributions to MW are from the top quark, and the contributions of the top and bottom quarks to the gauge boson self-energies are given in [loop].
6. The triplet model (TM) is a model with an additional Higgs boson transforming as a real triplet under the SM gauge symmetry. The TM has been considered at one loop, and the dependence of the scalar masses in this model has been derived. The triplet is non-decoupling, meaning that the dependence on scalar masses does not disappear even as the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale. This is in contrast to the SM, where the dependence on scalar masses disappears at high scales.",1
33,"1. A log-Riemann surface is a pair (S, f) where S is a Riemann surface and f is a local holomorphic diffeomorphism. The set of points added to S in the completion with respect to the path metric induced by the flat metric is discrete.
2. A log-Riemann surface of finite type is a branched covering of a punctured compact Riemann surface given by certain transcendental functions of infinite degree. It has finitely many ramification points and finitely generated fundamental group.
3. An exp-algebraic curve is a compact Riemann surface together with equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions modulo germs of holomorphic functions, with poles of orders at points.
4. The uniformization theorems of [xcite, xcite] give germs of meromorphic functions at the punctures with poles of orders say, such that near a puncture, the map f is of the form g(z)dz, where g is a germ of meromorphic function near z and dz is a local coordinate near z.
5. The punctures correspond to ends of the log-Riemann surface, where infinite order ramification points are added in the metric completion. These infinite order ramification points correspond to the directions of approach to the puncture along which the function decays exponentially and converges.
6. In [xcite], certain spaces of functions and ω-forms on a log-Riemann surface of finite type were defined, giving rise to a de Rham cohomology group. The integrals of the ω-forms considered along curves in the Riemann surface joining the infinite ramification points converge, giving rise to a pairing between H^1(S, ωS) and H1(S, Z), which was shown to be nondegenerate.
7. The relevant spaces of functions and ω-forms with exponential singularities at p of types h1, ..., hn can be defined as the spaces of meromorphic functions and ω-forms with exponential singularities of types h1, ..., hn at p.
8. In [xcite], it is shown how to naturally associate to an exp-algebraic curve a degree zero line bundle together with a meromorphic connection with poles at p. The connection ω-form of L near p is",0
34,"1. Recent progress has been made in understanding the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems through the development of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and its merging with local density approximation (LDA) based electronic structure calculations.
2. The goal is to create self-consistent electronic structure algorithms that can explore all space of parameters where dopings or degeneracy is not fixed, as different states may appear near the Fermi level during iterations towards self-consistency.
3. Realistic DMFT simulations of material properties require fast scans of the entire parameter space to determine the interaction for a given doping, degeneracy, and bandwidth via the solution of the general multiorbital Anderson impurity model (AIM).
4. Present approaches based on non-crossing approximation (NCA) or iterative perturbation theory (IPT) are unable to provide the solution to this problem due to a limited number of regimes where these methods can be applied.
5. The quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique in DMFT is accurate but has limitations in terms of its applicability to multiorbital situations and unphysically large temperatures due to its computational cost.
6. An interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation is proposed, but it is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem.
7. The interpolative procedure is based on the ideology of LDA theory, where approximations were designed by analytical fits to QMC simulations for homogeneous electron gas.
8. The interpolative method is found to be in good agreement with numerically more accurate QMC calculations, and can be extended for increased accuracy by imposing more constraints and implementing more refined impurity solvers.",1
35,"1. The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in complex systems is a growing area of interest, with applications in areas such as contact process, domain growth, catalysis, phase separation, and transport phenomena. While there is no general theory for nonequilibrium model systems, progress has been made in understanding the stationary states of these systems using approximate analytical methods and simulations. The Ziff-Gulari-Barshad (ZGB) surface reaction model, which describes some kinetic aspects of the oxidation of CO over a catalytic surface, has been the focus of recent research. In this paper, the authors consider a modified version of the ZGB model that incorporates a random distribution of inert sites on the catalytic surface.
2. The original ZGB model is an irreversible lattice model for surface reactions based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which reactants must be adsorbed before reacting. The model is a lattice Markov process in which molecules of CO and O2 from a gaseous phase can be adsorbed onto the sites of a regular square lattice of identical sites. The dynamics of the model are determined by the arrival probability of a CO molecule, and the lattice is described by a set of time evolution equations for the concentrations of CO, O, and blank sites. The steady-state solutions of these equations correspond to a poisoned surface or a reactive steady state with a nonzero number of vacant sites present in the lattice.
3. The authors are interested in the effects of inert sites on the phase transitions of the ZGB model. They have investigated the dependence of the phase transitions on the concentration of inert sites and found that the first-order transition changes to a continuous one at a critical value of the concentration. This behavior is similar to that observed in the automobile industry, where lead particles are deposited over the catalyst during the exhaust of gases after combustion, affecting the efficiency of the catalytic surface. The authors have also performed mean-field and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the phase diagram and hysteresis curves for different concentrations of inert sites.",1
36,"1. The text discusses the hydrodynamic limit for interacting particle systems in the crystal lattice, which is a generalization of classical lattices such as the square lattice, triangular lattice, and hexagonal lattice. The authors extend the study of hydrodynamic limits to these more complex lattices and discuss the relationship between the macroscopic behavior of particles and the geometric structures of the underlying spaces.
2. The authors introduce the concept of a crystal lattice as an infinite graph with a free action of a free abelian group and a finite quotient graph. They construct a scaling limit of a crystal lattice by taking a quotient of the lattice by a finite index subgroup of the free abelian group. They then consider exclusion processes on the crystal lattice and embed the lattice into a torus using a harmonic map in the discrete sense.
3. The authors focus on the simplest case of exclusion processes, the symmetric simple exclusion process and its perturbation, the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process. They show that the diffusion coefficient matrices and nonlinear drift terms in the limit of the process of empirical density can be computed using data from a finite quotient graph and a harmonic map.
4. The proof of the local ergodic theorem, which is a key step in the proof of the hydrodynamic limit, is based on the one-block estimate and the two-blocks estimate. These estimates are interpreted as the local law of large numbers and the asymptotic independence of two different local laws of large numbers, respectively.
5. The authors also discuss related works on interacting particle systems, including the gradient system and the non-gradient system, and mention recent work on the non-gradient system by Sasada. They also mention the problem of interacting particle systems evolving in random environments and the use of harmonic maps and local function bundles in the systematic treatment of particle systems in more general random graphs.",1
37,"1. Harmonic maps are extrema of the energy functional and have a vanishing trace of the second fundamental form. They are defined as smooth maps between Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds that minimize the energy functional.
2. The tension field of a harmonic map is the section defined by the trace of the second fundamental form and vanishes if and only if the map is harmonic.
3. The Hessian of a harmonic map is a symmetric bilinear form that measures the second order change in the energy functional. The index of a harmonic map is the dimension of the tangent subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite.
4. A harmonic map is said to be stable if its Morse index (the dimension of the largest subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite) is zero, and unstable otherwise.
5. An almost product structure is a tensor field of type (1,1) that satisfies certain conditions, and an almost para-complex manifold is an almost product manifold whose eigenbundles associated with the eigenvalues of the tensor field have the same rank.
6. An almost para-hermitian manifold is a smooth manifold endowed with an almost para-complex structure and a pseudo-Riemannian metric that is compatible with the structure. The fundamental 2-form and co-differential of an almost para-hermitian manifold are defined in terms of the metric and the almost para-complex structure.
7. A para-Kähler manifold is an almost para-hermitian manifold that satisfies certain conditions. An almost paracontact structure is a triplet (φ, ξ, η) that satisfies certain conditions, and an almost paracontact manifold is a smooth manifold equipped with an almost paracontact structure.

38,"1. The text discusses the use of ultra-hard X-ray observations to select a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) for a study of their far-infrared (FIR) properties. The selection of AGN using ultra-hard X-rays provides a direct view of the AGN, as these high-energy photons can easily pass through gas or dust in the line of sight. This is in contrast to optical or mid-infrared selection, which can be contaminated by the host galaxy.
2. The study uses data from the Herschel Space Observatory's Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) to analyze the FIR emission from the AGN sample. The authors find that the FIR emission is not strongly contaminated by AGN-related emission, as evidenced by the small values of the correlation coefficients between the SPIRE wavebands and the bat luminosity. However, they do find a weak correlation between the 250 and 350 μm luminosity and ultra-hard X-ray luminosity for Sy 1 AGN only.
3. The authors also investigate the FIR colors (i.e. flux ratios) of the AGN sample and compare them to the colors of a sample of galaxies from the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS). They find that the FIR colors of the AGN sample are statistically similar to the colors of high stellar mass (M\* > 10^10.5 M\_sun) HRS galaxies, further emphasizing that the FIR emission of AGN host galaxies is likely produced by cold dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) heated by stellar radiation. However, they do find anomalous colors for 6 AGN, which have FIR seds dominated by synchrotron emission from a radio jet rather than thermally heated dust.",1

2. A Zariski pair is a pair of plane curves with the same combinatorics but non-homeomorphic complements. Finding new finite non-abelian groups that serve as fundamental groups of complements of plane curves and searching for more examples of Zariski pairs are important applications of fundamental group computations.
3. Fan proved some results concerning the projective fundamental group of complex line arrangements and conjectured that the inverse implication of his results is also correct. Recently, Eliyahu, Liberman, Schaps, and Teicher proved Fan's conjecture completely.
4. A conjugation-free geometric presentation of a line arrangement's fundamental group is a presentation with generators as meridians of lines at a far side of the arrangement and relations of a specific type. Fan's result implies that if the graph associated with the arrangement is acyclic, then the corresponding fundamental group has a conjugation-free geometric presentation.
5. The paper aims to study which line arrangements have a fundamental group with a conjugation-free geometric presentation. The importance of this family of arrangements is that the incidence lattice determines the fundamental group of the complement without any computation.
6. The paper presents the computation of the fundamental group of the complement of real line arrangements using the Moishezon-Teicher method and the van Kampen theorem. It also discusses the relation between the families of nice, simple, and arrangements with conjugation-free geometric presentations.",1

It mentions the success of continuous symmetries like gauge symmetry and discrete symmetries like exchange symmetry in describing the mass and mixing pattern in the leptonic sector. A new symmetry called @xmath1 symmetry was introduced to avoid mass degeneracy under @xmath15 symmetry. This symmetry has been extensively studied and has been used to fit the tri-bi maximal mixing pattern in an extension of the standard model through the inclusion of @xmath1 discrete symmetry.
2. The text also discusses the possibility of generating non-zero and complex @xmath0 in the leptonic sector, which could lead to the exploration of CP violation in future short and long baseline experiments. This can be generated through radiative correction or the introduction of higher dimensional mass terms in the model.
3. The text also discusses the generation of non-zero complex @xmath0 and the possibility of non-zero CP violation in the proposed model of Altarelli-Feruglio with explicit soft breaking of @xmath1 symmetry. It also mentions that the tri-bi maximal mixing pattern can be generated naturally in the framework of see-saw mechanism with @xmath23 symmetry. However, the exact tri-bi maximal pattern forbids CP violation in the leptonic sector at low energy. The textures of mass matrices in the model could not generate lepton asymmetry. The authors investigate the generation of non-zero @xmath0 through see-saw mechanism by considering a small perturbation in @xmath2, the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, keeping the same texture of the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix as proposed in ref.@xcite. They study the detailed phenomenology of neutrino mass and mixing including CP violation at low energy, neutrinoless double beta decay and leptogenesis.",1
42,"1. Organic molecular crystals, which are composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces, are emerging as excellent candidates for fabricating nanoscale devices. These crystals have potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics, including solar energy harvesting, surface photochemistry, organic electronics, and spintronics. A common feature of these devices is that they are composed of both an organic and inorganic component, with the organic component forming the active part of the device and the inorganic component providing the necessary electrical contact to external circuitry.
2. The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance. It is important to determine how charge transfers between the organic and inorganic component and the energies at which the transfer takes place. This is a challenging task, especially in the single-molecule limit.
3. Upon adsorption on a substrate, the electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change value from that of their gas phase counterparts. This is due to the formation of an image charge on the substrate in the vicinity of the molecule, which alters the addition or removal energy of charge carriers from the molecule.
4. A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle (qp) description. Within the qp picture, one ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons and consequently takes the relative alignment of the metal Fermi level with either the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a molecule as removal energy.
5. The adequacy of the qp description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO. If the theory of choice is density functional theory (DFT), then it is important to note that except for the energy of the HOMO, which can be rigorously interpreted as the negative of the ionization potential, the Kohn-Sham orbitals cannot be associated with qp energies. This is commonly done in practice, but the Kohn-Sham qp levels may not provide a good approximation to the true removal energies, particularly for molecules.",1
43,"1. The text discusses the interaction between many particles and how it can be described using pair potentials or forces between a single pair. This approach is accurate when the governing physical equations are linear, but if nonlinearities are present, nonadditivity gives rise to many-body effects.
2. Many-body effects can lead to changes in the total force acting on a particle, including strengthening or weakening of the force, a change in the direction of the force, or the appearance of stable or unstable configurations.
3. These effects are present in a variety of systems, including nuclear matter, superconductivity, colloidal suspensions, quantum-electrodynamic Casimir forces, polymers, nematic colloids, and noble gases.
4. Integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with small scales generates effective interactions among the large particles, which are not pairwise additive. These effective interactions can lead to collective behavior of the large particles, which can be described more easily if it is governed by pair potentials.
5. The text assesses the influence of many-body effects on critical Casimir forces (CCFs), which arise due to the confinement of the order parameter fluctuations in a critical fluid.
6. The authors study the normal and lateral CCFs acting on two colloidal particles immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture and close to a homogeneous, planar substrate.
7. They consider two three-dimensional spheres with different boundary conditions facing a homogeneous substrate at different sphere-surface-to-substrate distances.
8. The authors use field-theoretic mean field theory to calculate the forces between individual pairs and three-body forces on the same footing, and they find that these forces are characterized by universal scaling functions.",1
44,"1. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecule in the universe and plays a crucial role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM). Its formation is governed by the transformation of atomic diffuse clouds into molecular clouds.
2. Dust grains are the primary site for H2 formation in the ISM. The sticking of H atoms onto dust grains is an essential mechanism for H2 formation and cooling interstellar gas.
3. PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are significant dust grains in the ISM, and they have characteristics similar to graphite surfaces. The hydrogenation of PAHs is an important route to form H2 in the ISM.
4. The first hydrogenation of neutral coronene, a type of PAH, is associated with a barrier, but subsequent hydrogenation barriers vanish. Coronene films exposed to H/D atoms at high temperature confirmed the high H2 formation rate attributed to PAHs in photodissociation regions (PDRs).
5. PAH cations, which are usually present at lower extinction, also represent an important route to form H2. The addition of the first H atom is predicted to be barrierless, and a second H atom can react with the already adsorbed H to form H2 without a barrier.
6. In a pilot experiment, the hydrogenation of coronene cations in the gas phase was studied through exposure to hydrogen atoms. The results showed that odd hydrogenation states of coronene cations predominantly populate the mass spectrum.
7. The further hydrogenation of PAH cations is associated with a barrier if the number of already attached H atoms is odd and no barrier if this number is even. This alternating barrier-no barrier occurrence suggests that PAH cations can also enjoy highly hydrogenated states in the ISM and act as catalysts for H2 formation.
8. The experiments have been performed using a home-built tandem-mass spectrometer. The coronene ions are exposed to a constant flux of H atoms for different periods of time before their degree of hydrogenation is determined by means of mass spectrometry.
9. The data obtained from the experiment are a series of mass spectra of hydrogenated coronene cations as a function of H exposure time. The results show that the most",1
45,"1. Atomic clocks, which measure time using the vibrations of atoms, have two main components: the atom or atoms used as the reference, and an active oscillator that is tuned using feedback based on measurements of the atom. The resonance frequency of the atom can vary based on factors such as the intensity of radiation from the oscillator, so a wave function is used to define the resonance frequency at absolute zero temperature. Computer-mediated feedback is used to adjust the oscillator based on measurements of the atom.
2. The use of atomic clocks and the concept of logical synchronization, which is the alignment of clock readings at the transmission and reception of signals, are important in digital communications and the study of spacetime curvature. The phase of a clock's cycle at which it receives a signal must be within a certain range for a logical symbol to be properly transmitted and written to memory.
3. The physics of signal propagation can impose constraints on channels, which are sets of pairs of clock readings at which a signal can be transmitted and received. These constraints can be used to steer the behavior of clocks in a network.
4. The behavior of open machines, which are systems that can receive and transmit signals, can be affected by clock adjustments and the relationship between the machine's clock and a proper clock. The echo count, which is the number of times a signal is transmitted and received between two machines, can be used to explain evidence in the form of an echo as being twice the radar distance between the machines.",1
46,"1. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is a low-power and low-data rate protocol designed for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) and wireless body area networks (WBANs). It operates in three different frequency ranges and uses carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) for channel access. The standard supports two types of topologies (star and peer-to-peer) and two modes of operation (beacon-enabled and non-beacon enabled).
2. The CSMA/CA mechanism used in IEEE 802.15.4 can result in packet loss due to collisions. The probability of a successful transmission by an end device is modeled as a function of the number of end devices, the backoff exponent, the probability of transmission success at a slot, and the probability of end device successfully allocated a wireless channel. The time delay caused by CSMA/CA backoff exponent is estimated as a probability of time delay event, which is obtained as the summation of the probabilities of time delay events for different backoff periods.",1
47,"1. MOPPED is a patented algorithm for data compression and speeding up the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis. It is useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the model's parameters, but it has limitations, particularly with multimodal and degenerate distributions.
2. The authors demonstrate MOPPED's application in galaxy spectra analysis and CMB power spectrum estimation. They also address the issue of ""badly"" behaved likelihoods in light transit analysis with a proposed solution.
3. The paper presents scenarios where MOPPED accurately and inaccurately represents the likelihood function. MOPPED's compression of data and faster likelihood evaluation provide significant runtime improvement when it accurately represents the likelihood function.
4. The authors discuss the criteria for MOPPED to accurately represent the likelihood function and provide an implementation of the solution for ""badly"" behaved likelihoods.
5. Limitations of the MOPPED algorithm are demonstrated through test cases from gravitational wave data analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The short duration of a sine-gaussian burst signal allows for a static approximation, revealing issues with MOPPED in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional parameter estimation.",1
48,"1. The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is a major puzzle in particle physics, and consists of several pieces. These pieces include the fact that the vacuum energy density can be the cosmological constant, and various sources of vacuum energy density exist, such as the zero point energy of each particle and potential energies accompanied with phase transitions. However, these vacuum energy densities can receive large radiative corrections including a cutoff scale. The experimental value of the cosmological constant is estimated to be much smaller than these theoretical values, which is known as the cosmological constant problem.
2. The pieces of the puzzle do not fit into the framework of Einstein gravity and the Standard Model of particle physics. In order to address this problem, the authors suggest an effective description of various experimental results concerning the vacuum energy. They propose that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy, under the assumption that the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively.
3. The vacuum energy density can have various sources, such as the zero point energy of each particle, the energy density from the Higgs potential, and the energy density accompanied with the chiral symmetry breaking due to quark condensations. The zero point energy density is calculated by using an effective potential at the one-loop level, and it contains quartic, quadratic, and logarithmic terms concerning an ultra-violet (UV) cutoff parameter. After the subtraction of logarithmic divergence, the zero point energy is given by the renormalization point. The zero point energy of the Higgs boson is estimated to be much larger than the experimental value of the cosmological constant, and its existence threatens the stability of our solar system. Therefore, it seems natural to suppose that the classical gravitational field does not feel a large portion of the vacuum energy.",1
49,"1. Spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkali metals have been aided by the precision of experimental techniques and the straightforward interpretation of results due to their hydrogen-like structure.
2. Recent precise measurements in higher excited states accessible through two-step transitions have renewed interest in improving calculations in other states where theoretical methods such as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) are yet to be tested.
3. Precise measurements in excited states beyond the first one have experimental complications, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and non-availability of detectors at desired frequencies.
4. The paper presents two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studies of atomic properties of higher excited states, which uses two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapor.
5. The method monitors the absorption of the pump laser as a function of probe laser detuning, generating sub-Doppler peaks and sidebands that overcome the issues of low signal-to-noise ratio and non-availability of detectors.
6. The authors illustrate the technique using two ladder systems in rubidium, with different applications of amplitude and frequency modulation.
7. The theoretical model uses a density matrix formalism to describe a three-level atom in ladder configuration interacting with two lasers, modeled as Doppler-free and ignoring Zeeman sublevels for simplicity.
8. The system is solved using a Floquet basis expansion of the density matrix, resulting in a series of coupled equations that are solved recursively to extract the absorption of the first laser carrier and sidebands.
9. The three-level model reproduces the resonance features of absorption observed in experiments, and the method can be extended to other atomic levels.",1
50,"1. The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has been a topic of interest, particularly for the central exclusive production (CEP) process where protons remain intact and are separated from the central system by a large rapidity gap. Observation of any particle in the CEP channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers and allow for mass measurement regardless of decay products.
2. Proposals have been made to install forward proton detectors at the LHC, such as the FP420 collaboration's plan to install detectors 420 meters from the interaction points, allowing detection of central systems with masses in the approximate range of 70 to 170 GeV. Additional proposals aim to upgrade the capabilities of ATLAS and CMS to detect protons in the 220 m region.
3. The paper focuses on the CEP of the Standard Model (SM) and supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs bosons with a mass of 120 GeV. The dominant decay channel for this mass region is H→b\bar{b}, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches due to the large QCD background. However, the CEP process suppresses the leading order background for this decay channel, making it observable in certain scenarios with appropriate proton tagging detectors.
4. The acceptance of the forward detectors is critical for this analysis, as it determines the smallest measurable energy loss of the outgoing protons and imposes an upper limit on the measurable momentum loss of the protons. The distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam and the aperture of the LHC beam elements between the interaction point and the forward detectors affect the acceptance.
5. The proposed forward detectors aim to associate particular protons with the Higgs candidate event by measuring the outgoing proton time-of-flight (TOF) from the interaction vertex to the detectors. The difference in arrival times of the protons on opposite sides of the central detector allows for a vertex measurement, which can then be matched with the vertex of a candidate Higgs event reconstructed using the central detector alone.",1
51,"1. The text discusses the zero-field hall effect in chiral p-wave superconductors (SCs), which arises due to broken time-reversal symmetry, leading to a nonzero hall conductivity. This effect can be explained by the intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs, spontaneous surface current, impurity effect, or multiband SC structure. The authors propose a new mechanism for this effect based on vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition in two-dimensional superfluid or SC films.
2. The authors describe the vortex-antivortex bound pair dynamics in a 2D p-wave pairing state with a vector order parameter, which gives rise to two types of integer vortices with different hall and vinen coefficients. This results in a convective term in the vortex pair polarization Fokker-Planck equation, leading to a nonzero vortex-dynamics-induced hall conductivity. The authors derive the response functions for bound pair dynamics and free vortex contribution, and investigate the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor.
3. The authors also discuss the contribution of free vortex motion and the resulting total conductivity tensor. They present the paper organization and provide analytic expressions for certain quantities in the opposite limit of the convective ratio. The text assumes a neutral SF film system with film thickness of order the superconducting coherence length and linear dimension along the x and y directions. The vortex core motion relative to the local superfluid velocity leads to a Magnus force, and the SF film is driven by a vibrating substrate. The driving force on the vortex due to a transport current is a Lorentz force, which is balanced by the force from the environment. The polarization of a test vortex-antivortex pair is under the influence of an infinitesimal oscillating external field, and the langevin equation for their relative coordinate is obtained. The potential energy is given by the logarithmic interaction screened by the Kosterlitz dielectric constant, and the convective pair motion is one of the special features for a system with unequal opposite vortices.",1
52,"1. The measurement of rotation curves (RCs) of disk galaxies is used to investigate the nature of dark matter (DM), including its content relative to baryonic components and their distributions. Dwarf galaxies are good candidates for this aim as their kinematics are generally dominated by the dark component, even at small galactocentric radii.
2. Recent studies of the RCs of dwarf galaxies have tested the NFW profile arising from pure N-body DM simulations and found that kinematic data are better fitted by a DM halo with a constant density core than by one that is centrally peaked.
3. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a nearby system with an extended disk, providing an important test of the DM paradigm. Its kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored profile, making it critically important for investigating the nature of the DM particle and the evolution of DM halos.
4. The Orion dwarf galaxy is an attractive candidate to determine the underlying gravitational potential of the galaxy. Its distance is estimated to be 5.4±1.0 Mpc, but the intrinsic uncertainty in this technique may allow for a larger distance ambiguity.
5. The Orion dwarf galaxy shows a large mass discrepancy at all radii, and the baryonic components are efficiently modeled. Spectral line imaging data show rich morphological and kinematic structure in the neutral gas disk.
6. The total gas mass is estimated to be (4.7±0.4)×10^7 M⊙, and the gas surface density profile is well fitted by an exponential thin disk with a scale length of 1.33 kpc.
7. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a decisive benchmark for the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) formalism and a promising target for further detailed studies, particularly a direct measurement of the distance.",1
53,"1. The trihydrogen dication, consisting of three protons and one electron, has been studied extensively in the 1960s and 1970s. Its stability has been investigated through various theoretical and experimental methods.
2. Conroy, in a series of articles, studied the potential energy surfaces of the electronic ground state and the lowest excited states at linear and isosceles triangular configurations using a variational approach. The results suggest that the trihydrogen dication is not stable.
3. Schwartz and Schaad, as well as Somorjai and Yue, reported single-point calculations of the system at the supposed equilibrium equilateral triangular configuration, but did not address the stability problem.
4. Berkowitz and Stocker searched for the ion through charge stripping experiments and could not find evidence of a stable trihydrogen dication.
5. Later, the question of the existence of the trihydrogen dication was reconsidered theoretically by Shoucri and Darling, who examined equilateral configurations with the variational linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method, and by Hernndes and Carb, who studied two particular configurations with a more compact variational approach. No bound state was determined in these calculations.
6. Ackermann et al. revisited the question about the existence of the trihydrogen dication using the finite element method, which provided much higher accuracy than previously achieved. They treated the stability problem by keeping the nuclear charge as a continuous parameter and obtained critical values of the charges for the existence of stable or metastable equilateral triangular configurations.
7. The present study aims to address the question of the existence of the trihydrogen dication in an equilateral triangular configuration as a metastable state in a magnetic field. The study uses two methods, specialized variational with physically relevant trial functions and standard variational based on standard Gaussian trial functions, to explore the system and obtain highly accurate quantitative results for the total energy versus the size of the triangle.",1
54,"1. Recent investigations of the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have revealed a complex relationship between the properties of galaxies (such as color, luminosity, surface brightness, and concentration) and their environments. Galaxy clustering is found to be a function of both star formation history and luminosity.
2. Color and luminosity measures of star formation history appear to have a more fundamental relationship with environment than do surface brightness and concentration measures. Some studies have explored the scale dependence of these relationships, but it is important to examine whether the density on large scales is related to galaxy properties independent of the relationships with density on small scales.
3. The SDSS is taking CCD imaging of the northern galactic sky and selecting targets for spectroscopy, most of them galaxies. Automated software performs all of the data processing, including astrometry, source identification, deblending and photometry, photometricity determination, calibration, spectroscopic target selection, spectroscopic fiber placement, and spectroscopic data reduction.
4. For the purposes of computing large-scale structure and galaxy property statistics, a subsample of SDSS galaxies known as the NYU Value Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC) has been assembled. The low redshift catalog of this catalog, which corresponds to the SDSS Data Release 2 (DR2), has been used in this study. This catalog has important features for the study of low luminosity galaxies, including visual inspection of all of the images and spectra of low luminosity or low redshift galaxies, trimming of incorrectly deblended objects, and estimation of distances to low redshift objects using the local velocity field.
5. To evaluate the environments of galaxies in the sample, the number of other galaxies outside a projected radius of 10 kpc and within a certain outer radius and redshift direction is counted for each given galaxy. The mean expected number of galaxies in that volume is then calculated, and the density around galaxies in various classes is calculated as the density with respect to the mean. The sample is volume-limited for galaxies with a certain luminosity, and the total completeness-weighted effective area of the sample is 2220.9 square degrees. The catalog contains 28,089 galaxies.",1
55,"1. Transverse spin fluctuations are important low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, and play a crucial role in various macroscopic properties such as long-range order, order parameter magnitude, Néel temperature, and spin correlations.
2. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in two dimensions and the Néel temperature in three dimensions.
3. Recent interest has focused on spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in quantum antiferromagnets. In the random-t model, where the interaction is set to zero on a fraction of sites, the lattice-averaged AF order parameter is enhanced for small fractions due to suppressed quantum spin fluctuations. However, strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies enhances spin fluctuations, leading to essentially empty and doubly-occupied sites acting as spin vacancies.
4. A new method has been developed to evaluate transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state, in terms of magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA). This method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is demonstrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model.
5. The RPA approach has been shown to properly interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity and to yield identical results as the spin-wave theory approach in the strong coupling limit for the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
6. The quantum spin-fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization is obtained solely in terms of transverse spin correlations, parallel to the spin-wave theory approach, and differs from the method involving self-energy corrections.
7. The method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral in order to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators, and is illustrated for transverse spin correlations. The time-ordered, transverse spin propagator is written in frequency space as a sum of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix constructed from the zeroth-order, antiparallel-spin particle-hole propagator, evaluated in the self-consistent, broken-",1
56,"1. The study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory, particularly in cosmology, has gained significant attention due to its role in explaining the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe, as well as the small-scale inhomogeneity and anisotropy. The dynamics of multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation, have been of particular interest. These models can lead to various features unavailable in single-field models, such as hybrid inflation models. The subsequent phase of energy transfer between the inflaton and other degrees of freedom has also been extensively studied, with the inflaton decaying through perturbative and non-perturbative processes.
2. The renormalization of time evolution equations in single-field models has been understood for several years, with methods such as the WKB expansion and adiabatic methods being used to extract divergences and renormalize the theory. However, multi-field models and the dynamics of reheating typically require the inclusion of quantum effects beyond the tree level, which brings in the issue of renormalization. The paper proposes a slightly different method to extract the divergences of the theory, allowing for dimensional regularization and the use of the closed time path formalism to follow the time-dependent evolution of the system.
3. The paper demonstrates the formalism with two examples: a simple reheating model and a hybrid inflation model motivated by supersymmetry. The authors investigate the narrow resonance regime and the broad resonance regime in the reheating model, emphasizing the importance of mixing effects between the fields, which were often neglected in previous models. In the supersymmetric hybrid model, the authors show that taking into account fluctuations and investigating the full mixed system can lead to the loss of some of the model's attractiveness compared to general hybrid models due to different effective mass corrections for the two fields.",1
57,"1. The existence of dark matter (DM) has been established and its thermal relic abundance has been determined by the WMAP experiment. A promising candidate for DM is the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), which can be accommodated in models beyond the Standard Model by introducing an inert scalar field. The stability of the DM candidate is ensured by an imposed Z2 parity.
2. Neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses, which may indicate that they are of Majorana type. Many models have been proposed to explain tiny neutrino masses, with the seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) being the simplest ways. However, these scenarios do not contain a DM candidate. In some models where tiny neutrino masses are generated by higher orders of perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained.
3. In the HTM, Majorana masses for neutrinos are generated via the Yukawa interaction with a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) of an SU(2) triplet scalar field with hypercharge 1. The vev of the triplet field is described by vt = √2 μvt/mT, where μvt is the VEV of the Higgs doublet field and mT is the typical mass scale of the triplet field. The direct information on the neutrino mass matrix would be extracted from the decay of the doubly charged component of the triplet field, which can be produced via vector boson fusion at hadron colliders. The searches for the doubly charged Higgs at the LHC put a lower bound on its mass of 870 GeV, assuming that the main decay mode is into a pair of same-sign W bosons.",1
58,"1. Quantum communication technologies, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), promise to fundamentally change the way we communicate by allowing intrinsically secure communication. However, these new technologies require a new telecommunications infrastructure that can properly accommodate the quantum properties they rely on. This infrastructure will contain novel components, such as quantum memories, quantum repeaters, or quantum channels, which must all operate in a strictly quantum way.
2. Quantifying the quantum behavior of these devices is important for characterizing their suitability for quantum communication tasks. This can be done by measuring the quantum correlations in bipartite systems before and after they pass through a quantum channel. A strong quantum channel is one that preserves all or nearly all of the quantum correlations.

59,"1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided valuable information on subatomic physics, including the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the renormalizable theory of QED.
2. A charged particle with spin has a magnetic moment, given by the gyromagnetic ratio and the anomaly. The Dirac equation predicts that for spin-1/2 point-like particles, the gyromagnetic ratio is 2 and the anomaly is zero.
3. Radiative corrections, such as those shown in Figure 1, give rise to the anomaly for point particles. The lowest-order correction is the Schwinger result, which was verified experimentally.
4. The magnetic and electric dipole moments can be represented as the real and imaginary parts of a generalized dipole operator, and the interaction Lagrangian is given by equation (ef{eq : lint}).
5. The electron anomaly is now measured to a precision of about four parts in a billion, and the measured value is used to give the best determination of the fine-structure constant. The muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million and has an increased sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections.
6. The standard model value of the muon anomaly has measurable contributions from QED loops containing leptons and photons, hadronic loops containing hadrons in vacuum polarization loops, and weak loops involving the W and Z weak gauge bosons.
7. A significant difference between the experimental value and the standard model prediction would signify the presence of new physics, such as lepton substructure, anomalous couplings, or supersymmetry.
8. The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomaly is the ultimate limit to the precision of the standard model value and can only be calculated from a model.
9. The measurements of the muon anomaly have placed serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model and have grown substantially in interest with the development of supersymmetric theories.",1
60,"1. The paper presents a new design for an optomechanical system that consists of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which enables the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling.
2. The reactive coupling originates from the dependence of the microdisk resonator's extrinsic losses on mechanical motion and further phase-dependent gradient forces.
3. The design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, but the paper explores other possibilities of investigating the effects of strong reactive coupling without cooling the system.
4. The authors examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields, reporting reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting.
5. Normal mode splitting is observed in output fields in the presence of reactive coupling, while there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling.
6. The system consists of a microdisk cavity coupled to a freestanding waveguide, with a strong pump field and a weak stokes field entering the system through the waveguide.
7. The Hamiltonian of the system is given, describing the energy of the cavity field, the energy of the waveguide, interactions between the waveguide and incident fields, and coupling of the cavity field to the pump field and the stokes field.
8. The paper investigates the physical effects by scanning the stokes laser and studies the behavior of the system's output fields, finding that reactive coupling can lead to the appearance of normal mode splitting in the output stokes field.",1
61,"1. Quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium have been a subject of increasing interest, with many studies revealing new findings but leaving several questions unresolved.
2. The emergence of a current in a physical quantity can cause a system to become non-equilibrium, and transport of that quantity is an important aspect of the dynamics.
3. Transport properties, especially magnetization transport in low-dimensional spin systems, have gained importance in the areas of spintronics and nano-device applications.
4. Theoretical studies have confirmed that the properties of transportation in closed quantum systems differ significantly from their classical counterparts.
5. Studies on introducing current in integrable Hamiltonians have shown that current-carrying states exhibit oscillatory nature and power-law decay of correlations in space.
6. Analytical and simulative studies have been conducted on nonequilibrium transport of magnetization in open quantum spin chains, shedding light on the behavior of physical quantities during equilibration.
7. Integrability has become a crucial perspective in the exploration of nonequilibrium phenomena, as integrable systems have restricted dynamics and their relaxation process depends on the initial state.
8. A quantum Ising chain model is described, and an initial configuration is constructed incorporating odd-occupation basis states in momentum space along with other states.
9. The dynamics of transverse magnetization in the quantum Ising chain model are studied, and it is observed that the system does not reach a homogeneous magnetization even after infinite time.
10. The phenomena of quantum phase transition are manifested in the dynamics in two ways, and the initial configuration contains several parameters, with all features of the dynamics being true for arbitrary values of those parameters.",1
62,"1. Studying QCD at finite baryon density is important for understanding the structure of compact stars and the conditions near the core of collapsing stars.
2. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase, which was proposed by Frautschi and Barrois by observing that one-gluon exchange between two quarks is attractive in the color antitriplet channel.
3. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the charge neutrality condition and chemical equilibrium are required, which can lead to a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks.
4. The Cooper pairing will eventually be destroyed with the increase of mismatch, and the system may exhibit a first-order phase transition or a spatial non-uniform Loff (Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fudde-Ferrell) state in a certain window of moderate mismatch.
5. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system. If the charge neutrality condition is satisfied globally and the surface tension is small, the mixed phase will be favored.
6. Homogeneous neutral cold-dense quark matter can be in the gapless 2SC (g2sc) phase or gapless CFL (gcfl) phase, depending on the flavor structure of the system. These gapless states resemble the unstable Sarma state but are thermal stable under a natural charge neutrality condition.
7. The existence of thermal stable gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed in refs. and generalized to finite temperatures. Recent results show that the g2sc and gcfl phases can exist at moderate baryon density in the color superconducting phase diagram.
8. In the g2sc phase, there is a chromomagnetic instability where the Meissner screening masses for five gluons corresponding to broken generators become imaginary. This instability is inherent to gapless phases and is still not fully understood.
9. Giannakis and Ren suggested that a Loff state might be the true ground state, and a charge neutral Loff state can cure the instability of off-diagonal 4-7th gluons, but not the diagonal 8-th gluon. A narrow unstable Loff window exists when the charge",1
63,"1. The debate about the properties of the melting phase transition in two-dimensional systems has been ongoing for several decades, but recent developments in the fabrication of 2D materials may provide clarification.
2. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is the most widely accepted theory for this transition, which involves two separate, continuous transitions as a solid transforms into a liquid in quasi-equilibrium steps. These transitions involve the unbinding of dislocation pairs and dislocations into point defects.
3. The KTHNY theory is compatible with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids the existence of exact long-range positional order in 2D for a wide range of pair potentials at finite temperatures. However, it assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which is not always observed in experiments.
4. The validity of the KTHNY theory has been examined for systems with different pair interactions, including hard-sphere (disk), Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, dipole-dipole, and Debye-Hückel (screened Coulomb or Yukawa) inter-particle interactions.
5. The timeline of research on this topic shows a trend towards identifying first or second order phase transitions in earlier particle simulations, but since approximately the year 2000, particle-based numerical studies have favored the KTHNY theory.
6. A possible resolution to the ongoing debate is that extensive Monte Carlo simulations of 2D Lennard-Jones systems have revealed the metastable nature of the hexatic phase, which may be linked to the observation of the hexatic phase in numerical simulations operating on a longer diffusive time scale.",1
64,"1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4100 planetary candidates, leading to a better understanding of planet occurrence rates around various types of stars. One significant finding is that small planets, particularly those with sizes between Earth and Neptune, are common. However, accurately determining planetary radii is crucial for understanding the distribution of planetary structures and the occurrence rates of ""rocky"" and ""non-rocky"" planets.

2. The presence of stellar companions can affect the observed transit depths and planetary radii in the Kepler candidate sample. Recent work suggests that a non-negligible fraction of Kepler host stars may be multiple stars, which can introduce a systematic uncertainty into planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions. Undetected stellar companions can lead to misclassifications of planet sizes, as seen with hot Jupiters, where 30% were classified as smaller planets due to unaccounted transit dilution from stellar companions.

3. The paper explores the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample. The study focuses on bound companions within a certain distance and shows that, without spectroscopic or high-resolution imaging observations to vet companions, observed planetary radii will be systematically too small. However, if a candidate host star is observed with high-resolution imaging or radial velocity spectroscopy to screen for companions, the underestimate of the true planet radius is significantly reduced. This vetting process will be even more effective for K2 and TESS candidates, which will be closer to Earth than Kepler candidates.",1
65,"1. The range of hydrogen column densities in nearby galaxies' neutral gas disks is similar to that of damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) in quasar spectra. Mapping the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission would provide a direct observational link between DLAs and local galaxies, but it is currently impossible with present technology due to the weak 21-cm line caused by the small transition probability.
2. The identification of DLAs as absorbers in background QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, and the lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground because the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to UV wavelengths. The number density of DLAs decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts, making it difficult to find DLAs whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present-day radio telescopes.
3. There are now over 100 DLA galaxies known at various redshifts, spanning a wide range of galaxy properties. However, it is not just luminous, high surface brightness spiral galaxies that contribute to the HI cross-section above the DLA threshold. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe with single-dish radio telescopes have resulted in an accurate measurement of the cosmological density of neutral hydrogen, which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLA studies.
4. High-resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope can be used to constrain the column density distribution function of HI. These maps show that most of the HI atoms are in column densities around 10^21 atoms cm^-2, both in the local universe and at higher redshifts.
5. The cross-section weighted probability distribution functions of various galaxy parameters can be calculated now that accurate cross-section measurements of all galaxies in the sample and their space density are known. For example, 87% of the DLA cross-section is in galaxies that are fainter than M\_B = -18, and the expected median impact parameter of DLA systems is 7.8 kpc.
6. The metallicity distribution for HI column densities peaks around [O/H] = -0.",1
66,"1. Stars are thought to form in star clusters, with only a modest percentage of the gas in a giant molecular cloud being turned into stars during the collapse and fragmentation of the cloud.
2. After the onset of stellar winds and supernovae explosions, the gas within the embedded cluster is removed, causing a rapid change in the gravitational potential energy and resulting in a cluster that is far out of equilibrium.
3. Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters and comparing the ratio of dynamical mass to observed light to simple stellar population models. However, these studies have reported discrepant results, with some finding non-standard IMFs and others finding standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs.
4. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, with all clusters older than 1100 Myr being well fit by Kroupa or Salpeter IMFs, while the youngest clusters showed a significant scatter. They suggest that this is due to the youngest (tens of Myr) clusters being out of equilibrium.
5. The paper provides evidence that the young massive clusters M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1, which have been reported to have non-standard stellar IMFs, are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss.
6. The authors also show that NGC 1569-A, which has been reported to have a standard IMF based on dynamical measurements, is likely also out of equilibrium.
7. The paper supports the hypothesis that rapid gas expulsion from young clusters, which leaves the cluster severely out of equilibrium, causes the effect of ""infant mortality"" in which many young clusters are destroyed.
8. The authors conclude that the excess light at large radii seen in many massive young star clusters is a signature of violent relaxation after gas expulsion, and that these clusters have effective star formation efficiencies of around 25-35%.
9. The observations presented in the paper also suggest that the escaping stars from a cluster can result in an artificially high velocity dispersion, leading to incorrect mass estimates based on the assumption of stellar virial equilibrium.",1
67,"1. Quantum fluctuations can both suppress and enhance chaotic motion in wave packets in quantum physics, depending on the system and the specific phenomenon being considered.
2. The suppression of chaotic motion by quantum fluctuations is seen in the kicked rotor system, where quantum interference prevents the wave packet from delocalizing.
3. On the other hand, quantum fluctuations can enhance chaotic motion through the tunneling effect, as seen in the kicked double-well model.
4. The relationship between chaotic behavior and tunneling phenomena in classically chaotic systems is an important subject of study in quantum physics.
5. Semiclassical descriptions of tunneling phenomena in classically chaotic systems have been developed by several groups.
6. Lin and Ballentine studied the interplay between tunneling and classical chaos in a particle in a double-well potential with an oscillatory driving force.
7. They found that coherent tunneling takes place between small, isolated classical stable regions of phase space, which are much smaller than the volume of a single potential well.
8. Hnggi and coworkers studied chaos-suppressed tunneling in the driven double-well model using the Floquet formalism.
9. They found a one-dimensional manifold in the parameter space where tunneling is completely suppressed by the coherent driving.
10. The time scale for tunneling between the wells diverges due to the intersection of the ground state doublet of the quasienergies.",1
68,"1. Understanding dissipative quantum dynamics of a system embedded in a complex environment is an important topic in physics and chemistry, with significant progress made in condensed phase dynamics through models such as the Caldeira-Leggett model and spin-boson model.
2. These models typically represent the environment as a bosonic bath, a set of non-interacting harmonic oscillators whose influences on the system are encoded in a spectral density.
3. While bosonic bath models have been successful, other bath models have been suggested to play essential roles in various physical and chemical studies.
4. Examples include using a bath of non-interacting Morse or quartic oscillators, mapping anharmonic environments onto effective harmonic modes with temperature-dependent spectral density, and fermionic bath models.
5. Both bosonic and fermionic environments are Gaussian baths, which can be exactly treated by the linear response in the path integral formalism. However, for non-Gaussian baths, attaining numerically exact open quantum dynamics requires higher-order response functions or explicit dynamical treatments of the bath degrees of freedom.
6. A stochastic formulation of quantum dissipation has been extended to incorporate all three fundamental bath models: non-interacting bosons, fermions, and spins.
7. The stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) prescribes a simple yet general form of quantum dissipative dynamics when bath effects are modeled as colored noises. Different bath models and properties are distinguished by assigning distinct noise variables and associated statistics.
8. Achieving stable convergences in stochastic simulations has proven challenging, even for well-studied bosonic bath models. Direct stochastic simulation of real-time dynamics remains formidable, especially for generic quantum environments with non-Gaussian characteristics or fermionic degrees of freedom.
9. The stochastic formalism provides straightforward prescriptions to compute dynamical quantities such as system-bath joint observables and can be used to derive numerical schemes for deterministic simulations of quantum dynamics for all three fundamental bath models.
10. The paper also discusses a dual-fermion mapping for handling non-Gaussian properties of spin baths and presents numerical examples to illustrate the methods.",1
69,"1. The text discusses the glass transition, a phenomenon that occurs when a liquid cools and becomes an amorphous solid. This transition is associated with a sharp increase in relaxation times and a departure from equilibrium in laboratory measurements. Theoretically, it is believed that the transition is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic transition, known as the Kauzmann temperature, where only one minimum-energy basin of attraction is accessible to the system. However, this theory has been called into question by experimental data and simulations of polydisperse hard-core disks. The discrepancies between hard-disk and soft-sphere systems may be due to fundamental differences in the models or inappropriate sampling at low temperatures and high densities.
2. The text also discusses the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT), which predicts a transition from a high-temperature liquid state to a low-temperature arrested state at a critical temperature. The MCT has been used to study a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation model adapted to the glass-forming NiZr transition metal system. The MD simulations were used to calculate the partial structure factors and correlation functions of the system, which showed a structural relaxation in three successive steps as predicted by the idealized schematic MCT. The nonergodicity parameters, which describe the long-time behavior of the intermediate scattering function, were also calculated and found to decay to zero for longer times at all temperatures investigated, in agreement with the full MCT. The memory functions, which are used to evaluate the @xmath118, were also calculated and found to be in full agreement with the results in @xcite for the NiZr system. The @xmath118 has a maximum at an intermediate value of @xmath128 for all the investigated temperatures, and the values of @xmath130 move with decreasing temperature towards the limiting value 1 in the high temperature regime. A crossover temperature @xmath131 was estimated from the linear fit of the @xmath3-values for ni above 950 k and for zr above 1000 k. The diffusion coefficients of the Ni and Zr species were also calculated and found to have a fixed ratio in the temperature regime above approximately 1000 k. The critical temperature of the system was estimated to be around 850-900 k by adapting the critical power law to",1
70,"1. Dyadic data is common in psychosocial and behavioral studies, where observations are related and interdependent due to the influence of one member on the other.
2. Longitudinal dyadic data, which involves repeatedly measuring dyads over time, brings in two complications: within-dyad correlation and within-subject correlation, and it is important to account for both simultaneously to avoid invalid analysis results.
3. Nonignorable dropouts, where the dropout depends on missing values, are common in psychosocial dyadic studies and can lead to biased estimates using conventional statistical methods.
4. There are two broad classes of likelihood-based nonignorable models: selection models and pattern mixture models, as well as other likelihood-based and estimation equation-based approaches.
5. The nonignorable dropout problem has not been addressed in the context of longitudinal dyadic data, and the interdependence structure within dyads brings new challenges to this missing data problem.
6. The proposed approach to deal with longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts is a fully Bayesian selection model that accounts for the interdependence between patients and their spouses.
7. The approach models each subject's longitudinal measurement process using a transition model with both the patient's and spouse's characteristics as covariates, and accounts for within-dyad correlation using dyad-specific random effects.
8. The proposed method is applied to a motivating data set from a longitudinal dyadic breast cancer study, and simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
9. The research is motivated by a single-arm dyadic study focusing on physiological and psychosocial aspects of pain among patients with breast cancer and their spouses.
10. The study aims to characterize the depression experience due to metastatic breast cancer from both patients and spouses' perspectives and examine the dyadic interaction and interdependence of patients and spouses over time regarding their depression.",1
71,"1. Quantum fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that never vanishes, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources. This concept was used by H. B. G. Casimir in 1948 to predict that two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other with a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation.
2. E. M. Lifshitz, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii, and L. P. Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics. They derived an analytical formula that relates the Helmholtz free energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field to the dielectric functions of the interacting materials and of the medium in which they are immersed.
3. At very short distances, Lifshitz's theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force. At larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction that in the case of two ideal metals in vacuum reduces to Casimir's result.
4. Lifshitz's equation also shows that two plates made out of the same material always attract, regardless of the choice of the intervening medium. For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed.
5. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has received considerable attention in modern literature and has been verified in several high-precision experiments. Less precise measurements in liquids have been reported, and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids has also been reported.
6. The Casimir-Lifshitz force might be a potentially relevant issue for the development of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems. However, essentially no attention has been devoted to the torque between anisotropic materials predicted by Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash.
7. In this paper, the authors calculate the magnitude of the torque induced by quantum fluctuations for specific materials and discuss possible experimental validations of the effect. They consider a small birefringent disk made out of either quartz or calcite placed parallel to a birefringent barium",0
72,"1. The study of complex networks has gained significant attention in recent years, with applications in various fields such as computer science, biology, social science, and finance. A central problem in network science is the study of random walks (RWs) on a graph and their relation to the topological properties of the network.
2. The paper presents a new framework for the study of topologically biased random walks (TBRWs) on graphs, which allows for efficient exploration of network structure and addressing problems of community detection and synchronization.
3. The authors are motivated by the idea that biased random walks can be efficiently used for community finding. They introduce a set of mathematical tools to investigate the ""bias parameters"" space and uncover details in the spectra of the graph transition matrix.
4. The paper focuses on the behavior of the spectral gap in biased random walks, defining conditions for a maximal spectral gap and providing numerical evidence that this maximum is global.

73,"1. The text discusses the threat of internet worms, particularly those that exploit peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay applications, called P2P worms. These worms can spread rapidly and cause massive-scale disruption to the internet infrastructure.
2. P2P worms can be passive or active. Passive P2P worms spread by being copied into shared folders or by responding to queries with index information of worms. Active P2P worms can infect vulnerable P2P hosts directly or by using a hit list of P2P hosts. They can also perform topological self-propagation, spreading to neighboring hosts and causing the overlay service to become unusable.
3. The text proposes a holistic immunity system to provide mechanisms for both internal defense and external protection against active P2P worms. The system includes a small subset of P2P overlay nodes, called phagocytes, which are immune and specialized in finding and ""eating"" active P2P worms.
4. Phagocytes monitor their managed P2P hosts' connection patterns and traffic volume to detect active P2P worm attacks. Once detected, the local isolation procedure cuts off the links of all infected P2P hosts. The contagion-based alert propagation then spreads worm alerts to neighboring phagocytes to limit the impact area and enhance robustness against malicious alert propagations.
5. The system also includes access control and filtering mechanisms for the connection establishment between the internal P2P overlay and external hosts. P2P traffic is contained within the P2P overlay, and external worms are prevented from attacking the P2P overlay by hiding P2P hosts' IP addresses with a scalable distributed DNS service.
6. The system is designed to be compatible with both structured and unstructured P2P overlay networks. In unstructured networks, a subset of P2P hosts is elected to perform the functions of phagocytes. In structured networks, a subset of P2P hosts forms an overlay to perform defense and protection functions.
7. The system's internal defense mechanism includes isolating and patching infected phagocytes, monitoring managed P2P hosts' connection transactions and traffic volume, and detecting active P2P worms using behavior similarity algorithms.

74,"1. The debris disk surrounding the star HD32297 has been observed to have an edge-on orientation, making it an ideal target for gas phase absorption measurements. Observations of the D doublet (5895.9242 and 5889.9510) toward HD32297 were made over several epochs and revealed two absorption components at different velocities. The stronger component is likely caused by absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the local bubble, while the weaker component is likely caused by circumstellar material.
2. The stable absorption component in the gas phase resonance line is caused by either intervening circumstellar or interstellar gas. Measuring the interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight and in the locality surrounding a circumstellar disk candidate is critical to characterizing any contaminating ISM absorption. The sun resides in a large scale ISM structure known as the local bubble, whose boundary at 4100pc is defined by a significant quantity of interstellar material. If a stable absorption component is observed at the stellar radial velocity, and similar absorption is not detected toward any proximate stars, it is likely that the absorption component is caused by circumstellar material.",1
75,"1. Gravity is a universal and fundamental force that affects anything with energy. Theories of quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimum measurable length, also known as the Planck length, due to the breakdown of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle at high energies.
2. Certain effects of quantum gravity are universal and can influence almost any system with a well-defined Hamiltonian. Current and future experiments may be able to set bounds on parameters relevant to quantum gravity and potentially measure these effects.
3. The generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is a modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that holds at all scales. It can be represented by the equation x\_i p\_i [1 + ((p)^2 + < p>^2 ) + 2 ( p\_i^2 + < p\_i>^2 ) ] , where p is the Planck mass and E is the Planck energy.
4. The dimensionless parameter in the GUP equation is normally assumed to be of order unity, but if it is not imposed a priori, current experiments predict large upper bounds on it that are compatible with current observations. This may signal the existence of a new length scale that cannot exceed the electroweak length scale.
5. The GUP implies a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum, which have implications for quantum hamiltonians and the measurement of a single particle in a box.
6. The energy-time uncertainty principle can be derived from the standard HUP and the equations of motion for a system. In a cosmological context, the characteristic time is usually selected to be equal to the Planck time.
7. The present work investigates the effects of quantum gravity on the Planck era of the universe by evaluating the modifications to several quantities that characterize the Planck era, such as the Planck time, length, mass, energy, density, effective number density, and entropy.
8. The GUP can be used to derive physical quantities at the Planck epoch, such as the Planck time, length, density, mass, energy, temperature, and effective number density.
9. The entropic content of the universe behind the cosmological horizon at the Planck time is unaltered when quantum gravity corrections are taken into account, indicating that the information remains unchanged.",1

2. The focus is on computing 3-point correlation functions involving two insertions of an operator dual to a heavy string state and a chiral operator dual to a supergravity field.
3. The computation is done using the supergravity approximation for the light fields and the action for a string in the first quantized theory for the heavy string state.
4. The source for the operator dual to the heavy string field is represented by ℏ, and the source for the chiral operators dual to the supergravity fields is represented by ϕ.
5. The gauge theory generating functional for diagrams with insertions of ℏ at two boundary points can be written as Z[ℏ, ϕ] by varying with respect to the sources ϕ, correlation functions with many chiral operators can be computed.
6. At strong coupling, the generating functional can be approximated by Z[ϕ] + s[ϕ], where s[ϕ] is the string polyakov action describing the propagation of the heavy string state.
7. The supergravity fields in Z[ϕ] approximate the gauge theory sources near the boundary.
8. The propagation of the light fields is determined by the supergravity action around the vacuum, which has a five-dimensional form in the Einstein frame.
9. The propagation of the heavy string state and its coupling to the supergravity fields is determined from the polyakov action.",1
77,"1. The text discusses the development of an embedding scheme for the Dirac equation, which is a relativistic extension of the Schrödinger equation. This scheme is used to solve the Dirac equation in a limited region of a larger system, where the influence of the rest of the system is taken into account through an energy-dependent non-local potential. This method has been widely used in surface electronic structure problems, such as studies of image states, surface states, static and dynamic screening, atomic adsorption and scattering at surfaces, studies of surface optical response, and field emission.
2. The embedding method has also been applied to transport problems and has been used to study materials containing heavier elements, where relativistic effects can be significant. These effects include shifts in inner core levels and valence bands, as well as spin-orbit splitting. To deal with these effects, various electronic structure techniques have been modified to solve the Dirac equation, including the relativistic augmented plane wave method, the relativistic linear muffin-tin orbital method, the relativistic augmented spherical wave method, and the relativistic multiple-scattering method.
3. The embedding scheme has several advantages, such as the ability to include extended substrates for surface and interface calculations, the study of isolated point defects in solids, and the flexibility to perform full-potential studies with relative ease. These features make the embedding scheme particularly suitable for studying surface and interface problems, where the proper distinction between surface states, resonances, and the continuum of bulk states is important.
4. The text also discusses the application of the embedding scheme to a model problem of a hydrogen atom within a spherical cavity, where bound states of the Dirac equation are found. The results show that the eigenvalues converge to the exact values as the basis set size is increased, and that the influence of the embedding potential is relatively small. The text also outlines the calculation of the local density of states for a confined hydrogen model and a silver monolayer in a Au(001)/Ag/Au(001) sandwich structure, which demonstrates the ability of the embedding scheme to treat more challenging problems.",1

The authors highlight the importance of understanding the effects of temporal structural variations in networked systems, as real-world networks are constantly evolving. They mention various cases where the evolution of the network structure is heavily influenced by the dynamics of processes taking place in the network, such as social distancing in epidemiology and adaptation mechanisms in power networks, biological and neural networks, and online social networks. However, the effects of these adaptation mechanisms on network dynamics are not well understood.

2. The authors propose an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (ASIS) model for studying adaptation mechanisms over arbitrary contact networks. They derive an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the ASIS model for arbitrary networks and heterogeneous node and edge dynamics. They also propose an efficient algorithm for optimally tuning the adaptation rates of an arbitrary network to eradicate an epidemic outbreak in the ASIS model. The authors confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bounds with several numerical simulations and compare their optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures.",1
79,"1. Open dielectric resonators have received significant attention due to their applications as microlasers, sensors, and paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths.
2. Semiclassical methods have been successful in treating wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength, providing approximate solutions in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system. In the case of dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard.
3. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics.
4. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
5. One of the most important tools in semiclassical physics are trace formulas, which relate the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system. A trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators was recently developed and successfully tested.
6. However, typical microlasers are three-dimensional (3D) systems, and while trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators.
7. The difficulty of numerically solving the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities is the main reason for the lack of investigation. In the case of flat microlasers, they are treated as 2D systems by introducing an effective index of refraction.
8. The purpose of the present work is to compare experimental length spectra and the trace formula computed within the 2D approximation, as well as investigate the effect of the dispersion of the effective index of refraction and the need for higher-order corrections.
9. The experiments were performed with two dielectric microwave resonators of circular shape and different thickness, known to be ideal testbeds for the investigation of wave-dynam",1
80,"1. The merger of neutron stars and/or black holes are important sources of gravitational waves (GW) due to the large amount of energy released during the process. The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) can radiate about 10@xmath6 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.4 - 1.6 khz. The rate at which these mergers occur in the local universe is another crucial factor in determining their potential as GW sources.
2. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the authors estimate the GW background spectrum produced by DNS coalescences. They find that the signal frequency is in the range 10 - 1500 hz, covered by ground-based interferometers. The simulations indicate that about 96% of the GW energy is released in the few thousand seconds before the last stable orbit is reached.
3. The authors also estimate the probability for a given pair of massive stars to form a DNS at a given redshift, which is essentially given by the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) normalized in the redshift interval. They assume that the parameter @xmath20 does not change significantly with redshift and adopt a flat cosmological model with @xmath36 = 0.30 and @xmath37 = 0.70, corresponding to the concordance model derived from observations of distant type Ia supernovae and the power spectra of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations.
4. The authors consider three models for the cosmic SFR history up to redshifts @xmath41, and use the second model, labelled sfr2, in their computations. They estimate the redshift @xmath45 at which the progenitors have already evolved and the system is now constituted by two neutron stars, which fixes the beginning of the inspiral phase. They then estimate the redshift @xmath54 at which the coalescence occurs after a timescale @xmath49, and calculate the distribution of the number of coalescences as a function of @xmath54. The corresponding coalescence rate per redshift interval, @xmath56, is then calculated and plotted in figure [ fig - sfr ].",1
81,"1. The backreaction of accelerated particles on a shock occurs when the acceleration process becomes efficient enough to generate pressures comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure. This phenomenon changes both the spectrum of the particles and the structure of the shock, making it an intrinsically nonlinear process. There are three main approaches to account for this backreaction: numerical simulations, a fluid approach, and analytical methods.
2. The fluid approach, which treats cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, allows for the calculation of the thermodynamics of modified shocks but does not provide information about the spectrum of accelerated particles. Analytical methods, on the other hand, can help understand the physics of nonlinear effects in a way that simulations may not always achieve due to their complexity. A perturbative approach and an assumption about the energy dependence of particle diffusion are two analytical methods used to study the backreaction of accelerated particles.
3. Nonlinear backreaction effects can significantly impact the maximum achievable energy of particles accelerated in supernova remnants, especially in the presence of large acceleration efficiencies. A simple analytical broken-power-law approximation of nonlinear spectra has been proposed to address the need for a practical solution in the nonlinear regime. Recently, some promising analytical solutions of the problem of nonlinear shock acceleration have appeared in the literature, potentially avoiding limitations of previous approaches.
4. Numerical simulations have shown that even a small fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas can channel a significant part of the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid, making the test particle approach unsuitable. The most visible effects of backreaction on the shock appear in the spectrum of accelerated particles, which shows a peculiar flattening at the highest energies. While several calculations exist for nonlinear effects in shock acceleration of quasi-monochromatic particles, there is no description of how these effects appear when the shock propagates in a medium with pre-accelerated particles. The backreaction can severely affect the process of re-energization of preaccelerated particles, and an analytical treatment of shock acceleration in the presence of seed nonthermal particles, including their nonlinear backreaction, has been reported.",1
82,"1. The universe is currently in an accelerating phase, which is attributed to the existence of a dark energy (DE) sector with negative pressure. The DE sector eventually dominates over cold dark matter (CDM) and drives the universe to accelerate. The simplest candidate for DE is the cosmological constant, but it suffers from the cosmological constant problem and may also suffer from the age problem. Various DE models have been proposed, and one possibility is to consider a theory of gravity based on the Weitzenböck connection, which describes the gravitational field by torsion instead of curvature. This approach, known as teleparallel gravity, is equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but has attractive features related to geometrical and physical aspects.
2. The paper explores the implications of a specific teleparallel gravity model, called f(T) gravity, on the formation of light elements in the early universe during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) period. The authors confront various f(T) gravity models with BBN calculations based on current observational data on primordial abundance of hydrogen-1 (^1H) and use BBN to extract constraints on their free parameters. The authors find that viable f(T) models, namely those that pass basic observational tests, can also satisfy BBN constraints, which acts as an additional advantage of f(T) gravity as a candidate for describing the gravitational interaction.",1

Several protocols have been proposed for this network, including the traditional two-way relaying protocol and the time division broadcast (TDBC) and multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocols.
2. The TDBC protocol combines the relay-to-user phases into one broadcast phase, while the MABC protocol combines the user-to-relay phases into one multiple-access phase. These protocols take advantage of the broadcast capability of the wireless medium and can achieve higher data rates than the traditional protocol.
3. The text also discusses the use of adaptive mode selection and power allocation in the bidirectional relay network. By selecting the optimal transmission mode and allocating the optimal powers to the nodes in each time slot, the sum rate of the network can be maximized.
4. The text describes the channel model used in the network, including the user-to-relay and relay-to-user channels, which are impaired by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with unit variance and block fading. The channel coefficients are assumed to be constant during one time slot and change from one time slot to the next.
5. The text also introduces a useful condition for the queues in the buffers of the relay, which states that the maximum average sum rate is obtained when the queues are at the edge of non-absorption. This condition is used to derive the optimal transmission mode selection and power allocation policy.
6. The text concludes by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using buffering in the network. While buffering can increase the end-to-end delay, it can also improve the sum rate and achieve the capacity of the one-way relay channel with fading. However, the delay analysis of the proposed protocol is left for future research.",1

This ""standard ruler"" scale can also be measured at low redshifts, such as in large galaxy redshift surveys, to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.
2. If CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, the misinterpretation could potentially bias inferences at low redshifts. However, the interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
3. The actual densities of matter and radiation are not important; only their ratio matters. Therefore, even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, the inferences for dark energy from the combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged.
4. Knowledge of actual densities translates into improved constraints on the Hubble constant. The acoustic peak method depends on measuring the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination.
5. Nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination. The sound horizon integral depends only on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma. If we assume dark energy is sub-dominant, then the sound horizon can be calculated from the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
6. The baryon-to-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum. The modulation of the odd and even acoustic peaks and the silk damping tail gives a precise measurement of the baryon-to-photon ratio.
7. Information about matter-radiation equality is encoded in the amplitudes of the peaks through the manner in which the potentials evolve as they cross the horizon. Measurements of the potential envelope robustly constrain equality.
8. The sound horizon decreases by only 5% if the baryon-to-photon ratio is lowered by 10%. Understanding the acoustic",1
85,"1. There has been recent excitement about neutrino masses due to experiments testing neutrino oscillations, such as Super Kamiokande's positive indications of atmospheric neutrino oscillations.
2. Solar neutrino experiments and accelerator and reactor experiments have also provided evidence for neutrino oscillations and strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters.
3. It is hoped that new experimental results can help determine neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles, which may help infer the neutrino mass matrix and lead to a more fundamental theory beyond the Standard Model.
4. A plausible ansatz for the 3-generation neutrino mass matrix is proposed and its consequences are investigated.
5. In the SO(10) grand unified model, the neutrino mass matrix can be derived from an arbitrary symmetric complex matrix, which corresponds to the well-known approximate signature of grand unification.
6. The SO(10) grand unified model contains one light massive two-component neutrino and a very heavy one for each generation, with the effective neutrino mass matrix taking a specific form due to the seesaw mechanism.
7. The seesaw term is generally considered to dominate, but it is assumed to be negligible in this investigation.
8. In the SO(10) model, Higgs mesons belonging to the 10, 120, and 126 representations can contribute to the fermion masses at tree level.
9. The mass matrices for the down quarks, charged leptons, and light neutrinos can be expressed in terms of Higgs meson vacuum values and Yukawa type constants.
10. The mass matrices are assumed to be hermitian, which allows for a real symmetric mass matrix in the SO(10) model. The ansatz is then combined with experimentally obtained results on neutrino oscillations to learn more about the neutrino mass matrix itself.",1
86,"1. The contact pattern among individuals in a population is crucial for the spread of infectious diseases. This can be modeled using contact rates and contact matrices, but network analysis methods can provide a more precise understanding of the contact structure among individuals.
2. Many real-world networks, including sexual contact networks, exhibit a power-law degree distribution and are considered scale-free networks. Epidemics propagate faster in scale-free networks than in single-scale networks.
3. The Barabási-Albert (BA) algorithm is used to generate scale-free networks, and different network generation algorithms result in networks with distinct structural properties.
4. The authors studied the impact of different structural properties on the dynamics of epidemics in scale-free networks, using the BA algorithm and other network generation methods.
5. They developed routines to simulate the spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases in networks with the same degree distribution but different topological structures.
6. The results showed that networks generated by the BA method are more centralized and efficient than networks generated by other methods. The prevalence of diseases differed between networks with the same degree distribution but different topological structures.
7. The authors observed that the disease spreads independently of the value of the probability of disease spread (xmath26) used in undirected networks, and an increase in xmath26 leads to an increase in the prevalence of the infection. However, when the number of edges of each vertex (xmath6) is high, there is a great difference in the equilibrium level of the prevalence in each network.
8. Among the undirected networks, the networks generated using the mb algorithm presented the lowest values of prevalence in the spreading simulations. On directed networks, networks generated using the BA algorithm presented the lowest values of prevalence in the spreading simulations.",1
87,"1. The Levi-Civita (LC) spacetime, which describes the gravitational field of an infinite line mass, remains a challenge to interpret despite many works dedicated to its discussion.
2. The LC spacetime has two essential constants: one related to the topology of spacetime (deficit angle) and another, denoted by @xmath0, which presents the most serious obstacles to interpretation.
3. For small @xmath0, LC describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass, and becomes flat when @xmath0 is zero. However, circular timelike geodesics exist only for certain ranges of @xmath0 and become null or spacelike for other ranges.
4. The Kretschmann scalar decreases monotonically as @xmath0 increases, implying that the space is flat for certain values of @xmath0, even if an extra killing vector is present.
5. The absence of circular test particle orbits for certain ranges of @xmath0 and the fact that most known material sources for LC require a non-zero @xmath0, led to the interpretation that LC describes the field of a cylinder only if @xmath0 ranges within the (0,@xmath10) interval.
6. However, interior solutions matching to LC exist with @xmath16, and the absence of circular test particle orbits for @xmath16 may simply be interpreted as the centrifugal force required to balance the gravitational attraction implying velocities of the test particle larger than 1 (speed of light).
7. The acceleration of the test particle increases with @xmath0 in the interval ( @xmath10,@xmath11), suggesting that the acceleration represents the intensity of the field more suitably than the Kretschmann scalar.
8. Based on the above arguments and the study of a specific interior solution matched to LC, Bonnor proposes to interpret LC as the spacetime generated by a cylinder whose radius increases with @xmath0 and tends to infinity as @xmath0 approaches @xmath11.
9. The LC spacetime has no horizons, and the anisotropic fluid matched to LC produces an effective mass per unit length that has a maximum at @xmath20, which might explain the in",0
88,"1. Quantum information processing has gained significant interest due to the potential of quantum computers, where information is stored and processed in quantum systems.
2. Quantum information carriers offer possibilities like quantum cryptography, quantum networks, and quantum algorithms that are more efficient than classical ones.
3. Transmission of quantum information from one party to another through a communication channel has been the focus of many investigations, with qubits being used to encode information.
4. In a realistic scenario, qubits interact with the environment, leading to distorted qubits upon reception due to the channel's disturbing action.
5. The primary focus of investigations has been on channel capacity determination and quantum state reconstruction, assuming known channel actions. However, determining the properties of the quantum channel itself has not been explored extensively.
6. Reliable quantum information transfer requires a well-known intermediate device, and knowledge of the channel's behavior is essential for constructing quantum codes.
7. Quantum channel estimation is crucial for any quantum communication protocol, with the quantum channel being a transmission line, quantum system storage, or uncontrolled time evolution of the underlying quantum system.
8. Channel estimation is possible with infinite resources, but in practical applications, only up to some accuracy can be achieved due to limited available quantum systems.
9. A quantum channel can be parametrized by a vector with components, and the goal of channel estimation is to specify the parameter vector. Alice and Bob follow a protocol to estimate the properties of a quantum channel by preparing a set of quantum states, sending them through the channel, and performing measurements on the received states to deduce an estimated vector close to the underlying parameter vector of the quantum channel.",1

The text discusses the importance of understanding the role of collision centrality, the definition and nature of the underlying event (ue), the systematics of minimum-bias (mb) dijet production, and the existence and characteristics of a nonjet (nj) quadrupole component in angular correlations for high-energy nuclear collisions.
2. The text presents a unified experimental and theoretical picture of mb dijet production in collisions, and introduces the concept of a nj quadrupole component in angular correlations for collisions. The results from the present study have important implications for claims of collectivity, centrality, ue studies, and the mechanism of the cms ridge.
3. The text argues that the term ""collectivity"" or ""collectivity"" can be ambiguous, and that jet formation and the nj quadrupole are both forms of collectivity. The text also discusses the challenges in applying the concept of centrality to small collision systems, and suggests that the event-wise depth of penetration on momentum fraction of the projectile wave function may be the main source of variation for soft, hard, and quadrupole components.",1
90,"1. The paper presents a novel method for deriving master equations (MEs) in both the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes using stochastic methods and operator techniques. The main idea is to build random evolution operators with stochastic parameters and then take the stochastic expectation value. The paper shows that any Lindblad-type ME, with self-adjoint Lindblad operators, can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution. This result has several consequences, such as a fast method to solve MEs and the attainability of both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes under the same mathematical formalism.
2. The paper also discusses the flexibility of the mathematical language used, which can generalize some intrinsic decoherence models present in the literature. The authors propose a slight generalization of the Jaynes-Cummings model and show how the proposed formalism can account for reported exponential decays of Rabi oscillations in ion traps. The paper concludes with some comments on existing models of stochastic evolution in Hilbert space and future prospects.",1
91,"1. Metamaterials are a new type of artificial materials that have negative indices of refraction for certain wavelengths, with various applications in modern optics and microelectronics. They can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, and yield slow light propagation.
2. In disordered systems, the presence of negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) disordered metamaterials suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths. A sixth power dependence of the localization length with wavelength has been observed under refractive-index disorder.
3. The effects of polarization and oblique incidence on light propagation in disordered metamaterials have also been studied. A fourth-order perturbation theory has been developed to resolve the problem of non-conventional Anderson localization in bilayered periodic-on-average structures.
4. The text discusses the numerical calculation of the localization length of light for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with alternating indices of refraction and thicknesses. Disorder is introduced by changing the position of the layer boundaries while maintaining the same refraction indices.
5. Two structures are analyzed in detail: homogeneous stacks (h) composed entirely of traditional right-handed materials (RH) with positive indices of refraction, and mixed stacks (m) with alternating layers of left- and right-handed materials.
6. An analytical expression for the localization length for both h and m stacks has been derived using a perturbative theory up to second order in the disorder. The localization length for h stacks shows a quadratic dependence for long wavelengths and saturates for lower values.
7. The localization length is modulated by the corresponding bands in weakly disordered systems, and this modulation decreases as the disorder increases. For low-disordered m stacks and wavelengths much greater than the grating period, the localization length depends linearly on the wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.
8. The paper also discusses the localization length in the allowed and forbidden bands of disordered h stacks, the influence of disorder on the photonic gaps and resonance bands, and the behavior of the localization length in",1

2. Dark matter allows for the explanation of the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of visible matter. It also plays a crucial role in the formation of large structures by pulling in ordinary matter through gravitational collapse.
3. Dark matter must have been non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation and is therefore referred to as cold dark matter (CDM). The particle associated with CDM is called a WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle).
4. Dark energy is a form of energy with a constant density that causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. It could be the cosmological constant that Einstein introduced in his equations of general relativity.
5. The CDM model is successful in precisely fitting the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background and reproducing the large-scale structure of the universe. However, it does not explain the origin of its constituents.
6. The distribution of dark matter in galaxies can be inferred from the rotation curves of galaxies, which show a flat rotation velocity at large distances from the center. This requires the presence of a massive dark matter halo.
7. Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a recipe that accurately predicts the rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter. It modifies the law of gravity in a way that depends on the acceleration of the particles.
8. The success of MOND in predicting the rotation curves of galaxies has led to speculation about a possible influence of cosmology on local dynamics. However, it remains unclear how to incorporate the constant acceleration of MOND into the CDM model.",1
93,"1. Long chain macromolecules, or polymers, have been extensively studied due to their ubiquity in nature. While the physical properties of homopolymers are well understood, less is known about heteropolymers of biological significance.
2. From a biologist's perspective, the specific properties of a particular molecule are of interest, as genetic information is coded by specific sequences of nucleic acids that are translated into chains of amino acids forming a protein.
3. The energy of a polymer is determined by various interactions between its constituent amino acids, including van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, and Coulomb interactions. These interactions determine the protein's final shape and activity.
4. Finding the configuration of a particular molecule is a challenging task due to the large number of monomers and the complexity of their interactions. Physicists take a different approach by simplifying models to gain more general information.
5. Statistical descriptions of ensembles of molecules composed of a random linear sequence of elements with various interactions provide insights into disordered systems, such as spin glasses, with the advantage of faster relaxation.
6. Recent experimental studies have focused on solutions and gels of polymers with randomly charged groups. Simple models of heteropolymers that include essential ingredients, such as long-range Coulomb interactions, are used to study these systems.
7. The overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups are most likely controlled by Coulomb interactions, which are the strongest and have the longest range. A model polyampholyte (PA) is a flexible chain in which each of the N monomers has a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches.
8. In this work, the authors perform a complete enumeration study of PAs for all possible quenches up to N = 19 and present detailed results regarding energetics and spatial conformations of short PAs. These results support the predictions of previous Monte Carlo studies and provide additional details.
9. The continuous index x is used to label the monomers along the chain, while r(x) is the position of the monomer in the D-dimensional embedding space. The corresponding probabilities of these configurations are governed by the Boltzmann weights of an effective Hamiltonian, which includes entropic properties",1

Half-metallic ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures are ideal for spintronics applications, and much experimental and theoretical effort has been devoted to designing and searching for such materials. Among these, Cr-doped dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) or Cr-based alloys, particularly CrAs and CrSb in zinc blende (zb) structure, have attracted significant attention.
2. Thin films of CrAs and CrSb grown by molecular beam epitaxy have been found to be of zb structure and ferromagnetic with high Curie temperatures. The half-metallic character of CrAs has been verified by theoretical calculations, and the high Curie temperature has been supported by some studies. Thin films of CrSb grown on various substrates have also been found to be of zb structure and ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures higher than 400 k.
3. Theoretical studies have examined the possibility of half-metallic behavior in ordered zb compounds of transition metals V, Cr, and Mn with various elements. These studies show that the half-metallic ferromagnetic character of these compounds is preserved over a wide range of lattice parameters.
4. Experimentalists face challenges in synthesizing these compounds in zb structure due to the ground states of many of these compounds being different from the zb structure. However, the possibility remains open that such difficulties will be overcome with progress in techniques of film-growth and materials preparation.
5. Recently, there have been successful attempts to increase the thickness of zb-CrSb films using molecular beam epitaxy with (In, Ga)As buffer layers and to grow 4 nm thick zb-CrSb films on NaCl (100) substrates.
6. A detailed study of the volume dependence of exchange interactions and Curie temperature for Cr-based pnictides and chalcogenides is missing, and the mixed pnictide-chalcogenide systems offer the possibility of not only creating these alloys over a larger range of the lattice parameter but also with a larger variation in the exchange interactions.",1
95,"1. The vertical structure of an X-ray illuminated disk at rest is governed by the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and energy conservation. The force density due to gravity and radiation pressure depends on the plasma density. The heat conduction term in the energy balance equation can be neglected in thermally stable regions, and the temperature can be determined locally with the condition of energy balance. The dependence of the force on the plasma density is included explicitly through the hydrogen density.
2. The thermal instability allows the gas to coexist at different phases, resulting in enormous temperature gradients and heat conduction. The heat conduction in the energy balance equation should be included in such transition layers between stable phases. The thomson optical depth of these regions is readily estimated, and the transition layer solution is not arbitrary under the steady-state conditions.
3. The temperature profiles and optical depths of the transition layers and possible intermediate stable layer are shown in figures. The smaller the force factor, the more extended the intermediate stable layer. The stable phase with the lowest temperature is almost neutral, and the stable phase at the highest temperature is almost fully ionized. They are not efficient in generating X-ray line emission, except for iron fluorescence lines from the neutral material. Only the transition layers and the intermediate stable layer are expected to emit discrete lines in the soft X-ray band.
4. The flux of a particular line can be written as a function of the density of the ion before recombination, the line energy, and the line emissivity. In ionization equilibrium, the emission equivalent width is independent of the density of the medium and the incident flux. It is a unique function of the structure deduced in section [sec\_structure]. The numerical values of the emission equivalent width were provided by d. liedahl and computed using the models described in [xcite]. The values of the emission equivalent width are less than 1.0 eV, with the strongest lines being the hydrogen-like and helium-like lines of oxygen, with ews approaching several tenths of an ev.",1
96,"1. Polymers with a contour length much larger than the persistence length are flexible and can be described using quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. However, if the chain length decreases, the chain stiffness becomes an important factor.
2. Many polymer molecules have internal stiffness and cannot be modeled by the flexible polymer model developed by Edwards. The wormlike polymer model proposed by Kratky and Porod is a standard coarse-graining model that includes the penalty for bending energy and local inextensibility.
3. There has been increasing interest in the theoretical description of semiflexible polymers due to potential applications in biology and research on semicrystalline polymers.
4. Recent numerical work by Lattanzi et al. and analytical studies within the effective medium approach have found that the transverse distribution function of a polymer embedded in two-dimensional space possesses a bimodal shape for short polymers, which is considered a manifestation of semiflexibility.
5. The paper studies the transverse distribution function of the three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation of one polymer end using the exact representation of the distribution function in terms of the matrix element of the Green's function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field.
6. The exact solution of the Green's function made it possible to compute the quantities such as the structure factor, the end-to-end distribution function, etc., practically exactly in a definite range of parameters.
7. The paper presents analytical results for short and long wormlike chains based on the exact formula, which are in complete agreement with previous results obtained in different ways.
8. The paper is organized into sections that introduce the formalism and analytical considerations for short and large polymers, and numerical computation of the distribution function for polymers with different numbers of monomers.

2. Closed graphs were first encountered in the study of binomial edge ideals, which are ideals in the polynomial ring generated by the binomials x\_i y\_j - x\_k y\_l for all edges (v\_i, v\_j) and (v\_k, v\_l) such that v\_i = v\_k or v\_j = v\_l.
3. The above binomials form a Gröbner basis of the binomial edge ideal for lex order with a certain term order if and only if the labeling is closed.
4. Closed graphs have a property called narrow, which means that for every vertex and every longest shortest path, either the vertex is adjacent to the path or there is a vertex in the path that is adjacent to a vertex in the neighborhood of the vertex.
5. A connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow.
6. The number of layers of a connected graph with a closed labeling and diameter d is equal to d+1.
7. Every connected closed graph is narrow, meaning that every vertex is distance at most one from every longest shortest path.",1
98,"1. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles originating from outside the Earth that have been a major source of natural radiation since their discovery in the early 20th century. They have always been the source of the highest energy elementary particles known to humans, and have played a crucial role in the development of particle physics. The high-energy tail of the cosmic ray spectrum corresponds to energies up to 3 x 10^18 eV and rates of a few particles per km per century.
2. The composition of cosmic rays has been extensively studied, and for energies above a few tens of GeV, the detected particles are mainly protons with a remarkably isotropic distribution. This is understood in terms of diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields. However, as the energy rises above a given value that depends on the charge of the particle, propagation in the galaxy is expected to cease to be diffusive, and such high-energy particles are expected to be extragalactic.
3. The observation of high-energy cosmic rays has been reviewed recently, and there is increasing evidence for a different component of the high-energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum. Combining data from five different experiments, Nagano and Watson have shown that there is a clear signal of a change of the spectral slope in the region just above 10^18 eV. Composition studies have also given indications that there is a change to light element composition for energies above 10^19 eV, although this conclusion is model-dependent to some extent.
4. The highest energy events detected present a serious challenge to theory, and little is known about their origin. If they are protons, they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over distances of order 50 Mpc, resulting in a cutoff in the cosmic ray spectrum known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. However, no such features are seen in the observed cosmic ray spectrum, which has important implications for the origin and nature of these particles.",1
99,"1. Cold atoms in optical lattices is an application of quantum gases and laser theory from atomic physics and quantum optics, respectively. Optical lattices are artificial crystals of light created by the interference of two or more laser beams. Atoms can be cooled and trapped in these optical lattices, which can then be used to investigate quantum behavior and phenomena usually associated with crystals in a crystalline solid. The theoretical proposal and experimental realization of the superfluid to mott insulator (SF-MI) transition has been particularly important, as it has opened up the possibility of using cold atoms in optical lattices as a test laboratory for phenomena in condensed matter physics. This has led to a deluge of studies, as it brings together atomic physicists, quantum opticians, and condensed matter physicists.
2. The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in 1995 was a key breakthrough, as it led to the observation of the SF-MI transition and the possibility of using ultracold atoms in optical lattices to mimic phenomena in condensed matter physics. This has been used to study spin ordering in an isolated double-well-type potential, which is one of the simplest experimental setups of optical lattices to study spin hamiltonians. The double well can be considered as two localized spatial modes separated by a barrier and can be investigated as a two-mode approximation. The system can be completely controlled and measured in an arbitrary two-spin basis by dynamically changing the lattice parameters. On the theoretical side, the double well can be considered as a two-site version of the Hubbard model, which is a single band lattice model supporting a single atomic state that can hold up to two particles. The hamiltonian of the system consists of the superposition of six Fock basis states, with a basis state denoting the two wells. The wavefunction of the system is the superposition of all possible states, including singlet and triplet states. By tuning the potential bias, all the eigenenergies and corresponding eigenstates can be obtained analytically, which can be used to test the validity of the simple two-mode model.",1
100,"1. The family of iron pnictides is an important prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with various sub-families known to exhibit a phase transition from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic crystal symmetry, typically accompanied by the formation of long-range antiferromagnetic order. The suppression of these phase transitions is believed to be crucial for the emergence of superconductivity. However, understanding the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides has proven to be complex, with ongoing debates about the nature of magnetic moments and the role of correlation effects.
2. Experimental tools like angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) are essential for understanding the electronic structure of iron pnictides. However, DFT calculations often struggle to reproduce all features of ARPES spectra accurately, which is often attributed to strong correlation effects. Additionally, the connection between the magnetic phase of iron pnictides and the resulting consequences for ARPES is often overlooked, resulting in mixed magnetic domains that complicate the interpretation of macroscopic tools like ARPES or transport measurements.
3. Detwinning crystals by applying uniaxial stress during measurement can help address the issue of mixed magnetic domains, as demonstrated for the 122-prototype in the undoped and co-doped cases. However, such measurements are technically challenging and rarely done. A comprehensive study of the electronic structure in iron pnictides and the influence of in-plane anisotropy in the magnetic phase requires such studies, as there is now experimental data on detwinned crystals showing the anisotropy in the Fermi surface. Unfortunately, there is a lack of theoretical work focusing on this problem of magnetic anisotropy in ARPES data.
4. The document discusses a comprehensive DFT study on the magnetic phase of a specific iron pnictide and its corresponding ARPES spectra, with computational results that can be directly compared to available experimental ARPES data on detwinned crystals. The study employs the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-Green Function (KKR-GF) approach and the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with disorder due to substitution. The impact of surface termination on the anisotropy of iron pnictides in ARPES calculations is also highlighted, emphasizing the need",1

102,"1. The energy and lifetime of a resonance state can be calculated using various methods, with the complex scaling (dilatation) method being one of them. This method reveals a resonance state by the appearance of an isolated complex eigenvalue on the spectrum of the non-Hermitian complex scaled Hamiltonian. However, the implementation of this method requires a large enough rotation angle and the analysis of numerical data to determine the most accurate result.
2. The density of states (DOS) method can be used to obtain the energy and lifetime of a resonance state in a simple way. This method relies on the availability of the DOS and the Ritz-variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter. The resonance energy and lifetime are obtained as least square fitting parameters. However, there is no single procedure to assess the accuracy of the numerical findings and its convergence properties.
3. Pont et al. have used finite size scaling arguments to analyze the properties of the DOS when the size of the Hamiltonian changes. They presented numerical evidence of the critical behavior of the density of states in the region where a given Hamiltonian has resonances. The resonance energy and lifetime were obtained using the scaling properties of the density of states.
4. The feasibility of the DOS method to calculate the resonance lifetime depends on the availability of a known value of the lifetime, making the whole method dependent on results not provided by itself. The DOS method relies on the possibility to calculate the Ritz-variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter. For each basis-set size, there are variational eigenvalues, each one of which can be used to compute a DOS, resulting in an approximate value for the energy and width of the resonance state of the problem.",1

These systems can have real spectra even if their Hamiltonians are not hermitian. The paper describes how such systems can be realized in optics using controllable gain and loss, and mentions experimental realizations using coupled waveguides. The paper also discusses the stability of solitons in these systems and the possibility of engineering $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric oligomers and lattices.
2. The paper then introduces the concept of nonlinear $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, which incorporate $\mathcal{PT}$-balanced nonlinear terms. These systems have been studied mainly in one dimension, but the paper suggests the possibility of creating 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric oligomers and lattices. The paper also discusses the symmetry properties of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation used to describe these systems and the time reversal operation in this context. The paper then goes on to analyze the symmetry properties of a specific 2D plaquette and derives the corresponding parity matrix.",1

2. The two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year time scale, but some numerical simulations show long-term dynamical stability. The presence of planets around a binary, and in particular around a CV, is peculiar, but they could be common.
3. The inner planet in orbit around Hu Aqr allows for the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and mass of its core at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) to be broken, which can be used to derive the rate of mass loss in the common-envelope phase. The outer planet validates this calculation and determines the conditions under which the CV was born.
4. The presence of the inner planet in Hu Aqr allows for the derivation of the rate of mass loss in the common-envelope phase, which is a crucial parameter in understanding the evolution of CVs. The outer planet provides further constraints on the conditions under which the CV was born.
5. The response of the planet's orbit to mass loss depends on the total amount of mass lost and the rate at which it is lost. Numerical common-envelope studies indicate that for an in-spiraling binary, the entire envelope is expelled well within one orbital period of the inner planet, which leads to an impulsive response and the possible loss of the planet.
6. The eccentricity of the inner planet in Hu Aqr can be used to further constrain the rate at which the common-envelope was lost from the planetary orbit. The higher eccentricity of the outer planet indicates a more impulsive response, which is a natural consequence of its wider orbits with the same mass loss rate.",1
105,"1. The No-Core Shell Model with Resonating Group Method (NCSM/RGM) is a promising technique for treating both structure and reactions in light nuclear systems, which combines a microscopic cluster technique with realistic interactions and a consistent description of nucleon clusters.
2. The method has been introduced in detail for two-body cluster bases and has been shown to work efficiently in different systems. However, a three-body cluster approach is essential to study nuclear systems with a three-body cluster structure.
3. Three-body cluster configurations have been introduced into the method, and the first results for the ground state of 1he and its continuum states within a 2he+n+n basis have been presented.
4. The extension of the NCSM/RGM approach to properly describe three-cluster configurations requires expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states built from the NCSM wave function of each of the three clusters.
5. The microscopic Schrödinger equation is projected onto the basis states, and the many-body problem is mapped onto a system of coupled-channel integral-differential equations.
6. The Schrödinger equations are solved using the microscopic R-matrix method on a Lagrange mesh.
7. The approach has been developed for three-cluster systems formed by two separate nucleons in relative motion with respect to a nucleus of mass number A.
8. The lightest borromean nucleus, 1he, is an ideal candidate to be studied within this approach, and the model space used to describe the 2he core only includes its ground state wave function.",1
106,"1. The discovery of skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric compounds with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction has generated significant interest in the scientific community.
2. The preparation of thin films of B20-type MnSi on silicon substrates has offered promising prospects for spintronic device applications.
3. MnSi films provide a variety of magnetic phases and are easy to integrate into devices due to the established technology of using silicon as a substrate material.
4. The benefit of thin films compared to bulk material is the existence of the skyrmion phase in an extended region of the magnetic phase diagram due to uniaxial anisotropy.
5. The drawback of using MnSi films is the low magnetic ordering temperature, which is considerably below the liquid nitrogen temperature.
6. A suitable candidate for a compound with similar spin order at higher temperatures is the B20 compound MnGe, which has a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K.
7. The magnetic ground state of MnGe is a helical spin structure with a helix length between 3 nm at the lowest temperatures and 6 nm near Tc.
8. Recently, a large topological Hall effect exceeding that of MnSi was observed in MnGe, which was attributed to a skyrmion phase. Small angle neutron scattering experiments provided further evidence for the existence of skyrmions.",1
107,"1. A polynomial is postcritically finite if the forward orbits of its critical points are finite.
2. The filled Julia set of a postcritically finite polynomial contains a forward invariant, finite topological tree called the Hubbard tree.
3. The core entropy of a polynomial is the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its Hubbard tree.
4. The core entropy function can be extended to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers, which answers a question of W. Thurston.
5. The concept of core entropy generalizes the entropy theory of real quadratic maps, with the invariant real segment replaced by the invariant tree.
6. The restriction of the core entropy function to non-real veins of the Mandelbrot set is also monotone, which implies that the lamination for the Mandelbrot set can be reconstructed by looking at level sets of the core entropy function.
7. The value of the core entropy equals, up to a constant factor, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for the polynomial.
8. For dendritic Julia sets, the core entropy also equals the asymptotic stretch factor of the polynomial as a rational map.
9. An algorithm, devised by Thurston, can be used to compute the core entropy of a polynomial by considering a larger matrix whose entries are pairs of postcritical angles, requiring no knowledge of the topology of the Hubbard tree.
10. An infinite version of this algorithm can be developed to prove that the entropy function is continuous, and even Hölder continuous at certain angles.",1
108,"1. The detection of afterglows from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths suggests that most long GRBs are of cosmological origin. The so-called fireball model is strongly favored, but the puzzle of GRBs is far from being resolved. A major problem is that it is not known whether GRBs are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs, making it difficult to determine the energetics involved.
2. Three methods may help to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs: (1) based on analytic solutions, it has been proposed that optical afterglows from a jetted GRB should be characterized by a break in the light curve during the relativistic phase; (2) optical afterglows from a jet can be strongly polarized; and (3) due to relativistic beaming effects, the majority of jetted GRBs cannot be observed, but the corresponding late time afterglow emission can safely reach us, which are called orphan afterglows.
4. The ratio of the orphan afterglow rate to the GRB rate might allow measurement of the GRB collimation angle. However, the absence of large numbers of orphan afterglows in many surveys has been regarded as evidence that the collimation cannot be extreme. Recently, it has been argued that measurement of the GRB beaming angle using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult due to the low optical flux density when the afterglow emission from a jet begins to go into a much larger solid angle than the initial burst does.",0
109,"1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are elusive events in the universe that last for less than a minute and emit gamma rays. However, since the discovery of GRBs by the BeppoSAX satellite in 1997, it is known that GRBs also produce X-ray afterglows that can be detected for several hours or even days after the burst.
2. The text reports on two GRB afterglow observations carried out by the XMM-Newton satellite. GRB 011211 was detected and localized in the BeppoSAX WFC1 on 2001 December 11, and its afterglow was identified as a new point source in the optical R-band. The optical spectrum of the afterglow showed an absorption line system corresponding to a redshift of z=2.14.
3. GRB 001025 was detected by the RXTE All-Sky Monitor on 2000 October 25 and lasted for approximately 15-20 seconds. An optical afterglow was never detected for this GRB.
4. The XMM-Newton observation of the location of GRB 001025 started 1.9 days after the burst and detected two X-ray sources in the error box. The brighter source was analyzed and found to have a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.01, which is typical for X-ray afterglows of GRBs.
5. The spectrum of the GRB 011211 afterglow can also be described as a simple power-law with a photon index of 2.16, modified by the galactic absorption only. No significant spectral evolution was found during the observation.
6. The X-ray spectra in all or most of the observed afterglows are generated by a common physical process and do not depend much on the differences in the burst environments. The overall spectral shape can be fit to a popular model of synchrotron emission with possible inclusion of inverse Compton scattering.
7. No significant absorption above the galactic values has been detected in the X-ray spectra, which is unexpected if the burst occurs in a high-density star-forming region.
8. The text also discusses the discovery of a blue-shift",1
110,"1. A layered organic material, AI3, has recently regained interest due to the discovery of low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure. Compared to graphene and three-dimensional topological insulators, AI3 has several distinct features, including tilted Dirac cones, anisotropy in the Fermi surface, a smaller average Fermi velocity, and the presence of additional massive carriers near the Fermi level. These characteristics suggest that AI3 is a promising material for studying strongly correlated Dirac fermions, which are beyond the scope of graphene electrons.
2. Recent magneto-transport measurements on AI3 crystals under high hydrostatic pressure have revealed the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes. The interplay between these two carrier types at low energy is a significant finding. The measured mobilities for both carrier types suggest scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers. The analysis of data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity, and the material's behavior is similar to multi-carrier semiconductor systems. The magneto-conductivity is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor, and its analytical expression for a single carrier system is provided. The text also includes figures displaying magneto-conductivity curves, density and mobility as a function of temperature, and band structure calculations at different pressures.",1
111,"1. Fe-based superconductors (FEBS) are a non-cuprate class of high-temperature superconductors that can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides. They have a square lattice of iron as the basic element, with orthorhombic distortions in lightly doped materials. The Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the @xmath11 point and two electron sheets around the @xmath12 and @xmath13 points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone.
2. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which can result in different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation and distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure. The Random-Phase Approximation Spin Fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach suggests that the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets is the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations.
3. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure, as the measured dynamical spin susceptibility in the superconducting state carries information about the gap structure. There have been many reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems, which is commonly explained as the spin resonance appearing due to the s± state.
4. However, recent measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) have shown that there are at least two distinct gaps present in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LiFeAs. The very existence of the smaller gap raises the question of what the spin resonance frequency would be in a system with two distinct gaps.
5. The authors of the text study this question in detail and show that the naive expectation that the frequency shifts to the lower gap scale is wrong. They propose that the true minimal energy scale is consistent with the maximal frequency of the observed peak in INS in BaCo122 and confirms that it is the true spin resonance evidencing the s± gap symmetry. The maximal energy scale is determined by the relation between the exact band structure",1
112,"1. The presence of impurities can significantly alter the properties of a quantum system, including its coherence and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, if the impurity distribution is completely random, all states of the system are exponentially localized in one and two dimensions, while a mobility edge exists in three dimensions. However, if the impurity positions are correlated, some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum. This has been demonstrated in one dimension in the context of the random dimer model (RDMM) and the dual random dimer model (DRDMM).
2. The effects of correlated disorder in one dimension have been studied in various physical contexts. However, in two dimensions, the effect of correlations is mostly unexplored, except for the case of a speckle potential and for the case of pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions. Correlations in speckle potentials can mimic the presence of a mobility edge, but in the thermodynamic limit, all states are localized. Random dimers introduce a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2D lattices, as in 1D. From a statistical point of view, the main difference between these two models is the decay of the correlation function, which is algebraic for the first and exponential for the second.
3. The manuscript studies the effect of a short-range correlated disorder on a Bose gas confined on a 2D square lattice. The authors introduce a 2D generalization of the DRDMM (2D-DRDMM) and show that, in the non-interacting regime, there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized. This resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and is the same as the DRDMM in 1D.
4. In the presence of weak interactions, the 2D-DRDMM drives the homogeneity of the ground state. The disorder induces a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength, and enhances both in correspondence with the resonance energy of the 2D-DRDMM single-particle Hamiltonian.
5. The authors consider the tight-binding single-particle Hamiltonian and focus on a ",1

2. The text focuses on the class of generalized Petersen graphs, which are defined by two integers p and q. These graphs have a vertex set and an edge set, and can be divided into an inner subgraph and an outer cycle. The text also defines the concept of twin vertices and spokes.
3. The text presents known results about the independence number of generalized Petersen graphs, including a conjecture by Watkins that they admit a Tait coloring except for a specific case. The conjecture was later proved.

114,"1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is often considered unconditionally secure, but in practice, it is difficult for devices to meet the requirements for security, leading to successful attacks.
2. To combat practical attacks, countermeasures such as device-independent security proofs and experimental measures have been proposed.
3. A new scheme called Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD) has been proposed, which removes potential loopholes in detectors without sacrificing performance.
4. MDIQKD has been shown to cover twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD, and the only assumption needed is that the preparation of quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is (almost) perfect.
5. The characterization of the signal source is easier than that of the detection unit, and the imperfections of the sources, such as the basis-dependent flaw, decrease the achievable distance.
6. Two phase encoding MDIQKD schemes have been proposed and proven to be unconditionally secure, with simulations based on realistic parameters.
7. The first scheme covers shorter distances and may require less accuracy in state preparation, while the second scheme can cover much longer distances with precise state preparation.
8. The most general type of attacks has been considered, and unconditional security has been established for both schemes.",1
115,"1. Massive stars play a crucial role in the energy flow and material cycles that affect the evolution of galaxies, but their formation process is still not well understood.
2. Recent observations using advanced instrumentation have provided sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at wavelengths less affected by material that obscures the regions at shorter wavelengths, allowing for the study of individual massive protostellar systems.
3. High-resolution observations of four massive young stellar objects have inferred the presence of Keplerian disks very close to them, which suggests an accretion formation scenario for massive stars.
4. Further discrimination between accretion and merger models can be made by examining the properties, particularly the young stellar populations, of hot molecular cores.
5. The mid-infrared (MIR) window (7-25 µm) offers a powerful view of these regions, as the large column densities of material process stellar light to infrared wavelengths and diffraction-limited observations are readily obtained.
6. Class II methanol masers have been found to exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are generally either not associated or offset from UCHII regions.
7. Multi-wavelength (mm to MIR) observations of five star-forming complexes traced by methanol maser emission have found that maser sites with weak radio continuum flux are associated with massive, luminous, and deeply embedded cores, characterizing protoclusters of young massive (proto)stars in an earlier evolutionary stage than UCHII regions.
8. High spatial resolution observations of three of the five star-forming complexes have uncovered the embedded sources inside the cores at MIR wavelengths, revealing multiple point sources at close angular separations, which could be physically bound or simply close due to projection effects.",1
116,"1. The text discusses the use of modified theories of gravity to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. The authors focus on the Lovelock theory of gravity, which is a generalization of General Relativity to higher dimensions. The theory includes the Ricci scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which are both curvature invariants. The Gauss-Bonnet invariant is a topological term in four dimensions, but it can be used to study the dynamics of gravitational systems in higher dimensions.
2. The authors consider two scenarios for discussing the dynamics of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant in four dimensions. The first scenario is to couple the Gauss-Bonnet invariant with a scalar field, and the second scenario is to add a generic function of the scalar field to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The second scenario is known as ""GB gravity"" and is introduced as an alternative for dark energy.
3. The authors then discuss the reconstruction technique, which is a method for finding the function that generates a given cosmological solution. They apply this technique to some cosmological models in GB gravity and study their stability. They find that the de Sitter and power-law solutions are stable against linear perturbations.
4. The authors also discuss the stability of some cosmological evolutionary solutions about linear homogeneous perturbations in GB gravity. They construct the perturbed field and continuity equations and assume a general solution that satisfies the basic field equations for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe model. They then derive the equations of motion for the perturbed variables and the non-zero divergence of the energy-momentum tensor.
5. Finally, the authors apply the reconstruction technique to reproduce the Lambda-CDM cosmology in GB gravity. They find that the GB gravity can not explain the Lambda-CDM cosmological evolution, but it corresponds to cold dark matter evolution. They also analyze the stability of some cosmological evolutionary solutions about linear homogeneous perturbations in GB gravity and find that the de Sitter solutions are unstable, while the power-law solutions are stable.",1
117,"1. Majorana fermions (MFs) are real solutions of the Dirac equation and are their own antiparticles. They were originally proposed as a model for neutrinos but have recently been predicted to occur as quasiparticle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems.
2. MFs obey non-Abelian statistics, which is important for realizing potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.
3. The possibility of hosting MFs in exotic solid-state systems has focused on topological superconductors. Various realistic platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains, have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect.
4. Experimentally observing the unique Majorana signatures is still a challenging task. MFs are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs). However, ZBPs can also appear due to other mechanisms, such as the zero-bias anomaly caused by the Kondo resonance and disorder or band bending in the semiconductor nanowire.
5. To obtain definitive signatures of MFs, alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFs are necessary. An all-optical scheme to detect MFs using quantum dots (QDs) and nanomechanical resonators (NRS) is proposed.
6. The optical scheme provides a new platform for applications ranging from robust manipulation of MFs and MFs-based quantum information processing. The exciton resonance spectrum, when the nanomechanical resonator vibrates, enhances the exciton resonance spectrum significantly, making MFs more sensitive to be detectable.
7. The proposed optical measurement scheme detects the existence of MFs in iron chains on the superconducting Pb surface via a coupled hybrid QD-NRS system with an optical pump-probe scheme. The interaction between MFs in iron chains and the QD in the hybrid QD-NRS system is mainly due to the dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted by several tens of nanometers.
8. The change in the coherent optical spectrum, as a possible signature for MFs, is another potential evidence in the iron chains. The vibr",1
118,"1. The first evidence of time reversal symmetry violation was found in the kaon system, but no other signals have been discovered to date. However, studying time reversal symmetry has become a crucial aspect of searching for physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles.
2. Various alternatives or extensions of the Standard Model, such as grand unified theories and supersymmetric theories, imply specific ways of time reversal symmetry violation. These theories are formulated in terms of quarks and leptons, while nuclear low energy tests involve hadronic degrees of freedom. To relate hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom, effective potentials, like effective nucleon-nucleon potentials or mesonic exchange potentials, are introduced.
3. Experimental precision tests continue to make progress, and theorists face the challenge of translating these experimental constraints to a more fundamental interaction level. The paper aims to give estimates on hadronic matrix elements that arise when relating quark operators to the effective hadronic parameterizations of the time reversal symmetry violating interaction.
4. The text focuses on charge exchange and axial vector type exchange nucleon-nucleon interactions, which may be parameterized in terms of effective one boson exchange potentials. Two basic contributions are possible due to the behavior under specific symmetry transformations: a charged two-pion exchange and an axial vector exchange.",1
119,"1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by the absence of hydrogen and strong silicon lines in their spectra at maximum brightness. They are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies due to their uniform light curves and high luminosity.
2. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia. In this model, a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion star, increasing its mass until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes.
3. Recent progress in the accreting WD model includes the introduction of a stellar wind from the WD while it accretes material from the companion. This model has been successful in sustaining a stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
4. The accreting WD model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. These paths determine the type of companion star that leads to a SN Ia.
5. The evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia has not been confirmed by observations, which would require the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site.
6. Observations of the Tycho supernova remnant (SNR) have suggested the presence of a G2IV star as the companion of the SN. However, this identification is not yet confirmed and other means of proof are being proposed.
7. One proposed method for confirming the presence of a companion star is to look for the presence of broad wings in absorption lines in the spectrum of a star located inside the SN ejecta. This method relies on the fact that photons emitted from the star are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward us, resulting in a broad wing present only in the blue side of the absorption line.",1
120,"1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource that can be manipulated and characterized independently of its physical realization, and obeys a set of conservation laws. It is useful in making quantitative predictions and is regarded as a physical resource. The entropy of entanglement is a well-established measure of entanglement for pure bipartite systems, evaluated as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix. However, the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear for mixed quantum systems that interact with their environment.
2. A natural generalization of the entropy of entanglement for mixed states is its weighted average, but this measure can have infinitely many values due to the infinite ways a given density operator can be decomposed. To circumvent this problem, various measures have been proposed, such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation, which satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure set out by Horodecki et al.
3. Quantum trajectory theory can provide answers to questions about the behavior of open quantum systems at resonance, where the master equation offers limited insight due to the infinite characteristic time for the system to reach steady state. By considering the way information about the system is read from the environment through measurements, a measure of entanglement for open systems can be introduced that is contextual and dependent on the kind of measurements made. This approach can provide a more complete characterization of the entanglement than the above measures, but requires the removal of the inherent uncertainty of the mixed state description.",1
121,"1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are classified as Type 1 or Type 2 based on the presence or absence of broad emission lines, which is attributed to orientation-dependent circumnuclear obscuration.
2. The obscuring medium, known as the ""dust torus,"" is optically and geometrically thick, extending from sub-parsec to several tens of parsecs. It absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the energy in the infrared.
3. Type 1 AGN show more near-infrared emission than Type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity, consistent with the face-on view of the torus exposing the innermost hot dust to the observer.
4. The anisotropy of infrared emission in AGN samples can introduce biases when forming isotropic samples based on infrared fluxes. The wavelength dependence of this anisotropy can help distinguish between smooth and clumpy torus models.
5. High spatial resolution observations or using high luminosity objects can help mitigate the contribution of the host galaxy to the infrared emission.
6. The paper aims to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars.
7. The analysis is improved by applying host-galaxy subtraction for radio galaxies and using clumpy torus models for interpretation.
8. The authors find that the radio galaxies have systematically lower infrared emission compared to quasars, and this difference is most significant in the near-infrared.
9. The observed anisotropy can be attributed to differences in line-of-sight extinction or anisotropy in the re-emission of AGN-heated dust.
10. The authors argue that a single absorber and emitter (the dust torus) may be responsible for the radio galaxy/quasar anisotropy, which is supported by the wavelength dependence of the quasar/radio galaxy ratio in their sample.",1
122,"1. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is an unconditionally secure communication scheme between two parties, Alice and Bob, which has seen advancements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation. Practical implementation systems, such as fiber-based Gaussian-modulated and discrete-modulated coherent-state protocol QKD systems over tens of kilometers, have been demonstrated.
2. The unconditional security of such systems with prepare-and-measure (PM) implementation has been confirmed by the security analysis of the equivalent entanglement-based (EB) scheme. However, the traditional security analysis of the EB scheme of CVQKD only includes the signal beam and not the local oscillator (LO), which is an auxiliary light beam used for phase definition and balanced homodyne detection. This leaves security loopholes as LO is within Eve's manipulating domain.
3. Monitoring LO intensity is necessary for accurate security proofs in discrete QKD protocols embedded in continuous variables. Excess noise caused by imperfect subtraction of balanced homodyne detectors in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations has been noted and quantified. In practical CVQKD implementation, shot noise scaling with LO power is assumed to remain constant, with pulses having large fluctuations being discarded. However, this approach may give Eve an advantage in exploiting LO intensity fluctuations.
4. The paper discusses the security of practical CVQKD implementation under this attack and calculates the secret key rate with and without Bob monitoring the LO for reverse and direct reconciliation protocols. The analysis shows that the fluctuation of LO could compromise secret keys severely if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values.
5. In practical systems, LO intensity is monitored by splitting a small part with a beam splitter, and pulses with large LO intensity fluctuations are discarded. However, the precise impact of fluctuation, particularly small fluctuations, on the secret key rate is not yet fully understood.
6. The text also discusses the impact of imperfect measurement of balanced homodyne detectors due to incomplete subtraction in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations, but this aspect is not considered in the analysis for simplicity.",1
123,"1. The text discusses the development of a code for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models, with a focus on accuracy and flexibility in choosing integration methods and determining all frequencies of a given model within a specified range of degree and frequency.
2. The equilibrium model is defined in terms of a minimal set of dimensionless variables, as well as by mass and radius, and is used to calculate characteristic frequencies for adiabatic oscillations. The code provides extensive documentation and was tested using polytropic models.
3. The code introduces a new set of dependent variables for numerical integration in order to accurately represent the variation of variables in the model, particularly for large degree oscillations.
4. The equations are solved on a specified interval, typically involving a complete stellar model with a series expansion around the center and boundary conditions at the surface.
5. The code uses two main techniques for solving the equations: a shooting method and a relaxation technique, both of which are used to find the eigenvalue of the problem.
6. The code includes techniques for improving the precision of computed frequencies, including a variational principle and Richardson extrapolation.
7. The code also includes options for calculating rotational splittings and first-order rotational splitting in the special case where the angular velocity depends only on one variable. Additionally, a version of the code has been established for computing first-order rotational splitting for a given rotation profile.",1
124,"1. Highly structured Hi distribution, including cavities, shells, and supershells, is a common manifestation of activity in gas-rich galaxies. These features have been observed in a number of spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, and are often interpreted as expanding supershells with a loop-like or circular appearance in projection.
2. The kinetic energy of supershells can be attributed to internal or external sources. Internal source models involve starbursts, stellar winds, and supernova explosions, while external source models propose infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies.
3. The presence of extraplanar Hα filaments and star-forming regions in the disk of NGC 891, as well as correlations between halo emission and in-disk tracers of star formation, support internal source models. However, the energy deficit problem in these models remains a challenge, particularly for the largest shells, which may require hundreds of thousands of clustered supernovae.
4. Alternative explanations for the formation of Hi supershells include gamma-ray bursts and infall of massive gas clouds. Recent observations have revealed galaxies with extremely large Hi supershells but no evidence of interaction or nearby companions, suggesting the need for a new explanation.
5. The authors propose that Hi supershells can be formed by radio jets that plow through the interstellar medium, accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles. This internal energy source can resolve the energy problem and explain any spatial symmetries seen in Hi features.",1
125,"1. Baade's first color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for dwarf spheroidal (dSph) companions of the Milky Way, specifically the Draco system, showed all the features present in globular clusters' CMDs, including RR Lyrae stars. This led to the interpretation that dSph galaxies are essentially pure population II systems. However, Baade noted several characteristics that differentiate them from globular clusters, such as extreme red horizontal branches and distinct variable star characteristics.
2. The discovery of carbon stars in dSph galaxies led to the recognition that these differences are due to the presence of an intermediate-age population. This intermediate-age population has been shown in the CMDs of several dSph galaxies, such as Carina, Fornax, and Leo I.
3. An old stellar population, traced by a horizontal branch (HB), has been observed in all Milky Way dSph galaxy satellites, except Leo I. The absence of a conspicuous old population and the presence of a larger fraction of intermediate-age population in Leo I make it peculiar among local group galaxies.
4. Leo I's large galactocentric radial velocity suggests that it may not be bound to the Milky Way, unlike other dSph galaxies. Byrd et al. (1994) suggest that both Leo I and the Magellanic Clouds left the neighborhood of the Andromeda galaxy about 10 gyr ago.
5. The Magellanic Clouds also have a small fraction of old stellar population, similar to Leo I. The lack of detectable HI in Leo I and its morphology suggest that it would be considered a dSph galaxy. However, its unique characteristics, such as the lack of a conspicuous old population and a larger fraction of intermediate-age population, make it an enigmatic system.
6. New HST observations of Leo I have been presented in the paper. Previous work on Leo I is briefly reviewed, and the observations and data reduction are discussed. The photometry of the galaxy is reduced independently using both AllFrame and DoPHOT programs and calibrated using ground-based photometry.
7. The CMD of Leo I is presented, and the stellar populations and metallicity of the galaxy are discussed. The paper concludes that the star formation in Leo I has extended from at least 1",0
126,"1. The paper discusses the principal eigenvalue problem for a class of non-local operators, specifically the fractional Laplacian with zero Dirichlet exterior conditions.
2. The authors establish lower and upper bounds for the principal eigenvalue, which are used to prove the existence of a principal eigenfunction that attains the infimum of the Rayleigh quotient.
3. The proof of the lower bound involves constructing a sequence of functions that converge to the principal eigenfunction, and using the compactness of a certain operator.
4. The proof of the upper bound involves using the Green function of the fractional Laplacian and its properties, such as symmetry and the semigroup property.
5. The authors also discuss the relationship between the fractional Laplacian and the classical Laplacian, and show that the domains of these operators coincide.
6. The paper includes estimates for the Green function and transition density of the fractional Laplacian, which are used in the proofs of the main results.

2. Phase transitions, often involving symmetry breaking, are characterized by drastic changes in macroscopic properties.
3. Landau's theory of phase transitions, initially formulated phenomenologically, can be derived from microscopic principles using the renormalization group.
4. Order parameters are used to identify phases, with many known models allowing determination by symmetry considerations. However, topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin Hall states, or quantum spin liquids require more complex, non-local order parameters.
5. Machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, have shown promise in identifying order parameters for complex systems. They can approximate any function under mild assumptions and have been successful in image classification, speech recognition, natural language understanding, and predicting from high-dimensional data.
6. Physicists have started using machine learning techniques, primarily supervised learning algorithms and reinforcement learning, to tackle various tasks. Unsupervised learning algorithms can reproduce Monte Carlo-sampled states of the Ising model and identify phase transitions.
7. The authors use unsupervised learning to determine phase transitions without any information about the microscopic theory or the order parameter, transitioning from principal component analysis to variational autoencoders and testing their performance on different physical models.
8. Their algorithms find a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system that coincides with the correct order parameter, and the reconstruction error can be used as a universal identifier for phase transitions.",1
128,"1. Quantum cloning machines (QCMs) are devices that can produce copies of quantum states with varying degrees of accuracy, depending on their design conditions. They can create identical or non-identical copies, and the quality of the copying can be universal or state-dependent. QCMs have potential applications in quantum cryptography and quantum information processing, including eavesdropping on quantum channels.
2. The text discusses the use of partial QCMs, which copy only one constituent of a two-partite state. This approach can be used for cloning mixed states, which can be considered as reductions of pure states (purification). The choice of the unitary operator for the QCM is crucial, and various measures can be used to evaluate the quality of the cloning, such as fidelity. The text also discusses the use of a Bloch sphere for parametrizing the set of initial states and finding the optimal QCM parameters. The authors emphasize that the choice of parameters for the QCM depends on the strategy of eavesdropping and that there are many other possible variants for QCMs.",1
129,"1. The nature of dark matter remains unknown, but the success of the cold dark matter cosmological model suggests that a major component of dark matter is in the form of an elementary particle. However, there is still a possibility of a significant baryonic component of dark matter, as the observed baryons fall short of the total inferred from cosmic microwave background fluctuations. Some authors have proposed models with a large component of baryonic dark matter, including the possibility of cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds. These models predict gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray interactions within the clouds, which could yield a diffuse flux in the galactic plane comparable to the flux from known sources for photon energies around 1 GeV.
2. Previous investigations of this problem have neglected self-shielding and cascade phenomena, which can be important at high column densities and alter the emergent gamma-ray spectrum. The authors present detailed calculations of the gamma-ray spectra arising from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds, using a Monte Carlo simulation code, Geant4. They find that the predicted spectra differ substantially between high and low column-density clouds, and discuss the interpretation of their results in the context of the observed galactic gamma-ray emission. Their calculations are undertaken for cold, dense molecular gas in clouds of radius 1 cm, similar to those proposed to explain extreme scattering events during which compact extragalactic radio sources are magnified and demagnified as a plasma ""lens"" moves across the line of sight. However, the results depend primarily on the column-density of the individual clouds and their fractional contribution to the galaxy's dark matter halo.",1
130,"1. Colloidal crystals have the potential to develop into novel materials with unique optical properties, such as iridescent colors and photonic crystals. They have various applications, including lasers and display devices, and can even demonstrate tunable colors through control of lattice spacing with an external field.
2. Colloidal dispersions can be viewed as mesoscopic ""model atoms"" due to their well-defined thermodynamic temperature, allowing for the study of phase transitions and other phenomena typically associated with atomic systems.
3. The ability to tune colloid-colloid interactions has led to the observation of a wide variety of structures, including exotic crystal structures not found in atomic and molecular systems. External control of these interactions enables direct observation of phase transitions.
4. Single-particle-level microscopic observation allows for an unprecedented level of detail, opening up the possibility of addressing long-standing problems in condensed matter, such as freezing.
5. The introduction of a rotating AC field leads to dipolar interactions between colloidal particles, creating anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures. Rotating magnetic fields on granular matter have produced disc-like patterns, and similar structures may be observed in colloidal dispersions, which exhibit Brownian motion and can form thermodynamic equilibrium structures (crystals).
6. In quasi-2D colloidal crystals, lattice spacing can be controlled in situ using a coplanar rotating electric field. The interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field can be treated as a circularly symmetric attraction due to the time-averaging effect of a rapidly rotating field on relatively large particles.
7. To consider the interactions between colloids and smaller molecular and ionic species, coarse-graining schemes have been developed, generating a one-component picture where only effective colloid-colloid interactions are considered, reducing the complexity of the description.
8. The equilibrium behavior of the colloids in the original multi-component system can be faithfully reproduced using liquid state theory and computer simulation with a suitable effective colloid-colloid interaction.
9. The study presents a direct, quantitative comparison of a tunable interaction and a material property of the crystalline ""rafts"" formed in a model system of charged colloids in a rotating electric field. Experimental",0
131,"1. Soft X-ray transients (SXRTs) in outburst share similar properties with persistent low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star (LMXRBs).
2. Large variations in accretion rate in SXRTs allow investigation of neutron star regimes inaccessible to LMXRBs.
3. The origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in the quiescent state of SXRTs is unclear, but a possibility is a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) turning on.
4. AQL X-1, the most active SXRT known, has more than 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts, a 19-hour orbital period, and a K1V variable star companion.
5. AQL X-1 outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with type I X-ray bursts indicating a neutron star.
6. During outburst decay, the X-ray spectrum changes from soft to hard, and ROESAT PSPC observations revealed aql X-1 in quiescence at a lower energy band consistent with a blackbody temperature.
7. BEPPOSAX narrow field instruments observed the final stages of the AQL X-1 outburst decay, revealing a sharp decrease in luminosity described by an exponential decay.
8. The soft blackbody component remained nearly constant in temperature but decreased in radius, while the power law component changed substantially from decay to quiescence.
9. The sharp flux decay leading to quiescence is reminiscent of dwarf novae outbursts, but differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra suggest different efficiencies in gravitational energy release between white dwarfs and neutron stars.
10. The outburst evolution of low mass X-ray transients hosting an old neutron star or a black hole is built in analogy with dwarf novae outbursts, but important differences exist, likely due to the different nature of the underlying object.",1
132,"1. On October 9, 2006, @xcite reported the discovery of a possible supernova (SN) in UGC 4904. The supernova, SN 2006jc, was discovered after its peak, but an upper limit of the @xmath6 magnitude was obtained 208 days before the discovery. An optical transient was also reported in 2004, close to the position of SN 2006jc, which was speculated to be a luminous blue variable (LBV)-like event.
2. Spectroscopic observations showed many broad features and strong narrow emission lines, classifying SN 2006jc as a type Ib SN. However, strange spectral features and their evolutions were reported, including a bright blue continuum in the optical spectrum at early epochs and a red wing that brightened as the blue continuum declined.
3. The optical light curve showed a rapid decline from 50 days after the discovery, while near-infrared (NIR) emissions brightened. The NIR brightening, as well as the fact that the redder side of the He emission profile declined faster than the bluer side, has been interpreted as evidence of an ongoing dust formation. The formation of amorphous carbon dust was also reported.
4. The x-ray and UV emissions have been observed by the Swift and Chandra satellites, while the radio emission was not detected by the Very Large Array (VLA). A SN explosion model of a Wolf-Rayet star was presented to explain the bolometric and x-ray light curves.
5. The bolometric luminosities of SNe are usually estimated from the integration over the optical and NIR emission, but the spectra of SN 2006jc show bright red and blue wings, implying that the emissions in UV and IR bands considerably contribute to the bolometric luminosity. The bolometric luminosity was constructed with the integration of the UV, optical, and IR photometries obtained with various telescopes and satellites.",1

134,"1. The extinction curve describes how extinction changes with wavelength and is used to deredden magnitudes and colors of astronomical objects and to understand the physical properties of dust grains. Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (CCM) derived a mean extinction law that depends on one parameter, which they called @xmath0. This parameter characterizes the dust properties in the region that produces the extinction and ranges from about 2.0 to about 5.5.
2. The CCM law is powerful because it allows one to determine the extinction in some spectral region based on the extinction in a different spectral region, given that one knows @xmath0. Many authors have used this parameter to study extinction, such as searching for a relation between @xmath0 and other parameters that characterize the extinction curves, studying the role of @xmath0 as the main regulatory agent of the penetration of radiation inside dark clouds, and discussing different methods to deredden the data and obtaining a new estimate of the extinction law in terms of @xmath0.
3. The interstellar dust grains span a wide range of sizes and reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam by two physical processes: absorption and scattering. The extinction is the result of these two processes. The apparent magnitude of each star as a function of wavelength may be written as @xmath10 @xmath11, where @xmath12, @xmath13, and @xmath14 represent absolute magnitude, distance, and total extinction, respectively. The extinction as a function of @xmath15 may be obtained by comparing corresponding stars paired according to spectral properties.
4. The authors use the data taken from the CCM catalog of ultraviolet color excesses for stars of spectral types b7 and earlier. They use the equations for the coefficients for the last two regions listed in CCM's work, which are for the ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet regions. They use the data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite (ANS) to obtain the UV measurements. The sources of the data used to obtain @xmath66 as given by equation ([extinction]) and their errors are listed in table [table1]. The authors also consider another type of error, which is caused by the fact",1
135,"1. A hypergeometric system is a module determined by a matrix and a complex parameter vector. It is also known as a GKZ system and its solutions have applications in mathematics and physics.
2. The rank of a hypergeometric system is the dimension of its solution space at a nonsingular point. The authors provide a combinatorial formula for the rank in terms of lattice translates determined by the matrix and a parameter vector.
3. The formula yields a geometric stratification of the parameter space that refines its stratification by the rank of the hypergeometric system.
4. The relationship between the rank of the hypergeometric system and the lattice translates is made precise using Euler Koszul homology.
5. The exceptional arrangement, which is a subspace arrangement in the parameter space, is used to study the holonomic generalized hypergeometric system associated to a toric module.
6. The quasidegree set of a finitely generated graded module is the Zariski closure of the set of vectors for which the graded piece is nonzero.
7. The ranking arrangement is the union of the exceptional arrangement and an explicit collection of hyperplanes.
8. The rank jump of a hypergeometric system at a parameter is the nonnegative integer of parameters with nonzero rank jump. The exceptional arrangement can be described in terms of certain modules involving the hypergeometric system, and the ranking arrangement is an infinite union of translates of linear subspaces of the parameter space spanned by proper faces of the matrix.",1
136,"1. Quantum computers can perform certain algorithms much faster than classical computers, such as Shor's algorithm for factorizing numbers. Quantum computers use qubits and quantum logical gates to construct algorithms.
2. Qubits can be realized using semiconductor quantum dots with controlled electron numbers. The qubit state can be encoded using an electron charge or spin. Spin qubits have longer decoherence times and can be manipulated using electron spin resonance and read out via currents in spin-polarized leads.
3. Another concept for encoding qubits is based on singlet-triplet states in a double quantum dot (DQD). In this case, the magnetic field is not necessary, and the qubit preparation is performed by electrical control of the exchange interactions.
4. Divincenzo et al. suggested building the qubit in a more complex system, namely, in three coherently coupled quantum dots (TQD). The qubit states are encoded in the doublet subspace and can be controlled by exchange interactions. This subspace is a decoherence-free subspace, which is immune to decoherence processes.
5. Recent experimental efforts have been undertaken to achieve coherent spin manipulations in a linear TQD system. The initialization, coherent exchange, and decoherence of the qubit states have been shown in the doublet and doublet-quadruple subspace. The read-out of the qubit state was performed using the Pauli blockade effect.
6. The authors propose a new detection method for the qubit states, namely, a doublet blockade effect, which manifests itself in currents for a special configuration of the local potential gates. This method is fully compatible with purely electrical manipulations of the qubit.
7. The authors present studies of the dynamics of the qubit and demonstrate coherent and Rabi oscillations. The model is general and can be used for qubits encoded in the linear TQD, which is a one of the cases of broken symmetry in the triangular TQD.",1
137,"1. Symbiotic systems (SS) typically consist of a white dwarf (WD), a red giant (RG) star, and circumbinary nebulae. The nebulae emit radiation across a wide frequency range, from radio to X-rays.
2. The Z Andromedae (Z And) binary system is composed of a cool giant and a hot compact component. It has experienced multiple outbursts over a century, including a series of eruptions in 1984 and 1986.
3. The 1984-1986 outburst had two maxima, leading to ambiguity in interpretation as a double or disturbed single outburst. A drop in WD radiation flux may have triggered the observed trend in the light curve.
4. A shock wind collision model is used to calculate line spectra, accounting for varying wind velocity, preshock density, magnetic field, colour temperature, ionization parameter, geometrical thickness, dust-to-gas ratio, and abundances.
5. The 1984-1986 outburst is part of a longer activity period, as suggested by the trend of spectral observations between 1978 and 1993. The OI 1305 resonance line may be blended with an upper ionization level line.
6. The CII 1336 line's systematic decrease and increase indicate a strong correlation with the ionization parameter and shock velocity, with a less prominent role for WD temperature.
7. The physical parameters obtained by modeling the spectra throughout the 1984-1986 outburst reveal unexpected profiles compared to the visual light curve. Collision of the WD wind with RG shells and variations in shock velocity, density, and temperature are observed.
8. The gas composition at the epochs of collision with the shells suggests the presence of silicate grains after the first collision and gaseous Si in the next shell collision.
9. The emission from the nebula appears in a small frequency range between the optical and near-UV, with bremsstrahlung from the nebula downstream of shock fronts being the X-ray source for higher velocities. The bb flux from the RG and nebula dominates the sed in the visual, while the flux from the W",1
138,"1. Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks are emerging as novel materials for various applications, particularly as electronic materials, creating a need for accurate determination of their electrical properties.
2. SWCNT networks can be viewed as a two-dimensional network of conducting one-dimensional rods with large dimension ratio, leading to interesting behavior due to the high nanotube-nanotube junction resistance.
3. For sub-monolayer networks, junction resistance dominates the overall resistance and shows percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence. For networks with thickness in the tens of nanometers, the conductance through metallic tubes dominates, leading to metallic behavior.
4. Frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity have been investigated for individual SWCNT and some types of SWCNT networks.
5. There is a lack of systematic investigation on the frequency and electric field dependent conductivity for varying network densities and no correlation study between the onset frequency and the length scale determined from nonlinear transport.
6. Understanding the frequency and electric field dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks is important for applications such as high-speed transistors, transparent shielding materials, and interconnects in circuits.
7. The paper investigates the frequency and electric field dependent conductivity for SWCNT networks with systematically varying densities and finds that the onset frequency increases with film thickness while the length scale extracted from the electric field dependent measurement decreases.
8. An empirical relation between the two transport measurement methods is developed using the measured onset frequency and extracted length scale for different films.
9. SWCNT networks on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate are prepared by the spraying method, and the network density is controlled by the solution concentration and spraying time.
10. The corbino reflectometry setup is used to investigate the conductivity of the SWCNT networks, and the measurement procedures involve using two test instruments to cover a broad frequency range and a standard 4-probe method for electric field dependent conductivity measurement.",1
139,"1. Quantum algorithms, specifically Grover's algorithm, can perform certain tasks more efficiently than classical algorithms due to quantum superposition and interference. An example is the search of an item in an unsorted database, which can be done in square root of the time taken by classical algorithms.
2. Grover's algorithm has been realized using various physical systems such as NMR, superconducting qubits, and atom cavity QED systems. Superconducting qubit cavity QED is an attractive approach due to its strong coupling limit in microwave cavity. SQUIDs have attracted attention among superconducting qubits due to their design flexibility, large-scale integration, and compatibility with conventional electronics.
3. The goal is to implement three-qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level SQUIDs in cavity-QED. A three-qubit phase gate is considered, which reduces the number of quantum gates typically required for the realization of Grover's algorithm. The implementation of three-qubit Grover search is more complex as compared to the two-qubit case.
4. The scheme for implementing three-qubit Grover search is based on resonant and off-resonant interaction of cavity field with the transition of squid and application of resonant microwave pulses. The scheme does not require adjustment of squid level spacing during the implementation of Grover's search iteration, suppressing decoherence caused by the adjustment of level spacing.
5. The basic idea of Grover's algorithm is to prepare input basis states in superposition state, invert phase of the desired basis state through a unitary operator (called oracle), and then invert all the basis states about the average. The implementation of Grover's algorithm can be done using quantum logic networks, which can be constructed using quantum phase gates and single-qubit quantum gates.
6. The three-qubit controlled phase gate can be used instead of involving a series of two-qubit gates, simplifying the implementation and reducing the probability of error. The proposed implementation scheme for Grover's search algorithm, based on a three-qubit phase gate, is faster than one based on a two-qubit phase gate.",1
140,"1. The text discusses the use of many-body theory in the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra in metals. The theory takes into account the effects of conduction band (CB) electrons on the XPS peak from the core level. In the case of adiabatic excitation, the screening of the core hole by CB electrons leads to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy. However, if the excitation is not adiabatic, the CB electrons are left in a non-equilibrium state, leading to the appearance of plasmon replicas in the spectrum. These replicas correspond to different excited states of the system, with the main peak corresponding to the system left in quasi-equilibrium and subsequent peaks corresponding to states with one or more plasmons excited.
2. The text also discusses the application of this theory to the analysis of XPS spectra in graphene. In the case of pristine graphene, the chemical potential is not inside an energy band or a band gap, which makes the system special. Despite this, there is still a low-energy tailing in the XPS spectra. In the case of doped graphene, the chemical potential is inside an energy band, leading to the appearance of a tailing in the XPS spectra. However, the 2D character of the system means that the collective excitations are 2D plasmons, which contribute to the tail and make it difficult to make a quantitative interpretation of the spectra using Doniach and Sunji fitting. The text also discusses the effect of single-particle excitations and finite core hole lifetime on the XPS spectra.",1
141,"1. The text discusses the use of the Moran process, a mathematical model used to describe evolutionary dynamics, in the context of a two-genotype system with asymmetric mutation probabilities and nonlinear fitness functions. The Moran process is typically studied with symmetric mutation probabilities and linear interaction functions, but the authors argue that this is not always realistic. They derive the Fokker-Planck equation to describe the dynamics of the system and find that asymmetries in mutation probabilities can lead to the emergence of new stable points and the shifting of existing stable points.
2. The authors also discuss the impact of dynamic fitness, which can lead to multiple stable points in the dynamics caused by selection and genetic drift. They show an example where three stable points exist, two caused by selection and one by genetic drift.
3. The authors suggest that their results have implications for real biological systems, where multiple metastable equilibria may exist, leading to sudden shifts in the frequency of species over time. They propose that this could be due to complex inter-species interactions, and suggest that the Moran process could be used as a theoretical tool to study these dynamics.
4. The authors suggest several directions for further study, including the analysis of systems with more than two genotypes and the study of changing interactions that depend on the system dynamics. They also propose that their study could serve as a starting point for investigating how nonlinear frequency dependencies impact evolutionary dynamics in complex environments.",1
142,"1. The phase-field method is a popular tool for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity, which avoids tracking moving solid-liquid interfaces or grain boundaries by describing the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields.
2. The thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models has limitations, as currently available approaches cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness.
3. Orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification have issues, with the standard equation of motion for the orientation field not being appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
4. Including microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is challenging, and the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
5. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been enhanced in the last decade, but to be useful for simulating microstructure formation in solidification, phase-field models need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of the physical solid-liquid interfaces and the typical scale of the microstructures.
6. The thin-interface limit is used to guarantee precise simulations by analyzing the equations of the phase-field model under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale present in the problem.
7. The Kapitza resistance is an independent thin-interface effect that cannot be removed by an antitrapping current, which is a challenge for developing a general quantitative model.
8. The phase-field model for the solidification of a pure substance involves a phase-field evolution equation and a diffusion equation with a source term.
9. The sharp-interface solution to the problem of a steady-state planar front that propagates with constant velocity into a liquid of undercooling leaves behind a constant temperature, and the phase-field equations can be analyzed and related to this sharp-interface solution using the method of matched asymptotic expansions.",1

2. Large spectroscopic surveys, like SEGUE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO, and HERMES, are used to study individual stars and infer the characteristics of different populations of stars in the Milky Way.
3. Stellar parameters determined by spectroscopic methods are of key importance, as they are used to estimate distances, kinematics, and abundances of stars. High-resolution spectroscopy is used to correct low-resolution results.
4. A common method for deriving spectroscopic atmospheric parameters is to use the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and local thermodynamic equilibrium.
5. Both observational and theoretical evidence suggest that systematic biases are present in such analyses due to the breakdown of the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, particularly at low metallicity and/or surface gravity.
6. The authors aim to develop new methods to derive accurate spectroscopic parameters for FGK stars and apply these techniques to large stellar samples to study the chemical and dynamical properties of the Milky Way.
7. In this work, the authors utilize the RAVE survey to formulate the methodology to derive very accurate atmospheric parameters, focusing on the metal-poor sample to study the metal-poor thick disk of the Milky Way.",1
144,"1. Weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure has been detected in samples of high-redshift quasars (QSOs), intermediate-redshift galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It manifests itself as angular correlations between these sources and foreground inhomogeneously distributed mass or as a coherent shear effect in the case of galaxies.
2. Another way to detect weak lensing is by using fluxes of standard candles. If the observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen as brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess, while fainter ones have mass deficits in their foregrounds.
3. The best example of a cosmological standard candle is Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which have been extensively observed to determine the global geometry of the universe. Nuisance effects like evolution, variations in individual SNe, and gray dust extinction have been studied and either corrected for or shown to be small.
4. Weak lensing, another nuisance effect, has been addressed theoretically and found to be unimportant given the current uncertainties. For example, ray tracing through cosmological simulations has shown that the lensing-induced dispersions on truly standard candles are small (0.02 and 0.04 mag at redshift 1 and 2, respectively) compared to the current errors (0.11 mag).
5. However, weak lensing effects are estimated to be small but non-negligible for higher redshift sources. Therefore, the highest redshift SNe Ia have been examined for the effects of weak lensing due to galaxies along the line of sight.
6. Present-day high-redshift SNe Ia samples are dominated by lower redshift SNe, and so have not been examined for the effects of lensing. The main goal of the work described in the text is to determine if the observed fluxes of cosmologically distant SNe Ia have suffered significantly from lensing-induced (de-)amplifications.
7. The largest homogeneous compilation of SNe Ia contains 74 SNe at various redshifts. The authors use four different light curve fitting methods to estimate distances to SNe Ia and take the median of the estimates as the final quoted distance, with",0
145,"1. Heavy fermion (HF) metals are a major class of correlated electron materials with distinct behavior from conventional clean metals. Their behavior is driven by strong spin-flip scattering from essentially localized 3-levels, generating a large effective mass and low-energy scale.
2. The low-temperature state of HF is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened 3-spins, crossing over to essentially incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering at higher temperatures.
3. Physical properties of HF are typically anomalous, such as the resistivity showing a strong non-monotonic temperature dependence and optics often exhibiting rich structure from the microwave to the near infrared.
4. Theoretical treatments of HF center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.
5. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a framework that has had a major impact in recent years, providing a formally exact self-energy within the large-dimensional limit. However, a prerequisite to comparing theory to experiment is a method to solve the PAM, which DMFT does not provide.
6. Various methods have been employed to solve the PAM, including Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG), Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), Exact Diagonalization, Finite-order perturbation theory, Iterated Perturbation Theory, the Non-Crossing Approximation, and the Average-matrix Approximation.
7. The Local Moment Approach (LMA) is a method employed to provide a many-body description of dynamical and transport properties of paramagnetic HF, notably single-particle dynamics, DC transport, and optical conductivities.
8. The LMA is intrinsically non-perturbative and introduces the physically intuitive notion of local moments, leading to a 'two-self-energy' description that readily captures correlated spin-flip dynamics.
9. The LMA has been developed to encompass the Anderson lattice (PAM) and has been used to describe the transport and optical properties of kondo insulators, particularly in strong coupling where the system is characterized by an exponentially small indirect gap scale.
10. The LMA has also been extended",1
146,"1. The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied for several decades and is of particular importance in biology. The DNA loop formation is a basic process that underlies genetic expression, replication, and recombination. For example, in E. coli, the lac repressor (Laci)-mediated loop is crucial for the repressive regulation of lac genes.
2. The hairpin loop formation is the elementary step in protein folding and structure formation in RNA folding. A cell is crowded with a multitude of subcellular structures including globular proteins and RNAs, with which DNA is constantly interacting. A DNA fragment about to loop is often subject to temporally fluctuating forces due to its dynamic environment including the other part of the chain.
3. Recent studies have shown that the power spectrum of the fluctuating force exerted on the cytoskeleton is an order of magnitude larger than that expected from thermal equilibrium condition, indicating that the cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium. The advance of single molecule experiment techniques provides detailed information on the DNA loop formation.
4. Experiments have shown that static and temporally fluctuating tensions play a ubiquitous role in regulation of the DNA loop formation. However, there is no unifying conceptual or theoretical framework that explains a variety of experiments including these.
5. Theoretical studies have been conducted to understand DNA bending on short length scale and the effects of tension on the loop formation rate. However, it is hard to quantitatively compare these theories to the experiment as the loop formation rate is not proportional to the loop formation probability alone but depends on the free energy given an arbitrary chain end-to-end distance.",1
147,"1. Tidal interactions in close binary systems, such as star-star or star-planet systems, can lead to various phenomena including synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, disruption, and fall of an object onto the star. In this paper, the authors investigate the tidal interaction of a star and a point source (which can be a star or a planet) and consider the evolution of the star itself on time scales that depend on the orbital period of the binary system. They study dynamical tides by taking into account the stellar evolution for three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses.
2. The authors calculate the spectra of normal modes, overlap integrals, and time scales of the orbital parameters for each moment of the star's lifetime. They find that the brunt-Väisälä frequency, which determines the properties of the g-modes, is subject to significant changes as the stellar age increases, and this can directly affect the tidal forces. The brunt-Väisälä frequency exhibits a double-humped structure, with the first and second humps associated with the compositional and structural parts, respectively. The overlap integrals decrease in the low-frequency part of the spectrum as the star evolves, while in the high-frequency part, the absolute value of the overlap integrals increases and a characteristic structure appears in the spectrum in the form of kinks. The authors also calculate the change in the planet's orbital period for three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses, and find that the orbital period of a planet with a mass of one jupiter mass around the sun will reduce to a smaller value due to dynamical tides. The time scale of the change in semimajor axis for this orbital period and this solar age is several tens of millions of years, indicating that the planet will fall onto the sun within this time frame.",1

Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have enabled subwavelength imaging by accurately localizing individual fluorescent markers based on their optical characteristics or by selective activation of bright and dark states. However, the transparency of cells in fluorescence microscopy allows for noninvasive imaging of the interior of cells and detection of specific cellular constituents through fluorescence tagging, while turbid biological tissues or soft-matter systems can produce a blurred image due to intense scattering of photons.
2. A new approach is introduced to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment, based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light. This method could be useful in the study of conformational changes in biomolecules in living tissues and could provide an alternative to green function retrieval techniques based on the correlations of the isotropic ambient noise measured at two receivers. The method is based on capturing the interaction between two identical sources in a scattering environment, using only the measurement of intensity fluctuations, and could simplify green function retrieval techniques in complex media.",1
149,"1. The text discusses the mechanical behavior of cells and how it can be explained using polymer physics models. The comparison of cell rheological data with minimalistic in vitro reconstituted constructs of the cytoskeleton has provided new insights. Phenomenological mathematical descriptions, such as the glassy wormlike chain model, have been successful in describing the viscoelastic behavior of polymer solutions and living cells over many decades in time with a minimum of parameters.
2. The latest investigations have underscored the glassy, fragile, and inelastic character of the mechanical response of living cells. Experiments operating in the nonlinear regime have had to resort to special protocols to minimize plastic flow and make contact with dedicated theoretical models. The text aims to extend the theoretical model to situations involving inelastic deformations, starting with reversible inelastic behavior.
3. The text introduces an extended reversible inelastic version of the wormlike chain model, which is used to explain the mechanical response under pulsed and periodically pulsed loading. The model exhibits the hallmarks of nonlinear cell mechanics, such as strain/stress stiffening, fluidization, and cyclic softening.
4. The text also discusses the relevance of structural heterogeneities in networks of semiflexible polymers for the mechanical properties. The glassy wormlike chain model is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike chain model, which describes the mechanics of an isolated semiflexible polymer in an isothermal viscous solvent.
5. The text concludes by summarizing the key features of the wormlike chain model and the extended reversible inelastic version, and by discussing the relevance of structural heterogeneities for the mechanical properties of semiflexible polymer networks.",1
150,"1. Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with non-trivial topological invariants and robust surface metallic states, typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction.
2. All known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements, which poses constraints on the search for topological materials. However, it has been proposed that ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons can generate effective spin-orbit couplings, leading to TIs.
3. An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, resulting in a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI).
4. The stability of TMIs and the estimation of the critical value of interaction on the honeycomb lattice have mainly been considered by mean-field calculations, which cannot treat correlation effects satisfactorily. However, perturbative renormalization group methods suggest that TMIs become stable for infinitesimally small relevant Coulomb repulsions due to the quadratic band crossing with vanishing Fermi velocities.
5. In the honeycomb lattice, the long-period charge density wave (CDW) instability must be considered on equal footing, which is not captured in small-unit-cell mean-field ansatz employed in previous studies.
6. The most plausible symmetry-breaking competing with TMIs is a first-order quantum phase transition, which is hardly captured by theoretical methods focusing on diverging order-parameter fluctuations. Quantum many-body fluctuations beyond the mean-field approximation severely affect the stability of the TMI.
7. By reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones, the TMI tends to be stabilized. This can be achieved in an extended hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice by controlling the Fermi velocity and employing a variational Monte Carlo method with many variational parameters.
8. For the realization of TMIs in real materials, the suppression of the Fermi velocity of the Dirac electrons is crucial. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) offers Dirac electrons with tunable Fermi velocities and has been observed to achieve the quadratic band crossing (zero Fermi velocity limit) in experiments. However,",1
151,"1. Graphene-based transistors have moved one step closer to reality with the realization of a gate-induced band gap in Bernal stacked bi-layer graphene. However, the sub-gap conductance measured in this gapped bilayer is not as insulating as expected, introducing a new puzzle and obstacle. Dominant transport along the physical edge of the samples has been ruled out, and a new theory suggests the existence of a topological gapless channel of transport along a recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary network.
2. The predicted topological edge state would be the first realization of a topological surface(edge) state hosted by a structural topological defect. Although there has been much theoretical interest in topological gapless modes hosted by structural topological defects, none have been observed so far. The AB-BA tilt boundary is a structural topological line defect along which each neighboring layer is displaced by one inter-atomic spacing, and it can occur due to the third dimension added by the stacking of the graphene layers.
3. The AB-BA tilt boundary hosts gapless modes of topological origin and forms the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states. These gapless modes are protected by no valley mixing, electron number conservation, and time-reversal symmetries within the framework of SPT. The quantum valley Hall effect with corresponding edge states is expected in gapped multi-layer graphene, but there has been no experimental detection of the proposed edge state to date. The idea of classifying different topological insulator (superconductor) candidates based on symmetries has played a key role in the field of topological insulators, and the same approach can be applied to study a large class of gapped graphene systems.",1
152,"1. Ionizable polymers in solution can be classified into polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes, depending on the acidic or basic property of their monomers. These charged polymers have numerous industrial and medical applications and are often water-soluble. In a polyelectrolyte chain, intra-chain electrostatic interactions are repulsive and tend to swell the chain, while in a polyampholyte chain, attractive interactions between charged monomers of opposite sign tend to decrease the chain size.
2. The properties of a single polyampholyte and the solution of polyampholytes depend noticeably on the sequence of charged monomers on the chains. For example, the sequence of charged amino acids along ionically complementary peptides affects the aggregation behavior and self-assembling process in the solution of such peptides. Also, the charged monomers sequence of charge-symmetric polyampholytes affects their adsorption properties to a charged surface.
3. Brushes formed by grafted polymers have great interest in industrial and biological applications and academic research. With a sufficiently strong repulsion between the polymers, the chains become stretched and the structure obtained is known as a polymer brush. In a brush of charged polymers, electrostatic interactions introduce additional length scales such as Bjerrum length and Debye screening length to the system.
4. In a polyelectrolyte brush, the repulsion of electrostatic origin between the chains can be sufficiently strong even at low grafting densities, making it easy for the system to access the brush regime. Polyelectrolyte brushes have been investigated extensively using both theoretical and computer simulation methods. At high enough grafting densities and charge fractions of polyelectrolyte chains, most of the counterions are trapped inside the polyelectrolyte brush and competition between osmotic pressure of the counterions and elasticity of the chains determines the brush thickness.",1
153,"1. The light flavor scalar mesons present a challenge to the naive quark model, and their structures have not been definitively determined. Some candidates for these mesons are thought to be glueballs, molecular states, or tetraquark states. The mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 are good candidates for molecular states, but their ""cousins"" @xmath7 and @xmath8 are more difficult to identify as molecular states. There may be different dynamics that dominate the mesons below and above a certain energy, resulting in two scalar nonets below a certain energy. The strong attractions between certain diquark states may result in a nonet of tetraquark states that manifest below a certain energy, while the conventional @xmath3 nonet has masses around a certain energy.
2. The article discusses the use of colored diquarks as basic constituents for a new spectroscopy of mesons and baryons. The authors construct color singlet tetraquark currents with scalar diquark fields and perform the standard procedure of QCD sum rules to study the nonet scalar mesons below a certain energy. The interpolating currents are constructed from basic diquark fields instead of quark and gluon fields, and the authors take the isospin limit for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 quarks. The authors also study the structures of pseudoscalar mesons and scalar diquarks in the framework of the coupled rainbow Schwinger-Dyson equation and ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation using a confining effective potential. They observe that the dominant Dirac spinor structure of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes of the scalar diquarks is @xmath57. The attractive interaction of one-gluon exchange favors formation of diquarks in certain color, flavor, and spin configurations. Lattice QCD studies and studies based on the random instanton liquid model support the use of scalar diquark fields to construct tetraquark currents.",1
154,"1. Time-domain simulation is an important approach for power system dynamic analysis, but it can be expensive due to the large number of differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) required to represent different components of the system, which involve different time scales from milliseconds to minutes.
2. Intense efforts have been made to accelerate the simulation of long-term stability models, including using a larger time step size to filter out fast dynamics or automatic adjustment of step size according to system behavior. Another approach is to implement the quasi-steady-state (QSS) model in long-term stability analysis.
3. The QSS model suffers from numerical difficulties when the model gets close to singularities and may not provide consistent approximations of the long-term stability model. Sufficient conditions of the QSS model were developed, pointing to a direction to improve the QSS model.
4. This paper applies pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) method, a theoretically-based numerical method, to power system long-term stability analysis to accelerate simulation speed and overcome possible numerical difficulties in the QSS model.
5. PTC is a physically-motivated method that follows the solution of dynamical systems accurately in early stages and increases the time step to gain rapid convergence to steady state. It can avoid converging to nonphysical solutions or stagnating when the jacobian matrix is singular.
6. The paper presents three numerical examples to show the feasibility of the method in the long-term stability model and the QSS model. The proposed algorithm is shown to overcome numerical difficulties and provide correct approximations in the qss model.",1
155,"1. The study of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2d) has gained significant interest due to the potential for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases. Recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps has opened up opportunities to realize these phenomena. The theory of elementary quantum two-body systems and processes in the plane has been developed, focusing on the anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction. A new method for quantitative analysis of 2d quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer is presented, which allows for the description of 2d collisions of unpolarized dipoles.
2. The method is based on the few-dimensional scattering method and is applied to the 2d scattering on the cylindrical potential with the elliptical base and the 2d dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles. The method reproduces the threshold formula for the scattering amplitude on the cylinder potential with the circular base and the results of previous studies for the 2d scattering of polarized dipoles. The high efficiency of the method has been found in all problems being considered. The quantum scattering on the anisotropic potential in the plane is described by the 2d Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates with the scattering boundary conditions in the asymptotic region and the Hamiltonian of the system. The interaction potential can be anisotropic in the general case, and the task is to solve the problem for all possible orientations of the scatterer and fixed energy with the scattering boundary conditions. The scattering amplitude is found, and the differential scattering cross section and the total cross section are calculated by averaging over all possible orientations of the scatterer and integration over the scattering angle.",1
156,"1. G65.2-0.5, also known as G65.3+5.7, was identified as a supernova remnant (SNR) and the subject of several observational papers. However, it was later ignored until recently when it became interesting again due to its connection to an unusual class of SNRs called thermal composite SNRs or mixed morphology SNRs.
2. Thermal composite SNRs have a shell-like radio continuum morphology and a centrally bright X-ray morphology, where the X-ray emission is due to thermal, rather than synchrotron, processes.
3. G65.2-0.5 is a thermal composite SNR, and its X-ray emission is due to thermal processes, as evidenced by its _ HEAO 1 _ spectrum, which exhibits line emission.
4. The remnant's X-ray emission is not point-like and fills the remnant's outline, as shown by archival _ ROSAT _ data.
5. The remnant's X-ray emission exhibits a slowly decreasing temperature gradient, and its apparent flux of 0.11 to 2.04 keV photons is 1.1 x 10^-10 ergs s^-1 cm^-2.
6. The remnant's electron density is lower than that of the archetypical thermal composite supernova remnant, W44, causing its luminosity to be lower as well.
7. The remnant's band 45 and band 67 X-ray images reveal a slightly extended point source, but there is no known pulsar at this location.
8. The remnant's X-ray and radio observations establish its membership in the thermal composite (mixed morphology) class of supernova remnants.
9. The remnant's puzzling class of remnants has inspired several theoretical explanations, including the evolutionary hypothesis, where these remnants have evolved beyond the adiabatic phase into the radiative phase, and the collision hypothesis, where collisions with molecular clouds cause the characteristic thermal composite morphology.",1
157,"1. Permutations are a fundamental building block in the succinct encoding of various data structures such as integer functions, strings, and binary relations. A permutation can be trivially represented in approximately its information-theory lower bound of bits. Efficient computation of both the permutation and its inverse is often required in many applications. While the lower bound of bits yields a lower bound of comparisons to sort such a permutation in the comparison model, research has focused on finding better sorting algorithms that can take advantage of specific permutation properties.
2. Compression schemes for permutations do not necessarily support the inverse of the permutation or its application in reasonable time. This study describes several encodings of permutations so that, on interesting classes of instances, the encoding uses bits while supporting the operations and in time . These compression schemes are then applied to various scenarios, such as the encoding of integer functions, text indexes, and others, yielding original compression schemes for these abstract data types.",1
158,"1. Chimera states, which are the coexistence of coherent and incoherent oscillations in a network of identical phase oscillators, have been observed in various models such as Kuramoto phase oscillators, periodic and chaotic maps, Stuart-Landau oscillators, and coupled chemical oscillators. These states have been shown to emerge naturally in a mechanical experiment involving two subpopulations of identical metronomes coupled in a hierarchical network. In the context of neuroscience, chimera states are believed to explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in many birds and dolphins. A new study has identified a variety of single and multi-chimera states in networks of non-locally coupled neurons represented by Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators.
2. The study also identifies a new ""mixed oscillatory state"" (MOS) in which desynchronized neurons are uniformly distributed among those attracted by a stable stationary state. Chimera-like patterns have also been discovered in the more natural setting where only the membrane potential variables are coupled. The more realistic 3d-HR model, which includes a third variable representing a slowly varying current, exhibits bursting modes and only states of complete synchronization and MOS have been observed. However, when coupling is allowed only among the first (membrane potential) variables, chimera states are discovered in cases where spiking occurs within sufficiently long bursting intervals. The study of the collective behavior of a system of nonlocally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators and the investigation of the existence of chimera states in relation to the values of all network parameters is also discussed.",1
159,"1. Kauffman networks are disordered dynamical systems used to model genetic regulatory systems. They were studied using mean field theory and a dynamical phase transition was found. In this paper, the authors focus on the structural properties of the networks that determine their attractors. They introduce the notion of relevant elements and study their probability distribution. In the next paper, they describe how the relevant elements are subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules. The modular organization of random Boolean networks was already suggested by Kauffman and used to study analytically the attractors in certain networks. The authors show that it is possible to describe the phase transition in random Boolean networks in terms of the scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size or in terms of a percolation transition in the set of the relevant elements.
2. The authors computed the properties of the attractors in the framework of the annealed approximation, but observed that the results of this approximation are reliable only when the system is chaotic enough. They propose a new approximation scheme that works better in the frozen phase and on the critical line. This region in parameter space is the most interesting one, since it reproduces some features of real cells and is also the less understood.
3. The authors define the Kauffman model, which consists of a set of elements, each with a binary variable representing its state of activation. Each element is under the control of other elements, and its state is determined by the states of its control genes and a response function. The control elements and response functions are chosen at random. The dynamics of the system obey a deterministic but disordered evolution law. The authors are interested in the probability distributions of the number, length, and size of the attraction basins of the different periodic orbits, as well as in the distribution of transient times. They observe that two dynamical regimes are present, and that the line separating them has properties reminiscent of those of real cells. In the chaotic phase, the average length of the cycles increases exponentially with system size, while in the frozen phase, the typical length of the cycles does not increase with system size. The authors also discuss the distribution of the weights of the attraction basins and the number of different cycles in a network.",1
160,"1. The text discusses the phenomenon of turbulence in quantum fluids, specifically in superfluid helium and one-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In these systems, many quantized vortices with quantized circulation are nucleated, forming tangles, which is different from classical turbulence (CT) in classical fluids where the circulation of the velocity field is not quantized. The element of quantum turbulence (QT) is believed to be useful for the understanding of CT.
2. The text also discusses a new trend in turbulence study in multi-component BECs, which have various characteristic features, including the realization of multicomponent BECs. In this system, there exists not only a velocity field but also a (quasi) spin field. Due to the spin degrees of freedom, various topological excitations such as monopole, skyrmion, knot, domain wall, and vortex can be generated, leading to novel turbulence where both the velocity and spin fields are much disturbed.
3. The text also discusses the possibility of a Kolmogorov spectrum in spin-superflow turbulence (SST) with hydrodynamic equations obtained from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The authors apply three approximations to these hydrodynamic equations and obtain the equations for spin motion and velocity motion. By applying a Kolmogorov-type dimensional scaling analysis, the authors obtain the -5/3 and 4/5 power laws for the velocity and spin fields, respectively. These power laws are confirmed by numerical results, indicating that the spectrum of the kinetic energy of SST can obey the Kolmogorov spectrum.",1
161,"1. Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) are thought to have low luminosities due to very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes, and are predicted to have a ""submillimetre bump"" in their spectral energy distribution (SED) caused by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) rather than a standard disc.
2. The ADAF model predicts high brightness temperatures in radio bands, making future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments promising for imaging accretion discs. However, there is a gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum at low-frequency radio bands, indicating the existence of additional unknown emission.
3. About half of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and LINERs, and at least 25% of transition objects, hold a compact radio core. Most of the cores show nearly flat spectra in 0.5-arcsec resolution, indicating jet domination.
4. An ADAF+jet model has been proposed to explain the radio excess in some LLAGNs, and high-frequency observations are promising for detecting the inverted spectrum of the ADAF due to less contamination from non-thermal jets and larger flux densities at higher frequencies.
5. The authors report millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs, and find that at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz, indicating the presence of the ADAF.
6. The submillimetre fluxes measured with the SCUBA on the JCMT may be from the dust associated with host galaxies, and the inverted spectra are not caused by resolution effect but intrinsic properties of the cores.
7. The authors suggest that the relative radiative efficiencies between the jet and disc in LLAGNs are determined by some kind of physical parameter(s) in the central engine, and the central engines of LLAGNs probably can produce jets.",1
162,"1. Dust grains in the interstellar medium affect the propagation of starlight through scattering, absorption, and reradiation. Studying these processes has provided insights into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains.
2. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, which can be quantified by the normalized dust extinction law (or reddening law). The ratio of total to selective extinction is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.
3. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with an average R0 value of around 3.1, but this is not universal. Significant deviations from this canonical R0 value and corresponding differences in the overall shape of the extinction/reddening law are known to exist for various interstellar dust clouds.
4. The variations in R0 appear to be generally correlated with environment, with higher R0 values found in dense molecular clouds and lower R0 values in more diffuse, high-latitude cirrus clouds.
5. Measurements of R0 along many sight lines through a broad range of cloud types are necessary to improve our understanding of the dependence of R0 on environment.
6. The traditional method of spectral typing individual cluster stars, in conjunction with photometric measurements, allows for a direct and precise measurement of extinction and reddening. However, this method requires high-quality, flux-calibrated spectra and a good understanding of the effects of metallicity on the energy output of stars.
7. The study proposes three methods for measuring the R0 of dust in the foreground of differentially-reddened globular clusters using broad-band photometry, which are based on the premise that the width of the blue horizontal branch (HB) is minimized when the appropriate R0 value is used to correct the photometry for extinction and reddening.
8. The methods are applied to NGC 4833, a low-latitude galactic globular cluster with variable extinction across its face, and realistic Monte Carlo simulations of the cluster data set are used to estimate the accuracy with which R0 can be recovered.",1
163,"1. Heavy fermion systems are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, with the Kondo scale marking the screening of local magnetic moments through a many-body effect that entangles the spins of conduction electrons and local moments.
2. Below the coherence temperature, which tracks the Kondo scale, a paramagnetic heavy fermion liquid emerges, characterized by a large fermi surface with Luttinger volume including both magnetic moments and conduction electrons.
3. The competition between Kondo screening, which favors paramagnetic ground states, and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which favors magnetically ordered states, is at the heart of quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion systems.
4. Two radically different scenarios have been put forward to describe this quantum phase transition: the standard Hertz-Millis picture, where the quasi-particles of the heavy-fermion liquid remain intact across the transition and undergo a spin-density wave transition, and alternative scenarios where the quantum critical point is linked to the breakdown of the quasi-particle state and a topological reorganization of the fermi surface across the transition is expected.
5. Recent experiments show that a change in fermi surface topology must not necessarily occur only at the magnetic order-disorder quantum critical point (QCP), but can be shifted to either side of the QCP via application of positive or negative chemical pressure.
6. The paper addresses these questions through an explicit calculation of the fermi surface topology in the framework of the Kondo lattice model (KLM), using dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations aimed at investigating the KLM ground state. The results show that the KLM can describe the competition between RKKY-mediated spatial magnetic order and the time-displaced correlations responsible for Kondo screening, and that the DCA is a well-suited approximation for use with the KLM.",1
164,"1. The discovery of a resonance at 125 GEV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), compatible with expectations for the Higgs particle, is a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles. This discovery may also affect the subfield of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature may be beneficial for having the Higgs responsible for inflation and as a suppression mechanism for the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields.
2. White dwarfs can be used to obtain limits on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant by means of spectroscopic observations. This is demonstrated by the analysis of data taken from the HST archive on a second white dwarf, Procyon b, in addition to a carbon-rich white dwarf, BPM 27606, using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). The search for coupling between the Higgs (or any scalar field permeating the whole universe) and spacetime curvature arises naturally within the framework of field theory in curved spacetime. The lagrangian density for an interacting scalar field in a generic spacetime characterized by the metric tensor is written as L = (1/2)g^(1/2)g^(ij)∂\_iφ∂\_jφ - (1/2)m^2g^(1/2)φ^2 - (1/4!)g^(1/2)λφ^4 - (1/2)ξRg^(1/2)φ^2, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor, ∂\_i is the partial derivative with respect to the i-th coordinate, m is the mass parameter of the scalar field, λ is the self-coupling quartic coefficient of the scalar field, R is the Ricci scalar, and ξ is the coupling constant between the scalar field and the Ricci scalar. The coupling constant ξ is a free parameter in any model so far imagined to describe scenarios of scalar fields coupled to gravity, and it is therefore important to extract this coefficient, or upper bounds, from phenomenological analyses.",1

166,"1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into distinct phases: hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium. Star formation is restricted to cold dense gas and is strongly correlated with the molecular gas content. However, the presence of molecules may not be the cause of star formation but rather a marker of the cold and dense regions where gravitational collapse can occur.
2. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Tracking molecular chemistry is crucial for accurately representing small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations of star-forming clouds. Molecular gas is predominantly found in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity.
3. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, called photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively. The outer layers of a PDR are typically composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon, with the atomic-to-molecular transition beginning to occur as column density increases. The chemistry and thermodynamics of PDRs become dominated by deep penetrating cosmic rays and the freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains in the inner layers.
4. Simulating the ISM and star formation is a computational challenge due to the enormous range of spatial scales involved. Three-dimensional simulations have attempted to replicate a supernova-driven ISM, with varying degrees of success in reproducing a multiphase ISM or demonstrating the regulation of the star formation rate by stellar feedback. However, studies examining the atomic-to-molecular transition within large-scale, three-dimensional simulations have received less attention.",1
167,"1. The discovery of an overdensity of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been interpreted as an intervening population of stars that may represent a dwarf galaxy or tidal debris. This overdensity, labeled as the VRC (Vertical Extension of the Red Clump), has been analyzed and found to be a massive foreground population with about 5% of the angular surface density of the LMC itself. This conclusion, if true, would have profound consequences for the interpretation of galactic microlensing studies, as this stellar foreground population could be responsible for a sizable fraction of the microlensing signal toward the LMC. However, this explanation has been challenged on several grounds, including the lack of evidence for a foreground population in the MACHO team's extensive photometric database and the incompatibility of the feature's redder color with the hypothesis of a foreground clump population.
2. The origin of the VRC feature observed in the color-magnitude diagrams of the LMC has been debated, with some arguing for an intervening stellar population and others for a stellar evolutionary origin. Using BVR CCD photometry of several fields at different locations in the LMC, a team of researchers has confirmed the presence of substructure in LMC red clump morphology corresponding to the VRC. However, they argue that the origin is likely to be due to stellar evolution, not an intervening population. They demonstrate that the VRC corresponds precisely in magnitude and color to the so-called ""blue loops"" experienced by aging intermediate-mass core helium-burning stars.
3. The team also shows that similar red clump morphology is present in the cmd of Hipparcos, which probes stellar populations on scales of 100 pc from the sun, where intervening dwarf galaxies or tidal debris cannot be invoked. Finally, they analyze the argument used by Zaritsky & Lin to reject stellar evolution as the cause of the VRC and show that a more realistic model for the star formation history in the LMC is not only consistent with the VRC but also provides a better fit to the data.",1

4. However, the fraction of demi-LIRGs remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.
5. The paper finds no evidence of a correlation between the cluster specific star formation rate and cluster mass, indicating that transformation mechanisms which scale strongly with cluster mass may not play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in clusters.
6. The results suggest that strangulation, a cluster mechanism that cuts off a galaxy's resource for future cold gas supplies, may be an important cluster mechanism for regulating star formation in dense environments.",1

2. The importance of multi-nucleon events has been suggested in many calculations of charge-changing quasielastic cross sections. The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data.
3. A growing interest has arisen in including 2p-2h models into the Monte Carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations. The only 2p-2h model implemented up to date in some of the Monte Carlo neutrino event generators corresponds to the so-called IFIC Valencia model, which has been incorporated in GENIE.
4. Implementing 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo codes is challenging due to the high computational time required for the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over the final 2p-2h states.
5. Approximations can be made to speed up the calculations, such as choosing an average momentum for the nucleons in the local Fermi gas, neglecting the exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations to two nested integrals by performing a non-relativistic expansion of the current operators.
6. In this work, the authors present a fast and efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model (RFG) using the frozen nucleon approximation.
7. The frozen nucleon approximation was found to work properly in computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators.
8. The authors investigate the validity of the frozen approximation beyond the phase-space study by including the electroweak meson-exchange current (MEC) model and find that the presence of virtual delta excitations requires the introduction of a ""frozen"" propagator, designed by a convenient average over the Fermi sea.",1
171,"1. The accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the nucleus of galaxies is believed to be the source of activity in quasars and Seyfert galaxies, also known as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Several studies have suggested a correlation between the mass of the SMBH and the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the galaxies. These correlations may imply an evolutionary relation between the growth of the SMBH and the host galaxy.
2. In order to study the dependence of the various observed phenomena of AGNs on the black hole mass and the cosmic evolution of the black holes, independent and reliable estimates of the mass of the black holes are required. One independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole is using the reverberation mapping technique. This technique involves measuring the time lag between variations in the continuum emission and the broad emission lines, which can be interpreted as the light travel time across the broad line region (BLR).
3. The reverberation mapping technique has been used to make estimates of SMBH masses over a large range of redshift. However, the technique is observationally taxing and has only been applied to about three dozen AGNs to date. Using these estimates, a correlation was found between the BLR radius and the optical continuum luminosity at 5100 Å. This relation can be useful for estimating the SMBH masses from single-epoch spectra and calibrating other surrogate relations used for black hole mass estimates.
4. The text presents the optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of a new low luminosity AGN, the X-ray source and Seyfert 1.5 galaxy H 0507 + 164. Based on a reverberation mapping campaign that lasted for about a month, the authors have obtained the BLR radius and estimated the mass of the SMBH.
5. The authors also discuss the need for estimates of the BLR radius for a larger number of sources, as the extrapolation of the known BLR-luminosity relation to low luminosities suggests that the time lag between the variations of the broad line and that of the continuum will be of the order of hours to days. This would require monitoring programs of short durations, but fast sampling, to estimate the reverberation time lags for low",1
172,"1. Broad emission iron lines are common features in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, and are thought to originate near the black hole due to radiation being reflected off the accretion disc.
2. The spin of the black hole affects the shape of the iron line, with higher spin values resulting in the innermost stable orbit being closer to the black hole.
3. The Laor model is a widely used model for relativistic disc spectral lines, and assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole. However, other models have been developed that allow for the spin to be fitted.
4. The Laor model can still be used to estimate the spin if the inner edge of the disc is identified with the marginally stable orbit.
5. The other parameters of relativistic line models include the inclination angle, rest energy of the line, inner and outer radii of the disc, and emissivity parameters.
6. The emissivity of the line is given by different laws for different regions of the disc, and the angular dependence of the emissivity is characterized by a limb darkening profile in the Laor model.
7. The paper compares the Laor model to another relativistic model when applied to data from the XMM-Newton satellite and artificially generated data for a future X-ray mission. The two sources chosen exhibit a skewed iron line and marginally stable orbit.
8. The Laor model has a less accurate grid and is limited to the extreme Kerr metric, which can result in discrepancies in the spin determination and energy resolution when applied to higher quality data.",1
173,"1. Axially symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations are used to model galaxies or accretion disks, and can be static or stationary with or without radial pressure.
2. Solutions for static disks without radial pressure were first studied by Bonnor and Sackfield, and Morgan and Morgan. Solutions with radial pressure were also studied by Morgan and Morgan.
3. Disks with radial tension, electric fields, magnetic fields, and both magnetic and electric fields have been considered.
4. Solutions for self-similar static disks were analyzed by Lynden-Bell and Pineault, and Lemos.
5. The superposition of static disks with black holes and static disks as sources of known vacuum spacetimes have been considered.
6. A simple method to generate these solutions is the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method, but the matter content of the disk is usually anisotropic.
7. In this article, the authors apply the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method on spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates to generate static disks made of a perfect fluid, i.e., with radial pressure equal to tangential pressure.
8. They also generate disks of perfect fluid surrounded by an halo made of perfect fluid matter.
9. The article discusses the results and presents the basic equations used to calculate the main physical variables of the disks.",1
174,"1. The text discusses the creation of two interpenetrating superfluids, specifically focusing on the use of binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with two species of atoms. Research has been conducted to condense two different hyperfine spin states of the same atom in the same trap using sympathetic cooling. The dynamics of the complex relative motion of the condensates and the measurement of the relative phase between the two condensates have been studied. However, the two condensates do not completely interpenetrate each other in the stationary state. Theoretical investigation of two-component Bose systems has been carried out, and hartree-fock theory has been successfully tested on the two-component ^87Rb system. Stability, ground-state properties, and collective excitations have been studied using the Gross-Pitaevskii equations.
2. The text also discusses the effects of symmetry and symmetry breaking in two-component BECs. The quantum state of the binary Bose system is characterized by two phases of the two condensates, leading to a richer physics than that of usual one-component systems. When the coupling drive is on, only one u(1) symmetry remains exact, while the other one is explicitly violated. This leads to the possibility of a nontrivial static configuration, a domain wall inside which the relative phase changes by π. The domain wall is a local minimum of the energy but is not topologically stable, and its spontaneous decay is exponentially suppressed due to an energy barrier. The paper is organized into sections that introduce the field-theoretical description of binary BECs, describe the domain wall configuration, discuss the boundary of finite domain walls and the related phenomenon of ""vortex confinement,"" and contain concluding remarks.",1
175,"1. Quantum field theory may exhibit anomalies, which are violations of classical symmetries in the quantized version of a theory. External symmetry breakage is harmless but internal symmetry (gauge symmetry) breakage leads to inconsistencies in the quantum theory.
2. Gravitation, regarded as a gauge theory, also suffers from anomalies, such as Einstein anomalies, Lorentz anomalies, and Weyl anomalies, which can be calculated using various methods, including perturbation theory, heat kernel method, Fujikawa's path integral approach, and differential geometry and cohomology techniques.
3. Schwinger terms, which are additional terms in the canonical algebra of equal-time commutators, are deeply related to anomalies and can be calculated using similar methods. They are frequently calculated within perturbation theory and are cohomologically described by the Faddeev-Mickelsson cocycle.
4. The text discusses the calculation of gravitational anomalies, specifically the Einstein anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, using dispersion relations, a less familiar but useful approach. The authors show that all anomalous features are easily obtained by this method.
5. The authors extend the method of dispersion relations to the case of pure gravitation, considering chiral fermion loops coupled to gravitation and showing that the gravitational anomalies and the Schwinger terms are completely determined by dispersion relations.
6. The paper is organized into several sections, discussing the general structure of the amplitude, Ward identities, dispersion relations, the anomalous Ward identities, and the gravitational Schwinger terms.
7. The text also discusses the equivalence between the dispersive approach and the dimensional regularization procedure for calculating anomalies.",1
176,"1. The STE-Quest mission is a medium-sized candidate for launch in 2022/2024 by the European Space Agency (ESA) to test Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) by measuring the gravitational red-shift and testing the universality of free fall.
2. The mission comprises a space segment and a ground segment, connected by highly stable bi-directional microwave and optical links for precise time- and frequency transfer.
3. The space segment includes a satellite, two instruments (an atomic clock and an atom interferometer), science link equipment, and precise orbit determination equipment.
4. The ground segment consists of three ground terminals connected to highly accurate ground-clocks.
5. The atomic clock is a rebuilt of the high-precision PHARAO clock used in the ACES mission, with an optically derived microwave signal for short-term stability.
6. The atom interferometer uses interference between matter waves to generate a signal that depends on external forces acting on the atoms, and performs differential measurements to reject unwanted external noise sources.
7. The science links comprise optical and microwave time & frequency links to compare the on-board clock with distributed ground clocks and to compare distant ground clocks to one another.
8. The precise orbit determination equipment is required to determine the spacecraft position and velocity, which allows calculating theoretical predictions of the expected gravitational red-shifts and the relativistic doppler, and compare them to the measured ones.
9. The mission's baseline orbit is highly elliptical, with a typical perigee altitude of 700 km and an apogee altitude of 50,000 km, maximizing gravity gradients between apogee and perigee to achieve mission objective 1 (earth gravitational red-shift).",1
177,"1. Pulsed high-frequency (HF) electromagnetic (EM) waves are used to sound the density profile and drift velocity of the overhead ionosphere. In 1971, it was theorized that strong enough injected HF radio beams could excite weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionospheric plasma.
2. Ionospheric modification experiments in Platteville, Colorado, and Arecibo, Puerto Rico, demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation in ionosonde records, excitation of spread F, and the triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionosphere.
3. Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence. A full-scale simulation study of the propagation of an HF EM wave into the ionosphere was conducted, which is the first simulation involving realistic scale sizes of the ionosphere and the wavelength of the EM waves.
4. In the simulation, an EM pulse propagates through the neutral atmosphere and undergoes Faraday rotation when it reaches the ionospheric layer. The initially linearly polarized EM wave is transformed into two high-frequency EM modes, l-o mode and r-x mode, with different dispersion properties.
5. The l-o mode oscillations at a specific altitude radiate EM waves with perpendicular electric field components. Weakly damped oscillations of the electric field component are observed, which are interpreted as electrostatic waves produced by mode conversion of the l-o mode.
6. The nonlinear effects at the turning point of the l-o and r-x modes are investigated, and large-amplitude pump wave, relatively weak second harmonics of the pump wave, and low-frequency oscillations are visible in the frequency spectrum. Mode conversion of the l-o mode into electrostatic langmuir/upper hybrid waves and nonlinear harmonic generation of the high-frequency waves are observed.",1
178,"1. The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid-Mott insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. Recently, the transition has been observed and studied in a system of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. The possibility to manipulate and test the many-body behavior of a system of trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice has attracted significant theoretical and experimental interest, with potential applications in quantum computation.
2. The quantum phase transition in the system is driven by the interplay of the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy. The ratio of the on-site energy and the bandwidth forms the key parameter in the system, which can be easily controlled and varied in optical lattices. Experimentally, the system can be probed by taking absorption pictures to image the expansion patterns after a reasonable expansion time, which provides information about the momentum distribution of the state.
3. The essential physics of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic Mott-Hubbard model describing the competition between hopping and on-site interaction. Various approximation schemes, including the Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz, density-matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo, have been used to study this model analytically and numerically.
4. In this article, the authors study the short-range correlations, which are not included in the Gutzwiller ansatz, by using perturbation theory. The main purpose is to find corrections to the short-range behavior of the one-particle density matrix, which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns. These patterns are important for determining the location of the insulator-superfluid transition.
5. The authors note that their perturbative approach is identical to the one used in previous studies, although the goal was different, viz., studying corrections to the phase diagram. They present numerical results for local observables and the density matrix and discuss the implications for expansion patterns both for bulk systems and a harmonic confining potential.",1
179,"1. Scalar fields arise naturally in higher-dimensional theories such as string or m-theory, and can lead to accelerating cosmologies. In particular, compactification on a compact hyperbolic manifold with a time-dependent volume modulus can result in a flat expanding universe with a transient period of accelerating expansion. This behavior is typical of compactifications involving compact hyperbolic spaces or non-vanishing flux.
2. The transient acceleration in these models can be explained by the positive scalar field potential that both hyperbolic and flux compactifications produce in the effective, lower-dimensional action. The critical point in the target space, where the potential vanishes, separates steep exponential potentials (which arise in flux compactifications) from gentle exponential potentials (which arise from hyperbolic compactification).
3. The paper aims to generalize the analysis of these models to the multi-scalar case and to determine the model-independent behavior and the genericity of the phenomenon of transient acceleration. The authors also develop a new formalism for visualizing cosmological solutions that applies to any potential and illustrate it with an application to exponential potentials.",1
180,"1. The authors discovered a wide, common proper motion companion to the star HIP 115147, which they identified as LSPM J2322+7847.

181,"1. The universe is observed to be flat and dominated by dark energy, which is believed to be connected to particle physics. A dynamical model called MAVANs proposes that relic neutrinos could form a negative pressure fluid and cause cosmic acceleration through an unknown scalar field called ""acceleron.""
2. The neutrino mass is given by the acceleron and depends on its number density, changing with the evolution of the universe. The equation of state parameter and dark energy density also evolve with the neutrino mass, depending on the scalar potential model and the relation between the acceleron and neutrino mass.
3. The origin of the scalar potential for the acceleron is not discussed in many literatures, but it is clear in the supersymmetric MAVANs scenario. A work presents a model including the supersymmetry breaking effect mediated by gravity.
4. The basic assumption of the MAVANs with supersymmetry is to introduce a chiral superfield in the dark sector, which is assumed to be a singlet under the gauge group of the standard model. It is difficult to build a viable MAVANs model without fine-tunings in some parameters when one assumes one chiral superfield in the dark sector.
5. Therefore, it is assumed that the superfield couples to both the left-handed lepton doublet superfield and the right-handed neutrino superfield. The scalar component of the superfield is assumed to be the acceleron, which causes the present cosmic acceleration, and the spinor component is a sterile neutrino.
6. The lepton number conservation in the dark sector is violated in this scenario, leading to a variable neutrino mass. The finite mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable.
7. In the MAVANs scenario, there are two constraints on the scalar potential: the magnitude of the present dark energy density and the stationary condition with respect to the variation of the neutrino mass. The time evolution of the neutrino mass can be obtained from the stationary condition.",1
182,"1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a phase of quantum chromodynamics where quarks and gluons are mostly liberated from hadrons. The study of QGP has been ongoing for about thirty years, with experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider providing evidence for its formation. The QGP can also be created in the initial stage of the ""little big bang"" through relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions in heavy ion accelerators. The critical temperature and baryon density for the transition to QGP have been calculated for non-interacting, massless up and down quarks and gluons, but a similar calculation with non-zero interaction has not been performed.
2. In this work, the authors generalize previous calculations for the region with finite temperature and baryon density by considering weakly interacting quarks in the framework of the one gluon exchange scheme. They use the MIT bag model to take into account the bag pressure and the excluded volume hadron pressure. The authors calculate the thermodynamic properties of the QGP and compare the results with strange quark matter. They find that the QGP equation of state is harder than that of strange quark matter at the same baryon density and temperature. The interaction between quarks inside the bag is repulsive, making it easier for the system to transition to the QGP phase. The authors also find that the internal and free energies of the QGP are larger than those of strange quark matter.",1
183,"1. A conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies was proposed in ref. [xcite], based on the observation that the dynamical equations of gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form when subject to a conformally-flat metrical field.
2. The model describes confinement of quarks and gluons through the introduction of two scalar fields that spontaneously break the symmetry down to subgroups.
3. A symmetric second-order tensor field is defined that serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.
4. Quarks and gluons are confined to an anti-de Sitter (AdS) universe with a finite radius in the flat space-time.
5. The model describes quarks and gluons that oscillate with a universal frequency inside a closed universe, as well as photons which freely travel through flat space-time.
6. The model comprises one real scalar field and one complex scalar field. Their dynamical equations were solved in ref. [xcite] for the case that the respective vacuum expectation values satisfy a certain relation.
7. A solution for the real scalar field leads to AdS confinement, via the associated conformally flat metric.
8. Under the condition of the relation between the vacuum expectation values, one obtains a light real scalar field associated with confinement and a very heavy complex scalar field associated with electromagnetism.
9. Weak interactions were not contemplated in ref. [xcite], but the model can be extended to include them by replacing electromagnetism with electroweak interactions.
10. The model has been further simplified to compare its properties with measured cross sections and branching ratios, by coupling the AdS spectrum to the channels of hadronic decay products via light-quark-pair creation.",1
184,"1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the early 1980s in the study of periodic advance of glaciers on earth. It refers to the effect of nonmonotone dependence of the response of a system on the noise when this noise is added to a periodic input signal.
2. The phenomenon of stochastic resonance is characterized by the improvement of signal transmission in terms of statistical quantities through the addition of noise. This is because the perturbed signal may become observable, allowing for inference to be made on the signal.
3. The optimal level of noise, at which the signal transmission is maximized, is called stochastic resonance. This level can be determined using criteria such as the Shannon mutual information or the Kullback divergence.
4. The paper studies the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model with a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal. A noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process is added and the perturbed signal is observed in continuous time.
5. Two schemes of observations are proposed: observing the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold. The asymptotic properties of estimators for these two schemes are studied.
6. The paper notes the presence of stochastic resonance in the context of hypotheses testing, where the overall probability of error is nonmonotonic dependent on the noise level.
7. The paper also derives the asymptotic variance of the estimator and shows that it is asymptotically efficient in the sense of achieving the minimax asymptotic lower bound for the quadratic risk associated with the estimation of the signal.",1
185,"1. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have been found to have mainly d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant d-gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature. This symmetry has been confirmed through try-crystal phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements. However, above a certain temperature (k), no direct evidence for this type of symmetry has been published.
2. The symmetry of the order parameter and the interaction between quasiparticles, supercurrents (vortices), and the thermal conductivity depend on the temperature and angle between the heat current and the magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO planes. At low temperatures, the nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity, but as the temperature increases, thermal activation of quasiparticles reduces the sensitivity of the probe to measure gap characteristics.
3. A field-cooled procedure is used to rule out the influence of pinning of vortices, which is affected by the distribution of oxygen vacancies, defects, and impurity centers. The longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of temperature in both crystals at zero magnetic field provides qualitative information about the quality of the sample.
4. The angular patterns of the longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures for the twinned and untwinned crystals show a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity as the field is rotated from one direction to another. The phononic contribution to the total thermal conductivity is constant under variations of the magnetic field orientations, and the electronic contribution is entirely responsible for the magnetic field dependence. The variation of the thermal conductivity can be explained with a model involving a Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles along with an accurate inclusion of the impurity scattering and/or assuming Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices.",1
186,"1. The paper discusses the cosmetic surgery conjecture, which suggests that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes of a knot in a three-sphere are never purely cosmetic, meaning they result in the same oriented manifolds. The authors focus on purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere. They show that for most knots in the three-sphere, distinct slopes result in non-homeomorphic oriented manifolds. A knot invariant called @xmath30, which satisfies a crossing change formula, plays a crucial role in their study.
2. The authors prove that @xmath30 is equal to @xmath31, another knot invariant, and show that it is a finite type invariant of order @xmath5. They also derive an explicit closed formula for the canonically normalized finite type knot invariant of order 3 for two-bridge knots in Conway forms.
3. The paper includes results about purely cosmetic surgery from previous works, such as Proposition 5.1 and Theorem 1.2, which provide conditions for purely cosmetic surgery to occur. The authors introduce a new invariant, @xmath34, which is the degree @xmath83 part of the Kontsevich-Kuperberg-Thurston invariant of rational homology spheres. This invariant is universal among finite type invariants for homology spheres.
4. The authors prove the surgery formula for @xmath34, which plays a central role in their main result. They apply this formula to show that if a knot in the three-sphere with non-zero integers @xmath120 and @xmath121 satisfies @xmath122, then the knot admits purely cosmetic surgeries if and only if @xmath123.
5. The authors derive an explicit formula for @xmath87 and use it to study the cosmetic surgery problem for two-bridge knots. They show that if a two-bridge knot has the finite type invariant @xmath140 or @xmath141, then it does not admit purely cosmetic surgeries for any two distinct slopes. They also study the cosmetic surgery problem for the family of two-bridge knots @xmath196 and prove that it does not admit purely cosmetic surgeries.",1
187,"1. Anomaly-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB) models have attracted attention due to their attractive properties, such as calculable soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking terms and real, flavor-invariant soft terms. However, AMSB models have the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be solved by adding a universal scalar mass to the AMSB soft SUSY breaking terms. The parameter space of the ""minimal"" AMSB model (mAMSB) is given by $m_0, m_{3/2},$ and sign($\mu$).
2. An alternative set-up for AMSB is Hypercharged Anomaly Mediation (HCAMSB), a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB. In HCAMSB, SUSY breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, and the warping suppresses contributions due to tree-level gravity mediation. The anomaly mediation can become the dominant source of SUSY breaking in the visible sector.
3. In the mSSM, the bino gaugino mass can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation. The bino mass can lead to a small perturbation to the spectrum of anomaly mediation or it can be the largest soft SUSY breaking parameter in the visible sector. The effect of the bino mass on other soft SUSY breaking parameters can dominate the contribution from anomaly mediation.
4. The minimal AMSB model predicts a negative mass squared for the sleptons, while the pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.
5. The hcamsb ssb contribution is parametrized using a dimensionless quantity $c_{m_0}$, which governs the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms relative to the AMSB contribution. The parameter space of hcamsb models is given by $m_{3/2}, c_{m_0},$ and sign($\mu$).",1
188,"1. The text discusses the use of the Zero Range Potential (ZRP) approach in quantum mechanics, which allows for the exact solution of scattering problems. The ZRP can be represented as a boundary condition on the wavefunction or as a pseudopotential. Darboux transformations (DT) can be used to construct exactly solvable potentials and to modify the generalized ZRP (GZRP) boundary condition, creating a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.
2. The DT technique can be used to correct the ZRP model by dressing the ZRP to improve its possibilities. This involves modifying the GZRP boundary condition and creating a potential with short-range core interactions that depend on the angular momentum. The dressed potential can be used to build a zero-range potential eigenfunction in the multi-center problem.
3. The text also discusses the use of ZRPs in the study of slow electron scattering by polyatomic molecules. The partial and integral cross sections can be expressed in terms of the phases of the scattered waves, which can be classified with respect to symmetry group representation. The phases can be found from the compatibility condition of a system of equations, which can be factorized to obtain the phases of regular structures such as a tetrahedron.
4. The ZRP model has limitations, such as the neglect of polarization effects at low impact energies. However, these effects can be accounted for by dressing the ZRPs, which can correct the computed phases and integral cross sections. The DT can also be used to improve the agreement between the calculated and experimental results at higher collision energies by taking into account higher partial waves.",1
189,"1. The convection-diffusion equation is a type of partial differential equation that has remarkable applications in various branches of science and engineering. It has been solved numerically using various techniques, including finite element method, lattice boltzmann method, finite-difference scheme, and higher-order compact finite difference schemes.
2. Researchers have proposed different numerical schemes to solve the convection-diffusion equation, such as the nine-point high-order compact implicit scheme by Noye and Tan, which is third-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time. Another scheme is the fourth-order compact finite difference unconditionally stable scheme by Dehghan and Mohebbi, which has the accuracy of order 4.
3. The text also discusses the differential quadrature method (DQM), which is an approximation to derivatives of a function as the weighted sum of the functional values at certain nodes. The weighting coefficients of the derivatives depend only on grids. The DQM has been used to solve the convection-diffusion equation with new sets of modified cubic b-splines as base functions.
4. The accuracy and adaptability of the method are illustrated by three test problems of two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations. The resulting system of ODEs can be solved by using various time integration algorithms, such as the SSP-RK54 scheme, which results in less accumulation errors.",1
190,"1. Surveys using bolometer arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have discovered dusty objects at extreme redshifts, which are not detected in surveys at shorter and longer wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavorable @xmath11 corrections. These ""scuba galaxies"" have significantly changed the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
2. Early efforts to study scuba galaxies at optical and infrared wavelengths were met with difficulty, as many of these galaxies had no plausible optical counterparts. This led to the development of various redshift engines and broadband photometric techniques. However, only a handful of detailed studies were attempted, often for extreme and possibly unrepresentative galaxies.
3. Recent progress has been made through radio imaging of submillimeter survey fields, which has allowed for the detection and identification of many submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). These bright SMGs have been found to be a diverse population, including quasar-like galaxies, morphologically complex galaxies, extremely red galaxies, and galaxies with obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds.
4. Spectroscopic redshifts for SMGs have been difficult to determine, but accurate redshifts reported by Chapman et al. (2003, 2005) have facilitated the first systematic measurements of molecular gas mass and constraints on gas reservoir size and dynamical mass for SMGs. These data suggest that SMGs are massive systems and provide some of the strongest tests of galaxy-formation models to date. However, a detailed understanding of SMGs remains a distant goal, and confusion and selection biases may have skewed our understanding of this population.",1
191,"1. The text discusses the use of multi-object spectrographs on 4m-class telescopes to construct large samples of faint galaxies with measured redshifts, allowing for the computation of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies as a function of redshift and the observation of the evolution of the galaxy population.
2. Several deep, faint galaxy redshift surveys have been conducted, and while there is broad agreement that the population of blue, star-forming galaxies has evolved strongly since z~1, the population of red galaxies shows at most modest signs of evolution. However, there are inconsistencies in the LFs derived by different groups, which may be due to small sample sizes, small survey areas, and systematic errors.
3. The local LF also has considerable uncertainties, with different surveys having similar shapes but substantial differences in overall normalization, characteristic luminosity, and faint-end slope. A steep faint-end slope is a natural prediction of galaxy formation theories based on hierarchical structure formation models, but there is only weak evidence for this in the local field galaxy LF.
4. The paper presents the results of a redshift survey of the Corona Borealis supercluster, which was originally planned to study the dynamics of the supercluster but also provides a sample suitable for studying the evolution of the LF. The survey finds that the LF of field galaxies and the two superclusters are different, and that the supercluster LFs do not continue the exponential decline for galaxies brighter than M* (the characteristic magnitude).
5. The paper also discusses the potential impact of environmental effects on the LF, with superclusters containing a population of very luminous galaxies that are not present in the field LF. These galaxies are found in the densest regions of the superclusters and are dominated by the light of an old, red stellar population.",1
192,"1. Rapidity gaps, which are regions in pseudorapidity without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron. These gaps are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons.
2. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies above 100 Gev and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets. This observation suggests that color singlet exchange effects in QCD events are relevant at momentum transfers of order 1,000 Gev.
3. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent, in terms of a fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps of order 10%. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event.
4. The two-gluon exchange model, which is a model for the calculation of the color singlet fraction, with the two gluon-exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part, is used to estimate the color-singlet fraction. In this model, the color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons.
5. Measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron show no significant decrease in the gap fraction as the contribution from gluon-induced dijet events is reduced. In fact, the D0 data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum.
6. The two-gluon exchange model is found to be incompatible with unitarity, and phase shift unitarization leads to a more realistic description with color singlet exchange fractions that differ substantially from the expectations of the two-gluon exchange model.
7. The predicted color singlet fractions are found to strongly depend on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer, and within the unitarized model, the non-perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters, the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift.
8. The gap fraction between two hard jets varies with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation, and the predicted fractions are compared with Tevatron data. The conclusions are given in section [",1
193,"1. Forecasting electric energy consumption is important for managing power systems and maximizing consumer satisfaction. It has also been used for system security purposes to detect vulnerabilities in advance. Factors such as historical load, temperature, humidity, population, and GDP per capita can affect energy consumption. In the Gaza strip, energy demand has grown rapidly, with 75% of demands coming from service and household sectors.
2. Several algorithms have been proposed to tackle the electric energy consumption forecasting problem. These can be grouped into three approaches: time series, functional based, and soft computing based. Time series approach predicts future consumption based on past consumption patterns but can be inaccurate and not utilize weather information. Functional based approach models the relationship between weather and energy consumption, while soft computing based approach uses techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict energy consumption.
3. ANN is a system based on the working principles of biological neural networks and is useful in predicting future trends with reliance on past data. ANN systems have been designed for fields such as capacity planning, business intelligence, pattern recognition, and robotics. In computer science and engineering, ANN techniques have gained a lot of grounds and are vastly deployed in areas such as forecasting, data analytics, and even data mining.
4. In this study, historical monthly data from 1994 to 2013 was gathered from the Gaza region to develop a forecast model that predicts energy consumption for 2012 and 2013. ANN technique was used for training and learning procedures, which are fundamental in forecasting future events. The training of feed-forward networks is usually carried out in a supervised manner, and the learning process involves providing both input and output data, with the network processing the input and comparing the resulting output with the desired result.
5. The performance of the ANN model was evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) criteria. The results obtained have good accuracy and show that the proposed ANN model can be used to predict future trends of electric energy consumption in Gaza.",1
194,"1. Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole, is orbited by a low mass star. The secondary star transfers mass to the compact object via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk that emits X-rays.
2. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z sources and atoll sources. Z sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and have high accretion rates, while atoll sources have lower accretion rates and their X-ray color-color diagrams consist of fragmented island-like regions.
3. The main physical difference between Z sources and atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.
4. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB located in the Large Magellanic Cloud that shows the properties of a Z source, indicating that it is a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit.
5. Despite being X-ray luminous and having a known optical counterpart, little is known about the system parameters of LMCX-2. The estimates for the orbital period range from 6.4 hours to 12 days.
6. A new technique using phase-resolved spectroscopy has been developed to detect a signature of the donor star in persistent LMXBs. This technique has been used to detect narrow emission lines in several LMXBs, leading to constraints on their system parameters.
7. The authors of this paper applied the technique of Bowen fluorescence to LMCX-2 and detected a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset that they identify as the orbital period. They also detected narrow emission lines in the Bowen region, which they identify as coming from the irradiated side of the companion star.
8. The authors obtained a total of 77 spectra of LMCX-2 using the FORS2 spectrograph attached to the VLT unit 4 at Paranal Observatory. They de-biased, flat-fielded, and optimally extracted the spectra to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio.

195,"1. The axial anomaly, a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, has been analyzed using the renormalization procedure and the path integral formalism. An alternative approach by Dolgov and Zakharov interprets the anomaly as an infrared phenomenon, originating from a singularity in the chiral limit of the triangular diagram's absorbitive part. This infrared interpretation complements the more familiar ultraviolet interpretation from the renormalization procedure.
2. The Dolgov and Zakharov approach has been related to specific effects in physical reactions, such as polarized radiative decays of particles. The authors calculate decay rates for these processes, considering mass singularities and their cancellation, and discuss the kinoshita-lee-nauenberg theorem's implications. The work also highlights the importance of the axial anomaly in interpreting spin-dependent parton distribution.",1

2. This problem has attracted a lot of interest in the computer vision community due to its potential applications in various areas such as recognition, image and video compression, video summarization, and human-robot interaction.
3. A large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past 7 years, which typically involve two steps: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area.
4. However, current models have mostly focused on scenes with single objects and performed well on biased datasets with low-clutter images and often a single object at the center.
5. The text aims to address the lack of suitable benchmark datasets and a widely-agreed objective definition of the most salient object for complex, cluttered scenes.
6. The text also discusses related topics to visual saliency modeling and salient object detection, including object importance, object proposal generation, memorability, scene clutter, image interestingness, video interestingness, surprise, image quality assessment, scene typicality, aesthetic, and attributes.
7. The text mentions some breakthrough efforts in saliency detection, such as using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, subtracting the average color from the low-pass filtered input, incorporating global context using a patch-based approach, and using a region contrast-based method.
8. The text also discusses the relationship between fixations and saliency judgments, and how human observers choose to annotate salient objects or regions in free-viewing tasks.
9. The text concludes by highlighting the need for more versatile datasets and remedying biases in salient object datasets, and situating the field of salient object detection among other similar fields such as general object detection and segmentation, objectness proposal generation models, and saliency models for fixation prediction.",1
197,"1. Heegaard Floer theory is a decorated topological quantum field theory (TQFT) in 2 dimensions, constructed by Ozsváth and Szabó. It associates a vector space to a closed, connected, oriented 3-manifold and a map to a connected, oriented 4-dimensional cobordism decorated with a 2-structure.
2. The maps associated with cobordisms can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary. For example, two homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic 4-manifolds can be obtained by performing a log transform with odd multiplicity on a regular fiber of the nucleus of an elliptic surface.
3. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, with the Riemann surfaces related to the 3-manifolds and cobordisms involved via Heegaard diagrams.
4. Sarkar and the third author showed that every 3-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that is nice in the sense that the curves split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles. Using such a diagram, holomorphic disks in the symmetric product can be counted combinatorially, leading to a combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of any 3-manifold and null homologous knots and links in any 3-manifold.
5. The goal of the paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps associated with cobordisms between 3-manifolds with the property that the induced maps on the Heegaard Floer groups are surjective. This includes all cobordisms for which the torsion is trivial and all those consisting of only 2-handle additions.
6. The computation of the ranks of the maps goes as follows: the cobordism is decomposed into a sequence of one-handle additions, two-handle additions, and three-handle additions. Using the homological hypotheses on the cobordism and the τ-action on the Heegaard Floer groups, the problem is reduced to the case of a cobordism map corresponding to two-handle additions only.

198,"1. The paper extends the results of Yetter, Gerstenhaber, and Gerstenhaber and Schack on the infinitesimal deformation theory of associative algebras and poset-indexed diagrams of associative algebras to a deformation theory for arbitrary pasting diagrams of $\mathcal{C}$-linear categories, functors, and natural transformations. It establishes that obstructions are cocycles for deformation complexes of pasting diagrams in general, and considers deformations of pasting diagrams in which specified functors or natural transformations are required to be deformed trivially. The paper also addresses a point overlooked in previous theorems regarding the dependence of cochain maps on choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions.
2. The paper describes chain maps induced by pasting compositions on the full deformation complexes, when $\mathcal{D}$ is a composable pasting diagram. It constructs two chain maps for functors, and two more for natural transformations. It also gives a cochain map that ties together all of the deformations when a natural transformation, its source and target, and their common source and target are deformed simultaneously.
3. The paper uses the cochain maps of the previous section to give explicit examples of deformation complexes associated to various shapes of commutative pasting diagrams. It shows that cochain maps induced by two different associations of the 2-dimensional composition are not actually equal, but only chain homotopic. It also discusses the effect of compositions of 2-arrows and the iterative cone construction in the deformation complex of the pasting diagram. The paper leaves zero entries in matrices of maps giving coboundaries blank for improved readability.",1
199,"1. The text discusses the importance of understanding the physical picture behind observable phenomena in physics, rather than just calculating numbers. It highlights the need to select essential degrees of freedom in a theory, using the example of electric conductivity and heat capacity in crystals, which are explained by ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interactions.
2. The author then connects this concept to QCD, explaining that the full nonquenched QCD on a lattice is hoped to solve the problem of obtaining correct nucleon and pion masses in terms of underlying degrees of freedom. However, QCD at the scale of 1 GeV becomes too complicated, making it difficult to determine the relevant physics for the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties.
3. The author argues that spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important QCD phenomenon for understanding the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties. Beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks that interact through the exchange of Goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.
4. At low temperatures and densities, the chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to a subgroup by the QCD vacuum. A nonzero value of quark condensates for light flavors represents the order parameter for spontaneously broken chiral symmetry.
5. Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry has two important generic consequences: the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass, which represent the associated approximate Goldstone bosons, and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by valence (practically massless) quarks, known as constituent quarks.
6. Constituent quarks should be considered as quasiparticles with a dynamical mass generated by nonperturbative gluon and quark-antiquark dressing. The flavor-octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit implies that the constituent quarks and Goldstone bosons should be coupled with a strength that satisfies the constituent quark analog of the famous Goldberger-Treiman relation.
7. The author acknowledges that the microscopic mechanism for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD",0
200,"1. The text describes a calcium phosphate-coated implantable medical device that minimizes immune response and stores and releases one or more medicinally active agents. The calcium phosphate coating is made through a unique process that involves the application of a thin polymer film coating impregnated with medically active agents such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and other drugs. The coating is flexible and non-thrombogenic, and the release of the drugs from the coating is aided by the dissolution of the carrier film.
2. The text also discusses the use of calcium phosphate materials, such as hydroxyapatite (HA), as a coating for implantable medical devices. These materials are fully bio-compatible and bio-resorbable, and they offer new perspectives for coating-based drug encapsulation and delivery systems. The use of HA coatings has been limited due to their brittle behavior, but the text describes a method of biomimetic deposition of HA films at room temperature (BM-HA) that can be used for drug delivery. This method proceeds at or near room temperature and allows for the incorporation of biologically active species, such as antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, into the apatitic crystals that form through nucleation and growth. The deposition rates for BM-HA are in the range of 0.05-0.5 μm/h.",1

2. Cardiomyoplasty is a muscle-powered cardiac assist system, where surgically-modified muscle tissue (e.g., latissimus dorsi) is wrapped around the heart and stimulated to contract in synchrony with the heart, raising stroke volume and cardiac output.
3. Patients with chronic cardiac output deficiencies treated with cardiomyoplasty face an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmic episodes, which can be life-threatening.
4. Some cardiac assist systems combine a muscle stimulator and a cardiac pacer-cardioverter-defibrillator to provide muscle-powered cardiac assistance and therapeutic electrical stimulation for arrhythmias.

271,"1. The text describes an arrangement for controlling thread tension in a spool creel with multiple spool holders. Each spool holder has a controller with a brake rotor and an adjustable, tension-responsive braking element. A tensioning lever, coupled to the braking element, is biased by threads and operates at an angular position dependent on thread tension and weight. A biasing arrangement, activated by fluid pressure, is connected to the tensioning lever and can be simultaneously set for all biasing arrangements.
2. The force generated by the biasing arrangement operates in addition to the weight force on the tensioning lever, altering the thread tension. This change can be centrally set so that the thread tension can be determined for the entire creel. When the warping machine served by the creel is shut off, the braking force throughout the entire creel can be increased for quick braking action.
3. The tensioning lever subtends a large angle to the horizontal plane, and the working elevation angle of the biasing arrangement attached to the tensioning lever should preferably subtend a smaller angle. In a preferred modification, the biasing arrangement operates on a brake shoe, which is applied to a further rotating braking surface under higher fluid pressures for rapid braking at shutdown.
4. An alternate embodiment replaces the friction brake with an electromagnetic brake. The tensioning lever is rigidly connected with a transverse lever arm carrying a magnetic system. The magnetic system surrounds a braking disc attached to the brake drum. The magnetic system brakes by generating eddy currents in the braking disc, with a greater braking effect when the disc is more covered by the system.",1

274,"1. The text describes a problem encountered when bleaching pulp with oxygen: oxygen entrained in the pulp mat reduces the vacuum on the vacuum washer and mixes with the wash water to form foam, reducing the vacuum in the washer and preventing chemicals and water from passing through the mat.
2. Several proposals for deaerating the pulp before the washer are mentioned, including the Deculator process, which involves rapid acceleration and spraying of stock into a long 6-foot diameter stainless steel receiver where it is boiled under vacuum while being impinged against a suitable target surface.

279,"1. The text describes a pulsed power device and method for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) using pulsed power electrohydraulic (EH) and electromagnetic (EM) discharge devices to stimulate oil production.
2. The EH mode uses a plasma channel to create high pressures and temperatures, while the EM mode uses controlled flux compression to generate various physical effects without the coupled effect of the EH strong acoustic wave.
3. The pulsed power method can generate high-frequency acoustic stimulation of the reservoir separately from the direct acoustic response of the EH shock wave, inducing a coupled acoustic vibration at very high frequencies in geologic materials like quartz.
4. Effective acoustic stimulation requires higher frequencies than direct acoustic methods can generate, and can be optimized by targeting specific scales of inclusions in the formation.

The inlet to the pressure sensing apparatus is located at a desired depth in the formation and isolated to pressures produced by the formation at such depth.
2. The systems described involve the use of a borehole, grout pipe, pressure sensor arrangement, connector block, filter, check valve, and fluid injection pipe. The pressure sensor arrangement is fixed in the borehole at the desired location by placing a cement grout around it. Before the cement grout is fully cured, a liquid is pumped down hole through a check valve to clear the filter of the cement grout material. Subsequently, a fluid is again pumped down the borehole through the check valve to form a void or communication path between the formation and the pressure transducer.
3. The cement grout material around the void isolates the pressure transducer in the borehole, except the laterally adjacent portion of the geological formation where it is desired to obtain fluid pressure measurements. The systems also involve the use of a packer that carries a pressure transducer at its bottom end and is inserted into the large tube and sealed therein. The packer effectively plugs the large tube so that the pressure in the formation can pressurise the lower injection tube.
4. The text also describes the process of pumping a pressurised fluid into the surface input tube to displace fluid from the injection tubing, through the check valve and out of the filter through the opened cement grout. This process fractures the formation at a specific location via the void area around the filter. The hardened cement grout in the borehole above and below the void area functions to concentrate the pressurised fluid in the annular area of the formation surrounding the filter component of the pressure sensor arrangement.
5. The natural pressures of the geological formation cause the formation fluid to enter the fracture zone and from the filter to the pressure transducer. Changes in the formation pressure are sensed by the pressure transducer and coupled by corresponding electrical signals to the surface monitoring equipment.",1

298,"1. The position sensor system described includes a waveform generator that receives an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer and modifies it based on an error correction signal to provide a conditioned sensing signal. An error correction generator, which includes a comparator, controller, and signal processor, determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about the position of an object being sensed. A window reference circuit constantly compares a desired conditioned sensor signal output to an existing conditioned sensor signal output and adjusts the conditioned sensor signal output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal.
2. The sensor monitoring system is remotely located and provides power to the sensor and receives the conditioned sensing signal via two wires, making the sensor desirable for multiplexing with other sensors. The sensor system includes a window comparator, controller, counter, and digital to analog converter (DAC) that control the count rate and direction of the signal processor. The output of the DAC is subtracted from the output of the transducer in the waveform generator.
3. The sensor system determines and eliminates strong static signals or other error signals that do not deliver information about the position of the object being sensed whose inclusion in the sensor output signal would waste energy. A digitally stored offset and error correction closed-loop compensation constantly compares the sensor output to a desired minimum value and generates a correction that may be subtracted from the offset and error signal to deliver a sensor output that is as close to the desired, an ideal minimum, as is practical without requiring unnecessary circuitry that is typically used for signal conditioning. The sensor system generates a relatively small reference signal that is large enough to eliminate small values of drift in a negative going direction yet is small enough not to generate a significant amount of signal due to the discrete nature of the calibration voltages from the DAC and counter combination. A relatively large reference signal that substantially exceeds the largest voltage encountered as the object moves its maximum amount is accommodated by allowing rapid recalibration due to sudden changes in offset voltage caused by rapid temperature or other changes.",1

2. The method forms a conical pile of waste fuel, fed from below, with preheated underfire air percolating up through the pile in controlled amounts, drying and gasifying the waste fuel in the pile.
3. The volatile gases driven off the pile are partially oxidized by additional combustion air in a first or primary combustion chamber, with the total amount of combustion air admitted being maintained at less than stoichiometric proportions to keep the temperature lower than the necessary to melt the natural ash.
4. A steady temperature at the exit of the primary chamber is maintained by adjusting the amount of swirl air, which also forces particulate out of the gas stream leaving the primary chamber.
5. The volatile gases move into a second combustion chamber where secondary combustion air is introduced to complete combustion, with the secondary air introduced in the secondary combustion chamber being directed tangentially.
6. The combustion air introduced to the primary and secondary chambers is introduced on the outside of a refractory lining to cool the lining and increase its life.

304,"1. The invention is a highly efficient evaporative air cooler that operates by separating the dry and wet sides of a heat exchanger, keeping evaporating water separate from the useful air to achieve sensible cooling.
2. The system draws at least a major portion of the working air from the load (the enclosure to be cooled) to take advantage of its lower wet bulb temperature and increase the temperature differential.
3. The system uses an array of spaced vertically directed hollow elongated tubular members for the wet and dry sides of the heat exchanger. The wet side is accomplished by gravity flow of water downwardly along the inner surfaces of the tubes in conjunction with countercurrent flow of returned air from the load. The dry side is accomplished by fresh air flowing in thermal conductive contact with the outer surfaces of the tubular members for cooling.
4. The system can include variations such as recirculation of return air to mix with fresh air for quicker cooling at a higher energy cost, or bypassing cooled air to mix with working return air for lower temperature but higher energy cost.
5. The heat exchanger comprises an array of tubular members stacked between top and bottom headers, with a side wall accommodating blowers that draw fresh air through the dry side of the heat exchanger and distribute the cooled air to the enclosure.
6. Water is fed to the top header and flows downwardly along the inner surfaces of the tubular members, evaporating as the return air is pushed upwardly through the tubes, abstracting heat and cooling the walls.
7. The moisture-laden air is discharged as an exhaust stream, which can be conducted through a heat exchange assembly to pre-cool the fresh air.",1

2. The braking horsepower in these systems is varied by operating less than all of the engine brakes. However, if the maximum braking horsepower required does not need engine braking using all engine cylinders, the engine includes excess components.
3. A reduction in engine components can improve the overall robustness of an engine. Therefore, an engine compression release brake system including a sufficient, but reduced, number of components would be desirable.
4. The present invention provides an engine with an engine housing that defines a plurality of engine cylinders and an engine compression release brake for a portion of the engine cylinders, wherein the portion is less than all of the plurality of engine cylinders.

8. The piston is movably positioned in the brake body and provides a hydraulic surface that is exposed to fluid pressure in the actuation fluid passage. When actuation fluid passage is open to high pressure passage, high pressure acts on the hydraulic surface to move the piston toward its downward, advanced position, causing the exhaust valve actuator to move to an open position against the pressure in the cylinder.",1

The text describes a link assembly between an engine and a gearbox, which includes a male link coupled to either the engine or the gearbox, a female link also coupled to either the engine or the gearbox, and a pin that selectively retains the male and female links together. The female link receives the male link to allow translation and form a radial interface that dampens the translation of the male link relative to the female link. This design allows for increased mobility of the gearbox relative to the engine, which can absorb extreme shocks without transmitting potentially destructive loads from the engine to the gearbox.
2. The mounting link can be utilized as a medium to long link to connect the engine to an associated structure, such as the gearbox. In the illustrated embodiment, extreme loads may break the rigid constraint of the mounting link by shearing the pin to allow a permitted range of motion. The interface between the female link and the male link can dampen the relative motion within the permitted range of motion.
3. The female link includes a link mounting end and a link interface end, which includes a cavity to receive the male link. The male link is attached to the corresponding component that the female link is not attached to, and the link interface end is received by the female link in the link interface end of the female link. The pin selectively prevents the relative translation of the female link and the male link by passing through a through hole of the female link and a through hole of the male link to engage and retain the female link and the male link.
4. The pin can serve as a fusible link and is designed to shear at a known load magnitude corresponding to the maximum structural capability of the gearbox assembly, the unfused mount components, and the engine mounting structure. After an event that can cause the pin to shear, fuse, or otherwise release, the female link and the male link are allowed to translate relative to each other, which can limit or prevent damage that could otherwise be done to the gearbox and its attached peripherals by transmitting such extreme loads, while simultaneously helping to prevent the gearbox from detaching from the engine.",1

The cooling system, specifically the housing water cooling system, is crucial for improving fuel economy and durability of the engine. The most severe cooling problem is in the area surrounding the spark plugs, where combustion and expansion of working gases takes place.
2. The use of in-line or dual spark plugs in a single rotor housing is a common design aspect. However, this arrangement disrupts the flow of cooling fluid and prevents the heat from being carried away in a critical area. Spark plugs are typically installed into threaded ports of the spark plug bosses, which are cast into the engine water jacket passageway.

The engine comprises a rotor, an induction system, an ignition system, means for defining a cooling passageway, and boss means for containing the ignition means within the water passageway.
4. The text also discusses the importance of the arrangement and positioning of the spark plug bosses in the cooling passageway. The bosses should be arranged to form a definite and noticeable offset arrangement in the passage, while the terminals of each spark plug should project onto a point on the trochoid wall preferably offset a certain distance.
5. The staggered configuration of the spark plug bosses allows for high velocity flow and a high heat transfer coefficient to be maintained at the sensitive spark plug boss surfaces. This is achieved by controlling the flow and preventing uncontrolled swirling eddies. The text also includes test results that show an increase in the heat transfer coefficient between the flow and bosses with the staggered configuration.",1
314,"1. The present invention is a method of minimizing steam boiler pressure changes or turbine power changes during turbine control valve operational safety testing. The method uses control valve positions as feedback to minimize flow disturbance caused by the closing and reopening of a turbine control valve during periodic operational testing.
2. The flow is determined as a function of control valve position, i.e., valve stem lift. The flow change due to closure of one of the several parallel flow paths during valve testing, results in a change to the system that is controlling pressure from N valves to N-1 valves. The flow characteristic for each valve of the system with N valves, and for the system with N-1 valves, is determined during the turbine design process.
3. The flow characteristics are based on total flow (valve) demand. For any given valve not under test, the flow difference characteristic between the N and the N-1 condition is known. This difference is applied to the total flow demand to each of the N-1 valves on the basis of the total N valve demand derived from the position of the valve under test.
4. The test compensation circuit uses control valve positions as feedback and compensates by adjusting the flow through parallel control valves to minimize flow disturbance caused by the closure and reopening of turbine control valve during testing.
5. The test compensation circuit would be reproduced along with test control circuit and valve servo position loop for each valve of several parallel turbine inlet control valves used to control the mass flow through turbine. Output 44 of selector would be provided as signals 41, 43 and 45 to control valves 2, 3 and N, respectively.",1

Electric fans are often used to move ambient air across electronic components to keep them within acceptable temperature ranges. Traditional methods of securing cooling fans to an enclosure, such as using fasteners, increase the cost of the product.

The installation process involves positioning the cooling fan assembly against the panel, compressing the spring member, and rotating the assembly to move it into the partially installed and fully installed positions. The resilient leg portions spring outwardly when they enter the residual opening, capturing them within the opening and creating a compressed state that urges the turned-out portions of the resilient leg portions against the exterior surface of the panel.

This method is particularly useful in the automotive industry for manufacturing anti-intrusion, structural, or safety components.
2. The method described in patent EP 0971044 is applied to butt-welded blanks, which are obtained from steel plates of different compositions or thicknesses. The plates are pre-coated with a metal and then welded together using laser beam welding. The welded blanks undergo heat treatment to form a surface alloy, which prevents decarburization and oxidation during further processing.

The invention aims to solve this problem by proposing a plate consisting of a steel substrate and a precoat with an intermetallic alloy layer in contact with the substrate, topped by a metal alloy layer. The metal alloy layer is removed from an area situated at the periphery of the plate to prevent the formation of intermetallic areas within welded assemblies.

369,"1. High-dielectric oxide materials, such as ferroelectric materials, are useful in various semiconductor structures like capacitors, MOS transistors, and electrooptic applications. However, integrating non-SiO2 based oxides directly on Si is difficult due to the strong reactivity of Si with oxygen, resulting in a low dielectric constant SiO2 or silicate layer at the Si/oxide interface.
2. A Ge buffer layer on Si can prevent or minimize the formation of the low dielectric constant layer, allowing for the epitaxial growth of high dielectric constant oxides on a semiconductor substrate. Ge is a semiconductor compatible with Si process technology and can form three-dimensional epitaxial structures.
3. Not all oxides are stable next to Ge. For example, Pb-containing ferroelectrics like Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 (PZT) are not thermodynamically stable next to Ge. A thin layer of SrTiO3 or other stable ferroelectric can be used as a buffer layer between the Pb-containing ferroelectric and the Ge-coated Si substrate.
4. An epitaxial Ge and non-Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric material buffer layers can simplify the integration of Pb/Bi-containing ferroelectrics on GaAs, which is unstable in O2 at normal growth temperatures.
5. A method for fabricating a structure useful in semiconductor circuitry involves growing a buffer layer of non-Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric constant oxide layer directly or indirectly on a semiconductor substrate, followed by depositing a Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric constant oxide on the buffer layer.

High-dielectric constant oxides have dielectric constants greater than 100, and preferably greater than 1,000. Pb/Bi oxides are generally perovskites whose component oxides are thermodynamically unstable next to germanium metal, while non-Pb/Bi high-dielectric oxides are generally per",1

This problem arises due to the limited dynamic characteristics of passive and active semiconductor components such as bipolar transistors, field-effect transistors, diodes, and tuning diodes.
2. The Siemens publication ""Semiconductor Circuitry Examples"" 1972/73 describes circuitry examples for TV tuners that deal with this problem. It shows a VHF/UHF input section for a TV receiver with an input high-pass filter, PIN control network, antenna filter, uncontrolled preamplifier stages, and band filters tuned with varactor diodes. Amplification control is effected from a higher input signal level via the PIN diode control network.
3. The disadvantage of amplification control with PIN diodes is that it causes an increase in noise level, which necessitates moving control actuation to as high as possible signal levels to reach a sufficiently high S/N ratio level with stronger signals. The preamplifier transistor itself is used for amplification control, which entails a non-linearity that causes signal distortions.
4. The Siemens publication ""Semiconductor Circuitry Examples"" 1973/74 describes a circuit arrangement for the input section of an FM radio receiver with electronically tunable selective circuits. Here, amplification control is effected by means of a PIN diode control network between antenna input and the first selective circuit.
5. The use of varactor diodes in electronic tuning causes negative influences if they are subjected to strong signals. They themselves then cause cross modulation and intermodulation, and at certain signal levels and frequencies, can even occasion relaxation oscillations.
6. The invention proposes a receiver input circuit with several amplification control circuits. The control signal for the first control circuit is obtained at the output of the preamplifier stage, for the second control circuit at the output of the mixer stage, and for the third control circuit in the signal frequency selective intermediate frequency amplifier.
7. The first and second control circuits avoid unwanted overloading of the mixer stage and/or the varactor diodes and overloading of",1

373,"1. The invention describes a recessed mask structure that prevents localized high electrical fields at intersections, which can result in lower electrical breakdown in small dimension semiconductor devices. This is achieved by positioning a differentiating or mask member, used for the protection of the dielectric in subsequent processing operations, at a position below the surface to be planarized, where there will be a lower electric field. This technique is particularly useful in damascene type device structures, where adjacent conductors lined with an electrically conductive and diffusion barrier film are disposed in thin trenches in an intralevel dielectric material (ILD), and connections are made to levels above and below through metal-filled vias.
2. The invention also addresses the problem of high electric field concentrations at the pointed regions where conductive members intersect with the surface, which can cause electrical breakdown and possible damage to the diffusion barrier liner. The invention proposes to arrange the interface between the mask and cap to be placed at a location away from the high electric field points, where the conductive liner diffusion barrier surrounding the conductive members will have integrity that has not been disturbed by processing up to that point. This is achieved by removing a portion of the mask layer, providing a mask to cap interface area that is not coplanar with the pointed locations, and positioning the mask member so that the high field points are separated from the interface. The invention also provides a lower and predictable overall capacitance, which is valuable for faster signal propagation in the interconnect wiring.",1

The Downconverting Digitizer of the present invention is a novel design implementation for an analog-to-digital converter that samples and downconverts a modulated (IF) carrier to baseband in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. It consists of a digitally-controlled variable gain amplifier, a gain control logic element, an analog summing element, a sampling element, a predictive digital filter, an offset nuller element, a digital summing element, a digital-to-analog converter, a digital quadrature mixer, and two rate reduction filters.
2. The predictive loop of the Downconverting Digitizer generates a prediction of the input signal and minimizes the prediction error signal in the steady-state mode of operation. The sampler plays a critical role in this process, and the offset nulling loop is designed to eliminate offsets caused by implementation imperfections.
3. The predictive filter element of the loop is implemented using digital signal processing techniques and is designed to generate a prediction of the modulated IF at the next sampling epoch. The bandwidth of the modulation must be appreciably smaller than the clock rate for a valid prediction to be generated.
4. The digital predictive loop of this invention has the inherent advantage of confining the quantization noise to a narrower bandwidth compared to conventional analog-to-digital converters, easing the design constraints placed on subsequent digital signal processing elements.
5. The dynamic frequency response adjustment feature of this invention can be used to dynamically adjust the coefficients of the predictive filter to track the instantaneous carrier frequency of the modulated IF or reduce distortion caused by interfering signals in a multi-channel receiver application.",1

The invention relates to a method for fabricating arrays of nano-scale features on a single wafer to form a sensor device or a matrix of devices for multiplex detection of selected analytes using many simultaneous detection zones, by detecting changes in electrical characteristics of the nano-scale materials for each device.

The conventional process of manufacturing multilayer capacitors involves several steps, including casting a ceramic slip, printing electrodes, laminating and cutting the compacted structure, and thermal processing. The new process aims to simplify the manufacturing process by eliminating certain steps and introducing new methods for interconnecting electrodes, locating sub-assemblies in precise registered relation, and building-up stacks with covering components at upper and lower ends of the stacks.
2. The new process involves the use of carriers, such as flexible decals, which are prepared by punching holes and applying a thin coating of a transfer release agent. Multiple first electrodes are provided in spaced apart and supported relation on a first carrier, and multiple electrical components A are deposited in the formed electrodes to produce first laminate sub-assemblies. Similarly, components B are deposited on formed electrodes on other decals to produce second laminate sub-assemblies.
3. The sub-assemblies are brought into mutually stacked relation, thereby forming resultant assemblies. The carriers or decals are displaced to effect precision registration of the sub-assemblies, and the carriers are removed by heat application and peeling away from the sub-assemblies. The exposed electrode tabs at each end of the stack melt and fuse together during the bake-out cycle, whereby alternate electrodes are electrically joined to form a capacitor.
4. The new process also permits the use of more complicated electrode configurations, such as T-shaped or outline electrodes, which are sunk in a recess formed by the component. This allows for the formation of end terminations at the same time as the stack is fired, enabling a five-fold reduction in size and the elimination of one step. It also allows for the inspection of both the electrode print and dielectric print for perfection and thickness before commitment to actual construction.
5. The new process has several advantages over the conventional process, including the elimination of cutting stress cracks, the elimination of internal delamination caused by laminating stress disturbing green density, lower labor content per part, and the provision of a variety of tab configurations with no extra process time. It also enables the production of a more reliable part for high reliability requirements and allows for inventory to be partially carried in decal form, allowing for rapid",1

The text also notes that the present invention provides substantial advantages over the prior art, including the use of a flexible elastomer bellows and smaller, light weight moving surface, direct or indirect atmospheric venting, overhead surface floating buoys, the absence of an expensive, heavy, high maintenance, marine debris fouled ectoskeleton/cage, the absence of a fragile high wear, high maintenance ""flexible rolling membrane seal"", a larger stroke, the ability to capture kinetic wave energy, and the ability to be oriented vertically, horizontally, or in any other orientation.",1
392,"1. Scraped surface heat exchangers are used in industry, particularly in food processing, and include a long cylindrical outer tube, a central drive shaft, an annular space between the two for material, and radially extending paddles (blades) hingedly connected to the central drive shaft to help mix the material and scrape the inside surface of the outer tube.
2. Blades are typically mounted to the drive shaft using pins welded onto the shaft, with a narrow protruding finger and a wider finger. The blade is inserted at an installation angle and then pivoted to a more shallow angle, allowing the inner finger to protrude through a hole in the blade and restrain it from lateral movement.
3. It is desirable for the blades to remain at the shallow angle during installation of the drive shaft into the outer tube, so that they fit within the diameter of the outer tube and the drive shaft can be slid into the outer tube.
4. A problem occurs when the blades are permitted to swing outwardly to their installation position, as they may be able to freely slide away from the pin and fall freely downward in the case of a vertically arranged scraped surface heat exchanger.
5. The present invention provides an apparatus and method for facilitating the mounting of a scraped surface heat exchanger blade onto a drive shaft, while still using a pin type connection.
6. The apparatus includes a blade with a first side, a second side, a scraper edge, a hinge edge, at least one mounting hole, a first L-shaped locking track on the first side, and a second L-shaped locking track on the second side.
7. The method involves providing a blade body with at least one mounting hole, and locking the blade against longitudinal movement in one direction while permitting pivoting movement relative to the drive shaft, using tracks on both sides of the blade interfering with the pin.
8. The invention ensures that the blade will be installed with the correct side facing up, and hence in the case of the scraper design, that the scraper edge will be correctly oriented against the inside of the outer tube of the scraped surface heat exchanger.
9. The invention provides tracks on both sides of the blades, which allows for structural rigidity and reduces wear and tear on both blades and p",1
393,"1. The invention describes a process and apparatus for detecting and eliminating defective or incorrectly positioned cigarettes in a cigarette magazine of a cigarette production and/or packaging machine.
2. The detection process uses at least one optical checking element, such as a camera, to scan an image of a plurality of cigarettes in the magazine. The image is then evaluated by an image-processing device, and if the scanned image deviates from a reference image or reference value, an error signal is produced.
3. The detection apparatus includes an optical checking element, an image-processing device, and means for producing an error signal. The optical checking element is arranged in the region of the cigarette magazine and is intended for scanning at least one image of a plurality of cigarettes.
4. The advantage of this process and apparatus is the monitoring of a relatively large area of cigarettes, providing an overview of the orientation of the cigarettes and making it possible to detect transversely located cigarettes.
5. The process and apparatus may also be used to register defective cigarettes, such as those with missing filters or bent or broken cigarettes.
6. A disruption detected in this way can be eliminated automatically or manually, with an error signal being emitted acoustically or optically to alert the operator in the case of manual elimination.
7. The elimination process involves detecting a defective or incorrectly positioned cigarette and actuating an ejecting unit to eject a plurality of cigarettes located in an ejecting zone assigned to the ejecting unit.
8. The elimination apparatus includes at least one ejecting unit arranged in the region of the magazine, which is intended for ejecting a plurality of cigarettes located in an ejecting zone. A plurality of adjacent ejecting zones and corresponding ejecting units may be provided to eject cigarettes over a specific width of the cigarette magazine.",1
394,"1. The text describes a device for interconnecting high voltage cables with an apparatus or a second cable, which consists of a cable termination and a rigid insulator. The device aims to simplify the connection system for high voltage cables with ratings up to 400 KV and above, by providing a common cable connection system for all accessories and interconnections.
2. The device includes three interface methods: an inner cone concept, an outer cone concept, and a no cone or slight inner cone concept. The interface could also be obtained by using plane contacting surfaces. The outer cone concept separates the cable connection further from the apparatus it is connected to, making it less likely for a fault at one side to affect the other side.
3. The text also describes various applications of the invention, including SF6 terminals, transformer terminals, out-door terminals, straight through joints, transition joints, and joints between two apparatus. The rigid insulator used in the device has a conical interface surface, and the claimed angle between the longitudinal axis and the boundary surface of the insulator should be between 15° and 45°.",1
395,"1. The text describes an invention for a fixing mechanism for a tool used in machining materials such as wood, plastics, and metal. The fixing mechanism comprises a tool, its frame, and a tool holder in the frame of a machine tool. It can be used in various applications including machining by chipping, cutting, punching, molding, and forming work, particularly in machining of metal sheets in sheet machining centers. The fixing mechanism uses a curved surface for connecting the tool frame and the tool holder, which improves upon the prior art of using a conic fit that tends to clamp the connecting surfaces too much.
2. The invention is illustrated in figures showing various stages of fixing and releasing a tool in the tool holder. The fixing mechanism comprises a tool, a tool frame with a connecting element, a bushing-like tool holder, and clamps. The connecting element in the tool frame has a first connecting surface and a first contact surface, while the tool holder has a curvilinear connecting surface, such as a spherical surface, that forms part of its outer surface. The tool frame is arranged to surround the second connecting surface in the end of the tool holder, with the first and second contact surfaces being against each other. The curvilinear surface is designed to fulfill a specific formula involving the radius of curvature, the radius of the second contact surface, and the distance between the center of the radius of curvature and the second contact surface. The diameter of the inlay of the connecting element is substantially equal to twice the radius of curvature plus a fit used. The cross-sectional form of the tool holder and the connecting element in the tool frame is circular. The clamps are used to fix the tool frame in the tool holder and can transmit forces and loads in the mounting direction as well as in a direction perpendicular to the mounting direction due to frictional contact.",1
396,"1. The text describes a switching regulator circuit for generating supply voltages to drive display drivers, which can operate at high speeds while producing low electromagnetic interference (EMI).
2. The circuit is based on a switching regulator that charges and discharges an active element, such as an inductor, to provide an output voltage. Switching regulators can supply high current but typically generate radiated energy as part of the switching process, which is observed as noise on surrounding circuits.
3. The invention modifies the switching regulator circuit to create multiple circuit paths that carry electric current in opposite directions to cancel out the radiated noise of each path. Additional terminal lines are also provided to sink any EMI generated in the outermost paths.
4. The modified circuit can produce relatively large amounts of current, making it suitable for driver circuits for large displays such as the Apple iPhone display, without incurring the typical penalties associated with EMI or noise.
5. The invention also describes a method for reducing EMI in chip on glass (COG) implementations, where an integrated circuit (IC) is located on one side of the glass used in displays. The parallel source and drain paths in the transistor are configured in an alternating relationship to cancel out the EMI generated in the source paths by the EMI generated in the drain paths. The reduction in EMI can be further increased through the use of terminal leads.",1
397,"1. Vehicle battery rebalancing is a process that corrects cell voltage imbalance conditions by measuring the voltage of each cell, identifying the cell with the minimum voltage, and bleeding down the other cells until their voltages are approximately equal.
2. A power system may include a battery with multiple cells and a controller that causes the cells to acquire charge for a period of time so that their voltages are approximately equal at the end of the period. The rate of charge acquisition may differ among some cells during a determined portion of the period.
3. Rebalancing a battery can take up to 50% of the total time required to rebalance and charge it. For example, a PHEV or BEV vehicle with a 1.5 kw charger and a 6 kwhr battery may spend 1.5 hours rebalancing and 3 hours charging.
4. A battery cell's maximum capacity can be calculated using the relationship Ihr max = ΔIhr/ΔSOC, where ΔIhr is the change in capacity and ΔSOC is the change in state of charge.
5. A battery cell's energy content can be approximated using the equation ε = ∫ρ·dt, where ρ is the power applied to the cell over time. ρ can be written as ρ = v m ·i, where v m is the measured voltage associated with the power stored and i is the current associated with the power stored.
6. The voltage of a battery cell can be calculated using the equation v m = Δv + V min, where V min is the voltage of the cell at 0% state of charge and Δv is the difference between the voltage associated with the power stored and the voltage of the cell at 0% state of charge.
7. To determine the desired voltage for charging a battery pack with cells of different Amp-hr capacities, the required cell voltage can be calculated using the minimum Amp-hr cell and summing the string energy. If the energy is too great, a smaller assumed voltage can be used and the summation process repeated until the desired energy level is reached.
8. The time required to charge a battery pack is dependent on the cell requiring the greatest ΔIhrs, the cell requiring the least ΔIhrs, the method of balancing the cells to the same voltage, and the portion of the charge cycle selected to",0

The lamp has constant brightness, no low or high frequency flicker light, no electromagnetic radiation, which reduces eye fatigue and protects eyesight and health.
2. The converter includes an input power supply, input protection circuit, EMI filter, rectifier, filter, converter, output filter, lamp, start circuit, control circuit, biasing circuit, sampling circuit, output protection circuit, feedback and dimming circuit, and input monitor circuit.
3. The power supply can be implemented using various filters, rectifiers, converters, sampling circuits, feedback and dimming circuits, control circuits, start circuits, biasing circuits, lamps, and input power supplies. The power supply can be used in various applications, such as bus AC to DC converter, PFC converter, computer power supply, TV power supply, monitor power supply, notebook adapter, LCD TV, AC/DC adapter, battery charger, power tool charger, electronic ballast, video game power supply, router power supply, ballast, and power tool charge power supply.",1
399,"1. The text describes a system for controlling the illumination levels in a space with both daylight and artificial lighting sources, as well as for reducing sun glare. The system includes a central processor, a dimming panel with various lighting loads, photosensor interfaces, photosensors, wall stations, a window treatment controller, and a computer for programming and monitoring the central processor.
2. The system is designed to manage the lighting for an entire facility and allow the user to create and recall custom preset scenes for common room activities. The central processor includes an astronomical time clock for scheduling events based on sunrise and sunset times. The motorized window treatments can be programmed to preset window treatment levels and controlled manually or automatically to optimize light levels, energy savings, and reduced sun glare.
3. The system uses two algorithms for controlling the window treatments and the electrical lights based on the readings of photosensors. The first algorithm for control of the window treatments can be implemented based on the readings of photosensors 140 or 145, while the second algorithm for control of the electrical lights can be based on pre-existing control algorithms as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,236,101.
4. The system uses a closed loop control method for control of electric lights based on a fixed number of presets or lighting scenes. Each preset defines a target intensity for one or more electric lighting zones, and the system adjusts the dimming level of the electric lights towards a preset that would result in the appropriate supplementing of the available daylight. The system can also control the window treatments to prevent sun glare based on input from the photosensors 145.",1

Before September 11, 2001, there were significant vulnerabilities in aviation security, including weaknesses in passenger and baggage screening, access controls at airports, and protection of air traffic control computer systems. These vulnerabilities were identified in government reports and tests, but were not fully addressed.

2. After September 11, 2001, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created to address these vulnerabilities. TSA has implemented many measures to improve aviation security, including the deployment of federal screeners, the use of explosives detection technology, and the expansion of the Federal Air Marshal Service. However, there are still concerns about the security of air cargo, general aviation, and airport perimeters. TSA is working to address these issues, but faces challenges in funding, coordination, and risk management.",1

LDA covers only federal officials, while the IRC definitions cover state and local officials as well. LDA covers only lobbying of federal government officials, while the IRC definitions cover grassroots lobbying, such as television advertisements, newspaper advertisements, and direct mail campaigns to influence federal, state, and local legislation.
2. The three definitions differ in many ways regarding the officials and subjects they cover. For example, when the subject of a lobbyist's contact concerns a nonlegislative matter, such as a regulation, grant, or contract, LDA covers more officials than the IRC definitions cover. When the subject of a lobbyist's contact is a legislative matter, both IRC definitions potentially cover more levels of executive branch officials than the LDA definition does.",1
402,"1. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been assessing strategic sourcing in federal acquisitions for over a decade and found that leading companies have been able to achieve substantial savings by taking an enterprise-wide approach to services acquisition and leveraging their buying power.
2. The federal government, however, is not fully leveraging its buying power due to the decentralization of procurement activities, resulting in agencies acting like many unrelated, medium-sized businesses and relying on hundreds of separate contracts for commonly used items with varying prices.
3. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has implemented strategic sourcing practices and established the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) to address government-wide opportunities to strategically source commonly purchased products and services. However, the GAO found that most agencies leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing efforts and the FSSI program managed only a small amount of spending through its initiatives.
4. The GAO identified several impediments to strategic sourcing in the federal setting, including difficulties in obtaining and analyzing reliable and detailed data on spending, securing expertise, leadership support, and developing metrics. The GAO recommended that DOD, VA, and OMB take actions to improve strategic sourcing efforts, such as evaluating the need for additional guidance, resources, and strategies, and establishing metrics to measure progress toward goals.",1

2. The fiscal sustainability of numerous highway, transit, and safety programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund is in doubt due to increased spending without commensurate increases in revenues.
3. Federal surface transportation programs have grown in number and complexity, incorporating additional transportation, environmental, and societal goals. However, the expansion has created a variety of grant structures and federal approaches for establishing priorities and distributing federal funds.
4. Many federal surface transportation programs are not effective at addressing key transportation challenges due to unclear goals and roles, and a lack of links to needs or performance.
5. The federal government does not possess adequate data to assess outcomes or implement performance measures, and tools to make better use of existing infrastructure have not been deployed to their full potential.
6. The solvency of the federal surface transportation program is at risk due to expenditures exceeding revenues for the Highway Trust Fund, and the effectiveness of any overall federal program design can be increased by promoting and facilitating the use of the best tools and approaches to improve results and emphasize return on investment.",1
404,"1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for aviation safety oversight, air traffic control (ATC), and airport infrastructure development. The costs associated with these activities depend on the nature and usage of the specific services provided by FAA.
2. FAA's revenue comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF), which is funded through excise taxes on airline tickets, cargo, aviation fuel, and other sources. The Trust Fund has historically had a surplus, but revenues have been declining in recent years, leading to concerns about revenue adequacy.
3. There are concerns about the equity and efficiency of the current funding system, as the revenue contributions of different flights are not directly linked to the costs of the services they receive from FAA. This has led to calls for reform, including linking revenues more closely to costs and using alternative funding options.

406,"1. The government of Mexico has been working to combat the growing power of criminal groups, which initially emerged as Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) in the 1980s and 1990s. This struggle became a national priority in 2006 when then-President Felipe Calderón mobilized the military and law enforcement agencies to disrupt DTO operations and target their leadership structures. Under current President Enrique Peña Nieto, who was elected in 2012, the emphasis has shifted towards reducing criminal violence that threatens the security of civilians and the business sector. Besides trafficking billions of dollars’ worth of narcotics into the United States annually, Mexican DTOs’ criminal activity now extends to other areas, including human trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, extortion, bribery, racketeering, and weapons trafficking.
2. Firearms that criminal organizations acquire from the United States are primarily transported overland into Mexico using the same routes and methods employed when smuggling bulk cash south and drugs north across the U.S.-Mexico border. Within the United States, DTOs or their agents typically rely on “straw purchasers” to execute the paperwork necessary to purchase a firearm from a federally licensed firearms dealer. The surge in criminal activity by DTOs along the U.S.-Mexico border has generated concern among policymakers that this violence is spilling over into the United States. Since 2009, Mexican-based DTOs have been known to operate in more than a thousand cities in the United States. While the extent of violence seen in Mexico has not been reported in the United States, law enforcement officials in two border cities we visited told us that murders and other criminal activity on the U.S. side are often linked to Mexican DTO activities. The governments of the United States and Mexico have committed to work together to stem the activities of these criminal organizations, including illicit arms trafficking. From fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2015, Congress appropriated about $2.5 billion in assistance for Mexico that has been provided through the Mérida Initiative, including approximately $194 million provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015.

2. NCHIP grants have been used by states for various purposes, including automating criminal history records, improving the quality and completeness of criminal history records, and providing training and technical assistance to criminal justice agencies.
3. NCHIP grants have also been used to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to conduct presale background checks of persons purchasing firearms.
4. States have made progress in automating criminal history records and making them accessible nationally, but more work remains, particularly for NICS-related purposes.
5. The demand for background checks is growing, and technology is not static, which necessitates periodic upgrades or replacements of automated systems.
6. NCHIP encourages states to use funds to improve disposition reporting and to focus on improving access to specific types of records, such as those related to domestic violence misdemeanors and noncriminal disqualifying factors.
7. BJS is developing a criminal history records quality index (RQI) to uniformly characterize and monitor performance across jurisdictions and over time.
8. NCHIP’s goal is to improve public safety by enhancing the quality, completeness, and accessibility of the nation’s criminal history and sex offender record systems and the extent to which such records can be used and analyzed for criminal justice and authorized noncriminal justice purposes.
9. NCHIP has provided more than $438 million in federal grants nationwide since its initiation in 1995, and states have made much progress in automating their records and making them accessible nationally by conforming with the FBI’s standards for applicable national data systems.",1
408,"1. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) established the Superfund program in 1980 to clean up the nation's most severely contaminated hazardous waste sites. As of December 1996, there were 1,210 sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) for study and cleanup. Incineration is used as a cleanup remedy at Superfund sites, with EPA having selected it 43 times as of fiscal year 1995. At the time of the review, three incinerators were operating at Superfund sites, and EPA planned to use incineration at four additional sites. Incineration involves burning wastes in a controlled flame in an enclosed area and converting contamination into residual products in the form of ash and gases.
2. Incinerators at Superfund sites are generally ""transportable"" and are constructed and operated by contractors. CERCLA exempts any portion of a cleanup action conducted entirely on-site, including incineration, from the need to obtain any permit. However, EPA applies legally applicable or relevant and appropriate environmental standards from other federal laws, including RCRA, to Superfund cleanups. EPA requires incinerators at Superfund sites to meet RCRA’s substantive requirements, such as the act’s standards for emissions. EPA relies on four principal methods to ensure the safe operation of incinerators used to clean up Superfund sites: setting site-specific standards for emissions and operations, incorporating safety features into an incinerator’s emergency systems, monitoring emissions at the incinerator’s stack and along the site’s perimeter, and providing 24-hour on-site oversight.
3. EPA establishes specific cleanup standards for each incinerator used at a Superfund site based on studies of the site’s characteristics conducted during the incinerator’s design and construction. RCRA’s standards for fixed facility hazardous waste incinerators are typically applied, which govern the extent to which an incinerator must destroy and remove contaminants and set limits on emissions from the incinerator. EPA establishes the operating parameters needed for the incinerator to achieve the emissions standards and tests the parameters through a “trial burn” required under RCRA. The operating parameters can",1

The Service's diversity development program was created in 1992 to foster an all-inclusive business environment and support the recruitment, retention, and upward mobility of women and minorities. Aguirre International conducted a study of the Service's workforce diversity in 1997 and found that the Service was a leader in meeting affirmative action goals and striving for parity between its workforce and the CLF. However, the report also stated that women and minorities appeared to be experiencing problems advancing to management jobs at EAS 17 and above positions.
2. The Service's cluster-level workforce was found to be fully representative of black and Asian men and women, but underrepresentative of Hispanic women, Native American men and women, and white women when compared with CLF data from the 1990 decennial census. White and Hispanic women and Native American men were also underrepresented among the Service's headquarters-level and area office-level workforces. The representation of women and minorities in EAS 17 and above positions generally increased from fiscal years 1993 to 1997, but white men's representation decreased during this period at the cluster, headquarters, and area office levels.
3. The Aguirre report found that a glass ceiling existed at positions beginning at EAS 17 for women and minorities, but the report did not explicitly define the term or present convincing supporting evidence. The Service contracted with Aguirre International to study the Service’s diversity program and assess its progress in meeting its goal of creating a Service workforce as diverse as the CLF. The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of the Service’s diversity program in eight research areas using multiple research methods. The report indicated that Aguirre staff performed numerous data analyses, reviewed written policies and practices, validated a Service database, visited 10 postal sites, and conducted a survey and interviews. However, limitations resulting from the study’s parameters and cautions regarding the study’s findings were noted throughout the report.",1
411,"1. Military Working Dogs (MWDs) are canines used by the military for various purposes such as explosive and illegal narcotic detection, patrol, and tracking. When MWDs are no longer needed or can no longer perform their duties, they are removed from service and may be available for adoption. Robby's Law, enacted in 2000, promotes the adoption of MWDs after their military service and gives priority to former handlers, followed by others capable of humanely caring for the MWD, and finally to law enforcement agencies.
2. The disposition process of MWDs includes a review board that makes decisions about removing an MWD from service. The review board includes the Commander of the Air Force’s 341st Training Squadron, a representative of the 341st Training Squadron or designee, a Veterinary Corps Officer (Army veterinarian), and a Veterinary Corps Officer behavioral representative. Handlers who are interested in adopting an MWD must communicate their interest to the Kennel Master where the MWD is located.
3. The Army Veterinary Service has the lead responsibility for the medical care of all DOD-owned animals, including MWDs. During the MWD disposition process, Army Veterinary Corps Officers are responsible for providing a recommendation letter and a consultation/referral form that describes each MWD’s medical condition and suitability for adoption. The Army also maintains a veterinary care system that provides medical care to privately owned animals of individuals with access to medical services at a military installation, including adopted MWDs.
4. DOD uses three systems to track different types of information about MWDs, including information related to their removal from service. The number of MWDs that have been adopted, transferred, or euthanized has varied over the past 5 years. Available data for 55 percent of the MWDs adopted in 2014 and 2015 indicate that prevalent medical conditions included skin, dental, and musculoskeletal issues. Adopted MWDs need preventative care regardless of their medical conditions, and some assistance with privately provided veterinary care is available through nonprofit organizations such as the U.S. War Dogs Association and the American Humane organization.",1

3. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals to realize significantly lower operating and support costs and achieve a wartime operational availability for the Comanche of 6 hours per day.
4. In 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program due to budgetary constraints, reducing funding and extending the development phase by 3 years.
5. The Army's restructuring of the program continues to carry risks, including making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required and higher program costs.
6. Under the Army's restructured program, operational testing will not begin until after the low-rate initial production decision is made, continuing the risks associated with the highly concurrent Comanche program.
7. The Comanche's estimated program acquisition unit cost has increased significantly since 1985, from $12.1 million per aircraft to $34.4 million per aircraft, due to funding reductions and restructuring.

The facility will be operated and maintained by the Army, with the Air Force providing clinical services currently offered at the 86th MDG clinic.
2. DOD used beneficiary population data as of March 2010 and historical patterns of patient migration to identify the areas served by the proposed replacement medical center. A majority of the beneficiaries expected to receive health care from the replacement medical center are located within a 55-mile radius of it. DOD officials expect the replacement medical center to have little impact on workload and sizing requirements, even with recent posture changes that include the removal of a second brigade combat team from Europe.
3. DOD hired an independent contractor to perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the type of population changes that would require the addition or subtraction of intensive-care unit (ICU) and medical/surgical beds, as well as specialty care exam rooms for outpatients. The analysis concluded that the planned capacities for the replacement medical center would be resilient to sizable changes in the population served. However, DOD officials expect changes in the beneficiary population in the EUCOM catchment area through 2015, including an 8% reduction in the Europe Regional Medical Command’s active duty servicemembers and their dependents’ population and a 1% gain in the total EUCOM beneficiary population due to the stationing of Aegis Cruisers in Spain.",1

ICE investigations resulted in 102,034 apprehensions in 2005, and the removable alien population grew by 24% from 8.5 million in January of 2000 to 10.5 million in January of 2005.
2. ICE officers have discretion in various phases of the alien apprehension and removal process, particularly in the initial phases of initiating removals, apprehending aliens, issuing removal documents, and detaining aliens. Officers exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis, particularly for aliens with humanitarian issues and aliens who are not investigation targets.
3. ICE has updated some of the training it offers to officers responsible for making alien apprehension and removal decisions, but guidance on the exercise of discretion during the alien apprehension and removal process does not fully support officer decision making in cases involving humanitarian issues and aliens who are not primary targets of ICE investigations.
4. ICE officers rely on formal and on-the-job training, guidance provided by supervisors, and guidance provided in field operational manuals to inform their decision making regarding alien apprehensions and removals. However, there is a lack of comprehensive guidance and a mechanism by which to help ensure that officers receive consistent information regarding legal developments, putting ICE officers at risk of taking actions that are not appropriate exercises of discretion and do not support the agency’s operational objectives.",1

418,"1. Supply Chain Integration, a department-wide office under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics & Materiel Readiness, is responsible for leading the development of DOD supply chain policies and improving accountability, visibility, and control of critical assets, including SRC I ammunition.
2. The Army has a significant role in managing SRC I ammunition, as it procures a majority of the department’s ammunition and provides wholesale storage for other military services at Army depots.
3. DODM 5100.76 sets forth DOD policy on the physical security of sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives, requiring continuous program and policy oversight and tracking of SRC I ammunition by serial number.
4. The military services maintain accountability of SRC I ammunition at various locations, but there are gaps in service-level guidance and procedures for accounting for the ammunition across locations.
5. The military services generally recorded shipment and receipt of SRC I ammunition in their accountability systems, but existing Army depot and Marine Corps guidance do not specify a time frame for receipting shipments of SRC I ammunition.
6. DOD policy emphasizes the need for continuous oversight to ensure protection of sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives, and delegates to DOD component heads the responsibility to implement procedures for the protection of arms, ammunition, and explosives.
7. The military services varied in the extent to which they have developed guidance that addresses the time frame within which SRC I ammunition should be receipted on the accountable record.
8. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command tracks the movement of SRC I ammunition and coordinates responses to transportation issues, but there are limitations in the military services’ use of automated information systems that affect their ability to facilitate efficient management of conventional ammunition.",1
419,"1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for issuing Social Security numbers (SSNs) and maintaining records of individuals' wages and earnings. SSA's disclosure policy is designed to protect individuals' privacy rights while permitting the exchange of records required to fulfill its administrative and program responsibilities.
2. The Privacy Act of 1974 is the primary law governing the protection of personal privacy by agencies of the federal government. The act regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information that federal agencies maintain in a system of records. The act requires agencies to inform individuals of the authority for the collection of information, the principal purpose for the collection, what the routine uses for the information may be, and what the consequences are of not providing the information.
3. SSA's disclosure policy has been revised to comply with about 25 statutes, including the Privacy Act. The policy is more restrictive than both the law enforcement exception specified under the Privacy Act and the disclosure policies of most federal agencies. SSA maintains that it must have a restrictive disclosure policy because much of the information the agency collects is especially personal.
4. SSA's disclosure policy allows the sharing of nontax information with law enforcement under certain conditions. SSA officials consider several factors before allowing the disclosure of information, such as the nature of the alleged criminal activity, what information has been requested, and which agency has made the request.
5. SSA's disclosure policy is contained in 20 C.F.R. Part 401 and is promulgated through regulations outlined in its ""Program Operations Manual System"" (POMS) and Emergency Messages. POMS is the primary tool the field offices use to assist them in making appropriate disclosure decisions when they receive requests from law enforcement agencies.",1
420,"1. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sets national policy for the management of hazardous waste, including its generation, treatment, storage, and disposal. The law aims to minimize threats to human health and the environment.
2. RCRA's provisions govern the identification and listing of hazardous waste, with EPA establishing criteria for identifying waste that should be classified as hazardous. This includes specific types of waste produced by certain industrial processes and waste defined by characteristics that make it hazardous.
3. RCRA's regulations apply to all hazardous waste, regardless of where or how it is generated, and cover waste from both current and past industrial operations. Waste associated with cleanups, often referred to as remediation waste, must be managed under RCRA if it contains a hazardous component.
4. Since 1995, legislative proposals have been introduced to amend the application of RCRA's requirements to remediation waste, exempting certain types of remediation waste from these requirements and giving states the authority to establish their own requirements for managing this waste.
5. EPA has identified three specific RCRA requirements that, when applied to remediation waste, pose the most significant barriers to cleanups: land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and requirements for permits.
6. EPA has developed policies to mitigate barriers presented by RCRA's requirements, but stakeholders disagree on the extent to which waste should be exempt from RCRA's requirements and on EPA's legal authority under current law to exempt waste from the requirements. EPA has concluded that such reform can best be achieved by revising the underlying law governing remediation waste management.",1
421,"1. Before 1996, Medicare program integrity activities were underfunded and performed by insurance companies under contract with CMS, leading to reduced audits and review of medical claims. In 1997, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) and provided CMS with dedicated funding for program integrity activities, with funding ranges increasing from $430 million in 1997 to $720 million in 2003. From 1997 to 2005, total MIP expenditures increased by about 63%. MIP funds are primarily allocated to support contractors' program integrity efforts for the traditional Medicare program, including fiscal intermediaries, carriers, Program Safeguard Contractors (PSCs), and Medicare administrative contractors (MAC).
2. MIP funds are used for five program integrity activities: audits, medical review, secondary payer, benefit integrity, and provider education. From 1997 to 2005, CMS generally increased funding for each activity, with provider education receiving the largest percentage increase (about 590%) and audit and medical review receiving the largest amount of funds overall. CMS plans to use additional MIP funds provided by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) to address potential fraud, waste, and abuse in the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.
3. CMS officials have historically allocated MIP funds based on historical funding and high-level priorities, but this approach does not consider data on the effectiveness of one activity over another or allow CMS to determine if activities are yielding benefits commensurate with the amounts spent. CMS has not fully assessed whether MIP funds are appropriately allocated within the audit, medical review, benefit integrity, and provider education activities. CMS tracks return on investment (ROI) for medical review and secondary payer activities, but not for audit, which has an ROI of almost zero due to the implementation of prospective payment systems. CMS is implementing a different way to track audit savings, focusing on savings from disallowing items that directly affect an individual provider's payment under a PPS.",1
422,"1. The performance of passenger and checked baggage screeners in detecting threat objects at the nation's airports has been a long-standing concern. Screener failure rates in detecting threat objects during tests conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were 13% in 1978 and 20% in 1987. More recent tests identified weaknesses in screener performance and the need to improve screener performance and better understand the reasons for performance problems.
2. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was signed into law in November 2001, creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and giving it responsibility for securing all modes of transportation, including aviation. TSA oversees security operations at the nation's more than 450 commercial airports, including passenger and checked baggage screening operations.
3. TSA has established a basic screener training program composed of a minimum of 40 hours of classroom instruction and 60 hours of on-the-job training, and requires an annual proficiency review of all screeners. TSA also conducts operational testing of screeners and requires remedial training for any screener who fails an operational test.
4. Passenger screening is a process by which authorized TSA personnel inspect individuals and property to deter and prevent the carriage of any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, weapon, or other dangerous item aboard an aircraft or into a sterile area. Checked baggage screening is a process by which authorized security screening personnel inspect checked baggage to deter, detect, and prevent the carriage of any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, or weapon onboard an aircraft.
5. TSA has taken actions to enhance the training of screeners and Screening Supervisors but has encountered difficulties in providing access to recurrent training. FSDs reported that insufficient staffing and a lack of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity at some training facilities have made it difficult to fully utilize these programs and to meet training requirements.
6. TSA has enhanced its basic screener training program by updating the training to reflect changes to standard operating procedures, deploying a new dual-function (passenger and checked baggage screening) basic training curriculum, and allowing the option of training delivery by local staff.
7. TSA has implemented an Online Learning Center with",0
423,"1. The IRS operates a network of call centers providing round-the-clock service for tax law, account services, and refund status inquiries. This network was established in 1999 and enables the IRS to route calls to sites with the shortest hold times.
2. The IRS' Operations Center is responsible for forecasting call demand, planning call routing, developing staffing requirements, and monitoring network call traffic status. Call site staffing requirements are developed weekly with call site input and agreement.
3. The IRS faces challenges in determining the staffing level for its toll-free telephone customer service operations. It has not established a long-term, desired level-of-service goal based on taxpayer needs and costs and benefits of meeting them.
4. The IRS recognizes the need to establish long-term goals and is considering adopting measures used by other organizations and establishing goals for those measures.
5. The six call sites visited by the GAO faced challenges in recruiting, training, retaining, and scheduling customer service representatives. The IRS is in the early stages of developing a national recruiting strategy and is working with the Office of Personnel Management to develop a mechanism for assessing the refresher training needs of customer service representatives.",1
424,"1. Ginnie Mae is a government-owned corporation that guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by government-insured or guaranteed loans.
2. Ginnie Mae's mission is to expand affordable housing in America by linking capital markets to the nation's housing markets.
3. Ginnie Mae does not buy or sell loans or issue MBS, but instead provides guarantees backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
4. Ginnie Mae has several different products, including Ginnie Mae I, Ginnie Mae II, and Multiclass Securities Program, which include Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMIC) and Ginnie Mae Platinum Securities.
5. Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on MBS, but investors do not face credit risk because the underlying mortgages are federally insured or guaranteed.
6. Ginnie Mae's market share of new issuances and volume outstanding has declined over the last 20 years, largely due to the growth of the conventional mortgage market and the decline in FHA and VA loan origination.
7. Ginnie Mae securities finance the great majority of FHA and VA loans, but the agency faces potential competition from other secondary market entities.
8. Ginnie Mae charges issuers a guarantee fee for providing its guarantee of timely payment, and issuers also pay a commitment fee for the authority to pool mortgages into Ginnie Mae MBS.
9. Ginnie Mae's revenues exceed its expenses, reducing the federal budget deficit.
10. Ginnie Mae has taken steps to address internal control weaknesses and data integrity issues, but ongoing initiatives are still underway.",1
425,"1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has agreed to reverse $592 million of the $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments identified in a prior report. However, due to DOD's long-standing accounting accuracy problems, additional reviews are necessary to correct the reversed transactions.

426,"1. The Internet, which was originally a research project sponsored by the U.S. government, has grown significantly and is now critical to American businesses, consumers, and vital services.
2. The domain name system (DNS), which ensures the uniqueness of each email and web site address, is critical to the functioning of the Internet.
3. The DNS relies on a set of 13 root servers to coordinate the translation of domain names into Internet addresses.
4. The U.S. government supported the implementation of the DNS for nearly a decade, but in 1998 it began the process of transitioning technical responsibility to the private sector.

427,"1. The federal government has held funds in trust for Indian tribes since 1820, with many allotments still in trust today. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for managing these trust funds and services, including accounting for revenue, investing trust funds, maintaining land title and ownership records, and managing natural resource assets.
2. In 2001, the Secretary of the Interior contracted with Electronic Data Systems to determine how trust reforms could be improved and reorganized the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Office of Special Trustee (OST) in response to the recommendations. OST's budget and staff have grown significantly since 1997, mainly due to trust reform efforts and trust fund management responsibilities.
3. OST is responsible for implementing trust reforms associated with the trust funds accounting system and the overall integration of various trust reform automated systems. BIA and OST are responsible for trust reforms associated with the implementation of the TAAMS system for managing land title records and leasing activities for Indian lands.
4. OST has made important progress in implementing trust fund management reforms, including the Trust Funds Accounting System (TFAS) and the Trust Beneficiary Call Center. However, OST has not prepared a timetable for completing remaining trust reform activities or identified a date for its termination under the 1994 Act.
5. The 1994 Act includes a sunset provision for OST, but the Special Trustee has not provided a timetable for completing trust reforms or a date for OST's termination. The lack of a timetable has hindered the ability of Congress, tribal organizations, and the public to assess the status of OST's trust reforms or plan for trust fund operations once reforms are completed.",1
428,"1. In 1998, the VA and DOD began developing a comprehensive, life-long medical record for each service member with the Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR) project, which aimed to create an electronic interface for physicians and authorized users to access data from either agency's health information systems.
2. The GCPR project faced management and oversight challenges, leading to recommendations in 2001 and 2002 for a clear mission, goals, and objectives, a designated lead entity, and commitment to sound project management principles.
3. In response, the agencies revised their strategy, designating VA as the lead entity and renaming the project the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) program. The FHIE program was completed in two phases, enabling one-way data transfer from DOD's CHCS to a separate VA database and adding to the base of patient health information available to VA clinicians.
4. The departments also began working on the HealthePeople (Federal) initiative, aiming for a longer-term, two-way exchange of health information between DOD and VA systems, with a common health information architecture and standardized data, communications, security, and high-performance health information systems.
5. The departments have faced challenges in developing an architecture for the electronic interface, selecting a lead entity, and establishing a project management plan, but they have made progress on the CHDR program, a critical component of the HealthePeople (Federal) initiative.
6. VA and DOD have also started two demonstration projects, Bidirectional Health Information Exchange and Laboratory Data Sharing Interface, focusing on exchanging information between existing systems, with the goal of improving the sharing and coordination of health care and health care resources between the departments.",1
429,"1. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses the Examination Quality Measurement System (EQMS) to measure the quality of closed audits against nine IRS audit standards.
2. The EQMS audit standards address the scope, audit techniques, technical conclusions, workpaper preparation, reports, and time management of an audit.
3. Each standard includes additional key elements describing specific components of a quality audit.
4. IRS uses the key element pass rate as one measure of audit quality, which computes the percentage of audits demonstrating the characteristics defined by the key element.
5. The primary tool used by IRS to control quality under the nine standards is the review of ongoing audit work, which is the responsibility of first-line supervisors called group managers.
6. After an audit closes, IRS uses EQMS to collect information about the audit process, changes to the process, level of audit quality, and success of any efforts to improve the process and quality.
7. IRS auditors did not always meet the requirements laid out under the workpaper standard, which requires that workpapers provide the principal support for the auditor’s report and document the procedures applied, tests performed, information obtained, and conclusions reached.
8. IRS has historically found problems with the quality of its workpapers, with IRS auditors meeting all of the key elements of the workpaper standard in no more than 72 percent of the audits during the past 6 years.
9. IRS’ primary quality control mechanism is supervisory review of the audit workpapers to ensure adherence to the audit standards, but there is limited documentation of such reviews in the workpapers.
10. The lack of documentation on workpaper review raises questions about the extent of supervisory involvement with the audits, and proposed changes to the IRM may address this issue by requiring such documentation.",1
430,"1. The Antiterrorism Assistance (ATA) program, authorized by Congress in 1983, aims to enhance the counterterrorism skills of friendly countries, strengthen ties with foreign governments, and promote respect for human rights.
2. ATA provides training courses and equipment to partner nations, focusing on critical capabilities such as crisis management, cyberterrorism, and dignitary protection.
3. From fiscal years 2002 to 2007, ATA funding increased, with about 57% of the funding allocated for training and training-related activities going to the top 10 recipient nations.
4. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism and the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security share responsibility for overseeing ATA, with S/CT leading the initial assessment of a partner nation's counterterrorism needs and DS/T/ATA developing country-specific plans.
5. However, S/CT and DS/T/ATA have not systematically used country-specific needs assessments and program reviews to plan assistance to partner nations, resulting in inconsistencies and weaknesses in the assessments.
6. The tiered list of countries based on priority categories does not always align with the assistance provided, as unforeseen events and governmental initiatives can influence the allocation of resources.
7. DS/T/ATA officials have not consistently used ATA country needs assessments and program reviews in making program decisions or creating annual country assistance plans.
8. State has not complied with a congressional mandate to report on U.S. international counterterrorism assistance since 1996, and ATA annual reports have contained inaccurate data and lacked systematic assessments of program results.
9. The GAO recommends revising internal guidance, improving the needs assessment and program review process, establishing clearer measures of sustainability, and complying with the congressional mandate to report on U.S. international counterterrorism assistance.",1
431,"1. There are two approaches for reorganizing or terminating a large financial company: bankruptcy and special legal and regulatory resolution regimes. Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure aimed at helping individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts, while special legal and regulatory resolution regimes have been created to address insolvent financial entities such as insured depository institutions and insurance companies.
2. The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities, including bankruptcy courts, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC), the Federal Judicial Center, the Department of Justice’s U.S. Trustee Program, and the judiciary’s Bankruptcy Administrator Program. A preference action can be asserted for payments made to an insider within a year prior to the bankruptcy filing.
3. Large, complex financial companies that are eligible to file for bankruptcy generally file under Chapter 11 of the Code. However, certain financial institutions, such as insured depository institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, and commodity brokers, may not file as debtors under the Code or face special restrictions in using the Code. Regulators often play a role in financial company bankruptcies.
4. Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, based on the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), promotes coordination between courts in different countries during insolvencies and has been adopted in 21 jurisdictions. It authorizes several types of coordination, including U.S. case trustees or other authorized entities operating in foreign countries, foreign representatives having direct access to U.S. courts, and U.S. courts communicating information with foreign authorities.",1
432,"1. The electricity industry is composed of four main functions: generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations. Once electricity is generated, it is sent through high-voltage transmission lines to local distributors and then transformed into a lower voltage for consumption. The industry is highly dependent on control systems to manage and control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power. However, for many years, aspects of the electricity network lacked technologies to monitor electricity flow, communications networks to integrate parts of the electricity grid with control centers, and computerized control devices to automate system management.
2. The smart grid vision aims to transform the electricity grid into one that is more reliable and efficient, facilitates alternative forms of generation including renewable energy, and gives consumers real-time information about fluctuating energy costs. This vision would increase the use of IT systems and networks and two-way communication to automate actions that system operators formerly had to make manually. Smart grid initiatives have commonly involved installing advanced metering infrastructure on homes and commercial buildings, adding smart components to provide system operators with more detailed data on the conditions of the transmission and distribution systems, and using high-resolution, time-synchronized monitors on the transmission system. The use of smart grid systems may have benefits including improved reliability, downward pressure on electricity rates, an improved ability to more efficiently use alternative sources of energy, and an improved ability to detect and respond to potential attacks on the grid.",1
433,"1. The federal workforce faces mission-critical skills gaps, particularly in areas such as cybersecurity and acquisitions, which hinder the government's ability to efficiently serve the public. These gaps may be due to insufficient staffing or a lack of appropriate skills among employees.
2. The federal workforce is becoming increasingly skilled and specialized, but the General Schedule (GS) classification system has not kept pace with these changes. This has led to issues with pay, recruitment, and retention of mission-critical employees.
3. Effective performance management is essential for addressing poor performance and retaining top talent. However, many federal employees receive high performance ratings, making it difficult to distinguish between levels of performance.

434,"1. The majority of the costs associated with the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) fall into two accounts: military personnel and operation and maintenance. These funds are used for various purposes such as pay and allowances of mobilized reservists, Imminent Danger Pay, Family Separation Allowance, transportation of personnel, goods, and equipment, unit operating support costs, and intelligence, communications, and logistics support.
2. Estimating the cost of ongoing military operations is difficult due to changing operational requirements. If operations cost more than originally estimated, DOD may use various authorities to meet its needs, such as transferring and reprogramming funds and reducing or deferring planned spending for peacetime operations. DOD can shift funds between appropriation accounts (transfer authority) or within a specific appropriation account (reprogramming).
3. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received a total of about $52.4 billion and about $62.1 billion, respectively, in supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses. However, DOD and the military services have lost visibility over funds provided through annual appropriations, making it difficult to determine how much, if any, was used to support GWOT in those years.
4. In December 2001, the President directed that DOD's annual budget submission be increased by about $10 billion annually to support GWOT. This resulted in Program Budget Decision 736, which provided for increasing DOD's annual budget request in the amount of more than $10 billion per year plus inflation in fiscal years 2003 through 2007. However, DOD has not explicitly maintained visibility over how these funds were used to support GWOT.
5. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the Army, Air Force, and Navy received additional funds in their annual appropriations, totaling about $7.9 billion, which DOD described as for support of military operations in the war on terrorism. However, DOD and the military services cannot be certain that these funds were actually used to support GWOT-related activities.",1
435,"1. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was extended until October 3, 2010, to provide flexibility in addressing continued weaknesses in housing markets, financial conditions for small businesses, and to allow for the implementation of additional programs to address the foreclosure crisis. The decision to extend TARP was made at the highest levels within the Treasury Department and was based on a range of officials' views from various Treasury offices. The extension allowed Treasury to reallocate existing commitments and make additional funds available for some programs.
2. Treasury used a variety of quantitative indicators to measure the key factors that influenced the decision to extend TARP, including housing market indicators such as foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies, serious delinquency rates, and foreclosure start rates. Treasury also considered the slow pace of conversions of homeowners from trial modifications to permanent modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the need for more time to complete the significant backlog of modifications, build up servicers' capacity, and allow the public and investors time to better understand the requirements and opportunity presented by the HAMP process.
3. The extension of TARP marked a shift in focus from capitalizing institutions and stabilizing securitization markets to mitigating preventable foreclosures and improving financial conditions for small banks and small businesses. Treasury estimated that new commitments under MHA and CBLI could increase the costs of TARP by $25 billion, but overall, Treasury expected that TARP would ultimately cost taxpayers $105.4 billion, more than $200 billion less than initially estimated.",1
436,"1. Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act, USDA, through FSIS, is responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and certain egg products. FDA is responsible for all other foods. Both FDA and FSIS have the authority to take enforcement actions to ensure that facilities meet their safety and sanitation regulatory requirements. In fiscal year 1999, FDA, FSIS, and the states spent a total of about $1.3 billion on food safety activities. Following the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government intensified its efforts to address the potential for deliberate contamination of agriculture and food products, and both FDA and FSIS have taken many actions to better protect the food supply against deliberate contamination.
2. FDA and USDA issued guidelines to the food-processing industry suggesting measures to enhance security at their facilities, but these guidelines are voluntary and food processors are not required to adopt any of the security measures. FDA and USDA have also asked their field inspection personnel to be on heightened alert and to discuss, but not interpret, the security guidance with facility officials during their routine food safety inspections. However, both agencies have instructed their field inspection personnel to refrain from enforcing any aspects of the security guidelines because the agencies generally believe that they lack such authority. They have also instructed their field personnel not to document plants’ security measures because they are concerned that such information would be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.",1
437,"1. The MAS program, also known as the Federal Supply Schedule or the schedules program, is the largest interagency contracting vehicle directed and managed by GSA.
2. MACs and GWACs are also interagency contracts, and government buyers usually pay a fee for using other agencies’ GWACs, MACs, and schedule contracts.
3. In fiscal year 2008, federal agencies spent at least $60 billion on GWACs, MACs, the MAS program, and enterprisewide contracts to buy goods and services.
4. Interagency and enterprisewide contracts should provide an advantage to government agencies when buying billions of dollars worth of goods and services.
5. However, OMB and agencies lack reliable and comprehensive data to effectively leverage, manage, and oversee these contracts.
6. There is a lack of governmentwide policy for establishing and overseeing MACs and enterprisewide contracts.
7. GSA’s MAS program is still the primary governmentwide buying program, providing advantages to both federal agencies and vendors.
8. There are concerns about contract duplication, with vendors and agency officials expressing concerns about duplication of effort among these contracts, resulting in duplication of products and services, increased costs, and missed opportunities to leverage the government’s buying power.",1
438,"1. IT investments can enrich people’s lives and improve organizational performance, but some federally funded IT projects have become costly mistakes.
2. 18F and USDS were formed in 2014 to improve public-facing federal digital services, with similar missions but different approaches.
3. 18F, located within the Technology Transformation Service within GSA, has five business units that provide various IT services to agencies and relies on 173 staff, mostly hired through special hiring authorities.
4. 18F is funded through the Acquisition Services Fund, a revolving fund managed by the Federal Acquisition Service, and is required to have a plan to achieve full cost recovery.
5. USDS, led by an Administrator and Deputy Federal CIO who reports to the Federal CIO, selects which projects to apply resources to and aims to recruit private sector experts to improve the most important digital services for citizens.
6. USDS has used special hiring authorities for the vast majority of its staff and reported spending $318,778 during fiscal year 2014 and approximately $4.7 million during fiscal year 2015.
7. The President’s Budget for fiscal year 2016 proposed funding for digital service teams at 25 agencies, and USDS policy calls for agencies to hire or designate an executive for managing their digital services teams.
8. OMB plays a key role in helping federal agencies manage their IT investments by working with them to better plan, justify, and determine how much they need to spend on projects and how to manage approved projects.

439,"1. The baby boom generation, defined as those born between 1946 and 1964, will start turning 65 in 2011 and the last will turn 65 in 2029, leading to significant changes in the ratio of the working age population to the population aged 65 or older.
2. The aged dependency ratio, which estimates the number of workers available to support each retiree, will rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% in 2030, meaning there will be fewer than three persons of traditional working age for every person age 65 or over.
3. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is not only due to the growing numbers of older persons, but also the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers, which is expected to continue.
4. Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives to work longer, including the elimination of the practice of reducing Social Security benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age, and the increase in the delayed retirement credit.
5. Federal laws such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) promote the employment of older persons and prohibit age discrimination in employment.
6. The number of older workers will grow substantially over the next two decades and they will become an increasingly significant proportion of all workers, with the oldest baby boomers currently 55 years old and the youngest turning 55 in 2019.
7. Older workers are employed in a diverse group of occupations but are a growing proportion of the workers in white-collar occupations, and are expected to make relatively greater gains in earnings than their younger counterparts between 2000 and 2008.
8. Employers can encourage older workers to stay in the workforce by offering flexible employment arrangements, such as part-time or part-year schedules, consulting or contracting for limited periods of time, or a reduction of job responsibilities. However, survey data suggests that such programs are often limited in scope and not widespread in the private sector.",1
440,"1. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was established in 1986 to facilitate legitimate travel of visitors for business or tourism by providing visa-free travel to the United States. The program has expanded from 8 to 36 countries and aims to boost international business and tourism, as well as airline revenues, and create substantial economic benefits to the United States.
2. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and gave it responsibility for establishing visa policy, including policy for the VWP. DHS created the Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit in 2004 to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating VWP countries’ adherence to the program’s statutory and policy requirements.
3. To qualify for the VWP, a country must offer reciprocal visa-free travel privileges to U.S. citizens, have a low refusal rate for visa applicants, issue machine-readable passports, enter into an agreement with the United States to report or make available information about lost or stolen passports, accept the repatriation of citizens, enter into an agreement to share information regarding whether citizens and nationals traveling to the United States represent a threat to U.S. security or welfare, and not compromise U.S. law enforcement or security interests.
4. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 and the 9/11 Act added security requirements for all VWP countries and increased the frequency of assessments of the effect of each country’s continued participation in the VWP on U.S. security, law enforcement, and immigration interests.
5. DHS implemented ESTA in 2008 to collect passenger data and complete security checks on the data before passengers board a U.S. bound carrier. ESTA approval is generally valid for 2 years and passengers traveling under the program are no longer required to complete the I-94W form each time they board a carrier to the United States.
6. DHS has taken steps to minimize the burden associated with ESTA’s use and has informed passengers who do not qualify for VWP travel that they need to apply for a visa before they travel to the United States. However, DHS has not fully analyzed the risks of carrier and passenger noncompliance with",1
441,"1. State child welfare systems, which receive funding and guidance from the federal government, have experienced significant growth in their foster care populations over the past decade. This has strained their ability to provide adequate services to children and families in need. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes and to provide services to families and children with the goal of reuniting them. If reunification is not possible, the state must find permanent placement for the child outside the family home.
2. In response to the prolonged stays of children in foster care, many states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing. These laws vary in their specific requirements, with some states requiring hearings within 6 or 12 months, and others consistent with the federal requirement of 18 months. The goal of these initiatives is to expedite the permanent placement process and reduce the time children spend in foster care. However, some states have reported unintended consequences, such as an increase in the number of children placed in long-term foster care due to the lack of other placement options.",1
442,"1. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) of 2014 requires federal agencies to disclose federal agency expenditures and link them to federal program activities for effective tracking of federal spending.
2. The DATA Act mandates government-wide reporting of a greater variety of federal funds, including budget and financial information, and tracking of these funds at multiple points in the federal spending lifecycle.
3. OMB and Treasury are responsible for leading the implementation of the DATA Act, and they have taken steps to help agencies meet their reporting requirements, such as establishing data element definitions, issuing guidance, and meeting with agencies.
4. OMB has issued guidance on reporting financial and award information required under the act, including implementing data definition standards, a standard data exchange format, and linking agency financial systems with award systems.
5. Treasury has released the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) version 1.0, which provides information on how to standardize the way financial assistance awards, contracts, and other financial and non-financial data will be collected and reported under the DATA Act.
6. The DATA Act also requires agencies' inspectors general (IGs) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess and report on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of spending data submitted by federal agencies.
7. IGs have been encouraged to conduct readiness reviews of their respective agencies' implementation of the DATA Act and to provide recommendations for improvement.
8. As of February 2017, 16 IGs had identified a range of issues and challenges that may affect agencies' abilities to produce quality data for submission to Treasury as part of the DATA Act reporting requirements.",1
443,"1. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has an agreement with the Administrative Resource Center (ARC) to provide contracting support for a fee. ARC is a part of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt and operates as a self-supporting, business-like enterprise.
2. The agreement between OSC and ARC is a mechanism for interagency contracting, which generally involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services.
3. OSC used 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to hire intermittent consultants for the organizational assessment, as it is authorized to do so by its appropriation. This statute allows agencies to acquire the temporary or intermittent services of experts or consultants without regard to competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements.
4. In contracting with MPRI for the organizational assessment, several required steps were not taken, including seeking competition among Schedule vendors, demonstrating the necessity of a sole-source order, performing duties normally done by contracting officer's representatives without authorization or training, and evaluating the contractor's price for reasonableness.
5. The Competition in Contracting Act requires contracting officers to promote and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding government contracts. Use of GSA’s Schedule program is considered a competitive procedure, but ordering offices are required to follow specific procedures to ensure competition.
6. The contracting officer, in this case ARC, may designate a contracting officer’s representative in the requiring agency, in this case OSC, to act as the contracting officer’s technical expert and representative in the monitoring and administration of a contract or task order.
7. OSC employees may seek redress for alleged prohibited personnel practices through OSC, but this may be unworkable for OSC employees in certain circumstances. Two other agencies with redress roles, MSPB and EEOC, have taken steps to avoid conflicts when their employees have complaints.
8. OSC would need explicit authority to implement options that ensure OSC employees have alternative avenues of recourse when their prohibited personnel practice allegations involve the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel. These options include an external investigation of their allegations and expanded rights",1
444,"1. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for promoting the health, welfare, and dignity of veterans through medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials.
2. VA's three major components - Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA) - provide benefits and services to veterans and their families.
3. VA operates an IT infrastructure to support its mission, including 240 information systems, 314,000 desktop computers, 30,000 laptops, and nearly 460,000 network user accounts.
4. VA's IT systems are used for determining benefits, processing claims, admitting patients to hospitals and clinics, and accessing health records.
5. VA plans to replace two obsolete systems, Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) and Benefits Delivery Network (BDN), with modern systems.
6. VA's 6-year strategic plan emphasizes increasing veterans' access to benefits and services, eliminating the disability claims backlog, and ending veteran homelessness.
7. VA reported spending $3.9 billion on IT resources in fiscal year 2015, with approximately $548 million on new systems development efforts.
8. VA's CIO has initiated a transformation strategy to focus on stabilizing and streamlining processes, mitigating weaknesses, and improving outcomes by institutionalizing new IT management capabilities.
9. VA's IT challenges, including the failed modernization of a system, suspended development of another system, and lack of system interoperability with DOD, contribute to the department's designation as a high-risk area.
10. VA and DOD lack electronic health record systems that permit the efficient electronic exchange of patient health information, and their plans to modernize their two separate systems are duplicative and not cost-effective.",1
445,"1. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for managing the Medicare program, which includes processing claims and monitoring managed care health plans. HCFA has a unique authority and responsibility among health care payers and serves about 33 million beneficiaries.
2. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) have granted HCFA substantial authority and responsibility to reform Medicare, including enhancing anti-fraud-and-abuse activities and introducing new health plan options and payment reforms.
3. HCFA is facing challenges in implementing these reforms, including a need for specialized expertise, loss of institutional experience, and disruptions from reorganization. There is also a concern about the agency's capacity to carry out its other Medicare program objectives due to a lack of adequate justification for the resources it seeks.
4. HCFA is struggling to address program vulnerabilities and the risks associated with a program of Medicare's magnitude. The loss of experienced staff has further diminished the agency's capacity, and senior managers do not appear to be adequately informed about the status of the full range of Medicare activities or associated resource needs.",1
446,"1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is primarily supported by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from excise taxes on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and cargo shipment.
2. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA's two capital accounts, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account, as well as the Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account and part of FAA’s Operations account.
3. The administration’s reauthorization proposal would change FAA’s financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges.
4. Under the proposed system, funding for ATO would come primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft.
5. Funding for AIP, EAS, and part of RE&D would come from an equal fuel tax on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers.
6. FAA's budget structure would also change, with two new budget accounts established: Air Traffic Organization and Safety and Operations.
7. The current funding structure, with some modifications to the excise taxes and tax rates and changes in the levels of General Fund contributions, has successfully funded a growing FAA budget.
8. However, FAA has been concerned about the long-run revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency of its funding due to the lack of connection between some key drivers of current FAA revenues, such as ticket prices, and FAA’s workload and costs.
9. Some of the administration’s proposed changes for funding FAA, such as establishing direct user charges for commercial aviation and substantially increasing fuel taxes for general aviation, are intended to link FAA’s revenues more closely with its costs.
10. However, the effectiveness of the proposed funding structure in linking costs with revenues depends critically on how well FAA’s new cost allocation method assigns costs to users and on how closely the proposed funding structure adheres to the principle of cost-based funding.",1
447,"1. The General Services Administration (GSA) and the Integrated Services Council (IMC) are planning the FTS Networx acquisition program to replace existing FTS2001, Federal Wireless Telecommunications Service, and FTS Satellite Service contracts with two acquisitions: Networx Universal and Networx Select. The Networx Universal contracts aim to ensure continuity of services and prices found under expiring contracts, while Networx Select will provide agencies with leading-edge services and solutions with less extensive geographic and service coverage. GSA faces challenges in finalizing the program strategy, including ensuring adequate inventory information, establishing measures of success, structuring and scheduling contracts, and initiating implementation planning.
2. GSA recognizes the importance of transition planning, but it has not yet fully addressed these issues. GSA's Associate Commissioner Service Delivery/Development outlined proactive steps, including developing processes and procedures, identifying funding needs, and training agency personnel to support a smooth contract transition. It is crucial that GSA follows through on these initial steps to ensure a seamless transition to the new contracts and avoid repeating FTS2001 transition difficulties. The success of Networx will depend on GSA's leadership and stakeholder commitment in overcoming challenges and leveraging the telecommunications marketplace to deliver better and more cost-effective solutions for federal agencies.",1
448,"1. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) is a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) established to manage and administer student financial assistance programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. FSA provides more than $50 billion in student aid annually to approximately 8 million students and their families. However, the student financial aid environment is large and complex, involving about 5,300 schools, 4,100 lenders, and 36 guaranty agencies. FSA oversees or directly manages approximately $200 billion in outstanding loans representing about 100 million borrowers.
2. FSA has taken steps to develop and implement a strategic direction, but additional actions are needed. FSA's performance plan discusses its three strategic goals, including increasing customer and employee satisfaction while decreasing unit cost. However, the plan could be more useful with respect to systems integration and program integrity. FSA has also begun to implement a balanced scorecard, but some employees have found it difficult to link employees' day-to-day activities with the organization's progress toward its strategic goals. FSA and the department have not met its requirement to report annually to Congress on its progress in meeting the goals laid out in its performance plan. FSA's performance plan includes measures for gauging FSA progress in meeting each of these strategic goals, but it does not fully disclose the bases of its unit cost calculation and what costs are included and excluded from the calculation. FSA needs to ensure that it makes human capital management an integral part of its strategic approach for accomplishing its mission, particularly with respect to workforce planning and development.",1

450,"1. Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a compact, mixed-use, walkable neighborhood located near transit, typically within a half-mile radius of a transit station.
2. TODs can increase access to employment, educational, cultural, and other opportunities by promoting transportation options to households, resulting in increased transit ridership and reduced road congestion.
3. Stakeholders involved in TOD planning and implementation include local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, metropolitan-planning organizations, local governments, regional councils, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts.
4. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD but does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, FTA has been expanding its role in TOD in recent years by funding TOD research, coordinating with other federal agencies, and implementing a transit-oriented development planning pilot program.
5. Factors that can support TOD include market demand for real estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, and a transit line that efficiently connects to established job and activity centers.
6. Challenges that can hinder TOD include higher construction costs, lenders' reluctance to finance TOD projects, lengthy local-development approval processes, an unsupportive local population, and land around transit stations that is unattractive for development.
7. Local governments can use a variety of policies to encourage TOD, including zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives.
8. FTA evaluates proposed transit projects for potential New Starts funding based on criteria set forth in law, including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, economic development effects, land use, and cost-effectiveness.
9. Two of the six project-justification criteria—economic development effects and land use—require documentation from project sponsors related to whether current and future land use is supportive of transit.
10. FTA's assessment of TOD-related factors when assessing proposed projects is generally consistent with the factors that local stakeholders told us affect projects' results. However, there are inherent limitations in the extent to which some factors can be fully evaluated.",1
451,"1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been sending out Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statements (PEBES) to workers since 1995, which provide information on a worker's earnings history and estimates of their future Social Security benefits.
2. The PEBES are intended to help workers plan for their financial future, ensure that their earnings records are accurate, and reduce the time and cost required to correct errors in earnings records.
3. The PEBES estimates are based on certain assumptions about a worker's future employment and earnings, and may over- or understate benefits for certain individuals, such as federal workers who are eligible for both Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security benefits.
4. The public's reaction to receiving an unsolicited PEBES has been generally favorable, with most people indicating that they are glad to receive the statement and find the information helpful.
5. However, the current statement provides too much information, which may overwhelm the reader, and presents the information in a way that undermines its usefulness.
6. SSA officials have acknowledged these weaknesses and have taken steps to improve the PEBES, such as revising the Commissioner's message and making the statement shorter and less complex.
7. The design expert consulted by GAO suggested that the statement include an obvious purpose, an attractive and functional design, easy-to-understand explanations, and a clear structure to help the reader identify the most important points and move easily from one section to the next.",1
452,"1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two disability programs: Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs use the same definition of disability, but have different program purposes and requirements for entitlement. DI is an insurance program for individuals who have lost earnings due to disability, while SSI provides a standard minimum level of income for individuals with disabilities and limited income and assets.
2. DI and SSI beneficiaries who work are responsible for reporting their work activity to SSA. However, SSA has no specific provisions for adjusting benefits for concurrent beneficiaries who work and must apply the work incentive provisions of the two programs independently. Most concurrent beneficiaries interact with SSA through its network of field offices, which use employees who specialize in either the Social Security programs or the SSI program.
3. Approximately 1.2 million individuals receive benefits from both DI and SSI. These beneficiaries are an average age of 45, with fewer than 15 percent between the ages of 17 and 30. Over half of concurrent beneficiaries have a mental impairment, and approximately one-ninth have an impairment related to their muscular or skeletal system.
4. SSA has taken steps to improve service to concurrent beneficiaries and increase the accuracy of their payments by better coordinating the administrative process related to work activity. However, the lack of integrated guidance and coordination between the DI and SSI program rules, especially for concurrent beneficiaries who work, makes it difficult to serve these beneficiaries effectively. SSA is currently testing and evaluating new initiatives to address these challenges.",1
453,"1. The federal government has provided approximately $88 billion in funding through four emergency supplemental appropriations acts for hurricane relief and recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast region. However, there is no central collection point or framework in place to compile and report on how these funds are being spent, making it difficult for decision makers to determine the status of funding provided in direct response to these hurricanes at both the individual federal agency level and the governmentwide level.
2. FEMA, the agency responsible for administering the provisions of the Stafford Act, uses appropriations made to the Disaster Relief Fund to assist relief and recovery efforts. However, FEMA does not have mechanisms in place to collect and report on information from other agencies that are performing work on its behalf through mission assignments, resulting in limited usefulness from a governmentwide perspective. Additionally, there is no governmentwide framework or mechanisms in place to collect and consolidate information from the 22 federal agencies that have directly received funding for hurricane relief efforts and report on this information.",1
454,"1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has authority to authorize all unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operations in the national airspace, but currently only allows access on a case-by-case basis while a final rulemaking is not completed. FAA provides access through Certificates of Waiver or Authorization (COA), Special Airworthiness Certificates in the Experimental Category, and Section 333 exemptions.
2. FAA has been planning for further integration of UAS into the national airspace system and has issued the UAS Comprehensive Plan and the UAS Integration Roadmap, which provide a broad framework to guide UAS integration efforts. The plans describe a phased approach to FAA’s UAS integration plans—Accommodation, Integration, and Evolution—with associated priorities for each phase.
3. FAA has issued a Notice for Proposed Rulemaking for the operations of small UASs, which could allow greater access to the national airspace if finalized. FAA has also selected six UAS test ranges in December 2013 for research and testing in support of safe UAS integration into the national airspace.
4. Other countries such as Canada, Australia, France, and the United Kingdom have regulations and restrictions on commercial UAS operations, but have allowed such operations for years. The speed of change and complexity of airspace and supporting infrastructure can vary based on a number of factors.
5. FAA faces critical steps to keeping the UAS integration process moving forward, including issuing a final rule for small UAS operations, developing a detailed implementation plan, addressing safety and privacy concerns, and accounting for changes to the national airspace system as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).",1

Solar energy technologies include photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, and solar hot water, which can be used for various applications such as heating, cooling, and powering homes and businesses. Federal financial support for the development and production of solar energy technologies is provided through initiatives at six federal agencies, with around $2.6 billion obligated for solar projects in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.
2. The 65 initiatives support a variety of key characteristics, including different types of solar technologies, a range of technology advancement activities from basic research to commercialization, and several types of funding recipients such as universities, industry, nonprofit organizations, and federal labs and researchers. Most concentrated solar power technologies are designed for utility-scale operations and are connected to the electricity-transmission system.
3. The initiatives are fragmented across six agencies and many overlap to some degree, but agency officials reported a number of coordination activities to avoid duplication. However, there is no clear evidence of duplication among initiatives, as they sometimes differ in meaningful ways or leverage the efforts of other initiatives.
4. Officials from most initiatives reported that they engage in a variety of coordination activities with other solar-related initiatives to avoid duplication, and coordination is important to enhance and sustain federal agency coordination, address fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, and leverage resources.",1
457,"1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has determined that servicemembers must be protected against chemical or biological weapons attacks to survive and effectively conduct military operations. DOD supplies servicemembers with protective ensembles consisting of a suit, mask with breathing filter, rubber boots, butyl gloves, and hoods.
2. During Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, DOD noted that the protective equipment had limitations such as causing unacceptable heat stress, limiting freedom of movement, being bulky, and not being fully interoperable across the services. Additionally, most of the existing suits were no longer manufactured, had a 14-year lifespan, and would expire by 2007.
3. To address these issues, DOD developed new individual protective equipment such as the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) trousers and coat, improved multipurpose overboots, and new protective gloves. DOD began procuring the JSLIST suits in 1997, and plans to spend about $5.7 billion on chemical and biological defense from 2002 through 2007.
4. However, DOD's assessment process for determining the risk to military operations is unreliable, and the Department's current determination that the risk is generally low is inaccurate. The Chemical and Biological Defense Program Annual Report to Congress contains erroneous inventory data and understates equipment requirements.
5. DOD's criteria for assessing the risk of wartime shortages is to determine the numbers of protective suits, masks, breathing filters, gloves, boots, and hoods it has on hand, compared against the requirements for those individual items. However, this methodology is flawed because it does not consider the number of complete ensembles needed and it obscures military service readiness by combining service data and reporting the results jointly.
6. DOD has inaccurately assessed the risk to military operations by determining the number of individual items of equipment it has on hand and by combining the services' inventories of individual items. Service guidance specifies that a total of 1,573,866 active and reserve servicemembers need protection to meet current operations plan requirements.

458,"1. Program evaluations are systematic studies that assess program performance and address specific questions about program effectiveness, providing a valuable supplement to ongoing performance reporting.
2. Evaluations can better isolate the causal impact of programs from external conditions, measuring results that are difficult or expensive to assess annually, explaining performance gaps, or comparing the effectiveness of different approaches.
3. In a 2013 survey, most federal managers reported lacking recent evaluations of their programs, but those who had evaluations found them helpful for understanding program performance, assessing program effectiveness, making changes, and sharing best practices.
4. Key elements of national or organizational capacity to conduct and use evaluation in decision making include leadership support, organizational resources, and the robust, transparent availability of evaluation results.
5. The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRAMA) established an expectation that evidence would have a greater role in agency decision making, changing agency performance management roles, planning and review processes, and reporting to ensure the use of performance information in decision making.
6. Since 2009, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued several memorandums urging efforts to strengthen the use of rigorous impact evaluation, designate a high-level official responsible for evaluation, and demonstrate the use of evidence and evaluation in budget submissions, strategic plans, and performance plans.
7. In 2016, the Congress enacted and the President signed two pieces of legislation encouraging federal agency evaluation: the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act and the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act.
8. In a 2017 survey, 40% of federal managers reported having access to recent evaluations of their programs, and 54% of those reported that evaluations contributed to improving program management or performance, while 48% reported that evaluations contributed to assessing program effectiveness.",1

Federal efforts are in place to promote the employment of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce, including special hiring authorities such as Schedule A and appointments for veterans with disabilities.
2. Executive Order 13548 requires federal agencies to develop plans for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities, designate a senior-level official to oversee implementation, and report progress to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Labor. The federal government tracks the number of individuals with disabilities in the workforce through OPM's Standard Form 256, Self-Disclosure of Disability (SF-256).
3. In July 2010, the Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) Initiative was established to improve agency return-to-work outcomes for employees who sustain work-related injuries and illnesses. The initiative aims to set performance targets, collect and analyze injury and illness data, and prioritize safety and health management programs.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for managing public lands and resources, and is currently implementing the ALMRS/Modernization project to automate land and mineral records and case processing activities, and to provide information to support land and resource management activities. The project is expected to provide an efficient means to record, maintain, and retrieve land description, ownership, and use information to support BLM, other federal programs, and interested parties.
2. The ALMRS/Modernization project consists of three components: ALMRS IOC, GCDB, and technology modernization and rehost of selected systems. The ALMRS IOC component is to provide support for case processing activities and information for land and resource management activities. The GCDB component is the database that will contain geographic coordinates and survey information for land parcels. The technology modernization and rehost component consists of installing computer and telecommunications equipment and converting selected management and administrative systems to a relational database system.
3. As of April 30, 1995, about $262.8 million had been obligated for the ALMRS/Modernization project, with initial hardware installation for the Alaska and Wyoming state, district, and resource area offices delayed due to a shortage of hardware funds in fiscal year 1995. The collection and validation of land and mineral data for ALMRS IOC are on schedule, and the development of ALMRS IOC software is currently on schedule. However, one state office, Montana, is behind schedule in meeting the data collection milestones set in 1993 for the GCDB component.
4. The administrative systems rehost effort is on schedule, with all 13 of the planned software applications and related databases converted from COBOL to INFORMIX. Three of these applications have been rehosted to the ALMRS/Modernization equipment and are operational, and the remaining applications are expected to be rehosted soon. BLM plans to perform a 30-day acceptance test of the ALMRS IOC at pilot sites to assess functionality and performance in an operational setting, and to stress test the ALMRS IOC in a network environment. However, the Bureau's plans do not examine how the entire ALMRS/Modernization will perform under peak workload conditions.",1
461,"1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an independent organization affiliated with the United Nations that promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy and ensures the secure and safe handling of nuclear materials. The IAEA derives its authority to establish and administer safeguards from the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and other regional nonproliferation treaties, bilateral commitments between states, and project agreements with states.
2. The IAEA's safeguards program aims to verify that nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes. This is achieved through a set of activities, including inspections, material-accounting measures, containment measures, and surveillance devices. The IAEA has taken steps to strengthen safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program.
3. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a multilateral export control group established in 1975 to govern the exports of nuclear materials and equipment. The NSG guidelines require countries to accept IAEA safeguards at facilities using controlled nuclear-related items and, in 1992, were broadened to require countries receiving nuclear exports to agree to IAEA's safeguards as a condition of supply.
4. The IAEA faces limitations in its ability to draw conclusions with absolute assurance about whether a country is developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program due to limited inspection rights and practical problems that restrict access. IAEA's ability to detect undeclared activities remains largely untested, and there are weaknesses in the agency's ability to effectively implement strengthened safeguards due to limited information about the nuclear activities of non-NPT countries and the lack of adoption of the Additional Protocol by many NPT signatories.
5. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has helped stop, slow, or raise the costs of nuclear proliferation, but there are weaknesses that could limit its ability to curb nuclear proliferation, including the lack of sharing of complete export licensing information and prompt review and agreement on common lists of items to control and approaches to controlling them.

The Year 2000 computing crisis poses a high risk of severely disrupting critical services provided by the government and private sector, including financial transactions, flights, power, and national defense. The problem is particularly acute due to the interdependencies among various public and private enterprises at all levels.
2. Key economic sectors that could be seriously affected if their systems are not Year 2000 compliant include information and telecommunications, banking and finance, health, safety, and emergency services, transportation, power and water, and manufacturing and small business. The information and telecommunications sector is especially important due to its role in enabling the electronic transfer of funds, distribution of electrical power, and control of gas and oil pipeline systems.
3. The global nature of the problem poses another significant risk, as the world has become critically dependent on computers for electronic communication and international commerce. However, there are indications of Year 2000 readiness problems in the international arena, with only 14% of countries surveyed by the World Bank having a national Year 2000 program and 51% having no conclusive data on their readiness.

463,"1. The Information Quality Act (IQA) of 2000 requires federal agencies to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, that they disseminate. Agencies were required to develop IQA guidelines by the end of fiscal year 2002 and establish administrative mechanisms for affected persons to seek correction of information. IQA builds on previous efforts to improve the quality of information, including OMB Circular A-130 and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
2. OIRA, which oversees the implementation of governmentwide policies in the areas of information technology, privacy, and statistics, had responsibility for developing the governmentwide IQA guidelines and helping agencies meet the act’s requirement that they develop their own guidelines. However, implementation of IQA guidelines has been uneven, with OIRA concentrating its communication and outreach efforts on cabinet-level and regulatory agencies. As a result, many independent agencies do not have IQA guidelines in place and did not post IQA information on their Web sites.
3. The overwhelming cause for the decline in the number of IQA requests from over 24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004 was that in fiscal year 2004 FEMA no longer classified flood insurance rate map correction requests as IQA requests. In fiscal year 2004, 15 agencies reported a total of 62 IQA correction requests to OMB, with 26 requests resulting in changes. Over half of the substantive IQA correction requests originated from businesses, trade groups, or other profit-oriented organizations, and over one-quarter were generated by nonprofit or other advocacy organizations.
4. Agencies are required to address all IQA requests and provide an appeals process for petitioners to request reconsideration of an agency’s initial decision about the correction request. However, the guidelines allow agencies to avoid duplicating the public comment process required by the rulemaking procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. OMB monitors IQA correction requests received by agencies and assists them in developing responses, but there is no indication that OMB’s involvement substantially changed agencies’ responses.",1
464,"1. Both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and channel them back to the economy by investing.
2. Banks use deposits to make loans or invest in debt securities, while mutual funds invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks.
3. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with companies increasingly turning to securities markets for their financial needs.
4. Securitization, where banks and thrifts provide initial financing for mortgage, credit card, and automobile loans and then sell these loans as securities, has further diminished the importance of bank loans.
5. The growth of mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, with sizable amounts of money being attracted away from deposits and into mutual funds.
6. The total net flows into mutual funds from all sources during 1990 through 1994 were $1,067 billion, and the impact on deposits had to be less than this amount.
7. The decline in the deposit-to-GDP ratio and the rise in the mutual funds-to-GDP ratio since the late 1980s suggest a substitution of money into mutual funds rather than bank deposits.
8. The liquidity provided by mutual funds' investments in securities has improved conditions for existing issuers and may have made it easier for a broader range of borrowers to tap the securities-issuance markets.
9. The availability of finance for residential, consumer, and business borrowers could be disproportionally affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds.
10. The channels of financing are varied, and a shift of customers' money from deposits into mutual funds need not reduce credit availability for any group of borrowers. However, some small businesses might face credit availability constraints in certain circumstances.",1

The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 requires specific activities related to bioterrorism preparedness and response, including increasing coordination and planning for such events, developing priority countermeasures, and improving state, local, and hospital preparedness and response. The Act also requires the establishment of an integrated system or systems of public health alert communications and surveillance networks among federal, state, and local public health officials, public and private health-related laboratories, hospitals, and other health care facilities, and any other entities that the Secretary determines are appropriate.
2. Since fiscal year 2002, HHS has funded over $2.7 billion for public health preparedness efforts through grants administered by CDC and just over $1 billion for hospital preparedness grants administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. HHS has also encouraged the integration of health care system response plans with public health department plans by incorporating both public health preparedness and hospital performance goals into the agreements that the department uses to fund state and local public health preparedness improvements.
3. The President established the goal that health records for most Americans should be electronic within 10 years and issued an executive order to provide leadership for the development and nationwide implementation of an interoperable health information technology infrastructure to improve the quality and efficiency of health care. The President also tasked the Secretary of HHS to appoint a National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, who was subsequently appointed 1 week later.
4. Federal actions to encourage the use of IT for health care delivery and public health have been accelerated, including the development of IT to support federal, state, local, and tribal governments in public health preparedness and response. The ability to quickly exchange data between providers and public health agencies is crucial in detecting and responding to naturally occurring or intentional disease outbreaks.
5. State health departments have primary responsibility for disease surveillance in the United States, but total responsibility for surveillance is shared among health care providers, local county, city, and tribal health departments, state and territorial health departments, public and private laboratories, and public health officials from multiple federal agencies. Health care providers are responsible for the medical diagnosis and treatment of their individual patients, but also have a responsibility to protect public health by helping to identify and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.",1
466,"1. A survey of the largest sponsors of DB pension plans reveals that they have made changes to their benefit offerings over the past 10 years, including modifying benefit formulas, converting some plans to hybrid plans, and freezing others.
2. More sponsors have increased the generosity of their DB plan formulas for bargaining unit employees than for nonbargaining employees.
3. The key reasons for changing the benefit formulas of plans covering nonbargaining employees are unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements, while global or domestic competitive pressures are the key reasons for changes to plans covering collectively bargained employees.
4. Sponsors were more likely to convert a DB plan covering nonbargaining unit employees to a hybrid plan design than to convert DB plans covering collectively bargained employees.

467,"1. The Refugee Act of 1980 provides a systematic and permanent procedure for admitting refugees to the United States and resettling them as quickly as possible. The federal government, in coordination with state and local governments and private organizations, determines the maximum number of refugees that can be admitted each year, with the number actually resettled typically below this maximum. Refugees are assigned to live in communities throughout the United States based on an annual evaluation of the communities’ capacity to serve them.
2. In the last 10 years, refugees have come to the United States from an increasing number of countries, and the issues associated with these diverse populations have become more complex. Many refugees today arrive after having lived in refugee camps for years, and may have little formal education or work experience, or untreated medical or mental health conditions. Receiving communities have needed to adjust their language capabilities and services in order to respond to the changing needs of these diverse refugee populations.
3. Three federal agencies are involved in the refugee resettlement process. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) approves refugees for admission to the United States, the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) is responsible for processing refugees overseas and partially funds services to meet their immediate needs upon arrival, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides temporary resettlement assistance to refugees and funds cash and medical assistance as well as social services to help refugees become economically self-sufficient.
4. While refugees can benefit their communities, they can also stretch the resources of local service providers, such as school districts and health care systems. In several communities visited, school district officials said that it takes more resources to serve refugee students than nonrefugee students, and health care providers expressed concerns about serving refugees due to the requirement to provide interpreter services. Refugees who exhaust federal refugee assistance benefits and are not self-sufficient can also strain local safety nets.
5. Communities can benefit socially and economically from refugee resettlement, as refugees can enrich cultural diversity and stimulate economic development by filling critical labor shortages and starting small businesses. However, refugees can also stretch the resources of local service providers, such as school districts and health care systems, and can negatively affect district performance outcomes. ORR offers discretionary grants to assist school districts that serve a large number of refugees,",1
468,"1. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to provide government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses, reducing the federal government's costs for repairing flood damage after disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for the oversight and management of NFIP.
2. NFIP has mapped flood risks across the country, assigning flood zone designations based on risk levels, and offers two types of flood insurance premiums: subsidized and full risk. However, the inventories of repetitive loss properties and policies with subsidized premium rates have continued to grow.
3. To participate in NFIP, communities agree to enforce regulations for land use and new construction in high-risk flood zones and to adopt and enforce state and community floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood damage. Currently, more than 20,000 communities participate in NFIP.
4. NFIP's full-risk rates may not reflect actual flood risks, and increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss would generally require reducing or eliminating subsidized and grandfathered rates, which could increase costs to some homeowners.
5. Expanding participation in NFIP and increasing mitigation efforts could help ensure that losses from flood damage did not become the responsibility of the taxpayer and reduce taxpayers' exposure. However, these efforts would have to be carefully implemented to avoid increasing challenges associated with expanding participation.
6. The private market provides only a limited amount of flood insurance coverage, and encouraging private market participation could transfer some or all of the federal government's risk exposure to the private markets and away from taxpayers. However, identifying ways to achieve that end has generally been elusive.",1
469,"1. Section 287(g) of the INA allows ICE to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to perform certain immigration officer functions, including investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States.
2. The 287(g) program has grown rapidly in recent years, with more state and local communities seeking to address criminal activity by those in the country illegally with specialized training and tools provided by ICE.
3. ICE has developed three models for state and local law enforcement participation in the 287(g) program: the ""jail model,"" the ""task force model,"" and the ""joint model.""
4. Participating agencies have used 287(g) authority to process for removal aliens arrested for minor offenses, which could lead to an unmanageable number of aliens being referred to ICE and detention space being used ineffectively.
5. ICE has not consistently articulated how participating agencies are to use their 287(g) authority, nor has it defined what program information should be tracked or developed performance measures to assess the effectiveness of the program.
6. ICE has not consistently communicated to participating agencies how this authority is to be used, which has led to confusion and potential misuse of authority.
7. ICE has not defined in its program-related documents the responsibilities required of ICE agents directing and supervising local officers under the 287(g) program, leaving it to ICE to define the terms of direction and supervision.
8. ICE has not consistently provided clear guidance to participating agencies on what data is to be collected and how it should be gathered and reported, making it difficult for ICE to ensure the program is achieving its objective.",1

OCIE examines mutual funds to ensure compliance with federal securities laws, determine if they are operating according to disclosures made to investors, and assess the effectiveness of their compliance control systems.
2. The Division of Investment Management administers securities laws affecting funds and advisers, reviews disclosure documents, engages in rulemaking, responds to requests for exemptions from federal securities laws, and provides interpretation of those laws.
3. The Division of Enforcement investigates and prosecutes violations of securities laws related to mutual funds.
4. The SEC regulates mutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
5. The Investment Company Act imposes requirements on the operation and structure of mutual funds, and its core objectives include ensuring adequate and accurate information about mutual funds, protecting the integrity of fund assets, prohibiting abusive forms of self-dealing, preventing the issuance of securities that have inequitable or unfair valuation, and ensuring the fair valuation of investor purchases and redemptions.
6. The Investment Advisers Act requires mutual fund advisers to register with the SEC, imposes reporting requirements on them, and prohibits them from engaging in fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative practices.
7. The Securities Act requires fund shares offered to the public to be registered with the SEC and regulates mutual fund advertising. The Securities Act and Investment Company Act require mutual funds to make extensive disclosures in their prospectuses.
8. The Securities Exchange Act regulates how funds are sold and requires persons distributing funds or executing fund transactions to be registered with the SEC as broker-dealers. The SEC, NASD, and NYSE regulate broker-dealers, including their mutual fund sales practices, by examining their operations and reviewing customer complaints.

471,"1. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is an independent federal corporation established by the TVA Act in 1933 to improve the quality of life in the Tennessee River Valley by improving navigation, promoting regional agricultural and economic development, and controlling floodwaters.
2. TVA's operations and planning include building dams and hydropower facilities on the Tennessee River and its tributaries, and selling power to customers. TVA's power program is financed through revenue from electricity sales and borrowing, and it must repay a substantial portion of the annual appropriations it received for its power facilities.
3. TVA's board of directors is appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The board sets TVA's goals and policies, appoints the CEO, develops long-range plans, and approves TVA's budget and rate changes.
4. TVA's strategic plan covers fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and outlines its strategic imperatives, including maintaining low rates, living within its means, managing assets to meet reliability expectations and provide a balanced portfolio, and being responsible stewards of the region's natural resources.
5. TVA's board approved a goal in August 2013 to reduce TVA's debt to about $22 billion by fiscal year 2023. TVA uses a 10-year long-range financial plan to determine the amount of funds available for capital investment.
6. TVA's debt reduction plans and performance information are not reported in a manner consistent with GPRAMA requirements. TVA has not reported required performance information in its annual performance plan or report for managing debt and its unfunded pension liabilities.
7. TVA's unfunded pension liabilities have steadily increased over the past 10 years and constitute a promise to make a future payment or provide a benefit. TVA defers pension costs as regulatory assets for recovery through rates in the future.
8. Several factors could affect TVA's ability to meet its debt reduction goal, including regulatory pressures, changes in demand for electricity, technological innovations, or unforeseen events. TVA aims to eliminate its $6 billion in unfunded pension liabilities within 20 years, but no mechanism is in place to ensure TVA fully funds the liabilities if plan assets do",1
472,"1. First City Bancorporation of Texas, a bank holding company with a high concentration of loans to the energy industry in the Southwest United States, experienced financial difficulties in the 1980s due to the struggling energy industry. By 1986, the company was reporting operating losses.
2. In 1988, First City entered into a recapitalization agreement, also known as open bank assistance, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to restore its financial health. The agreement included a $970 million capital infusion from the FDIC and $500 million of private capital raised by the new bank management.
3. The recapitalized First City banks pursued an aggressive growth policy, resulting in an increase in assets from about $10.9 billion to about $13.9 billion between April 1988 and September 1990. However, the bank's loan portfolios included high-risk loans, and by September 1990, problems with the quality of its loan portfolios caused operating losses and eroded the bank's capital.
4. In 1990, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) criticized the lending practices of First City's lead bank, First City-Houston, and entered into formal supervisory agreements with several of the bank's subsidiaries. Despite these efforts, the bank's financial difficulties continued, and by October 1992, the bank's assets had decreased to about $8 billion and it had incurred total losses of about $625 million.
5. In October 1992, the OCC declared First City-Houston insolvent and appointed the FDIC as receiver. On the same day, the Texas Banking Commissioner closed First City-Dallas, and the FDIC exercised its statutory authority to issue immediately payable cross-guarantee demands on the remaining 18 First City banks. This resulted in the closure of the entire First City banking organization.
6. After the banks were closed, the holding company filed lawsuits on behalf of the shareholders, alleging that the regulators had acted without due process and illegally closed a solvent banking organization. The lawsuits also claimed that the",1
473,"1. In the early 1980s, Congress passed the Single Audit Act of 1984 to address concerns about the lack of adequate oversight and accountability for federal assistance provided to state and local governments.
2. The Single Audit Act requires state and local governments that receive at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance in a fiscal year to have a single audit conducted for that year.
3. The objectives of the Single Audit Act are to promote sound financial management, including effective internal control, with respect to federal awards administered by nonfederal entities; establish uniform requirements for audits of federal awards administered promote the efficient and effective use of audit resources; reduce burdens on state and local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations; and ensure that federal departments and agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, rely upon and use audit work done pursuant to the act.
4. The Single Audit Act established the single audit concept to replace multiple grant audits with one audit of an entity as a whole, and requires that grantees address material noncompliance and internal control weaknesses in a corrective action plan.
5. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the Single Audit Act of 1984 and established uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients, including nonprofit organizations, hospitals, and universities.
6. The Single Audit Act assigned OMB the responsibility of prescribing policies, procedures, and guidelines to implement the uniform audit requirements and required each federal agency to amend its regulations to conform to the requirements of the act and OMB’s policies, procedures, and guidelines.
7. OMB Circular No. A-133 sets implementing guidelines for the audit requirements and defines roles and responsibilities related to the implementation of the Single Audit Act.
8. Federal oversight responsibility for implementation of the Single Audit Act is currently shared among various entities—OMB, federal agencies, and their respective Offices of Inspector General (OIG).",1
474,"1. Medicare, a federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, currently contracts with health insurers to process and pay claims, but the number of such companies willing to serve as Medicare contractors has declined.
2. The program could benefit from contracting reforms, such as directly choosing contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities, allowing contractors to specialize in specific functions, paying contractors based on performance, and terminating contracts more efficiently.
3. The use of health insurers for claims administration may have made sense when Medicare was created, but the explosion in information technology and the need to broaden the pool of contractors has increased the potential for using new types of business entities.
4. Since 1993, the agency has repeatedly proposed legislative changes to repeal the provider nomination authority and allow contracting with entities other than health insurers, but these changes have not been enacted.
5. Allowing Medicare to offer financial incentives to contractors for high-quality performance and terminate contracts more efficiently may promote better program management.
6. Implementing these changes would not be without challenges, and CMS would need to adopt an experimental, incremental approach, including developing clear statements of work, efficiently integrating new contractors, and developing sound evaluation criteria for assessing performance.",1
475,"1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has been looking for ways to reduce support costs in order to free up funds for modernization and other defense priorities. A Defense Science Board (DSB) report from 1996 identified opportunities for DOD to save money by outsourcing support services, estimating that DOD could save 30-40% of logistics costs through outsourcing. The DSB's report also estimated that an aggressive DOD outsourcing initiative could generate savings of $7-12 billion annually by fiscal year 2002.
2. A second DSB report from 1996 built on the first, proposing that DOD should only provide warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy- and decision-making, and oversight activities, with all other activities being done by the private sector. This report estimated that DOD would need to make an initial investment of $6 billion, but would ultimately save about $30 billion annually by the year 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions. Of these $30 billion in annual savings, $6 billion was to come from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities.
3. The DSB's estimate of $14 billion for CONUS logistics costs is conservative, as the Navy has reported that more than $8.5 billion of Navy resources was applied in fiscal year 1996 to maintenance programs in support of fleet ships and aircraft. However, the DSB's savings estimates have been criticized for being overstated. The Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) directorate at DOD assessed the DSB's savings estimates and found that the estimate was overstated by about $1 billion and that another $3 billion in projected savings would be difficult to achieve or unlikely to be achieved.
4. Despite the potential for savings through outsourcing, DOD has found that infrastructure reductions are difficult and painful due to the need for up-front investments, the closure of installations, and the elimination of military and civilian jobs. DOD officials have also expressed concerns that savings achieved from outsourcing may not be available to the outsourcing organization to fund service needs. The DSB recognized DOD's cultural resistance to outsourcing logistics activities and said that overcoming resistance may take some time.",1
476,"1. In 1993, both Congress and the administration agreed to reduce federal employment levels to control deficits. This was achieved through a series of executive orders and legislation, with the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 and the National Performance Review being the driving forces.
2. The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 mandated government-wide reductions of 272,900 FTE positions through fiscal year 1999. The National Performance Review recommended that any reductions be accomplished through agency efforts to streamline operations, reduce management control and headquarters positions, and improve government operations through reinvention and quality management techniques.
3. Agencies were required to measure their performance through the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, which established requirements for pilot projects, strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual reports on program performance. Over 70 federal organizations participated in the pilot projects for performance planning and reporting.
4. The downsizing of components at five parent agencies, including HUD, DOI, GSA, NASA, and OPM, ranged from around 2% to 100%. The effect of each component's downsizing on the parent agency's total reductions varied.
5. Actions taken to maintain performance amid downsizing generally fell into three categories: refocusing missions, reengineering work processes, and building and maintaining employee skills.
6. Components reengineered their work processes to improve effectiveness and/or efficiency, such as consolidating functions into fewer locations, aligning operations with private sector business practices, modernizing data processing systems, placing increased decision-making authority in field offices, and increasing reliance on contractors.
7. Components generally took steps to help ensure that they had the skilled workforces needed to maintain their performance in a downsized environment, such as retraining employees for additional responsibilities and consolidating expertise in fewer locations.
8. Officials, employee representatives, and employees believed that efforts to maintain performance had generally been successful; however, some expressed concern about whether performance could be maintained with additional downsizing. Customers we spoke with did not always agree with the assessment of satisfaction with performance during downsizing.",1
477,"1. The National Research Program (NRP) is a study conducted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to obtain new information about taxpayers' compliance with tax laws. The NRP's main elements include casebuilding, classification, and audits. The casebuilding process compiles available data to establish the accuracy of information reported by taxpayers on their returns. Classification is used to determine whether an NRP audit is necessary and which items need to be verified through an audit. NRP audits will take place either through correspondence with the taxpayers or through face-to-face audits.
2. IRS designed the NRP to measure voluntary reporting compliance and to minimize the burden on taxpayers. The NRP's reporting compliance study consists of three major processes: casebuilding, classification, and taxpayer audits. The NRP's primary goals are to obtain accurate voluntary reporting compliance data and to minimize the burden on the approximately 47,000 taxpayers with returns in the NRP sample. IRS plans to use NRP data to update return selection formulas, allow IRS to design prefiling programs that will help taxpayers comply with the tax law, and permit IRS to focus its limited resources on the most significant areas of noncompliance.
3. IRS conducted two tests of NRP processes prior to implementing the program. IRS tested the casebuilding and classification processes in an NRP simulation in July 2002, and conducted another classification process test during the initial classification training session in September 2002. IRS used the preliminary results of both of these tests to estimate NRP classification outcomes and to evaluate the effectiveness of NRP training. IRS also identified and trained staff to complete NRP classification and audits, and delayed the delivery of computer software training to managers and clerks involved in NRP audits due to technical problems. IRS selected over 3,000 auditors to handle NRP cases, most of whom are assigned to the Small Business/Self Employed operating division. IRS selected 138 Small Business/Self Employed auditors to be NRP classifiers and about 3,500 to handle NRP face-to-face audits. IRS also selected two groups of correspondence auditors from the Wage and Investment operating division’s Kansas City office to handle NRP correspondence audits. I",1

2. Poor planning for the 2000 Census resulted in increased costs, risks, and controversy, and similar mistakes were made in planning the 1990 Census.
3. To prevent repeating past mistakes, the Secretary of Commerce was recommended to provide comprehensive information backed by supporting documentation in future funding requests for planning and development activities.
4. The Bureau's goals for the 2010 Census include increasing the relevance and timeliness of census long-form data, reducing operational risk, increasing coverage and accuracy, and containing costs.
5. The Bureau developed a ""three-legged stool"" approach to taking the census, focusing on an accurate address list and maps, the American Community Survey (ACS), and the Modernization of the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) system.
6. The Bureau launched the MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program (MTEP) to update and modernize MAF/TIGER, with an estimated total cost of $536 million.
7. The ACS is intended to replace the long form used in past decennial censuses, providing more timely long-form data and improving the accuracy of decennial census population counts.
8. The Bureau's three-legged stool strategy generally aligns with three of its four key goals for the 2010 Census, but it is unclear how the Bureau will achieve its goal of reducing operational risk.
9. The Bureau faces challenges in securing congressional approval for its proposed approach, maintaining the stability of the basic design, and addressing methodological questions related to the ACS.
10. The Bureau is not currently planning to develop a procedure to adjust census numbers for purposes of redistricting, but it is essential to ensure the best available census data for all purposes.",1

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act establish a framework for protecting the privacy and security of Medicare beneficiaries' protected health information (PHI) when used for purposes other than directly providing clinical care. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for implementing and enforcing these rules. OCR has established and implemented a process to enforce provisions of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules through investigations, but it has not issued required implementation guidance to assist entities in de-identifying PHI and has not fully established a capability to proactively monitor covered entities' compliance through the use of periodic audits as required by the HITECH Act.
2. The use of health information technology, such as electronic prescribing, can improve the quality of care received by patients and reduce health care costs. However, the use of electronic health information requires multiple entities to have access to an individual's identifiable health information in an electronic format, which is subject to federal laws and regulations regarding the acceptable use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). The HITECH Act strengthened the privacy and security protections of health information established by HIPAA and also adopted provisions to strengthen and expand HIPAA's enforcement provisions. OCR is responsible for implementing the HITECH Act's requirements, including conducting periodic audits to ensure HIPAA compliance, providing public education related to HIPAA protections, and enforcing HIPAA regulations. However, OCR has not issued required guidance to assist entities in de-identifying PHI due to competing priorities for resources and internal and external reviews, and it has not implemented periodic compliance audits as required by the HITECH Act.",1

2. The MHSS may also support nonactive-duty beneficiaries with its resources, but when those needs exceed the MHSS's resources, DOD purchases services from the civilian health care sector.
3. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, whether in the military or civilian sector, provide mental health services, but only psychiatrists can prescribe medication due to their medical training.
4. The MHSS created the PDP to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists in the military so they could treat their patients with psychotropic medication when needed.
5. The PDP was established in response to a conference report dated September 28, 1988, and the Army's Office of the Surgeon General was tasked with designing and implementing the PDP.
6. The MHSS currently has enough uniformed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists to meet its current and upcoming readiness requirements, and no additional mental health providers are needed to meet medical readiness requirements.

It is being designed to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope and will be located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.
2. JWST is a complex project that is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. The observatory segment includes several elements and major subsystems, such as the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), sunshield, and cryocooler.
3. JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope, as well as to collect and transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts.
4. JWST's development has faced numerous challenges, including technical issues, management problems, and funding delays. In 2010, an independent review of the project found that it was executing well from a technical standpoint, but that the baseline funding did not reflect the most probable cost with adequate reserves. As a result, the project underwent a replan and Congress placed an $8 billion cap on the formulation and development costs.
5. JWST is currently on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining, but all of its elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the project's critical path. This means that any delays to these elements or subsystems could impact the overall project schedule.
6. JWST has experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays, with early cost estimates ranging from $1 billion to $3.5 billion and expected launch dates ranging from 2007 to 2011. However, the project is currently on track to meet its cost commitments and has a planned launch date of October 2018.
7. Independent oversight has played an important role in the JWST project, with various groups providing insights, recommendations, and assistance in managing the development of the telescope. These groups include the Test Assessment Team, the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel",0

2. The EPA regulates about 15,000 facilities under the Clean Air Act to prevent and prepare for accidental releases, and these facilities have gained extensive expertise that could be useful in assessing security issues.
3. Federal requirements address security at some U.S. chemical facilities, but there is no comprehensive assessment of security at the nation's chemical facilities.
4. DHS is developing a plan for protecting the chemical sector, which will establish a framework for reducing the overall vulnerability of the sector in partnership with the industry and state and local authorities.
5. DHS has identified an interim inventory of 3,400 chemical facilities that pose the greatest hazard to human life and health in the event of a terrorist attack and is developing a new risk assessment methodology to compare and prioritize all critical infrastructure assets.
6. Industry associations have been active in promoting security among member companies, but the extent of participation in the industry's voluntary initiatives is unclear.
7. Chemical industry officials face challenges in preparing facilities against a terrorist attack, including the cost of security improvements, the need for guidance on what level of security is adequate, the lack of threat information, and limited guidance on conducting vulnerability assessments.
8. Existing laws give DHS limited authority to address chemical sector security, but DHS currently lacks specific authority to require all high-risk facilities to assess their vulnerabilities and take corrective actions.
9. DHS and EPA have called for legislation to give the federal government greater authority over chemical facility security, and additional federal legislation is needed to address the significant risks posed by thousands of chemical facilities across the country.",1

The program has grown and expanded since its creation in 1935 to include dependents and disabled workers. Benefits are calculated using a common formula and are paid from trust funds financed through payroll taxes.
2. Disabled workers and dependents receive lower average monthly benefits than retired workers, but these benefits can be particularly important for them due to their potentially limited ability to work and earn income. Social Security was not intended to provide adequate income by itself, but rather to serve as a base on which to build.
3. Recent reform proposals have focused on elements intended to improve solvency, but there has also been interest in protecting some or all DI and dependents' benefits from potential benefit reductions. Despite ongoing fiscal concerns, eligibility for certain dependents' and disability benefits has been expanded since 1975, and there continues to be interest in protecting vulnerable populations who rely on Social Security for a significant portion of their monthly income.",1
485,"1. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) was enacted in October 2008 to address the financial crisis and provide support to financial institutions and the automotive industry. Under EESA, the Treasury established a variety of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) programs, including the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP), and the Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP).
2. Many of these programs have been winding down or have ended, with Treasury recovering all debt and equity investments made in PPIP as of September 30, 2014. The AIG Assistance Program, the Asset Guarantee Program, the Capital Assessment Program, the SBA 7(a) Securities Purchase Program, and TIP are no longer active. Treasury still holds investments in CPP, CDCI, and AIFP, and the housing assistance programs remain active.
3. The housing assistance programs include Making Home Affordable (MHA), which includes the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) Program, the Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA), the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP), and government-insured or guaranteed loans (FHA-HAMP and RD-HAMP). These programs offer assistance to homeowners facing financial distress and aim to prevent foreclosures.",1
486,"1. Coal-fueled electricity generating units provide a large share of the electricity produced in the United States, but their contribution has declined in recent years due to concerns over air pollution, water resources, and solid waste.
2. Several environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, have led to the proposal or finalization of four key regulations affecting coal-fueled units, with potentially significant implications for public health and the environment.
3. EPA has proposed new regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating units, which may impact the electricity industry, including coal-fueled generating units, aiming for overall reductions equivalent to 30 percent from 2005 emissions levels by 2",0
487,"1. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) does not consistently determine the eligibility of estates kept open for more than 2 years to receive farm program payments, as required by regulations. The quality of the determinations also varies.
2. FSA did not conduct annual eligibility determinations for 40 percent of the 181 estates that required a determination from 1999 through 2005. Sixteen of these 73 estates received more than $200,000 in farm program payments and 4 received more than $500,000 during this period.
3. FSA sometimes approved eligibility for payments when the estate had provided insufficient information or vague explanations for keeping the estate open. Some FSA field offices approved program payments to groups of estates kept open after 2 years without any apparent determination.
4. The extent to which FSA field offices make eligibility determinations varies from state to state, suggesting that FSA is not consistently implementing its eligibility rules.
5. FSA cannot be assured that millions of dollars in farm program payments it made to thousands of deceased individuals from fiscal years 1999 through 2005 were proper because it does not have appropriate management controls to verify that it is not making payments to deceased individuals.
6. FSA paid $1.1 billion in farm program payments in the names of 172,801 deceased individuals from fiscal years 1999 through 2005. Of the $1.1 billion in farm payments, 40 percent went to individuals who had been dead for 3 or more years, and 19 percent went to individuals who had been dead for 7 or more years.",1
488,"1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for operating a common air traffic control (ATC) system in the National Airspace System (NAS) and has experienced substantial cost overruns, lengthy schedule delays, and significant performance shortfalls in its modernization projects over the past 16 years.
2. The Advanced Automation System (AAS), the centerpiece of FAA's modernization program, was restructured in 1994 after estimated costs tripled and delays in putting significantly less-than-promised system capabilities into operation were expected to run 8 years or more over original estimates.
3. FAA has reported spending about $5.3 billion on 81 completed projects and $15.7 billion on about 130 ongoing projects, with an estimated additional $11 billion planned through fiscal year 2003. However, problems with modernization projects have caused delays in replacing FAA's aging equipment, especially the automation equipment in the en route and terminal facilities.
4. FAA has added four interim projects, costing about $655 million, to sustain and enhance current automated air traffic control equipment, and is assessing the Host computer's microcode with a plan to resolve any identified year 2000 date issues while preparing to purchase and implement new hardware for each of its 20 en route centers before January 1, 2000.
5. Two key components of the modernization effort, the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), have encountered delays and cost increases, with the latter experiencing more delays due to software requirements to resolve air traffic controllers' dissatisfaction with the system's computer-human interface.
6. FAA's lack of a complete and enforced systems architecture, unreliable cost information, lack of mature software acquisition processes, and an organizational culture that does not always act in the agency's long-term best interest have contributed to long-standing problems with FAA's modernization.
7. FAA has recognized the need for a comprehensive strategy for cultural change and has proposed restructuring its personnel system to tie pay to performance based on measurable goals, but has not yet implemented a management structure similar to the provisions of the Clinger-Cohen Act of ",1
489,"1. From fiscal years 1993-98, the United States provided at least $970 million in rule of law assistance to countries worldwide.
2. Total annual rule of law funding increased from $128 million in 1993 to $218 million in 1998, with a slight dip in 1996 potentially due to issues with USAID's automated information system.
3. The Latin America and the Caribbean region received the largest share of funding, approximately 36%, while Africa, Central Europe, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union each received around 15%.
4. Over the period, rule of law funding shifted from the Latin America and the Caribbean region to other regions, primarily Central Europe. Funding for Central Europe grew from $9 million in 1993 to over $67 million in 1998, while assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean declined from $57 million in 1993 to $42 million in 1998, and assistance to Africa also decreased from $38 million in 1993 to $29 million in 1998.",1
490,"1. Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting businesslike enterprises that provide common administrative services, such as payroll processing, information technology support, and contracting.
2. DOD primarily uses two franchise funds for contracting services: GovWorks, operated by the Department of the Interior, and FedSource, operated by the Department of the Treasury.
3. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to regulatory requirements, and three main parties share responsibilities for ensuring proper procedures are followed.
4. GovWorks and FedSource can either make use of their own or other agencies’ contracts, or they can develop new, customized contracts to satisfy a DOD customer’s needs.
5. The fee-for-service arrangement of franchise funds creates an incentive to increase sales volume, potentially leading to an inordinate focus on meeting customer demands at the expense of complying with contracting policy and required procedures.
6. GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain the full benefits of competitive procedures, did not ensure fair and reasonable prices, and may have missed opportunities to achieve savings on behalf of DOD customers for millions of dollars worth of goods and services.
7. DOD customers told us they were under the impression that franchise funds ensure competition and analyze prices, but we found numerous cases in which these practices did not occur.
8. The FAR states that contracting officers must purchase goods and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices, and price competition is the preferred method to ensure that prices are fair and reasonable.
9. We reviewed 10 orders in which GovWorks provided contracting services to DOD’s customers and found that GovWorks did not always seek competing proposals as required, did not always conduct price analysis, and added substantial work beyond what was originally planned without determining that prices were fair and reasonable.",1
491,"1. Wildland fires play an important ecological role in the United States, but various land use and management practices have reduced the normal frequency of fires and the resiliency of ecosystems to fire. Changing climate conditions have also increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons. Collaboration across federal-nonfederal boundaries to address the wildland fire issue can involve any mix of the nation's 2.3 billion acres of federal, state, local, private, or tribal lands. Federal agencies and nonfederal entities collaborate in a variety of ways to reduce the risk of wildland fire before a potential wildland fire incident occurs, through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities.
2. Federal officials and stakeholders identified federal authorities, agency initiatives, joint community-level planning, leadership, community engagement, and agency resources for collaboration as directly affecting federal-nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities. Certain federal legal authorities that allow federal agencies to work across jurisdictions with nonfederal entities facilitate collaboration, such as the Good Neighbor Authority and the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004. However, some federal and nonfederal entities are reluctant to use these authorities due to unclear guidance or lack of awareness. Federal and nonfederal entities also collaborate through initiatives such as the Wildland Fire Leadership Council, the Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership, and BIA’s Reserved Treaty Rights Lands Program.",1
492,"1. The Battle of Normandy Foundation is a private nonprofit organization that aims to honor America's World War II veterans and teach future generations about the causes and consequences of World War II. The Foundation's activities include building and promoting the Memorial Garden in Normandy, supporting a French-owned World War II memorial museum, circulating newsletters, sponsoring a Normandy scholar program, and planning a Wall of Liberty in Normandy.
2. In 1992, the World War II 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coins Act was passed, directing the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue commemorative World War II coins. The Act specified that the first $3 million in surcharges received by the Treasury from the sale of coins be transferred to the Battle of Normandy Foundation to create a United States D-Day and Battle of Normandy Memorial in Normandy.
3. The Foundation obtained land adjacent to the World War II memorial museum in Caen in 1993 and constructed the Memorial Garden on this land. The Foundation is responsible for funding the costs of operating and maintaining the Memorial Garden and land for the entire lease term.
4. In 1993, allegations of financial impropriety were made against the Foundation and its then president, Anthony C. Stout. The Foundation's Board of Directors appointed a special committee to investigate certain allegations and the committee employed another public accounting firm to assist it.
5. In January 1994, the special committee concluded its investigation and reported that the Foundation had met its stated corporate goals and that accusations against Mr. Stout were unsupported. However, the committee identified internal control weaknesses and recommended improving the Foundation’s internal controls governing financial management.
6. The Foundation has experienced significant managerial, financial, and internal control problems, and its liabilities substantially exceed its assets. The Foundation's precarious financial condition casts doubt on whether it can continue its operations.
7. The Foundation has received $3 million in surcharge coin proceeds from the Treasury for the Memorial Garden and has used these funds toward funding the costs of the Memorial Garden. However, the costs of the Memorial Garden have exceeded the amounts provided by the Coins Act, and additional Memorial Garden funding came, or needs to come, from other sources.",1
493,"1. Pension plans, both public and private, invest in defined benefit (DB) plans which promise to pay retirement benefits based on an employee's salary and years of service. The financial health of these plans depends on adequate contributions and prudent investments.
2. DB plan managers invest in various asset classes, traditionally consisting of stocks and bonds, to maintain and increase plan assets. They consider the plan's benefit payment requirements and balance the desire to maximize returns with the desire to limit overall risk.
3. Private sector pension plan investment decisions must comply with ERISA, which sets fiduciary standards based on the principle of a prudent man standard. ERISA requires plan sponsors and other fiduciaries to act solely in the interest of plan participants, invest with care, skill, and diligence, and diversify plan investments to minimize risk.
4. Hedge funds and private equity funds are alternative investment options for pension plans. Hedge funds are privately organized investment vehicles that invest in various types of securities and often engage in active trading. Private equity funds invest in companies, often not listed on a stock exchange, and seek long-term financial returns through corporate stewardship, improved operating processes, and financial restructuring.
5. Public sector pension plans are not subject to ERISA funding, vesting, and most other requirements, but must follow state law requirements. While states have adopted standards essentially identical to the ERISA prudent man standard, specific provisions of law and regulation vary from state to state. Public plans are not insured by the PBGC, but could call upon state or local taxpayers in the event of a funding shortfall.",1
494,"1. The United States territories of American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have some discretion in setting Medicaid and CHIP eligibility standards and provider payment rates, and determining covered benefits within broad federal guidelines. However, there are significant differences in how these programs are funded in the territories compared to the states, including lower federal matching rates and statutory caps on federal funding. These differences, along with higher health care costs in the territories, have resulted in lower federal and territory Medicaid program expenditures in the territories.
2. The territories have flexibility in administering their Medicaid and CHIP programs, leading to differences in program eligibility and benefits among the territories and compared to the states. For example, Puerto Rico uses its CHIP funds to cover additional children in its Medicaid programs, while the other four territories use their CHIP funds to pay for services provided to children in their Medicaid programs. Additionally, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands base program eligibility on local poverty levels that are more restrictive than federal standards, resulting in lower program enrollment. The different methods territories use to determine eligibility affect Medicaid enrollment, with the estimated percentage of territories’ populations enrolled in Medicaid in fiscal year 2015 ranging from about 17 percent in the U.S. Virgin Islands to 88 percent in American Samoa.",1
495,"1. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) established the Superfund program in 1980 to clean up highly contaminated hazardous waste sites. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the program and oversees cleanups performed by the parties responsible for contaminating the sites. State governments also have a role in the Superfund process.
2. EPA maintains a list of hazardous sites, known as the National Priorities List (NPL), that the agency considers to present the most serious threats to human health and the environment. Sites on the NPL are eligible for long-term cleanup financed by the agency under the trust fund established by CERCLA.
3. As of October 1997, there were 3,036 sites awaiting a NPL decision, representing only a portion of the sites that EPA has evaluated and classified over the history of the Superfund program. EPA has reported that it has removed waste or taken other interim cleanup actions at over 5,500 sites, most of which are not on the NPL.
4. EPA's surveys of officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states indicate that 1,789 of the 3,036 sites classified by EPA’s database as awaiting a NPL decision are potentially eligible for the list. Another 1,234 sites are unlikely to become eligible for the Superfund program for various reasons.
5. Of the 1,789 potentially eligible sites, 1,739 are nonfederal sites and 50 are federal facilities. Many of these sites pose risks to human health or the environment and are contaminated with various pollutants, including metals, volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and other unspecified contaminants.
6. EPA, other federal agencies, and the states reported conducting some cleanup actions at 38 percent of the potentially eligible sites. However, 45 percent of the sites reported to have high current risks and 47 percent of the sites with high potential risks have not had any cleanup activities.
7. Responding officials did not indicate the final outcome for 53 percent of the",0

Foreign nationals seeking temporary admission to the United States must obtain a nonimmigrant visa (NIV) and go through a visa process managed by the State Department, which includes documentation reviews, in-person interviews, biometrics collection, and name-checks against the Consular Lookout and Support System.
2. The visa process has become more complex and time-consuming due to new security measures implemented after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, such as the removal of visa adjudication functions from consular associates, the requirement of personal interviews for most foreign nationals, and the collection of 10-fingerprints.
3. The number of visa applications has increased since 2003, with 8.6 million expected in 2008, and several countries, such as India and China, have seen large growth in visa demand. However, the visa workload increased by almost 16 percent between 2004 and 2006, and there have been delays in visa interview appointments at consular posts due to increased consular officer workload, staffing gaps, and facilities limitations.
4. State has taken measures to improve visa wait times, such as providing temporary duty staff to assist in adjudicating visas at several locations, upgrading embassies and consulates, and implementing procedures to maximize efficiency and better manage visa workload.
5. However, State's current efforts are generally temporary, nonsustainable, and insufficient to meet the expected increases in demand at some posts, and there are still challenges in reporting wait times of less than 30 days during peak processing periods.
6. State has set a global standard that all visa applicants should receive an appointment for a visa interview within 30 days, but there are inconsistencies among posts in the reporting of visa waits data, which impacts the reliability of State's visa waits figures.
7. State is in the process of developing a measure of applicant backlog to better understand and manage post workload, and reported wait times for visa appointments have generally improved in recent months.
8. However, there are still long waits at times during the past year, and some posts have reported maximum monthly wait times in excess of 90 days at least once over the past year.

497,"1. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for managing the federal government's retirement program for employees. The program includes two defined benefit retirement plans, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), which provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to federal employees.
2. OPM has identified several factors that limit its ability to process retirement benefits in an efficient and timely manner, including paper-based and manually intensive processes, outdated information systems, limited customer service capabilities, lack of retiree access to retirement records, and difficulty attracting qualified personnel to operate and maintain the antiquated retirement systems.
3. OPM has recognized the need to automate and modernize its retirement processing since the late 1980s and has initiated several modernization initiatives, including the FERS Automated Processing System (FAPS) and the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program. However, these initiatives have faced significant challenges, including lack of strategic planning, improperly managed requirements, and high costs.
4. In 2006, OPM awarded contracts to Hewitt Associates, Accenture Ltd., and Northrop Grumman Corporation to modernize the retirement process, including a commercially available, defined benefits technology solution (DBTS) to automate retirement processing, services to convert paper records to electronic files, and consulting services to support the redesign of its retirement operations.
5. However, the DBTS contract was terminated in October 2008 due to system quality issues, and OPM has since restructured the program. The restructured program, called RetireEZ, is expected to provide prompt and complete benefit payments, a standardized retirement benefit calculation system, and a consolidated system to support all aspects of retirement processing. The program is currently in transition, and OPM is facing challenges in defining and transitioning to the restructured program, as well as addressing managerial weaknesses in key areas of program management.",1
498,"1. The number of school-aged children with limited English proficiency in the US has grown significantly in the last two decades, with the largest populations in California, Florida, New York, and Texas. However, other states such as Alabama, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee have also experienced large increases.
2. The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) was passed in 1968 to educate students with limited English proficiency and reach academic standards. The BEA created four bilingual education grant programs, which are the only federal programs that specifically target instructional services to children with limited English proficiency.
3. In fiscal year 2000, Education funded approximately 28 percent of the 665 applications it received, with 18 Systemwide grants averaging $551,000 each, 75 Comprehensive grants averaging $245,300 each, and 92 PDI grants averaging $156,200 each. No Enhancement grants were awarded in fiscal year 2000.
4. The 107th Congress is considering several bills as it deliberates BEA reauthorization in fiscal year 2001, including one bill that recommends the elimination of the four grant programs and another that seeks to significantly increase funding for bilingual education programs and consolidate the four programs into a single grant program.
5. The four federal bilingual education programs share the same performance goals and measures, possess similar eligibility criteria, and allow similar uses of program funds. They target students with limited English proficiency in kindergarten through 12th grade and provide bilingual or special alternative education programs to help such children reach high academic standards.",1
499,"1. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a criminal justice information system maintained by the FBI, which contains data on crimes and criminals of nationwide interest and serves as a locator file for missing and unidentified persons. As of January 1, 2011, NCIC contained 85,820 active records in its missing persons file.
2. The NCIC system is managed cooperatively by the FBI’s CJIS and state and local agencies that access the system. An Advisory Process, consisting of an Advisory Policy Board and working groups, is responsible for establishing policy for NCIC use by federal, state, and local agencies.
3. Local level governance of NCIC use is performed by the CSA, a criminal justice agency that has overall responsibility for the administration and usage of NCIC, including providing quality assurance and training and assuring LEA compliance with operating procedures within its jurisdiction.
4. CJIS shares with the CSAs the responsibility for monitoring compliance with NCIC policy, as shown in figure 2. CJIS policy, as approved by the Board, calls for triennial audits of each CSA to assess the CSA’s compliance with NCIC policies, including the 2-hour entry requirement for reports of missing children.
5. During its audits, CJIS assesses the extent to which the CSAs are fulfilling the requirement to audit all LEAs that enter data into NCIC under their jurisdiction. CJIS and the Board have taken a number of steps to help ensure that LEAs implement the 2-hour entry requirement.
6. However, CJIS officials acknowledged that CSA audits would be more useful if they measured LEAs’ compliance with the 2-hour criterion and reviewed a sample of missing children records to assess compliance with the entry requirement, but CJIS and the Board do not require CSAs to incorporate either of these into their audits.
7. Officials from eight of the nine LEAs we contacted identified custody disputes and coordination with child welfare agencies as potential impediments to reporting missing children to NCIC in a timely manner or investigating these cases. CJIS and OJJDP could take additional steps to better position DOJ to carry out its oversight role over NCIC, with respect to helping ensure compliance with the 2-hour requirement.",1
500,"1. The text discusses the factors affecting the safety of automobile occupants and the dangers automobiles pose to occupants of other vehicles. The safety experiences of model year 1987 and later cars are more relevant to today's new cars. The analysis focuses on the injury experiences of drivers, not passengers or child occupants.
2. The text examines the independent effects of crash type, crash severity, automobile weight and size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender on the risk of injury in an automobile crash. Crashworthiness refers to the extent to which automobiles protect their occupants in a collision, and aggressivity refers to automobile characteristics that affect the safety of the occupants of other vehicles in a collision.
3. The text reports that cars from recent model years are safer than automobiles from past model years, and some of this improvement can be attributed to federal government safety regulations. The report also discusses the safety consequences of crash characteristics, automobile weight and size, and safety belts and air bags.
4. The text states that most traffic crashes do not involve serious injury, but some crashes are much more likely to lead to serious injury than others. Single-car crashes are more likely to seriously injure occupants than are multiple-vehicle collisions. Some points of impact on the automobile are more dangerous than others, and crashes at high speeds are more dangerous than others. The text also reports that injury risk and driver and automobile characteristics vary by crash type, with one-car rollover crashes being the most dangerous.",1

It is organized into two major commands responsible for overall mission execution in the Pacific and Atlantic areas, which are further divided into 9 districts and 35 sectors.
2. The Coast Guard has 11 programs under two broad missions: homeland security and non-homeland security. It uses performance measures to communicate agency performance and provide information for the budgeting process to Congress, other policymakers, and taxpayers.
3. The Coast Guard has acquisition programs such as the $24 billion Deepwater program to upgrade or replace existing vessels and aircraft, and the National Automatic Identification System to identify and track vessels bound for or within U.S. waters.
4. The Coast Guard's fiscal year 2008 budget request is $8.73 billion, approximately $275 million, or 3.3 percent, more than in fiscal year 2007. The request reflects a smaller increase than in previous years and a reorganization of internal operations and support command infrastructure.
5. The Coast Guard's performance on its non-homeland security indicators has not changed substantially over the past 5 years. However, there are challenges associated with using performance measures to link resources to results, such as comprehensiveness and external factors outside agency control.
6. The Coast Guard is implementing a new field command structure, reorganizing deployable specialized forces under a single unified command, and consolidating acquisitions management programs. Each of these efforts faces challenges that merit close attention.
7. The Coast Guard continues to face challenges in managing the Deepwater program, including technology and funding uncertainties, recent changes to Coast Guard plans for procuring Deepwater assets, and performance and design problems for certain Deepwater assets.",1

2. The program involves a complex process of qualifying carriers, soliciting rates, distributing moves, evaluating moving companies' performance, paying invoices, and settling claims.
3. DOD has been facing challenges in ensuring adequate year-round capacity, especially during the summer peak moving season.
4. In an effort to address some of the challenges, DOD previously evaluated three pilot programs and submitted recommendations to Congress in 2002.
5. These recommendations included reengineering the liability and claims process, changing the acquisition process, and implementing information technology improvements.
6. DOD developed a new program called Families First to improve the quality of household goods moves for servicemembers, DOD civilian employees, and their families.
7. However, DOD's legacy data management system, TOPS, is being phased out and a new system, DPS, is being developed.
8. DOD expects that TOPS will need to be functional for a large part of the Families First rollout, but DPS is expected to provide improved reporting and data capabilities.",1
503,"1. Tobacco is a high-value, pesticide-intensive crop that is grown in 16 states in the United States and over 100 countries. It is the nation's ninth highest valued crop and ranks sixth in terms of the amount of pesticide applied per acre. The United States is the third largest exporter of unmanufactured tobacco, behind Brazil and Zimbabwe. The tobacco industry both exports tobacco to Japan and Western Europe and imports tobacco in increasing amounts from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Malawi, and Thailand.
2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for registering and regulating pesticides in the United States. Most of the pesticides used on tobacco during the 1990s were initially approved before 1984 and are subject to reregistration under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). The FQPA amendments to FIFRA passed in 1996 require EPA to reevaluate the amounts of pesticide residues allowed on or in food and to ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from all pesticide exposures from food and nonfood uses for which there is reliable information. EPA uses risk assessment to evaluate the potential health impacts of a pesticide and determine what measures are needed to mitigate identified risks.
3. During the 1990s, tobacco producers in the United States commonly used 37 of the pesticides approved by EPA for such use. Most of the pesticides used on tobacco were insecticides and herbicides, which control insect and plant pests; others were fungicides, which combat fungal diseases, or plant growth regulators. Most of these pesticides were also widely used on food crops. The actual number and amount of pesticides used on tobacco or other crops in any given year vary depending on factors such as the weather and the specific pests that become problematic.
4. EPA has determined that 17 pesticides commonly used on tobacco in the 1990s belong to three chemical classes that, at high doses, are known to cause adverse human health effects up to and including death. These pesticides act on the nervous system to prevent the normal flow",1
504,"1. User fees, charges, or excise taxes on certain products can be used to finance federal programs or activities, assigning costs to identifiable users who receive a benefit beyond what's normally available to the public.
2. User fees should have a tight link between payments and the cost of providing services, with payers expecting high-quality related services.
3. The boundaries between fees and taxes can be unclear, but fees are generally related to voluntary transactions for government goods or services, while taxes are based on the government's sovereign power to raise revenue.
4. Agencies derive authority to charge fees from the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) or specific statutory authority, with fees collected under IOAA deposited in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.
5. Specific user fee statutes should be consistent with IOAA and OMB Circular No. A-25, and the amount of a fee may be set to partially or fully recover costs or based on other factors like market value.
6. The beneficiary-pays principle guides how program costs should be divided between the general public and users, promoting equity by assigning costs to those who benefit from the services.
7. Fee payers and other stakeholders may be concerned about the long-term decline in the portion of program costs covered by general revenues, and agencies must consider the costs and benefits of transitional measures and exemptions.
8. Determining a program's beneficiaries and the extent to which a program benefits users or the general public is not always clear-cut, and sometimes it may be difficult to identify specific users or collect fees from them.",1

The District of Columbia's (D.C.) public school system, which includes the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) and public charter schools, received federal payments for school improvement from fiscal years 2004 to 2009. These payments were used for a variety of purposes, including expanding D.C. public charter schools and improving DCPS. However, the lack of detailed information on some of these payments precludes a complete understanding of their use.
2. OSSE, the agency responsible for monitoring federal payment grantees, has faced financial management challenges and was designated as a ""high risk"" grantee in 2007. While OSSE has taken corrective actions, the U.S. Department of Education has maintained a high risk designation for OSSE.
3. DCPS has also had problems managing grants and contracts, as identified in annual independent audits. These audits have found internal control deficiencies related to federal grants management at OSSE and procurement practices at DCPS.
4. To improve internal controls for managing the use of federal payments and to provide continuity of information across administrations, the Mayor of the District of Columbia should direct the State Superintendent of Education to establish and implement written policies and procedures for monitoring federal payment grantees, and direct the DCPS Chancellor to establish and implement policies for contract monitoring.",1

The crude oil price is based on the forecasted price for crude oil provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and is adjusted for refining and nonproduct costs. The standard price is intended to remain unchanged until the next budget year to shield the military services from market price volatility.
2. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DOD's actual costs for bulk fuel differed considerably from its budget estimates, due largely to fluctuations in fuel price. DOD either under- or overestimated what it would have to pay for bulk fuel, and these differences were accounted for primarily by fluctuations in the market price for fuel.
3. Differences between the price DOD paid for fuel and the price it charged its fuel customers—the standard price—accounted for, on average, 74 percent of the difference between estimated and actual costs. In fiscal year 2012, for example, DOD estimated a standard price of $131.04 per barrel, but its actual costs during that year averaged $167.33 per barrel, an underestimate of $36.29 per barrel, which represented 85 percent of the underestimate for fiscal year 2012.
4. DOD has taken actions to manage fluctuations in the cash balance of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund caused by differences between its estimated and actual fuel costs. These actions included transferring funds into the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund from other accounts and adjusting the standard price DOD charged to its fuel customers.
5. DOD has not updated its current approach for setting the standard price to reflect current market conditions or documented its rationale for the assumptions it uses in estimating the standard price. The department has completed several studies since 2004 reviewing various aspects of its bulk fuel program, but it has not implemented any changes to its approach for setting the standard price.",1
508,"1. The Standard Procurement System (SPS) is a DOD program for automating contract management-related functions within the procurement process for all DOD organizations and activities. The program began in 1994 and is expected to be used to prepare contracts and contract-related documents, standardize procurement business practices and data elements, and provide timely, accurate, and integrated contract information.
2. From 1994 to 1996, DOD defined SPS requirements and solicited commercially available vendor products. In April 1997, DOD awarded a contract to American Management Systems (AMS), Incorporated, to use its commercially available contract management system as the foundation for SPS and modify it as necessary to meet requirements.
3. DOD has deployed four releases of SPS to 773 locations in support of 21,900 users. However, the fifth release, delivered in February 2001, was sent back to the vendor for rework due to software deficiencies and has not been deployed.
4. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has issued three reports critical of SPS, citing concerns such as the needs of SPS users not being met, lack of critical functionality, inadequate system training and guidance, high costs, and lack of cost-effectiveness.
5. The program office is not responsible for ensuring that all program commitments are being met, and DOD is not measuring whether it is meeting other commitments.
6. DOD has not met key commitments concerning the timing of product delivery, user satisfaction with system performance, and the use of a commercial system solution.
7. The program is not meeting its expected benefits, such as replacing legacy systems and manual processes, standardizing policies, processes, and procedures, and reducing problem disbursements.
8. DOD does not know the total cost of the SPS program or the extent to which SPS is meeting cost-and-benefit expectations.
9. Federal IT investment management requirements and guidance emphasize the need to have investment management processes and information to help ensure that IT projects are being implemented at acceptable costs and within reasonable and expected time frames and that they are contributing to tangible, observable improvements in mission performance.",1
509,"1. USCIS is responsible for processing and determining eligibility for various types of immigration benefits, and detecting fraudulent information and evidence in applications.
2. In FY 2005, USCIS received about 6.3 million applications and adjudicated about 7.5 million, with service centers processing about 67% and district offices processing about 33%.
3. USCIS has a budget of about $1.8 billion, with about $1.6 billion from service fees and $160 million from congressional appropriations.
4. USCIS has a backlog of several million applications and has developed a plan to eliminate it by the end of FY 2006.
5. To combat immigration benefit fraud, USCIS established the Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) office in 2003, which has Fraud Detection Units (FDU) at all service centers and the National Benefits Center.
6. FDNS receives fraud leads from adjudicators and determines which leads should be referred to ICE’s Office of Investigations.
7. ICE’s Office of Investigations created four new Benefit Fraud Units (BFU) in Vermont, Texas, Nebraska, and California to review, assess, and refer immigration fraud leads to ICE field offices for possible investigation.
8. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman to assist individuals and employers in resolving problems with USCIS.
9. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of State and the Department of Labor’s Division of Foreign Labor Certification, also play important roles in the immigration benefit application process.
10. Fraudulent schemes used in several high-profile immigration benefit fraud cases include submitting fraudulent documents and being committed by organized white-collar and other criminals, with the potential to result in large profits for these criminals.",1
510,"1. The objective of the assessment was to evaluate IRS' performance during the 1994 filing season, specifically focusing on its ability to process income tax returns and refunds accurately and efficiently and to provide taxpayers access to forms, information, and electronic filing methods.
2. The assessment found that IRS' computer systems generally performed well, with intermittent problems causing only minor delays. IRS exceeded its accuracy and timeliness goals for processing refunds and took positive steps to improve its processing of tax receipts.
3. However, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) continued to be a leading source of errors by taxpayers and tax practitioners, contributing to IRS' error resolution workload. The number of fraudulent refund claims identified by IRS also continued to grow at a troubling pace.
4. In planning for the 1994 filing season, IRS had expected to receive 117.5 million individual returns, but due to a drop in the number of filers in the previous year, the projection was revised to 114.5 million. However, as of September 9, the number of filings was still 1.1 million short of IRS' revised expectations.
5. The use of alternative filing methods generally increased in 1994, with 13.5 million individual income tax returns filed electronically, up from 12.3 million in 1993. The availability of TeleFile was expanded to 7 states in 1994, and the number of users grew to about 519,000.
6. IRS' computer systems generally performed well during the 1994 filing season, but some systems problems occurred that had operational impacts, such as downtime for IRS employees and short delays in refunds for taxpayers.
7. IRS measures refund accuracy by reviewing samples of nonelectronically filed returns with a refund due to the taxpayer and comparing the taxpayer’s name, address, and refund amount on the tax return with the same information on IRS’ master file. IRS uses the same sample to measure refund timeliness.
8. In an effort to improve check processing and deposit tax receipts more timely, IRS tested the use of lockboxes and required each of the service centers to develop procedures for",1
511,"1. Tennessee's TennCare program is a statewide prepaid managed care program that was implemented rapidly and without much experience or a model to follow. This led to several problems such as confusion among enrollees, providers, and MCOs; provider resistance; and delays in enrollment, claims processing, and premium payments. Despite these challenges, the program has continued to experience problems even after addressing some of them to some degree.
2. The TennCare program introduced a prepaid, capitated system, in which the TennCare Bureau makes monthly payments to MCOs for enrollee care, and the Bureau assumes responsibility for MCO oversight. This change from the state's previous fee-for-service reimbursement system caused confusion for contracted MCOs, TennCare beneficiaries, and participating providers due to the inexperience of the parties involved. Additionally, poor communication and outreach, delays in signing providers with MCO networks, and assigning patients to primary care providers, and delays in claims processing and collecting premium payments have presented several problems for the program.",1
512,"1. The 1980s crack cocaine epidemic in the United States was not identified by national prevalence data until several years after it had spread to multiple metropolitan areas. This was due to limitations in drug detection mechanisms, including gaps in populations surveyed, self-reported data, and potential inaccuracies in hospital emergency department data.
2. The federal public health response to crack in the 1980s primarily focused on cocaine in general, with NIDA's research aimed at developing best practice prevention and treatment approaches. There was no significant change in block grant funding for state drug prevention and service delivery activities.
3. In the 1990s, changes were made to drug detection mechanisms and new federal mechanisms were created to address concerns about coverage, timeliness, and methodological issues. The creation of ONDCP and organizational changes to HHS' drug abuse agencies were intended to strengthen the federal response to drug abuse problems.
4. Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, federal agencies are required to set goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to which the goals are met in order to increase program effectiveness and public accountability. However, the effectiveness of these changes will depend on how well the agencies carry out their roles and responsibilities.",1
513,"1. In the mid-1970s, major structural changes in the American economy led to the dislocation of thousands of workers, resulting in the need for job search assistance and reemployment services.
2. Demonstration projects in the 1980s and 1990s in New Jersey, Nevada, Minnesota, and Washington showed the efficacy of using statistical methods and administrative data to identify those likely to experience long periods of joblessness.
3. The Clinton administration proposed legislation to implement worker profiling in 1993, and Congress enacted the Unemployment Compensation Amendments, requiring states to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for UI regular compensation.
4. Under the law, states must identify claimants likely to exhaust regular compensation and refer them to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services.
5. States are required to collect information on the type of services claimants receive, their participation, and their subsequent employment outcomes, including whether referred claimants obtained new jobs and the related wage levels.
6. Labor issued guidance in 1994 to help states establish profiling tools and provide necessary reemployment services, and recommended considering factors such as education, tenure at previous job, and state unemployment rate.
7. The law requires that states withhold UI administrative grants from a state if Labor finds that a state has failed to comply with worker-profiling requirements, including identifying claimants most likely to exhaust benefits, referring claimants to reemployment services, and collecting follow-up information on services received and subsequent employment outcomes.
8. The large majority of states use statistical models to identify unemployment recipients who are most likely to exhaust benefits, but many states have not recently adjusted their models, risking the possibility that these models may lose predictive accuracy over time.
9. States vary in how they specifically define exhaustion, and models can differ considerably in how they define similar variables, including those corresponding to the factors recommended by Labor.
10. Labor has taken actions to encourage and assist states in updating their profiling models, but has not established requirements for updating models or undertaken ongoing monitoring of state models.",1
514,"1. The Military Health System (MHS) has three missions: maintaining the health of active-duty service members, maintaining readiness, and providing care to the dependents of active-duty personnel, retirees and their families, and survivors of military personnel. The MHS implemented the TRICARE framework in response to rising costs and concerns about access to military care. TRICARE provides care through over 600 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and a network of civilian providers managed by outside contractors. TRICARE offers three options: TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Standard.
2. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees. Medicare enrollees receive part A benefits and are eligible for optional part B benefits if they pay a monthly premium. Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries choose their own providers, and Medicare reimburses those providers on a fee-for-service basis. Beneficiaries who receive care through traditional Medicare are responsible for paying a share of the costs for services. Most beneficiaries have supplemental coverage that pays for many of the costs not covered by Medicare.",1
515,"1. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has made significant progress in implementing leading management practices in eight key areas, including communication, strategic planning, IT, knowledge management, organizational structure, human capital management, training, and financial management.
2. NTSB has fully implemented three of the 15 management recommendations provided by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2006 and 2008, and has made further progress on eight others.
3. NTSB has improved communication from staff to management, aligned its organizational structure with its strategic plan, and corrected an Antideficiency Act violation related to accidental death and dismemberment insurance for employees on official travel.
4. NTSB has fully implemented an IT strategic plan, undergone annual independent audits for information security, and installed encryption software on most of its laptops.
5. NTSB has drafted a strategic training plan and developed core curricula for investigators, with two modal offices having core curricula specifically for their investigators.
6. NTSB has initiated actions to fully implement the remaining four management recommendations, including improving knowledge management, human capital planning, and the use of the Training Center.
7. NTSB's human capital plan now includes goals for recruiting, developing, and retaining a diverse workforce, and the agency provided diversity training to senior managers and office directors in May 2009.
8. NTSB's current workforce demographics present an opportunity to increase the diversity of its workforce and management, as more than 50 percent of its current supervisors and managers will be eligible to retire in the next three years.
9. NTSB has fully implemented the GAO's recommendation to develop transparent policies containing risk-based criteria for selecting which accidents to investigate, and has three safety studies in progress.
10. NTSB has increased use of its Training Center's classroom space from 10 percent in fiscal year 2006 to 80 percent in fiscal year 2009, and has reduced the Training Center's annual deficit from about $3.9 million to about $1.9 million over the same time period.",1
516,"1. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) aims to shift the focus of government decision-making, management, and accountability from activities and processes to the results and outcomes achieved by federal programs.
2. Under GPRA, annual performance plans should include details on performance goals, measures, strategies, resources, and verification procedures for major programs and activities.
3. EPA, with over 18,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $7 billion, funds diverse regulatory, research, enforcement, and technical assistance programs aimed at controlling pollution of the air, land, and water.
4. EPA's performance management involves working cooperatively with state partners, and the agency has identified weaknesses and made recommendations to improve relationships with the states.
5. EPA reported progress in achieving its goal of safe and healthy air in communities, including improvements in air quality and reductions in toxic air pollutant emissions.
6. EPA's strategy for achieving its clean air goal includes working with states, tribes, and local governments to achieve compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants.
7. EPA's performance report acknowledges data limitations and time lags in verifying emissions data, and the agency's strategy for clean air relies on the continued implementation of the Acid Rain Program.
8. EPA reported making strides in ensuring safe and clean drinking water, but achieving this goal relies on information from sources with data limitations.
9. EPA's strategy for ensuring safe drinking water involves several approaches, including regulatory standards, funding to states for drinking water revolving funds, and addressing state drinking water sources through the Source Water Assessment and Prevention Program.",1
517,"1. The Corporate Information Management (CIM) initiative, launched by the Department of Defense (DOD) in 1989, aims to improve business processes and make better use of information technology across all DOD functional areas. The initiative has its origins in the recommendations of the President’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management and was established to achieve the objectives outlined in the Defense Management Report (DMR). The primary objective of CIM is to significantly improve business processes of all functional areas through techniques such as business process reengineering and continuous process improvements. Standardization and improvement of DOD’s supporting information systems remains a major CIM objective.
2. The DOD has implemented various strategies to achieve CIM objectives, including the selection and implementation of migration systems for materiel management and depot maintenance functions. JLSC, a DOD organization, has been established to oversee the implementation of CIM in the logistics functions of materiel management and depot maintenance. However, the implementation of CIM has faced several challenges, including the lack of full acceptance of CIM by some DOD functional and technical managers, the absence of integration of various CIM efforts, and unclear program management authority. DOD has taken several actions to address these challenges, including issuing a strategic plan and establishing boards and councils to facilitate CIM integration. However, more needs to be done to overcome these challenges and successfully implement CIM.",1
518,"1. As part of an undercover investigation, GAO investigators produced counterfeit NRC documents and transported radioactive sources in an attempt to cross the border.
2. The investigators did not encounter any difficulties in obtaining radioactive sources or in crossing the border, and the counterfeit documents were not questioned.
3. The investigation highlights the potential for individuals to obtain and transport radioactive materials without proper authorization.
4. The GAO recommends that the NRC and CBP work together to verify the authenticity of NRC materials documents.
5. The NRC disagreed with the GAO's determination of the amount of radioactive material needed to produce a dirty bomb.
6. The GAO was able to purchase all of the radioactive sources used in the investigation from different suppliers, using false identities and cover stories.
7. The GAO believes that the amount of radioactive sources transported during the operation would be sufficient to produce two dirty bombs, which could be used as weapons of mass disruption.",1
519,"1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has historically experienced difficulties in transitioning technologies from the lab environment to real-world use, often due to insufficient demonstration or recognition of a technology's potential, unwillingness of acquisition programs to fund final stages of development, or preference for in-house technology development.
2. DOD and Congress have established various technology transition programs to address these challenges, such as the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program, the Manufacturing Technology Program (MANTECH), and the Dual Use Science and Technology program. However, these programs represent a small portion of DOD's overall spending on research and development.
3. More recent initiatives include the Tactical Technology Office's (TTO) Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), the Defense Advanced Concepts Demonstration Program (DACP), and the Quick Reaction Fund, all managed by DOD's Office of Defense Research and Engineering. These programs aim to speed technology transition, introduce innovative and cost-saving technologies, and field test technology prototypes.
4. While these programs have shown promise, their impact on technology transition is not yet fully determined, as few projects have been completed and limited performance measures are in place to gauge success or track return on investment over time.
5. To ensure effective technology transition, transition programs need to establish robust selection, management, and oversight processes, including verifying technology readiness levels, confirming a sound business case, maintaining clear communication between labs and acquisition programs, and tracking the impact of program funding.
6. DOD should consider strengthening selection and management capabilities for its technology transition programs, taking into account resources needed for implementation and their impact on flexibility, while also developing better performance measurement tools to assess which approaches are most effective.",1

It is updated through a combination of full address canvassing and other sources such as USPS files, commercial database files, and state/local government input.
2. For the 2020 Census, the Bureau is researching the feasibility of conducting targeted address canvassing, which would involve verifying addresses only in select areas more likely to require updates. This is in an effort to reduce costs from the full address canvassing used in the 2010 Census.
3. The Bureau's 2020 Census preparation is divided into five phases, with the early research and testing phase (through FY2015) being used to develop a proposal for conducting targeted address canvassing. The Bureau plans to complete decisions about preliminary operational designs earlier in the decade than it did for the 2010 Census.
4. The Bureau's 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I schedules exhibit some characteristics of a reliable schedule, but important weaknesses remain. The schedules substantially met the ""controlled"" characteristic, but minimally or partially met the ""comprehensive,"" ""well constructed,"" and ""credible"" characteristics.
5. The Bureau is using a work breakdown structure to guide the activities of the 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I schedules, but not all activities listed in the work breakdown structure are included in the schedules. This could make it difficult for managers to identify causes of delay.
6. The Bureau has not yet produced a timeline for all enterprise activities, as recommended in 2012. In both schedules, the Bureau did not identify the preceding and following activity for a number of activities, and used a large number of constraints which can affect the reliability of the schedule.
7. The Bureau has a schedule management process in place and a method for logging changes to the schedule, but has not taken advantage of some opportunities to use its schedules to reinforce roles or clarify responsibilities. The Bureau is working to improve its scheduling practices and collaboration efforts.",1
521,"1. The Clean Air Act, a federal law passed in 1963, aims to improve and protect the nation's air quality by regulating air pollution from stationary and mobile sources. The act has been substantially overhauled several times, with major amendments in 1970, 1977, and 1990. The 1990 amendments, in particular, introduced market-based approaches to reduce emissions, such as cap-and-trade programs.
2. EPA is responsible for establishing national ambient air quality standards for pollutants, while states and local governments are responsible for implementing and enforcing these standards. EPA has set standards for six principal air pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, and lead.
3. Between 1970 and 2004, the US experienced significant economic and population growth, but total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 54%. However, large numbers of Americans still live in communities where pollution sometimes exceeds federal air quality standards for one or more of these pollutants.
4. EPA identified 452 actions required to meet the objectives of Titles I, III, and IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Of these, 256 were completed late, with an average delay of 24, 25, and 15 months for Title I, III, and IV requirements, respectively. EPA officials cited several factors for missing deadlines, including stakeholder involvement, setting priorities, competing demands, litigation, and new scientific information.
5. As of April 2005, 45 requirements related to Titles I, III, and IV with statutory deadlines had not been met, primarily involving promulgating regulations that limit emissions of volatile organic compounds from consumer and commercial products and reviewing the NAAQS for the criteria pollutants. EPA is currently being sued for not implementing these rules by their statutory deadlines.
6. EPA has made notable reductions in emissions of air pollutants as a result of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. However, the agency faced challenges in implementing the required actions, leading to varying timel",1
522,"1. The Girls Study Group was established in 2004 by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to identify effective or promising programs, program elements, and implementation principles to prevent and reduce girls’ delinquency.
2. The Study Group reviewed over 1,000 documents and identified 61 programs that specifically targeted girls’ delinquency, which were then assessed for methodological quality using DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs’ What Works criteria.
3. The Study Group’s methods for assessing studies and involving practitioners were consistent with generally accepted social science research practices and standards.
4. However, some experts criticized the use of the What Works criteria for creating an unrealistically high standard and causing the group to overlook potentially promising programs.
5. The Study Group found that few girls’ delinquency programs had been studied and that the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs.
6. OJJDP plans to provide technical assistance to help programs prepare for evaluations of their effectiveness, but could better address its girls’ delinquency goals by developing specific plans for supporting such evaluations.
7. OJJDP officials have stated that they plan to involve practitioners more fully in future study groups and to develop a plan for meeting their girls’ delinquency goals, including specific funding requirements and time frames.",1
523,"1. Before 1991, the military services maintained separate and inefficient finance and accounting operations. DFAS was created to standardize DOD finance and accounting policies, procedures, and systems.
2. DFAS was established in January 1991 by consolidating large finance and accounting centers from the military services and defense agencies. It later assumed control of existing finance and accounting operations and personnel at the command and installation levels within the military services.
3. The establishment of DFAS aimed to increase DOD-wide oversight, improve consistency in the application of accounting principles, eliminate the costs of maintaining multiple financial operations and systems, provide more timely, meaningful, and accurate financial information, and accelerate the implementation of standard DOD-wide financial systems.
4. DFAS is currently consolidating its activities into 5 centers and not more than 21 operating locations, while the military services continue to perform their remaining activities at most of the 332 installations.
5. DFAS and the military services are jointly responsible for carrying out DOD finance and accounting activities, with DFAS reporting to the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer and the military services headed by their respective secretary.
6. The Under Secretary has no direct line of authority to any of the financial management staff within the military services, defense agencies, and DOD field activities, but does issue policies, instructions, regulations, and procedures relating to financial management matters.",1
524,"1. The Federal Reserve is the country’s central bank, established as an independent agency with a decentralized structure to ensure that monetary policy decisions are based on a broad economic perspective from all regions of the country. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions do not require approval from the President, the executive branch, or Congress. However, the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by Congress and conducts monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States.
2. The Federal Reserve operates in a unique public and private structure, consisting of the Board of Governors, the 12 Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Board of Governors is an independent regulatory federal agency located in Washington, D.C., and has broad interest in monitoring and promoting the stability of financial markets. The Reserve Banks are not federal agencies, but federally chartered corporations with a board of directors and member banks that are stockholders.
3. The Federal Reserve Act requires the Board of Governors to submit written reports to Congress twice each year containing discussions of the conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects for the future. The act also requires the Chair of the Board of Governors to testify on the conduct of monetary policy twice each year in connection with the monetary policy report, as well as economic development and prospects for the future.
4. The Federal Reserve derives income primarily from the interest on its holdings of U.S. government securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt acquired through open market operations. Other sources of income include the interest on foreign currency investments held by the Reserve Banks, interest on loans to depository institutions, reimbursements for services performed as fiscal agent for Treasury and other agencies, and fees received for payment services provided to depository institutions.
5. The Federal Reserve Act established nine-member boards of directors to govern all 12 Reserve Banks. Each board is split equally into three classes of directors. Class A directors represent the member banks, while Class B and C directors represent the public. The Federal Reserve Act requires member banks to elect Class A and Class B directors and the Board of Governors to appoint Class C directors.
6. The research generally finds that a high level of central bank independence is desirable and is generally associated with lower levels of inflation. Central bank independence can be divided into three categories:",1
525,"1. The 1992 Act outlines several approaches for dealing with motor vehicle theft, including the establishment of a task force to study related problems and the creation of a new federal crime for armed car jacking. It also calls for the establishment of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System and grants for states to implement it, and expands the parts marking program established in the Theft Act of 1984.
2. The 1992 Act required Transportation to establish a task force to study problems related to motor vehicle titling, registration, and salvage, and to report its recommendations. The task force recommended, among other things, the passage of federal legislation requiring uniform definitions for terms such as salvage vehicles and uniform methods for titling vehicles, and penalties to enforce compliance by the participating states.
3. NHTSA contracted with AAMVA to identify the states' costs for implementing a titling system, and AAMVA surveyed the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The cost for the 37 states that provided cost estimates ranged from zero to $12.2 million. AAMVA officials estimated that about $19 million in federal grants would be needed to fund states' implementation costs.
4. In December 1994, NHTSA denied AAMVA's request for funds to conduct a pilot study of a titling information system because, in NHTSA's view, such a study would have been premature without first having uniformity in state titling laws and regulations. However, Congress provided $890,000 for a pilot study by NHTSA as part of Transportation’s fiscal year 1996 appropriation.
5. NHTSA prepared legislation in response to the task force’s recommendations, and as of February 1, 1996, the bills were being reviewed by Transportation officials. Legislation (H.R. 2803) introduced in December 1995 would, among other things, transfer Transportation’s responsibilities for the titling area to Justice, extend the implementation date of the titling system, and provide immunity for those participants who make good faith efforts to comply with the 1992 Act’s titling requirements.",1
526,"1. The distribution of prescription drugs in the United States involves multiple entities, including wholesalers, independent pharmacies, Pharmacy Services Administrative Organizations (PSAOs), and third-party payers and their Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). Wholesalers purchase drugs in bulk from manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies, while independent pharmacies dispense medications to consumers and provide patient-care services. PSAOs help independent pharmacies negotiate contracts with third-party payers or their PBMs.
2. Third-party payers, which accounted for almost 80 percent of drug expenditures in 2010, include private and public health plans such as those offered by large corporations and the federal government through Medicare and the FEHBP. PBMs help manage prescription drug benefits for these health plans by assembling networks of retail pharmacies, including independent pharmacies.
3. PSAOs provide a range of services to independent pharmacies, including negotiating contractual agreements and providing communication and help-desk services. These services are intended to achieve administrative efficiencies for both independent pharmacies and third-party payers or their PBMs. Most PSAOs charge a monthly fee for a bundled set of services and separate fees for additional services.
4. The majority of PSAOs are owned by wholesalers and independent pharmacy cooperatives. PSAO owners may have an interest in developing relationships with independent pharmacies, which are potential customers of the wholesaler’s drug distribution line of business. By obtaining multiple services from a wholesaler, an independent pharmacy may be less likely to switch wholesalers.",1
527,"1. An enterprise architecture is a blueprint that describes an organization's current and desired state and a plan for transitioning between the two. It is used to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability in business processes and systems. The concept of enterprise architectures has been around since the mid-1980s and various frameworks have been published by government agencies and OMB. Legislation and federal guidance requires agencies to develop and use architectures.
2. The federal government has promoted the use of architectures for over a decade as a means to optimize agency operations and performance. The federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council published the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) in 1999 to provide federal agencies with a common construct for their architectures. OMB established the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (FEAPMO) in 2001 to develop a federal enterprise architecture according to a collection of five reference models. These models are intended to facilitate governmentwide improvement through cross-agency analysis and the identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration, interoperability, and integration within and across government agencies.
3. The federal government has developed and implemented an enterprise architecture assessment tool to help better understand the current state of an agency’s architecture and assist agencies in integrating architectures into their decision-making processes. The tool includes three capability areas: completion, use, and results. It also includes criteria for scoring an agency’s architecture program on a scale of 0 to 5. In early 2006, the major departments and agencies were required by OMB to self assess their architecture programs using the tool.
4. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) developed version 1.1 of its Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity Framework (EAMMF) in 2003 to provide federal agencies with a common benchmarking tool for planning and measuring their efforts to improve enterprise architecture management. The framework is an extension of A Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture, Version 1.0, published by the CIO Council. It arranges 31 core elements (practices or conditions that are needed for effective enterprise architecture management) into a matrix of five hierarchical maturity stages and four critical success attributes that apply to each stage. The core elements can be further categorized by four groups: architecture governance, content, use, and measurement.",1

The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was concluded in 2005 and signed in 2006, making Oman the fifth country in the proposed Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) to have a bilateral FTA with the U.S. The FTA is expected to have a small but positive impact on the U.S. economy, with minimal impact on U.S. workers. However, U.S. apparel workers may be adversely affected due to increased apparel imports from Oman.
2. The FTA provides immediate duty-free access for almost all consumer and industrial goods, with special provisions for agriculture and textiles and apparel. Tariffs on agricultural products will be eliminated immediately for 87% of agricultural tariff lines, while tariffs on textile and apparel products will be eliminated immediately for most U.S. imports from Oman.
3. The FTA also includes broad commitments to open markets in sectors such as banking, insurance, securities, and telecommunications, as well as protections for U.S. investors and intellectual property rights. It also includes enforcement measures for intellectual property rights infringement and transparent sanitary and phytosanitary measures.
4. Oman is a small U.S. trade partner, with total U.S.-Oman trade in 2005 accounting for only 0.04% of all U.S. trade. However, Oman is an important gateway to the Persian Gulf region and is seeking to diversify its economy beyond oil and gas exports.
5. The FTA has broad support in the business community, but labor groups have criticized the agreement for not adequately addressing weaknesses in Omani laws and enforcement. The AFL-CIO has also criticized the agreement for being a step back from the Generalized System of Preferences program.",1
529,"1. Hate crimes are criminal offenses motivated by bias against certain personal characteristics.
2. Congress has enacted laws to recognize the impact of hate crimes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, and the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1994.
3. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 expanded the definition of hate crimes to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.
4. The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13th and 15th Amendments are the primary sources of congressional authority to proscribe hate crimes and enact civil rights legislation.
5. The commerce clause allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce, including activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
6. The Supreme Court narrowed the ""affects interstate commerce"" category in the Morrison case, which dealt with the Violence Against Women Act.
7. The legislative clauses of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments give Congress the power to enforce the Amendments through appropriate legislation.
8. Section 5 of the 14th Amendment only authorizes legislation directed against state action, not private action.
9. Section 2 of the 13th Amendment may be a more viable option for broadening hate crime legislation, as it prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude without reference to federal, state, or private action.
10. The 1st and 6th Amendments impose constitutional limits on hate crime legislation, particularly in regards to freedom of speech and the right to a jury trial.",1
530,"1. East Asian nations, including China, Japan, and South Korea, have had exchange rate policies that have caused tensions with the United States. Some argue that these policies constitute currency manipulation and violate international agreements. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the Department of the Treasury to analyze the exchange rate policies of major trading partners. In its most recent report, Treasury found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for being labeled a currency manipulator, but it did identify six major trading partners to include on its ""Monitoring List,"" including four East Asian economies.
2. Different types of exchange rate policies include a ""free float,"" in which a country allows the value of its currency to fluctuate relative to other major currencies, and a ""pegged"" exchange rate, in which a nation fixes the value of its currency relative to another currency or a bundle of currencies. A ""managed float"" is another common exchange rate policy, in which a country allows the value of its domestic currency to fluctuate in international forex markets until certain designated economic indicators reach critical levels.
3. The International Monetary Fund classifies the current de facto exchange rate policies of East Asian nations as follows: Japan allows its currency to float freely, five nations allow their currencies to float but reserve the right to intervene, seven countries manage their exchange rates according to certain economic objectives, and two countries operate a currency board system that effectively pegs their exchange rates. However, categorizing a government's exchange rate policy can be complicated, particularly during periods of financial turbulence. For example, South Korea's official exchange rate policy has been a free floating system, but there have been reports of the South Korean government intervening in forex markets to maintain stability. Similarly, China officially maintained a ""crawling peg"" policy prior to the global financial crisis, but there were allegations that China had abandoned the crawling peg in favor of a pegged exchange rate during the crisis.",1
531,"1. U.S. ambassadors, also known as Chiefs of Mission (COM), are the President's personal representatives in foreign countries or international organizations, responsible for leading diplomatic efforts and overseeing nearly all U.S. government activities in their country of assignment.
2. The role of COMs has expanded significantly since World War II, with the postwar expansion of U.S. foreign assistance, and they are now considered CEOs of multi-agency missions, responsible for conducting traditional diplomacy and leading civilians from multiple federal agencies in other work.
3. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 (FSA 1980) outlines the authorities and responsibilities of COMs, including their responsibilities, authority over personnel, and obligations of U.S. government personnel to the COM.
4. COM authority is derived from the President's general constitutional powers in foreign affairs and is shaped by executive branch directives, such as executive orders and State Department regulations.
5. COMs have full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of all Government executive branch employees in their country of assignment, except for Voice of America correspondents on official assignment and employees under the command of a U.S. Geographic Combatant Commander.
6. COMs are also responsible for keeping fully and currently informed with respect to all activities and operations of the Government within their country of assignment and ensuring that all Government executive branch employees comply with applicable directives.
7. COMs have the right to see all communications to and from Mission elements, except those exempted by law or executive decision.
8. COM authority extends to all DOD personnel in a country except those under the command of a GCC, and ambassadors are charged with responsibility for the activities of in-country military personnel by a variety of statutes, presidential directives, and executive branch arrangements.
9. COMs have no authority over GCCs, but they are expected to maintain a cooperative relationship, and the Secretary of State, and by extension COMs, are responsible for the security of all U.S. government personnel, including DOD personnel serving under COM authority.
10. COMs play a key role in ensuring interagency coordination and promoting U.S. goods and services for export, and their ability to carry out these functions effectively depends on their support from officials in Washington and recognition of their role with respect to",1
532,"1. China's economy is heavily dependent on global trade and investment, with exports and FDI playing a significant role in its productivity gains and rapid economic growth. However, the current global economic slowdown, particularly in its major export markets, is having a negative impact on China's export sector and industries that depend on FDI flows, causing a sharp decline in exports, imports, and FDI flows, and leading to job losses and a slowdown in industrial output.

2. China has implemented a two-year, 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package to rebalance the economy, increase consumer spending, restructure and subsidize certain industries, and boost incomes for farmers and rural poor. The government also plans to create a universal health care system, boost rural incomes and spending levels, and narrow the gap in living standards between rural and urban citizens. Despite these efforts, there are concerns over long-term growth prospects, including the reliance on bank lending and infrastructure spending, the potential for a rise in non-performing loans, and the impact of stimulus policies on further economic reforms.",1
533,"1. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service are responsible for managing oil and gas development on federal public domain lands. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (MLLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas deposits on public domain lands, with the federal government retaining ownership of the land. The MLLA applies to National Forest System (NFS) lands that are reserved from the public domain and most reserved subsurface mineral estates, but excludes certain categories of lands such as national parks and monuments. The Secretary of the Interior cannot issue a lease for NFS lands reserved from the public domain if the Secretary of Agriculture objects. The U.S. Forest Service has issued separate regulations governing certain aspects of leasing and permitting for oil and gas development on lands within its jurisdiction.
2. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop and revise land use plans (Resource Management Plans) for public lands managed by BLM that consider the present and potential future uses for the lands. These RMPs serve as the initial determinant of which lands may be subject to leasing. The Secretary must apply multiple use and sustained yield principles when developing RMPs, and provide opportunities for public and government participation in the development of RMPs. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) applies to the competitive and noncompetitive leasing processes, and may require the preparation of a supplemental EIS (SEIS), a new EA or EIS, or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI).",1
534,"1. Itemized deductions are claimed by individual income tax filers who have aggregate deductions greater than the standard deduction. In 2014, 30% of tax filers chose to itemize their deductions, with a greater share of higher-income individuals doing so compared to lower-income individuals.
2. Higher-income tax filers claimed larger average sums of itemized deductions. For example, taxpayers with an AGI greater than $200,00",0
535,"1. The Pacific Islands region, also known as the South Pacific or Southwest Pacific, is strategically important and includes U.S. territories, as well as countries that have attracted Chinese diplomatic and economic attention.
2. Congress plays key roles in approving and overseeing the Compacts of Free Association with the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau, and in providing foreign assistance to Pacific Island countries for climate change adaptation and mitigation.
3. The region covers a large area of ocean and land, and includes 14 sovereign states with approximately 9 million people. Many Pacific Island countries have limited natural and human resources, and are hindered by lack of resources, skilled labor, economies of scale, inadequate infrastructure, poor government services, and remoteness from international markets.
4. The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) are regional organizations that seek to foster cooperation and address key issues such as climate change, regional security, and fisheries.
5. The United States has friendly relations with Pacific Island countries and has worked with Australia and New Zealand to advance shared strategic interests, maintain regional stability, and promote economic development.
6. China has become a diplomatic force, major source of foreign aid, and leading trade partner in the Southwest Pacific, and other nations such as Russia, India, and Indonesia have also increased their engagement in the region.
7. U.S. policymakers have emphasized the importance of the Pacific Islands region for U.S. strategic and security interests, and U.S. objectives in the region include promoting sustainable economic development and good governance, addressing the effects of climate change, administering the Compacts of Free Association, supporting regional organizations, projecting a presence in the region, and cooperating with Australia and regional aid donors.",1
536,"1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a federal law that provides for the listing and protection of species that are endangered or threatened with extinction. Listing a species results in limitations on activities that could affect that species and penalties for taking individuals of a listed species. Federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine whether an agency project might jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify a species' critical habitat.
2. The exemption process under the ESA allows federal agencies, governors, or permit or license applicants to seek an exemption from the ESA's restrictions if a project cannot be conducted without jeopardizing a species and the federal agency believes that the reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) would thwart the project. The exemption process offers the opportunity to consider extraordinary economic circumstances and provides an opportunity for economic factors to override jeopardy to the species.
3. The exemption process is used rarely, with only six instances in which an exemption was sought and only two in which it was granted in the four decades since the ESA was enacted. The historical prologue of these past applications may prove useful in future applications for exemptions.
4. The exemption process is a complex affair that can take up to 280 days and involves several steps, including the submission of an application, a consultation process, a formal hearing, and the preparation of a report. The Secretary and the Endangered Species Committee (ESC) are responsible for making the required findings on which an exemption rests.
5. Even if all the required findings are made in favor of the applicant, mitigation determined, and an exemption granted, controversy and legal challenges may continue. Other laws may still be in play and, as a result, conflicts may remain.
6. The ESA has strong legal protections for listed species, which tends to force decisions on issues that have long been in conflict. When an exemption is considered, potential applicants may be unaware of the stringency of the process, the fact that the exemptions apply to the action rather than the species, the need for the applicant to fund potentially costly permanent mitigation, and the fact that after an exemption is granted, the burden of conservation may fall more heavily on any other areas that the species inhabits",0
537,"1. The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed multiple times throughout history, with some legislative changes attempting to reestablish symmetry between the two. Under current law, asymmetries remain, such as the deductibility of net long-term losses against net short-term gains without limit and the different tax rates for ordinary income and long-term gains.
2. The loss limitation was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from altering the timing of the realization of gains and losses to minimize their capital income tax liabilities. Without the limitation, taxpayers could reduce their net federal income taxes by changing the timing of the realizations of gains and losses.
3. The current system, even without indexing the $3,000 loss for inflation, is more generous than the system that existed in 1978. Capital gains are concentrated at the higher end of the income range, with the top 3% of taxpayers earning 91% of schedule D capital gains in 2006. However, lower and middle income taxpayers are unlikely to be much affected by the expansion of capital losses due to their limited direct holdings of stock and the increasing proportion of assets held in tax-favored forms.
4. Raising the capital loss limit would benefit a relatively small proportion of high income individuals, and it may not be an effective device to stimulate aggregate demand. An increase in the net capital loss limit could produce an incentive to sell stock, which could depress stock prices and erode confidence even further. The restoration of the value of the loss limitation to its 1978 level is complicated by the growing asymmetry between loss and gain, which has not been addressed during recent tax changes. Achieving full symmetry in the system requires accounting for the tax rate differential between short and long-term gains and losses during the netting process.",1
538,"1. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 recognizes the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing, with the goal of mitigating and eliminating labor-related obstructions to the free flow of commerce.
2. The right to engage in collective bargaining under the NLRA applies only to ""employees,"" with the term ""supervisor"" excluding those with authority to perform certain functions with the use of independent judgment.
3. In the case of Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the definition of ""independent judgment"" in the context of supervisory status, emphasizing that judgment based on professional or technical training or experience should not be excluded.
4. The NLRB has the discretion to clarify the meaning of the term ""independent judgment,"" but the Court maintained that it was inappropriate for the NLRB to characterize judgment that reflects ""ordinary professional or technical judgment"" as failing to be independent judgment.
5. In Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., the NLRB defined the terms ""assign,"" ""responsibly to direct,"" and ""independent judgment"" as they are used in section 2(11) of the NLRA, focusing on the language used by Congress, the NLRA's legislative history, applicable policy considerations, and Supreme Court precedent.
6. The NLRA prohibits certain misconduct by both employers and unions that interferes with the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining, with section 8(a)(1) addressing employer misconduct and section 8(b)(1)(A) addressing union misconduct.
7. The NLRB has maintained that an employer may make anti-union, but noncoercive, speeches to their employees on company time and on company property without allowing a union an equal opportunity to reply.
8. In Babcock & Wilson Co. and Lechmere, Inc., the Court established that an employer cannot be compelled to allow the distribution of union literature on its premises if a union can reach employees through other channels of communication, but if employees are isolated and beyond the reach of reasonable union efforts, the employer must allow the union to approach its employees on its property.",1
539,"1. Banks play a crucial role in the economy by connecting borrowers and savers, and banking is an inherently risky activity. Over time, a regulatory system has developed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks.
2. The 2008-2009 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the financial regulatory system, leading to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III Accords. These changes aimed to strengthen regulation and address risks, but some argue they have resulted in reduced credit availability and slower economic growth.
3. Regulatory ratio requirements, such as capital and liquidity ratios, are designed to ensure banks are safely profitable and to reduce the risk of failure. These requirements have evolved over time and vary based on bank size and capital quality.
4. Restrictions on permissible activities have also evolved, with historical examples found in the Glass-Steagall Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Volcker Rule, introduced in Dodd-Frank, aims to separate proprietary trading from depository banking.
5. Consumer protection is an important aspect of banking regulation, with laws and regulations in place to protect consumers and ensure fair lending practices. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to focus on consumer protection in financial transactions.
6. The CFPB has the mandate to implement and enforce federal consumer financial law, while ensuring consumers have access to financial products and services. The CFPB has regulatory authorities over banks and certain nonbank providers of consumer products and services.
7. The CFPB has been a controversial product of the Dodd-Frank Act, with some observers questioning its structure and transparency. The CFPB's rulemaking and enforcement have also been debated, with some arguing they have been unduly burdensome and increased the cost of providing financial products.
8. Mortgage lending has long been subject to regulations, but the financial crisis spurred calls for reform. The Dodd-Frank Act made changes to the mortgage system, including requiring lenders to use documented and verified information to determine a borrower's ability to repay a loan.
9. The perceived trade-off between protecting consumers and the availability of credit is a long-standing issue in the regulation of mortgages and other consumer financial services. Providers",0

541,"1. The House of Representatives establishes rules for its committees and subcommittees at the beginning of each Congress, which are primarily governed by Rules X-XIII. These committees must comply with all House directives but have some flexibility in conducting their business through the adoption of written rules.
2. The rules of a committee apply to its subcommittees and must be consistent with House rules. Committees are required to adopt rules within 30 days of the beginning of a Congress and publish them in the Congressional Record.
3. Committees are obligated to submit an activities report at the end of each Congress, differentiating between legislative and oversight activities. Committee records are the property of the House and must be kept separate from the personal office records of the chair.
4. Noncurrent records of each committee are to be preserved at the National Archives and Records Administration, with the chair of each committee responsible for transferring the records at the end of each Congress.
5. Archived records of a committee are not available to the public if the Clerk of the House determines that availability would be detrimental to the public interest or inconsistent with the rights and privileges of the House.
6. Committees are authorized to sit and act at specified times and places, hold hearings, and subpoena witnesses or materials necessary to carry out their authorized responsibilities.
7. Committee and subcommittee hearings are to be open to the public unless the committee or subcommittee votes in open session to close the hearing for specific reasons. Hearing and markup transcripts must be substantially verbatim, and witnesses are entitled to receive a copy of the committee's rules and clause 2 of House Rule XI.",1
542,"1. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a 10-member grouping of Southeast Asian nations with a combined population of 580 million and an annual gross domestic product (GDP) of around $1.5 trillion.
2. ASEAN was established in 1967 to foster regional dialogue during the turbulent post-colonial, Cold War period and has grown into one of the world's largest regional fora, representing a strategically and economically important region.
3. The Obama Administration is pursuing a policy of expanding and upgrading U.S. relations with Southeast Asia and ASEAN, as the Bush Administration's narrow focus on terrorism and neglect of other issues was perceived as insufficiently committed to multilateral dialogue.
4. The U.S. has deep-seated interests in Southeast Asia, including maritime security, promotion of democracy and human rights, encouragement of liberal trade and investment regimes, counterterrorism, combating illegal trafficking of narcotics and human trafficking, and many others.
5. Engagement with ASEAN has presented the U.S. with a foreign policy dilemma, as Southeast Asian elites perceive a lack of commitment to ASEAN and Southeast Asia as a whole, despite considerable U.S. security, economic, and foreign assistance initiatives.
6. The U.S. has long had close bilateral relations with many of Southeast Asia's nations, but symbolic commitment is particularly important in the region, and the U.S. needs to ""show up"" more frequently and at higher official levels to maintain influence.
7. The Obama Administration has taken steps to engage with ASEAN and Southeast Asian countries at a higher level, including Hillary Clinton's visits to the ASEAN Secretariat and accession to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.
8. ASEAN is an informal organization with a light staff and operates on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members, making formal security and economic moves difficult to agree upon.
9. A new ASEAN Charter went into effect in 2007, committing member nations to the formation of an ""ASEAN Community"" and potentially signaling a greater willingness to discuss and comment on the internal affairs of members.",1
543,"1. The ""state sponsors of terrorism list"" is a designation made by the Secretary of State for countries that ""have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism."" Currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria are on the list.
2. Countries on the list are subject to various restrictions, including trade benefits, foreign aid, support in international financial institutions, and other benefits. Validated licenses are required for exports to these countries, with some exceptions for items such as informational materials, humanitarian assistance, and food and medicine.
3. Cuba has been on the list since 1982, and its retention has received increased attention due to support for legislative initiatives to lift some U.S. economic sanctions. However, even if sanctions are removed, various trade and aid restrictions would remain due to Cuba's presence on the terrorism list.
4. A country can be removed from the list if the President submits a report to Congress certifying that the government has fundamentally changed, is not supporting acts of international terrorism, and has provided assurances that it will not support such acts in the future. Alternatively, the President can submit a report justifying the recision and certifying that the government has not provided support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period and has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.
5. The Reagan Administration added Cuba to the list in 1982 due to its ties to international terrorism, as detailed in various U.S. government reports and statements. Cuba was accused of providing support to guerrilla groups in Latin America and the Caribbean, facilitating the movement of men and weapons into the region, and training individual terrorists.
6. Cuba remains on the list due to its support for terrorist groups in Latin America, including the Puerto Rican nationalist group known as the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN), the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador, and the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in Nicaragua. The State Department also asserts that Cuba helped transship Soviet arms to Nicaragua and El Salvador for use by terrorist organizations, trained anti-American insurgents elsewhere in Latin America, and supported insurgencies or war efforts in Angola and Ethiopia.",1
544,"1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax calculation with a broader base than the regular tax, including not only business provisions but also certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions.
2. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, leading to an increase in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT over time. In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but by 1999, the number had grown to 823,000, and is projected to reach over 9 million by 2009.
3. The AMT does not include the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds, and the itemized deduction for home mortgage interest is also not included.
4. The cost of correcting the AMT, such as indexing AMT exemptions or eliminating the credit limit provision, would be significant, potentially costing billions of dollars.
5. Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities without altering the AMT will increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and the number affected by the credit limit, and may cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families.
6. Tax provisions that are aimed at reducing taxes for joint returns may particularly interact with the AMT because married couples have a greater number of dependents, which increases the likelihood that taxpayers will be under the AMT.
7. The AMT will become increasingly important in the years to come, in the number of taxpayers covered and revenue cost of altering the AMT.
8. The interaction between tax cuts and the AMT is affected by how the tax change is distributed across the income classes, and tax cuts directed at joint returns are particularly likely to be restricted due to the AMT.
9. The Senate marriage penalty proposal in the 106th Congress initially proposed to expand the 28% bracket, which would increase the coverage of high income taxpayers, but an even larger fraction of this group would ultimately fall under the AMT. The amount by which marriage penalties are reduced by the proposed legislation will decline over time because of the AMT.",1
545,"1. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate are responsible for drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six related agencies.
2. DOT's budget is primarily for grants to state and local government agencies for transportation infrastructure, while HUD's programs address housing problems faced by low-income households or those with special needs. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a large sub-agency of DOT that operates the U.S. air traffic control system.
3. The THUD appropriations bill is divided into four titles: Title I funds DOT, Title II funds HUD, Title III funds related agencies, and Title IV sets out general provisions. Most of the programs and activities in the bill are funded through regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations.
4. The House-passed FY2018 THUD bill would provide $115.3 billion for THUD, a reduction of less than 1% from FY2017, while the Senate-reported bill would provide $119.1 billion, an increase of just over 2% over FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested $9.7 billion less than FY2017 for THUD programs.
5. The largest source of budgetary savings for the THUD subcommittees is generally HUD's FHA insurance fund, with estimates changing yearly based on factors such as the housing market, the economy, and changes to FHA's fee structure.",1
546,"1. The U.S. and India have established a ""global partnership"" with increased cooperation in various fields, but India has maintained its positive relations with Iran, with which it has historical and civilizational ties.
2. The U.S. seeks to isolate Iran and ensure its nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes, while India has never shared this assessment of Iran as a regional threat.
3. India and Iran have a ""strategic partnership"" and cooperate in areas such as energy, trade, and defense, but this is not a strategic alliance and is unlikely to derail U.S.-India ties.
4. India is unlikely to abandon its relationship with Iran due to its interest in maintaining positive ties, especially in energy commerce, but may bring its Iran policy into closer alignment with the U.S.
5. There are concerns in Congress about India's relations with Iran, including defense relations and energy commerce, with some seeking to link this with U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation.
6. Indian firms have taken long-term contracts for purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and India supports proposed construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan, which the U.S. opposes.
7. Some analysts believe that geostrategic motives, including great power aspirations, drive India's pursuit of closer relations with Iran.
8. India has voted with the U.S. in the IAEA on resolutions finding Iran in noncompliance with its international obligations, causing criticism from Indian opposition parties and independent analysts.
9. There have been occasional revelations of Indian transfers to Iran of technology that could be useful for Iran's purported weapons of mass destruction programs, for which some Indian persons have been sanctioned by the U.S.",1
547,"1. The importation of milk protein concentrates (MPCs) has been a topic of interest in Congress due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes in 2009. MPCs are derived from raw milk and are used in various food products, animal feed, and industrial products. Currently, U.S. imports of MPCs have limited or no trade restrictions while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas.
2. Advocates for stricter import controls on MPCs argue that it would prevent the unlimited importation of milk protein, encourage the use of domestically produced protein, and raise milk prices for dairy farmers. However, opponents argue that it would increase their costs and result in higher retail food prices. Additionally, major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports.
3. The U.S. produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates, and some dairy economists suggest that federal dairy policies have encouraged the production of nonfat dry milk at the expense of milk protein concentrate or casein. U.S. imports of dairy products, including MPCs and casein/caseinates, were valued at just over $3 billion in 2008 and represented 35% of total import value. Dairy imports are modest relative to domestic production, but constraints on dairy product imports are needed to maintain the integrity of the domestic dairy program.",1
548,"1. In 2000, democratic parties defeated Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, marking the end of a regime responsible for bloody conflicts, economic decline, and international isolation in the 1990s. Serbia's new rulers embarked on a transition towards democratic and free market standards, but progress has been uneven.
2. Serbia has held largely free and fair elections, adopted a new constitution, and made progress in fighting organized crime and corruption. However, the global economic crisis and high-level corruption have posed challenges. Serbia's key foreign policy goal is integration into the European Union, but prospects have been clouded by concerns over relations with Kosovo.
3. Serbia's most recent parliamentary, presidential, and local elections were held in May 2012. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won the majority of seats in the parliament, while the Democratic Party (DS) and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) formed the second and third largest groups. Tomislav Nikolic from the SNS won the presidential election, defeating incumbent President Tadic.
4. The formation of a new government was difficult, with former President Tadic initially set to head the government as Prime Minister. However, the Socialists decided to form a government with the Progressives and the United Regions of Serbia instead, with Socialist leader Ivica Dacic becoming Prime Minister.
5. Serbia's economic crisis remains the key problem for the government, but the government has boosted its popularity by launching an anti-corruption drive. The powers of the Serbian presidency are modest, but Nikolic's victory has strengthened the hand of the Progressives in the government.
6. Serbia's relations with Kosovo have been a major challenge, with Belgrade opposing Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008. After the ICJ ruled in July 2010 that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not contravene international law, Serbia agreed to hold talks with Kosovo under EU mediation. In April 2013, Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci initialed a ""First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalization of Relations"" between Kosovo and Serbia.",1
549,"1. The Supreme Court decided four search and seizure cases during its October 2012 term, including Florida v. Jardines, Florida v. Harris, Bailey v. United States, and Missouri v. McNeely.
2. The Court in Jardines held that a dog sniff at the front door of a suspected grow house by a trained narcotics-detection dog is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause.
3. The Court in Harris held that an alert by a trained drug-detection dog is sufficient to establish probable cause for a search of a vehicle.
4. The Court in Bailey held that the detention of an individual who has just left premises to be searched under warrant is permissible when the individual is detained out of view of the house as soon as possible.
5. The Court in McNeely held that the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream does not present a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases.
6. The Supreme Court has previously held that a dog sniff is not a Fourth Amendment search, but the Court in Jardines distinguished this case based on the ""expectation of privacy rationale"" and the ""property intrusion"" rationale.
7. In Jardines, Miami-Dade Police received an anonymous tip that Jardines was growing marijuana in his house, and a trained drug-detection dog alerted to the presence of drugs on the front porch.
8. The Florida Supreme Court held that the use of a drug-sniffing dog on Jardines's front porch constituted a search and that such a search required probable cause before it could be conducted.
9. The dissenters in Jardines contended that the majority opinion conflicted with binding United States Supreme Court precedent, but the majority relied on the Jones decision, which held that a Fourth Amendment search occurs whenever the government physically intrudes upon constitutionally protected property.
10. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Florida Supreme Court's decision in Harris, holding that the court had disregarded the Fourth Amendment's ad hoc, totality-of-the-circumstances standard and imposed evidentiary requirements that could readily be employed to ensure that the police rely on drug-detection dogs",1
550,"1. The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is responsible for supporting a more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure. OE's mission includes supporting electric grid modernization and resiliency through research and development (R&D), demonstration projects, partnerships, facilitation, modeling and analytics, and emergency preparedness and response.
2. The U.S. energy infrastructure is diverse and interdependent, consisting of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically. Key challenges facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure, modernizing and securing communication networks, accommodating new end-use technologies, planning for increased interdependencies of natural gas, water, and electricity systems, and devising business models to manage these challenges while providing reliable and affordable electricity.
3. OE's FY2016 funding was divided into two main areas: about 80% for R&D on technology development and about 20% for a variety of planning and operational areas. OE's goal for the future grid is to support economic growth and energy innovation through delivery of reliable, affordable, and clean electricity to consumers where, when, and how they want it.
4. The DOE's 2015 Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan outlines a vision for a future electric grid that provides a critical platform for U.S. prosperity, competitiveness, and innovation by delivering reliable, affordable, and clean electricity to consumers where they want it, when they want it, how they want it. To help achieve this vision, DOE aims at three key national targets: a 10% reduction in the economic costs of power outages by 2025, a 33% decrease in the cost of reserve margins while maintaining reliability by 2025, and a 50% decrease in the net integration costs of distributed energy resources by 2025.
5. OE's FY2017 budget request aimed to support the Obama Administration's ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy and emphasized priorities that increase electric grid resilience through managing risks, increasing system flexibility and robustness, increasing visualization and situational awareness, and",1
551,"1. The creation of memorials in the District of Columbia has evolved over time, with the first equestrian statue of George Washington authorized in 1783. However, it wasn't until 1986 that statutory criteria for authorizing commemorative works were established with the Commemorative Works Act.
2. Prior to the Commemorative Works Act, Congress authorized memorials and established site location and design approval processes. Special commissions, such as the Lincoln Memorial Commission and the Jefferson Memorial Commission, were given authority to select a location for the memorial.
3. The Commemorative Works Act was enacted in 1986 to guide the memorial creation process in the District of Columbia, preserving the integrity of the comprehensive design of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans, ensuring continued public use and enjoyment of open space, and maintaining the limited open space available to residents and visitors.
4. The creation of the District of Columbia in 1790, with the Residency Act, designated a 10-square-mile district for the permanent seat of government. Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant was chosen as the city's architect and worked to provide symbolic separation between Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court.
5. The original boundaries of the District of Columbia extended beyond the federal city, including modern-day Alexandria, Virginia, and Arlington County. In 1846, Congress returned Alexandria to Virginia due to lack of necessity and hesitation in locating new public buildings and memorials.
6. The McMillan Commission was established in 1901 to review and create a new comprehensive plan for the District of Columbia, examining questions related to public buildings, park spaces, and recreation. The commission's plan, while not fully implemented, laid the foundation for additional studies and plans for further development in the District of Columbia.
7. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was amended in 1991 and 1993 to extend the time required to complete a commemorative work and to further extend the legislative authority of certain memorials, such as the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation, Women in Military Service for America Memorial, and the National Peace Garden. The CWA also includes provisions on accountability for fundraisers to ensure the public's trust is not abused.",1
552,"1. The Senate Finance Committee approved the America's Healthy Future Act of 2009 (S. 1796) on October 19, 2009, which includes provisions to reform the private health insurance market, set minimum standards for health benefits, and provide financial assistance to certain individuals and small employers. The bill would require individuals to maintain health insurance and impose a tax on certain employers with more than 50 employees who do not provide coverage. Market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would be implemented, and existing plans offered by employers and in the individual market would be grandfathered. New plans could be sold in both the individual and group market outside of an exchange, but only those that meet the minimum requirements specified in the bill would satisfy the requirements for individuals and employers.
2. S. 1796 would also establish a health insurance exchange, through which Health Care Cooperatives and premium subsidies would only be offered. Certain individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level could qualify for credits toward their premium costs and subsidies towards their cost-sharing. States would be provided the flexibility to establish basic plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. Title VI includes a number of provisions to raise revenues to pay for expanded health insurance coverage, including excise taxes and limitations on executive compensation of insurance companies, as well as limitations on contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and other itemized deductions used for health care expenses.",1
553,"1. High risk health insurance pools (HRPs) are established by 35 states to provide health insurance coverage to individuals who cannot obtain or afford health insurance in the private market due to preexisting health conditions.
2. HRPs cover individuals who have been denied coverage, received high premium quotes, or received offers with preexisting condition exclusions in the individual market.
3. HRPs also help states comply with HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions, which require insurers to offer coverage to eligible individuals moving from the group to nongroup market without excluding coverage for preexisting conditions.
4. In 2008, approximately 200,000 individuals were enrolled in HRPs, while nearly 4 million additional persons were potentially eligible.
5. HRPs target individuals with preexisting health conditions who do not have access to public or group health insurance and seek coverage in the private, non-group market.
6. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a temporary high risk pool program before 2014 for certain individuals with preexisting health conditions who have been uninsured for six or more months.
7. In the private health insurance market, most people receive health coverage through the group market, which provides health benefits to groups of people drawn together by an employer or other organization.
8. In the nongroup market, applicants must undergo rigorous medical underwriting, and some are rejected, receive insurance offers with riders that exclude coverage for specific health conditions, or are charged higher premiums.
9. HRPs appeal to policymakers who prefer an incremental approach to coverage expansion and rely on current state oversight of health insurance. Supporters argue that HRPs help stabilize the market, promote competition, and retain insurance carriers.
10. Critics contend that HRPs are generally too small and underfunded to meet the needs of the majority of persons who cannot access health insurance in the private market, and that consumer groups generally advocate for expansion of the federal role in providing coverage.",1
554,"1. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a program that was created in 1951 to support the Department of Defense's (DOD) airlift requirements in emergencies. It is a partnership between the DOD and U.S. airline industry, and currently has 35 carriers with 1,262 aircraft enrolled. The CRAF has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into domestic and Alaskan sections.
2. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) contained three provisions that affected the CRAF. First, it called for a comprehensive and independent assessment of CRAF to examine current and long-range issues associated with the program and make specific recommendations for preserving and improving it. The assessment was required to be delivered to congressional defense committees no later than April 2008. Second, it extended authorization of the Aviation Insurance Program (AIP) from March 30, 2008, to December 30, 2103. As part of the AIP, the FAA offers a non-premium insurance program to air carriers that participate in the CRAF. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that extending the CRAF program through 2013 would have no significant budgetary impact. Third, it called for a DOD study on the size and mix of the airlift force to specifically include how the CRAF could potentially affect DOD's airlift fleet requirements. This report is expected to be completed by January 2009.",1
555,"1. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is a U.S. Department of Commerce agency that advises on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology policies, represents the executive branch in telecommunications and information policy activities, and manages spectrum used by federal agencies.
2. NTIA's responsibilities include overseeing the transfer of radio frequencies from the federal domain to the commercial domain, administering grants programs, and establishing a $135 million grant program for states to plan for participation in a new nationwide public safety broadband network.
3. NTIA collaborates with other agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), on matters concerning spectrum access, technology, and policy.
4. NTIA has produced a 10-year plan to increase spectrum capacity for mobile broadband by 500 MHz, and has identified bands of spectrum that might be available for commercial wireless broadband service.
5. The NTIA is responsible for working with the FCC to identify specific bands for auction, collecting auction proceeds, and making distributions from a Public Safety Trust Fund through FY2022.
6. The NTIA also has responsibilities to create and support FirstNet in planning, building, and managing a new, nationwide, broadband network for public safety communications.",1
556,"1. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, also known as the ""Electric Reliability Act of 2005,"" was enacted to improve the reliability of the U.S. bulk power system as it undergoes restructuring. It grants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction over activities that support reliability and establishes an electric reliability organization (ERO) to develop and enforce reliability standards, including cybersecurity protection.
2. The ERO can impose penalties on users, owners, or operators of bulk power systems that violate FERC-approved reliability standards. FERC can also enforce penalties for non-compliance. The provision does not allow the ERO or FERC to order the construction of additional generation or transmission capacity.
3. The Secretary of Energy is required to conduct a study of electric transmission congestion every three years and is authorized to issue construction permits in designated congested areas. The Secretary may also use eminent domain to acquire rights-of-way, with just compensation due to property owners.
4. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 is repealed, and a new regulatory regime is established for holding companies. The new law includes provisions for interconnection standards, affiliate transactions, and access to books and records.
5. The law also includes provisions for open access to transmission lines, third-party finance for transmission projects, advanced transmission technologies, and incentive-based transmission rates. It also encourages the use of renewable energy sources and demand response programs.",1
557,"1. The Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) of 1936 was enacted to enable small businesses to compete with larger companies in the purchase of commodities, particularly in the grocery store industry. The law prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality.""
2. The RPA has been enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but its enforcement has been inconsistent. The law has been criticized for having adverse effects on the economy and for limiting the extent of discounting, which has likely caused consumers to pay higher prices than they otherwise would.
3. The RPA provides several affirmative defenses to refute the illegality of differential pricing, including the ""meeting competition"" defense and the ""cost justified"" defense. Additionally, the 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act created a broad exemption from the general price-discrimination prohibition for certain nonprofit institutions.
4. In the mid-1970s, the 94th Congress held hearings on and considered proposals to amend or repeal the RPA, but no legislation was introduced. The Antitrust Modernization Commission recommended in 2007 that Congress should repeal the RPA in its entirety. However, it is not known at this time whether there will be further efforts to modify or repeal the statute.",1
558,"1. The Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires the President to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, but it has been interpreted as both imposing a duty on the President and providing the President with discretion not to enforce certain laws.
2. The President plays a significant role in the legislative process, but once a bill is enacted into law, the President's legislative role ends and is replaced by the President's duty to execute the law.
3. The courts generally will not review Presidential enforcement decisions, including the decision of whether to initiate a criminal prosecution or administrative enforcement action in response to a violation of federal law or regulation.
4. The Take Care Clause prevents the President from simply disregarding or suspending laws enacted by Congress, and it makes a significant contribution to the separation of powers by establishing a clear demarcation of the legitimate powers and responsibilities of both the President and Congress in our constitutional system.
5. The courts have recognized Congress's authority to impose specific duties upon executive branch officials by law, and the official's corresponding obligation to execute the congressional directive. However, the courts have also distinguished between the enforceability of ministerial or mandatory requirements and political acts involving statutory or constitutional discretion.
6. The Supreme Court has held that when an executive officer fails to perform a ""specific duty [] assigned by law,"" the courts may enforce the obligation through a writ of mandamus.
7. The President must be able to oversee those who enforce the law, but Presidential control over law enforcement officers need not be absolute. The courts have recognized that any discretion that may arise from the Take Care Clause would extend only to decisions directly related to the enforcement of federal law upon third parties, and not as a justification for either affirmatively suspending federal law or refusing to comply with explicit mandates or restrictions imposed on the executive branch.",1
559,"1. The official U.S. poverty rate in 2013 was 14.5%, a statistically significant drop from 15.0% in 2012. However, the number of people below the poverty line remained statistically unchanged at 45.3 million. Poverty rates tend to follow the economic cycle, with a strong economy leading to declines in poverty and economic recessions causing poverty rates to rise.
2. The poverty rate among children fell from 21.3% in 2012 to 19.5% in 2013, with an estimated 1.3 million fewer children living in poverty. However, the 2013 child poverty rate is still well above its pre-recession low of 16.9% (2006). Children living in single female-headed families are especially prone to poverty, with nearly half of such children living in poverty in 2013.
3. The Census Bureau's poverty thresholds, which reflect the amount of money individuals or families need to purchase a basket of goods and services deemed as ""minimally adequate,"" have not been updated to reflect changes in living standards since the early 1960s. The ""official"" U.S. poverty measure, which is based on these thresholds, has not changed since it was originally adopted in 1969, except for annual adjustments for overall price changes in the economy. Many experts consider the ""official"" poverty measure to be flawed and outmoded, and the Census Bureau has developed a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) to address some of the perceived flaws of the ""official"" measure.",1
560,"1. The U.S. agricultural sector is significantly affected by trade, with exports accounting for about 20% of total U.S. agricultural production. The U.S. farm bill, which is renewed every five or six years, is subject to scrutiny for compliance with WTO rules and its potential impact on future multilateral negotiations. The 2014 farm bill made substantial changes to the previous farm safety net and most of its agricultural provisions will not expire until September 30, 2018.
2. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) are paramount in governing domestic agricultural support. The AoA sets country-specific aggregate spending limits on the most market-distorting policies and defines general rules covering trade among member countries. The SCM details rules for determining when a subsidy is ""prohibited"" or ""actionable."" The WTO's dispute settlement process may be initiated if a policy or program is found to be in violation of these agreements.
3. The AoA categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs according to their potential to distort commercial markets. Green Box programs are minimally or non-trade distorting and not subject to any spending limits, while Blue Box programs are production-limiting and also exempt from payment limits. Amber Box programs are the most market-distorting and subject to a strict aggregate, annual spending limit. The United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays.
4. The WTO's Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) provides a means for WTO members to resolve disputes arising under WTO agreements. As of April 8, 2015, 492 complaints have been filed under the DSU, with nearly one-half involving the United States as a complainant or defendant. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) represents the United States in WTO disputes.",1
561,"1. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program, the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program are collectively referred to as the ""campus-based"" programs. These programs are unique because the mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined according to institution-specific award criteria.
2. The authorizations of appropriations for the campus-based programs, along with many other provisions under the Higher Education Act of 1965, expired at the end of FY2015. The FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, while the Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017.
3. The campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort, with only 2% of the approximately $125 billion of federal aid made available to students in FY2016 going to these programs.
4. As lawmakers consider reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered, including the extent to which the programs provide types of aid to students that are not provided via other postsecondary aid programs, whether the current formula for allocating funds to institutions is optimal, and the potential role of the campus-based aid programs in a redesigned federal aid system.
5. The Federal Perkins Loan program is the oldest of the campus-based aid programs and was originally enacted under Title II of the National Defense Education Act of 1958. The program authorized participating institutions to award low-interest rate loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students who demonstrated financial need.
6. The FWS program was originally authorized as the College Work Study program under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and was established to stimulate and promote the part-time employment of students in institutions of higher education who are from low-income families and are in need of the earnings from such employment to pursue courses of study at such institutions.",1
562,"1. Adults may go missing due to personal choice, disabling conditions, natural catastrophes, or crimes. Unlike children, adults have the legal right to go missing under most circumstances.
2. Families of missing adults may receive limited assistance from law enforcement agencies in recovering their loved ones, prompting policymakers to consider expanding the federal government's role.
3. The House passed H.R. 632 to establish a grant program for states to establish, expand, and coordinate alert systems for vulnerable adults who may go missing. A companion bill, S. 557, was introduced in the Senate.
4. CRS gathered data on existing state alert systems in 11 states and found that they were established beginning in 2006, administered by local and/or state law enforcement agencies, and intended to alert law enforcement entities and/or the public that vulnerable adults are missing.
5. Alert systems vary by state, but generally have legal authority to establish the systems, target populations (such as those with cognitive or physical disabilities), administrative responsibility with coordination with AMBER Alerts, training of law enforcement agencies, a process for activating alerts, coordination with other states, system costs, use of the systems, and outcomes.
6. Individuals can go missing due to mental or cognitive impairment, developmental disability, physical disability, natural disasters, or voluntary reasons. Persons with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are particularly vulnerable to missing episodes.
7. The federal government has played a role in preventing and identifying missing adults, including the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert grant and Kristen's Act grant program.
8. CRS identified 11 states with alert systems for missing adults and reviewed their authorizing legislation, executive orders, and regulations to obtain program data.
9. States have defined their target populations and processes for activating alerts differently, with most states providing training to state and/or local law enforcement agencies.
10. Most states reported using the alert system, with the number of alerts activated ranging from one to 82 since implementation. Outcomes of the alerts varied, with most individuals found alive but at least one individual found deceased in nearly every state.",1
563,"1. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) FY2017 appropriations include $41.3 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $6.7 billion in funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act, and $163 million in funding for overseas contingency operations. The act also included over $1.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Secret Service in response to a request from the Trump Administration.
2. The FY2017 DHS budget request was presented in a new common appropriations structure (CAS) with four categories of appropriations: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction and Improvement, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee did not use the new structure and instead drafted its annual DHS appropriations bill and report using the same structure as was used in FY2016.
3. The DHS budget is composed of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law and is appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts, while mandatory spending is provided in laws other than appropriations acts and is typically not appropriated each year. The DHS budget features two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and the Coast Guard retired pay accounts (pensions).",1
564,"1. The water supply and water quality infrastructure in the United States has been recognized as potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks, which could cause loss of life, environmental damage, or disruption of vital human services.
2. Water infrastructure systems are interconnected with other critical infrastructure systems, such as electric power and transportation, and damage to one system can have cascading effects on others.
3. Water infrastructure systems include sources of untreated water, dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, treatment facilities, finished water reservoirs, distribution systems, and wastewater collection and treatment facilities. There are approximately 77,000 dams and reservoirs, thousands of miles of pipes and aqueducts, 168,000 public drinking water facilities, and 16,000 publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities in the United States.
4. The federal government owns hundreds of dams and diversion structures, but most water infrastructure is either privately owned or owned by non-federal units of government.
5. The federal government has built many water projects, primarily for irrigation development and flood control, with municipal and industrial water use as an incidental, self-financed, project purpose.
6. The largest federal facilities were built and are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These facilities supply water to millions of people and produce enormous amounts of power.
7. Despite its critical involvement in water projects, the federal government is responsible for only about 5% of the dams whose failure could result in loss of life or significant property damage.
8. Water and wastewater utilities have long made preparing for extreme events a standard practice, but their focus has historically been on natural events rather than manmade threats.
9. Since the 9/11 attacks, federal dam operators have gone on high-alert and implemented additional security measures. Local utilities have primary responsibility to assess their vulnerabilities and prioritize security improvements, but many plans were developed to respond to natural disasters and cyber attacks rather than physical terrorism concerns.",1
565,"1. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III) was amended and reauthorized by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV). Perkins IV authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for FY2007-FY2012 for Perkins Act programs and activities, and it changes the terminology from ""vocational and technical education"" to ""career and technical education"" (CTE).
2. Perkins IV retains the overall structure of the Perkins Act, with Sections 1 through 9 dealing with overarching provisions and Title I, Title II, and Title III authorizing and specifying the central provisions of the act, tech-prep programs, and general provisions related to federal and state administration of the program, respectively. Perkins IV also makes changes in the reservation of funds for certain purposes, such as reducing the amount reserved for assistance for outlying areas and repealing the reservation for incentive grants.
3. Perkins IV makes significant changes in accountability requirements, including changing the core indicators of performance and data reporting, and adding sanctions for failing to meet these requirements. It also changes the distribution of funds for eligible recipients, including requiring states to distribute at least 85% of state grant funds to the local level and specifying how funds must be distributed at the local level. Additionally, Perkins IV adds provisions for the meaningful participation of private school students in CTE programs and activities.",1
566,"1. The federal estate tax is a tax on the estate of a deceased person, while the inheritance tax is paid by the heirs based on what they receive. The federal estate tax is unified with the gift tax, meaning they share a lifetime transfer credit. The unified credit covers an applicable amount of $5,340,000 per individual in 2014.
2. The gross estate includes the value of all property in which the decedent had an interest at the time of death, as well as certain interests in property transferred prior to death. Proceeds from a life insurance policy or the value of property owned jointly with a right of survivorship may also be included.
3. Deductions from the gross estate include estate administration expenses, certain debts and losses, qualified transfers to a surviving spouse, charitable bequests, and state death taxes. The marital deduction allows for the value of all property passing to the decedent's surviving spouse to be deducted.
4. The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is a flat-rate tax set at the highest estate tax rate, currently 40%. It applies to direct skips, taxable terminations, or taxable distributions to a skip person, who is a person assigned to a generation two or more below the transferor's.
5. The GST tax is calculated by determining the taxable amount and applying the applicable rate. The taxable amount for direct skips is the value of the property received by the transferee, while for taxable terminations and distributions, it is determined by including the tax value with the value of the property before applying the tax rate.
6. The GST tax provides a $5,340,000 GST exemption to each individual for generation-skipping transfers during life or at death. The exemption is doubled for married individuals who elect to treat the transfers as made one-half by each spouse. An indirect skip property transfer automatically triggers the GST exemption.",1
567,"1. Border and Transportation Security (BTS) is a critical function in protecting the American people from terrorists and their weapons. The federal government has implemented various programs and policies to achieve this goal, which can be seen as a series of concentric circles or screens, starting from preventive efforts launched outside the country and progressing through other stages as needed.
2. Border management is a complex task, and current programs and policies in place to strengthen the border and facilitate the flow of legitimate people and things can seem overwhelmingly complex. This report addresses the myriad programs and policies that make up the nation's current approach to attaining higher levels of BTS.
3. Congressional concern with terrorism and border security has been manifested following a series of terrorist attacks, starting in the 1990s. The congressional response began with inquiries related to the nature of the terrorist threat and was followed by specific, targeted measures to protect the nation.
4. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated many of the federal agencies responsible for border and transportation security into a single department, creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Directorate of BTS.
5. CBP's function is to secure U.S. borders while facilitating the legitimate flow of people and goods across the border. The Coast Guard aids in securing U.S. ports and waterways, and the TSA is responsible for securing the nation's air system.
6. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the nation has made securing the homeland its primary objective, with border security emerging as a critical stage in achieving this goal.
7. The massive volume of containers that arrive at U.S. ports each year makes it impractical for CBP to inspect every container. In order to focus its limited inspection resources, CBP has launched several initiatives designed to enhance the targeting of high-risk shipments and securing the entire supply chain from point of origin to final destination.
8. The DHS is the primary federal agency responsible for securing the border, with CBP's function being to secure U.S. borders while facilitating the legitimate flow of people and goods across the border. The Coast Guard and the air security component of the TSA also play a role in securing the nation's borders.",1
568,"1. Cabo Verde is a small island nation with historical ties to the United States, located off the coast of Senegal in West Africa. It is slightly larger than Rhode Island and has a population of mixed Portuguese and African descent.
2. The country is known for its democratic governance, high per capita income levels, high literacy rate, and positive social indicators. It is also a transshipment point for Latin American cocaine bound for Europe and a key refueling stopover for trans-Atlantic air traffic.
3. U.S.-Cabo Verdean cooperation focuses on counternarcotics efforts and military professionalization, as well as development projects supported by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). There is also an Open Skies commercial aviation and flight safety and security agreement.
4. Cabo Verde is eligible for tariff preferences under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), although its use of these benefits is minimal. Congressional activity relating to Cabo Verde is generally limited to periodic delegations and meetings between Members and high-level Cabo Verdean officials.
5. Cabo Verde is a volcanic island archipelago with a lack of rain and few natural resources, apart from a large maritime zone and its beaches. It was uninhabited when it was discovered in the 15th century and later colonized by Portugal.
6. The country's location in an 18th- and 19th-century whaling zone made it a key ship resupply and sailor recruiting center for U.S. vessels, giving rise to a long-standing tradition of emigration to the United States. There is a large Cabo Verdean population in New England.
7. Cabo Verde became a democracy in 1991 following increasing demands for a multi-party political system. It has a successful and enduring democratic system, with the MPD and PAICV strongly dominating politics.
8. The country faces some rule of law and human rights challenges, but its record is far better than that of most other African countries. It is classified as a lower-middle-income economy and ranks within the medium tier of human development under the U.N. Human Development Index.
9. Cabo Verde has a high literacy rate and generally high social services and health",1
569,"1. The United States and New Zealand have a long history of cooperation, but their relationship was strained in the 1980s due to New Zealand's nuclear policies. However, recent developments, such as the Wellington Declaration of 2010 and the 2012 Washington Declaration on Defense Cooperation, have greatly improved bilateral defense and security cooperation. The two nations are now close security partners in the Asia Pacific and beyond.
2. The U.S.-New Zealand relationship is underpinned by shared values, including a commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. However, there are also subtle differences in values that can lead to differences of opinion. New Zealand places a high value on independence of action, which is evident in its support for the U.N., close relations with the United States, FTA with China, leadership on climate change and the environment, and anti-nuclear policy. These differences can inform future policy decisions and further develop an enduring Pacific partnership between the two nations.",1
570,"1. The U.S. Constitution's Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to fill vacancies during a Senate recess, but the definition and duration of a ""Recess"" is not explicitly stated.
2. The Adjournment Clause, which restricts the Senate's ability to adjourn for more than three days without House consent, has historically been linked to the Recess Appointments Clause to define a ""Recess"" as longer than three days.
3. The use of pro forma sessions, where the Senate technically remains in session but with no business conducted, has become a point of contention for recess appointments.
4. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the justiciability of the Recess Appointments Clause, but lower courts have considered challenges to presidential appointments made pursuant to the Clause.
5. The unique nature of President Obama's January 2012 recess appointments, made during a three-day recess between pro forma sessions, raises constitutional questions about Congress's use of pro forma sessions and the minimum recess duration for recess appointments.
6. The CFP Act, which established the CFPB, allows the Secretary of the Treasury to perform some of the Bureau's functions until a Director is appointed. The impact of the President's recess appointment of Richard Cordray on both Cordray's and the Secretary's CFPB authorities remains unclear.
7. A court may consider various factors, such as historical practice, the text of the Constitution, and canons of statutory interpretation, when determining the constitutionality of a recess appointment and the scope of a recess appointee's powers.",1
571,"1. Expedited removal is a process established by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 that allows for the swift removal of certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens) who do not meet specified criteria for entry or presence in the United States. This process typically bypasses traditional due process protections, but aliens subject to expedited removal are entitled to certain procedural guarantees, such as the right to written notice of the charge of removability, to seek counsel, to appear at a hearing before an immigration judge, to present evidence, to appeal an adverse decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and to seek judicial review in limited circumstances.
2. Expedited removal applies to arriving aliens who do not have valid entry documents or have attempted to gain their admission by fraud or misrepresentation. These aliens may be summarily removed without a hearing or further review. However, in limited circumstances, an alien subject to expedited removal may be entitled to certain procedural protections before being removed from the United States, such as the ability to express a fear of persecution and seek administrative review of that claim. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also has the authority to expand the use of expedited removal to aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled if they have been in the country for less than two years and do not have valid entry documents or have attempted to gain their admission by fraud or misrepresentation. In practice, expedited removal has been used primarily for arriving aliens and aliens who have recently entered the country without authorization and are found near the border.",1
572,"1. The Supreme Court's decision in Baker v. Carr in 1962 allowed for constitutional challenges to redistricting plans, which significantly shaped how congressional districts are drawn. Recent and pending Supreme Court cases continue to impact the process of congressional redistricting.
2. The Constitution requires that each congressional district within a state contain approximately the same population, known as the ""equality standard"" or the principle of ""one person, one vote."" This requirement applies to both congressional and state legislative redistricting.
3. Congressional districts must comply with the Voting Rights Act (VRA), which prohibits any voting qualification or practice that results in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote based on race, color, or membership in a language minority. The VRA requires that electoral processes be equally open to participation by members of a racial or language minority group.",1
573,"1. Wildfire seasons have become more severe in the past decade, leading to increased funding and debate on fire protection programs. The National Fire Plan was enacted in 2000 to increase funding for protecting federal, state, and private lands, and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act was enacted in 2003 to expedite fuel reduction on federal lands and authorize other forest protection programs. The FLAME Act was enacted in 2009 to insulate other agency programs from high wildfire suppression costs. Wildfire funding has remained at high levels since 2000 and now constitutes a significant portion of land management agency budgets.
2. Federal wildfire protection programs fall into three categories: protection of federal lands managed by the Forest Service and Department of the Interior, protection of non-federal lands through programs to assist state and local governments and communities, and fire research, facilities, and improvements in forest health. Despite increased funding, the high costs of firefighting continue to attract attention. Issues associated with high wildfire costs include the impact on other agency programs and pending legislation. The Forest Service was created in 1905 with a focus on halting wildfires in national forests, and aggressive fire control policies were developed in the following decades. However, these policies began to be questioned in the 1970s due to the ecological benefits of wildfires in some situations. Concerns about fuel loads and catastrophic fires leading to spiraling suppression costs led to the establishment of the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters in 1994. The Clinton Administration directed a review of federal fire policy, and the recommended change to alter federal fire policy from priority for private property to equal priority for private property and federal resources became effective in 1995.",1
574,"1. Social Security coverage is extended to state and local government employees through ""Section 218 Agreements"" between a state and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Currently, all states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have a voluntary Section 218 Agreement with SSA.
2. Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all state and local government employees hired in the future have been part of the Social Security policy debate for many years. Mandatory coverage of newly hired state and local government employees is projected to result in a net increase in payroll tax revenues to the Social Security system.
3. The Bipartisan Policy Center and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform have recommended that all newly hired state and local government employees be covered under the Social Security system to increase the universality of the program and improve the coordination of benefits for current workers.
4. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects that Social Security expenditures will exceed total income starting in 2023, and that trust fund assets will be exhausted in 2036. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary estimates that, if mandatory coverage were implemented in 2011, it would close 9% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall and extend the projected trust fund exhaustion date to 2040.
5. Opponents of mandatory Social Security coverage argue that it would not necessarily result in better benefit protections for workers because state and local governments could reduce some pension benefits currently available under non-covered pension plans to keep overall pension costs down.
6. Mandatory Social Security coverage could result in better benefit protections for workers and their families through the provision of dependents' and survivors' benefits under Social Security, which are generally not available under state and local pension plans. However, the net effect on a worker's total benefits would depend in part on how state and local governments modify their existing non-covered pension plans in response to mandatory coverage.",1
575,"1. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is a federal program that provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to foreign competition.
2. TAA was created in 1962 and has been reauthorized multiple times, most recently in 2015 by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act (TAARA).
3. TAA provides benefits such as funding for training and reemployment services, income support, and a tax credit for health insurance premiums.
4. TAA is jointly administered by the federal government and the states, and is funded by mandatory appropriations.
5. To be eligible for TAA, a group of workers must establish that their job loss was attributable to foreign trade and meets statutory criteria.
6. Eligible workers can receive training and reemployment services, income support, and a tax credit for health insurance premiums.
7. TAA training programs can include occupational skills training, remedial training, on-the-job training, and customized training.
8. TAA funding may be the only source of funding for a worker's training costs, but other resources can be used in pursuit of TAA-funded training.
9. TAA also provides case management and employment services, job search and relocation allowances, and Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) payments to certified workers who have exhausted their UC benefits and are enrolled in training.
10. TAA is subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended.",1
576,"1. The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) was established in 2004, offering supplemental dental and vision benefits to federal employees, Members of Congress, annuitants, and dependents.
2. Enrollees are responsible for 100% of the premiums, and OPM does not review disputed claims. Eligible individuals may enroll in a FEDVIP plan during the standard open season for FEHB plans or following a qualifying life event.
3. There are four nationwide dental plans and three vision plans available, with varying premiums based on plan, family members, and residency (for dental plans only). Active employees pay FEDVIP premiums on a pre-tax basis, but annuitants, survivor annuitants, or compensationers do not have this option.
4. While there are no preexisting condition exclusions, there are waiting periods for orthodontia. Enrollees must be in the same plan for the entire waiting period, and switching to a new plan may require beginning the waiting period over again.
5. For 2008, the four nationwide dental plans are Aetna, GEHA, MetLife, and United Concordia, with monthly self-only premiums ranging from $22.71 to $37.90. The three vision plans are FEP BlueVision, Spectera, and Vision Service Plans, with annual self-only coverage ranging from $71.76 to $103.20.
6. FEDVIP enrollees may use in-network services to pay less out-of-pocket. Coverage and premiums vary by plan, with differences in benefits and network limitations among vision plans.
7. Prospective enrollees should consider their current FEHB plan coverage, likelihood of using services, and potential benefits against premiums before deciding to enroll in FEDVIP. Both FEDVIP premiums and FSA contributions are pre-tax for employees.",1

578,"1. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) Act, which was first enacted in 1999, requires meat packers to report prices and other information on purchases of livestock and meat to the USDA. The act was reauthorized in 2015 for another five years, until September 30, 2020. Before the LMR Act was enacted, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price and related market information from meat packers on a voluntary basis. However, by the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone significant changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, more production specialization, and more vertical integration. These changes led to fewer animals being sold through negotiated sales and more sales under alternative marketing arrangements, with prices not publicly disclosed or reported. As a result, some livestock producers called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat.
2. The LMR Act mandates price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine, and allows the USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales. The act also authorizes appropriations as necessary and requires the USDA to implement regulations no later than 180 days after the law was enacted. Mandatory price reporting was authorized for five years, until September 30, 2004. The USDA issued a final rule on December 1, 2000, and implemented the rule on April 2, 2001. The implementation of mandatory reporting did not affect the continuation of the AMS voluntary price-reporting program. AMS continues to publish prices from livestock auctions, and feeder cattle and pig sales, through voluntary-based market news reports.",1
579,"1. A sitting Member of the United States Senate who is indicted for or convicted of a felony is not subject to any immediate consequences with respect to their congressional status, as there is no federal statute, constitutional provision, or Rule of the Senate that directly affects their service or forfeits their rights or privileges. However, internal party rules in the Senate, such as the Senate Republican Conference Rules, may require an indicted Member to temporarily step aside from leadership or chairmanship positions.
2. Conviction of certain crimes may subject Senators to internal legislative disciplinary proceedings, including resolutions of censure or expulsion from the Senate upon approval of two-thirds of the Members. Expulsion does not result in the forfeiture of one's federal pension, but a Member's conviction of certain crimes may lead to the forfeiture of retirement annuities or the loss of creditable service towards a federal pension. Indictment and/or conviction of a crime that is a felony does not constitutionally disqualify one from being a Member of Congress, unless a Member's conviction is for certain treasonous conduct committed after taking an oath of office.
3. The Senate has significant discretion to discipline misconduct that the membership finds to be worthy of censure, reprimand, or expulsion from Congress. The most severe sanction of expulsion has historically involved either disloyalty to the United States or the violation of a criminal law involving the abuse of one's official position. The Senate has expressed reticence to exercise the power of expulsion for conduct in a prior Congress when a Senator has been elected or reelected to the Senate after the Member's conviction, with knowledge of the misconduct. No Senator or Representative has ever been recalled in the history of the United States, and the Constitution does not provide for or authorize the recall of any United States officials.",1
580,"1. The majority of the 766 million acres of forestlands in the United States are privately owned (58%).
2. The Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides assistance programs for nonfederal forest landowners, primarily administered through the State and Private Forestry (SPF) branch.
3. Providing federal assistance for nonfederal forest landowners has been a component of USDA's programs for over a century.
4. The FS has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance.
5. Most forestry assistance programs are administered by the FS but implemented by state partners, with the FS providing technical and financial aid.
6. To be eligible for most programs, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, consisting of an assessment and a long-term strategy for addressing threats to forest resources.
7. The forestry programs may provide technical assistance, financial assistance, or both.
8. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, with an average annual appropriation of $362.7 million from FY2004 through FY2018.
9. The Administration requested $197.4 million in FY2019 and proposed to eliminate funding for seven of the programs and decreased funding for the others.
10. Some activities authorized by unfunded or repealed forestry assistance programs may continue to be performed or provided by FS through other authorizations or funding sources.",1
581,"1. Burma is a major source of transnational crime, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal trade in gems, timber, and wildlife, generating several billion dollars annually. The country's extra-legal economy is so large that an accurate assessment of the size and structure of the economy is unavailable. Corruption among officials in the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), facilitates trafficking and provides immunity from law enforcement and judicial action.
2. Burma's border regions share many features of ungoverned spaces, with difficult physical terrain, ethnic tensions, and cease-fire agreements that have provided autonomy to criminal groups. The UWSA, SSA-S, SSA-N, DBKA, and other armed groups have criminal networks that stretch from India to Malaysia and up into China. Many of these groups are linked to past or ongoing ethnic insurgencies and are nearly immune from SPDC interference due to collusion with junta military, police, and political officials.
3. The SPDC and Burmese officials, especially army and police personnel in the border areas, are widely believed to be involved in the smuggling of goods and drugs, money laundering, and corruption. Burma is reported to be the third-most corrupt country in the world, and its weak implementation of anti-money laundering controls remains at the root of the continued use by narcotics traffickers and other criminal elements of Burmese financial institutions.
4. The most frequent destinations for Burmese contraband are China and Thailand, but demand reaches beyond the region, including the United States. Ready recruits for organized crime activities can be found in both urban ghettos and impoverished rural areas, with 27% of Burma's population living below the poverty line. Burma is party to all three major United Nations international drug control treaties but has not achieved its goal of ending all production and trafficking of illegal drugs by 2014.",1
582,"1. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has significantly impacted federal mandatory spending, with most of the projected spending going towards expanding health insurance coverage through premium tax credits, cost-sharing reduction payments, and federal matching funds for Medicaid programs. The IRS reported that spending on premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions totaled $79.2 billion for the first three fiscal years of ACA exchanges. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that, in 2014, 27 states spent a total of $36.7 billion on newly eligible adults and an additional $10.5 billion on previously eligible adults under the ACA's Medicaid expansion.
2. The ACA also included mandatory appropriations and Medicare trust fund transfers, totaling $100 billion over the 10-year period FY2010-FY2019. These funds supported various programs, including the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF). However, several of these programs have faced funding reductions or rescissions through various legislative actions since 2012. The ACA appropriations, in general, are fully sequestrable at the percentage rate applicable to nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending, with the exception of federal spending on insurance expansion coverage.",1
583,"1. The increasing number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and in the scientific workforce has been a concern in the scientific community. The number of foreign students in these programs has exceeded the enrollment of U.S. citizens.
2. Foreign students use U.S. graduate education programs as stepping stones to immigration through sponsorships for legal permanent residence. In 2008, approximately 15.0% of those individuals awarded legal permanent resident status resulted from employment-based preferences.

584,"1. The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Energy and Water Development (E&W) Appropriations bill provides funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which supports renewable energy and energy efficiency technology research, development, and implementation.
2. The President's FY2018 budget request seeks $28.2 billion for DOE, a 9.5% decrease from FY2017, with nearly half of the reduction coming from EERE programs. The request includes eliminating the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program.
3. EERE is organized into four offices: Transportation, Renewable Power, Energy Efficiency, and Operations. It focuses on high-impact activities, collaborating with industry, academia, national laboratories, and others to develop technology-specific roadmaps.
4. EERE funding is provided from the annual E&W appropriations bill, with approximately 30% going to sustainable transportation, 35% to energy efficiency, 23% to renewable energy, and 12% to corporate support.
5. The President's FY2018 budget request for EERE is $636 million, a 70% decrease from FY2017, focusing on early-stage R&D and increased reliance on the private sector for later-stage research, development, and commercialization.
6. Both the House and Senate versions of the E&W Appropriations bill provide more funding for EERE than the Administration's request, with H.R. 3219 allocating $1.086 billion and S. 1609 allocating $1.9 billion.
7. Both bills support continued funding for programs the Administration's request would terminate, such as SuperTruck II, Clean Cities, and commercial off-road vehicle sector efforts.
8. Both H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 would provide appropriations for FY2018 above the Administration's request for sustainable transportation, renewable energy, energy efficiency, advanced manufacturing, building technologies, and various research programs.",1
585,"1. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin, are a type of electronic payment system that uses a network of computers to validate transactions instead of a single third-party intermediary.
2. Cryptocurrency platforms often use blockchain technology to validate changes to the ledgers and prevent invalid alteration or manipulation of the public ledger.
3. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide benefits to the public and the economic system as a whole, such as reduced costs for international money transfers and payments, and an alternative payment system for individuals who do not trust traditional financial institutions.
4. However, cryptocurrencies also face challenges to widespread adoption, such as high energy consumption, lack of trust in decentralized networks, and the need for a trusted third-party intermediary in certain transactions.
5. Cryptocurrencies are currently subject to certain risks, including the potential for use in criminal activity and the lack of consumer protections for parties buying or using cryptocurrency.
6. Law enforcement has the ability to investigate criminal finances using the immutable, public ledger of accounts and transactions on cryptocurrency platforms.
7. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats virtual currencies as property, meaning users owe taxes on any realized gains whenever they dispose of virtual currency, including when they use it to purchase goods and services.",1

The report discusses the FY2016 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components included in the first title of the homeland security appropriations bill, labeled as ""Departmental Management and Operations."" This includes the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, the DHS headquarters consolidation project, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Analysis and Operations, and the Office of Inspector General for the department.
2. The Administration requested $1,396 million for these accounts in FY2016, an increase of $255 million (22.3%) above the FY2015 enacted level. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $1,346 million, a decrease of $73 million (5.2%) from the request and $182 million (16.0%) above FY2015. The House-reported bill would have provided $1,217 million, a decrease of $178 million (12.8%) from the request, but $76 million (6.7%) above FY2015.
3. The report also includes information on provisions throughout the proposed bills and reports that directly affect these functions, and tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, with particular attention paid to discretionary funding amounts.
4. The DHS headquarters consolidation project is a $3.4 billion plan to create a new DHS headquarters on the grounds of St. Elizabeths in Anacostia, reducing its cost and size through efficiencies, faster completion, altering the mix of component headquarters that would move to the campus, and consolidating FEMA's headquarters to the West Campus rather than the East Campus of St. Elizabeths.
5. The Administration requested $204 million and $380 million, respectively, as the FY2016 tranche of design and construction funding to support the new enhanced plan for DHS headquarters consolidation. Section 537 of Senate-reported S. 1619 includes $212 million for DHS headquarters and mission support consolidation, $4 million (1.9%) below the amount requested through DHS, and $164 million (33",0
588,"1. The text discusses the distinction between net job loss and gross job loss in the US labor market. Net job loss is the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains, while gross job loss is the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting firms in a given period.
2. The BLS data shows that gross job loss and gains are each around 20 times higher than net job loss in any given quarter, and this is true in both expansions and recessions. Economists view net job loss as detrimental, but gross job loss as a healthy and normal part of a functioning market economy.
3. The text also highlights the importance of the U.S. labor market's high mobility, with labor rapidly shifting from firm to firm to its most efficient use, which is essential for economic growth and rising living standards.
4. The text notes that while gross job loss can translate into net job loss at the local level, steady net employment gains are unambiguously good for society as a whole. However, the data does not necessarily indicate that the same individuals who lose jobs also gain jobs, nor whether the job loss is voluntary or involuntary.
5. The text also discusses the impact of trade on job loss, stating that while trade expansion causes gross job loss, it has no effect on net employment. The historical experience shows that trade liberalization has no effect on net employment, as employment has steadily increased during the post-war period, and the unemployment rate has mirrored the business cycle, not trade patterns.
6. The text concludes by stating that public policies to protect workers against the risks posed by gross job loss can be justified on both social and economic grounds. If crafted properly, they have been shown not to reduce gross job gains, and they can arguably raise efficiency by addressing market failures. The challenge for policymakers going forward is to find the right balance between mitigating risk and maintaining market dynamism in an increasingly fluid labor market.",1

2. Abe's next electoral test will be in July 2019, when half the seats of Japan's Upper House of the bicameral legislature will be chosen. The LDP's approval ratings are high and the disarray of Japan's opposition parties suggests that the LDP will maintain its majority.
3. Abe's government has prioritized improving relations with China and has reversed its initial opposition to China's Belt and Road Initiative. Japan and China have established a hotline for senior defense officials and have sought to manage tensions in the security realm.
4. Japan's relations with South Korea remain precarious due to historical grievances, particularly regarding Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula and the issue of Korean comfort women. The Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force pulled out of an international fleet review in South Korea in early October 2018 after being asked to refrain from hoisting its ensign.
5. The conflict in the East China Sea over the Senkaku Islands has been a source of tension between Japan and China. China has regularly deployed maritime law enforcement ships near the islands and has escalated tensions by locking its fire-control radar on Japanese vessels.
6. Japan has been a key actor in addressing the North Korean threat and has pursued a hardline policy, including a virtual embargo on all bilateral trade and vocal leadership at the United Nations to punish Pyongyang for its human rights abuses and military provocations.
7. The Abe Administration's foreign policy has displayed elements of both power politics and an emphasis on democratic values, international laws, and norms. Japan has prioritized enhancing its ability to counter gray zone activities in disputed waters in the East and South China Seas.",1
590,"1. The medical care provided to noncitizens in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized in congressional hearings and the press, leading to increased interest in detainee health care and the introduction of related legislation. The appropriate standard of health care for foreign nationals in immigration detention is a topic of debate.
2. ICE's National Detention Standards outline the medical care required for detainees, and the Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS) is responsible for detainee health care. However, there have been complaints about access to medical care and reports of substandard care, including the negligent death of a detainee.
3. ICE has the authority to detain aliens while awaiting removal decisions and mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention. The majority of aliens arriving without proper documentation are quickly returned to their country of origin, but some asylum seekers and other detainees may be held for extended periods.
4. ICE contracts with private companies for annual inspections of detention facilities and has established a Detention Facilities Inspection Group (DFIG) for oversight. The DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package (CSP) outlines the health care services available to detainees, primarily for emergency care, but there have been reports of difficulties getting necessary medical care, including biopsies and dental treatment.",1

The MCA is administered by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which is overseen by a Board of Directors chaired by the Secretary of State.
2. To be eligible for MCA funding, countries must pass certain hurdles in areas such as ruling justly, investing in people, and promoting economic freedom. These hurdles are measured by 16 indicators, which have been chosen for their relationship with economic growth and poverty reduction.
3. The MCA is intended to be a performance-driven program, with countries being selected based on their past and current performance. This is a departure from previous aid programs, which often based allocations on promises of future policy changes.

2. The Inland Waterway System (IWS) is a 12,000-mile network of fuel-taxed federal waterways managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, handling approximately half of all inland waterway freight.
3. The Corps develops, operates, and maintains the infrastructure of these commercial waterways, and also maintains and regulates the channel depths through dredging and water management.
4. Costs for maintenance and construction on inland waterways are funded by the Corps (through appropriations) and the commercial user industry (through user fees paid to the federal government).
5. The current revenue source, a set tax on fuel agreed to in the mid-1980s, is insufficient to cover the nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures on inland waterways, resulting in federal taxpayers covering more than half of these costs in some years.
6. Recent proposals include increasing the existing fuel tax, implementing lock usage fees, and increasing the overall federal share for inland waterway costs. The user industry has also proposed a plan that includes increases to the existing fuel tax in combination with an increase in the overall federal share for inland waterway costs.",1
594,"1. Congress has used commemoratives to express gratitude, dramatize virtues, perpetuate remembrance of events, and name buildings, scholarships, and historic sites. Commemorative options are divided into legislative and nonlegislative actions.
2. Legislative options require passage of a bill or resolution and include naming federal buildings, designing postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding Congressional Gold Medals, creating monuments and memorials, designating commemorative observances, establishing federal holidays, and requesting presidential proclamations.
3. Nonlegislative options include creating individual office awards, giving floor speeches, sending official letters, and ordering flags, and do not require legislative approval.
4. Since the 1960s, initiatives have been undertaken to reduce the number of commemoratives proposed through legislation due to concerns about excessive legislative time spent on commemorative measures.
5. Several legislative options exist to honor individuals, groups, and historic events, including naming post offices or other federal buildings, which requires an act of Congress. House and Senate committees have specific rules or guidance associated with commemoratives.
6. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) issues commemorative stamps and semipostal stamps at its own discretion, and legislation directing USPS to issue a stamp is occasionally introduced. Commemorative coins are produced by the U.S. Mint pursuant to an act of Congress.",1

COMPETES 2010 reauthorized selected provisions of the 2007 America COMPETES Act.
2. The President's FY2013 budget request sought increased funding for the doubling path accounts but included support for few COMPETES 2010 authorized STEM education programs. Of the new programs with defined funding authorizations in COMPETES 2010, only the Regional Innovation Program (RIP) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) was specifically included in the Administration's FY2013 budget request.
3. The President's FY2013 budget request for NIST was $857.0 million, including $648.0 million for the core laboratories account and $60.0 million for the construction account. The President did not seek funding for the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program or activities authorized by the NIST Green Jobs Act.

596,"1. The Lacey Act, enacted in 1900, regulates the trade of wildlife and plants and creates penalties for a broad spectrum of violations. It was amended in 2008 to include nonindigenous plants and violations of foreign laws pertaining to certain conservation actions and other activities involving plants and plant products. The Lacey Act now makes it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state, or any foreign law, that protects plants or that regulates taking or exporting plants and plant products in certain situations. This includes plants taken, possessed, transported, or sold without the payment of appropriate royalties, taxes, or stumpage fees; and plants exported in violation of state or foreign law.
2. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act also expanded the definition of a plant to include any plants (including foreign plants), whereas before it referred only to plants indigenous to any state or associated commonwealths, territories, or possessions of the United States. A plant is specifically defined as ""any wild member of the plant kingdom, including roots, seeds, parts, or products thereof, and including trees from either natural or planted forest stands."" There are certain exclusions to this definition of plants, including common cultivars (except trees), common food crops, scientific specimens of plant genetic material to be used for laboratory or field research, and any plant that is to remain planted or be planted or replanted. The 2008 amendments also require importers of all covered plants and plant products to submit an import declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the time of importation. The law requires that the declaration contain certain information, such as identification of the species and genus of plants or plants used in a product, and country of origin of plants, among other things. The declaration appears to apply to all plants and plant products, including those plants harvested or plant products made before the enactment of 2008 amendments.
3. The primary aims of the 2008 amendments were to reduce illegal logging and to increase the value of U.S. wood exports. International illegal",0

Between 1973 and 1995, deficiency payments linked to target prices were a common form of assistance. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 ended these payments and introduced fixed production flexibility contract (PFC) payments, which were not linked to current production or prices. However, marketing assistance loans continued to be provided, with farmers able to pledge their stored commodities as collateral for a USDA nonrecourse commodity loan after harvest. The loan rate is based on a per-unit rate, and farmers can repay the loan at a lower rate when market prices are lower than the loan rate, with the difference constituting the federal subsidy.
2. The 1996 FAIR Act anticipated that PFC payments, when combined with market earnings, would provide sufficient income to producers. However, by the late 1990s, major commodity prices had declined, and farmers relied heavily on marketing loan benefits. In response, Congress supplemented the benefits with additional emergency ""market loss payments"" in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) of 2002 provides new long-term counter-cyclical support for grains and cotton, replacing annual PFC payments with fixed, direct payments to farmers. The measure also maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments, with changes in most loan rates. The new law brings soybeans and minor oilseeds fully under the support program rules that apply to grains and cotton. Fixed payments and target price deficiency payments will be paid on 85% of each farm's base production, with farmers able to plant virtually any crops except most fruits and vegetables. The deficiency payment rate will be calculated as the difference between the target price and the lower average season market price, with an individual receiving no more than $130,000 per year in counter-cyclical assistance. Milk support would continue under FSRIA through government purchases of nonfat dry milk, butter, and cheese, with counter-cyclical payments added. Dairy farmers would be eligible for national dairy market loss payments whenever the minimum monthly market price for farm milk used for fluid consumption",1
598,"1. The United States and Vietnam have expanded their relations and cooperation in various sectors since establishing diplomatic ties in 1995. In 2013-2014, they signed a 123 agreement under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, allowing for the export of nuclear reactors and components, and facilitating the transfer of nuclear energy technology. This agreement was subject to a 90-day congressional review period, which was completed on September 9, 2014.
2. During the review period, several issues were raised, including the need for stronger nonproliferation commitments, the impact of Vietnam's human rights record, the strategic relationship between the two countries, and potential benefits for U.S. companies. Vietnam has nuclear cooperation agreements with several countries, and the U.S. nuclear industry contends that billions of dollars of exports could result from the Vietnam 123 agreement.
3. The U.S. has provided assistance to Vietnam in developing its nuclear infrastructure, including training and advising on nonproliferation and nuclear safety best practices. Vietnam plans to build nuclear power plants to meet its growing energy demands, aiming to provide 20%-30% of its electricity by 2050.
4. The U.S. and Vietnam have cooperated in the nuclear nonproliferation sphere, such as converting the Dalat research reactor from highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, reducing the risk of nuclear security.
5. The 123 agreement is important for U.S. participation in Vietnam's nuclear projects, particularly for the supply of certain major reactor components that require Nuclear Regulatory Commission export licenses, which cannot be approved without a 123 agreement.
6. The agreement also emphasizes Vietnam's commitment to rely on international markets for its nuclear fuel supply and the U.S.'s support for ensuring a reliable nuclear fuel supply for Vietnam. However, the agreement does not include a binding legal commitment by Vietnam to forswear ENR activities.",1
599,"1. The report is a chronology of events relevant to U.S. relations with North Korea in 2005, and is a continuation of a previous report covering 2002-2004.
2. The chronology highlights key developments in the issues surrounding North Korea's nuclear weapons program, with particular attention paid to the Six-Party Talks, inter-Korean relations, and contact with North Korea outside of the executive branch.
3. In 2005, there were no major reversals or breakthroughs in relationships and regional trends, with North Korea escalating the security situation on the Korean peninsula through words and actions.
4. In February, North Korea announced it had nuclear weapons and suspended its participation in the Six-Party Talks, and in April, it called for regional disarmament talks given its status as a nuclear weapons state.
5. In May, North Korea announced it had removed fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor for reprocessing, and later that month, it launched a short-range missile into the East Sea.
6. In July, negotiators from the six nations re-convened in Beijing for a fourth round of talks, resulting in a joint statement of principles agreed to in September by all parties.
7. The statement committed North Korea to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, and North Korea was provided with security assurances, South Korea committed to provide electricity, and the U.S. and Japan pledged to take steps toward normalization of relations with Pyongyang.
8. Criticism of North Korea's human rights record became more prominent on the U.S. agenda in 2005, with the appointment of Jay Lefkowitz as the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea.
9. In December, the U.S. suspended its shipments of food aid to North Korea, and North Korea asked all resident foreigners from aid NGOs operating in Pyongyang to leave the country.
10. Several key officials in charge of U.S. policy toward North Korea were reshuffled in 2005, with Condoleezza Rice and U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill taking on prominent roles.",1
600,"1. Protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry have improved, enabling the identification of hundreds of proteins in a single LC-MS/MS analysis. However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present in the sample over wide concentration ranges. To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at either the protein or peptide level, and the final step in most strategies involves analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS. Undersampling, where only a subset of the peptides is identified, can occur if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer. The reproducibility of proteomics has been a concern, but typically, the identifications of abundant proteins are reproducible, while most of the variability is observed in lower-abundance proteins.
2. Strategies for achieving more comprehensive proteome coverage include repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses, prefractionating the proteome based on protein physical properties, improving separation of the peptide mixture at the HPLC separation step, modifying the ESI interface to enhance ionization, or adding an ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) interface before the ion trap. Proteome coverage can also be improved at the data analysis stage by using high-mass-accuracy data or improved data-processing algorithms. A two-step method that reanalyzes the same sample with an inclusion list and a replay run that analyzes a sample twice from a single injection with targeted analysis of undersampled features in the replay run can also increase sensitivity. However, it is difficult to assess the relative importance of strategies that have not been directly compared in a single study due to variations in samples, study design, mass spectrometry platforms, data-analysis strategies used, and other laboratory-to-laboratory variations. Direct comparisons of alternative analysis strategies have been conducted to identify the best analysis approaches for specific types of samples such as serum and cell or tissue lysates. Factors that should be considered when comparing alternative analysis strategies include the amount of total protein required for the analysis and the total amount of mass spectrometry instrument time required by each method.",1
601,"1. The study compares the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy (SMUPPP) procedures in patients who underwent surgery between 2001 and 2010. The study found that the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was significantly higher in the tonsillectomy group (5.05%) than in the SMUPPP group (1.45%).
2. The SMUPPP technique involves two steps: step 1, tonsillectomy and excision of the soft palate and redundant tissue; and step 2, reconstruction. The reconstruction step includes bipolar cauterization followed by tacking with 3-0 vicryl sutures, which may have decreased the incidence of postoperative bleeding compared with routine tonsillectomy.
3. The study found that suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP seemed to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence.
4. The study suggests routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage. Submucosal tonsillectomy, which is a part of SMUPPP, has a lower incidence of postoperative delayed hemorrhage compared with tonsillectomy using unipolar cautery in adult patients.",1

2. Computational studies suggest that cyanosuccinic anhydride reactions proceed by a Mannich-like mechanism via the enol tautomer of the anhydride. Similar reactions reported by Castagnoli, Cushman, and Haimova likely proceed by this mechanism as well.
3. The authors explored Mannich-type reactions and related 4CRs of variously substituted anhydrides. Aryl-substituted succinic anhydrides showed some variation in reactivity based on the substituents attached to the aromatic ring. Direct attachment of an electron-withdrawing group resulted in higher reactivity.
4. The diastereoselectivity was reversed in the case of cyanosuccinic anhydrides and could be controlled by resident stereogenic centers. The electron-withdrawing capability of a sulfone was expected to impart similar reactivity as the nitrile-substituted anhydride, albeit with different steric requirements.
5. The authors report the development of anhydride Mannich reactions (AMRs) using sulfone-substituted anhydrides for the synthesis of -lactams and a six-step formal synthesis of ( )-isoretronecanol. Multigram-scale syntheses of anhydrides 3a-d were achieved from readily available starting materials.",1

Specifically, it highlights the functions of miR-125a, miR-206, and miR-145, which are similar to anti-oncogenes and are related to the occurrence of tumors. The text also mentions the roles of miR-21 and miR-10b, which are similar to oncogenes and are related to the invasion and metastasis of tumors. The text provides evidence for the differential expression of these miRNAs in breast cancer tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues.
2. The text also discusses the potential use of these miRNAs as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. It mentions that the relative transcript levels of miR-21 and miR-10b are higher in patients' tumor tissues compared to para-carcinoma normal tissues, while the relative transcript levels of miR-145, miR-125a, and miR-206 are lower in patients' tumor tissues compared to para-carcinoma normal tissues. The text also mentions that the relative transcript levels of miR-145, miR-125a, and miR-206 in serum are also visibly abnormal compared with those in serum from healthy females. Therefore, these miRNAs can be used as markers of breast cancer for early diagnosis.",1
604,"1. The text describes a study on the role of tissue transglutaminase 2 (TGMT2) in the pathogenesis of chronic allograft injury (CAI) in renal transplantation. The study found that TGMT2 mRNA and protein are overexpressed by mononuclear leukocytes, predominantly by activated monocytes, which accumulate in the vascular bed of rat renal allografts on day 9 after transplantation. After resolution of acute rejection on day 42, TGMT2 mRNA levels are lower but still moderately increased compared to respective isografts, which is not reflected in increased protein levels. TGMT2 mRNA expression was also induced in graft tissue upon allogenic transplantation.
2. The study also found that during the pathogenesis of CAI, urinary secretion of the transglutaminase cross-link product (-glutamyl)-lysine is increased. In end-stage CAI, this product is detected more abundantly in allografts compared to isografts. However, it is difficult to conclude if TGMT2 is a marker of CAI reflecting changes in the cellular composition of the graft or actively contributes to the pathogenesis of CAI. The study also suggests that tgm2 can be expressed by activated monocytes but cannot decide if, similarly to macrophages, tgm2 expression is confined to m2-like monocytes. The functional relevance of tgm2 expression by m2 macrophages, however, is still elusive and similarly its role in monocytes is unclear.",1
605,"1. Endothelial cells were grown, stimulated, and supernatant was collected. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged and pelleted to obtain extracellular vesicles (EVs).
2. Flow cytometric analysis was used to characterize and quantify EVs based on CD31- and annexin V-positivity, and a known concentration of polystyrene beads was used for enumeration.
3. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the size distribution of EVs and a representative micrograph was taken.
4. EVs were introduced to a model patient's IV bag, mixed, and circulated through a CVVH filter for 70 minutes.
5. 0.5 ml aliquots were removed for flow cytometric analysis at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 minutes of dialysis.
6. The decline in EV levels due to dialysis was rapid, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes and a relatively constant level of 29% of starting concentration thereafter.
7. The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EV concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis.
8. The findings support the idea of CVVH as a meaningful therapeutic intervention in ALI due to clearance of EVs from the patient's circulation.
9. The study has limitations, such as the use of a saturable filter for EV binding, the relative volume of human circulation to CVVH circuit, and the absence of convection and pressure gradient forces.",1
606,"1. The study found that sublingual nitroglycerin spray significantly improved exercise tolerance in patients with stable angina, although higher dose levels of the spray were associated with an increase in treatment-related adverse events. The improvement in exercise duration was nearly 1 minute compared to placebo, which could allow for much greater increases in walking times during normal daily activities.
2. Optimal medical therapy, including anti-anginal or anti-ischemic and disease-modifying therapy, is as effective as revascularization in reducing the risk of adverse coronary events in patients with chronic stable angina. Increased physical exercise is also important in these patients to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Current guidelines recommend the use of sublingual nitroglycerin as part of optimal medical therapy for patients with stable angina. However, despite published outcome data and current guideline recommendations, many patients are still referred for revascularization due to a belief that these procedures reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or death more effectively than optimal medical therapy alone. Additional studies are needed to further inform the clinical decision-making process.",1
607,"1. The presence of residual and resistant microorganisms, including fungi like Candida albicans, is a common reason for failures in root canal treatments.
2. Candida albicans is found in 20% of endodontic treatment failures and can invade dentin, making it difficult to eliminate.
3. The presence of Candida albicans in endodontic treatment failures can be due to coronal leakage after or contamination during the treatment.
4. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a gold standard root-end filling material with excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, antimicrobial effects, and resistance to fluid and blood contamination.
5. MTA Angelus has advantages over Proroot MTA, such as good marginal adaptation, good sealing, sealing ability in mineralized tissues with complete closure, and is inflammation-free in most cases.
6. MTA Angelus has an excellent antibacterial effect and a strong fungicidal effect against Candida albicans.
7. A study was conducted to evaluate and compare the antifungal properties of fresh and set Proroot MTA and MTA Angelus against Candida albicans at 1-, 24-, and 48-hour time points.
8. The study found that both Proroot MTA and MTA Angelus were fungicidal for Candida albicans at both concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml, and in both fresh and set states.
9. The study concluded that there is no significant difference between the two materials in their antifungal properties, and both are effective in eliminating Candida albicans by the 24-hour time point.",1

2. However, recent studies suggest the presence of subtle motor deficits on the ipsilateral side as well, which emerge during the acute phase and persist chronically.
3. Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to detect these ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination function.
4. Kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb during specific motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination have also been found.
5. Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, or the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.
6. Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have focused on motor deficits, but a recent study investigated the presence of both motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb using a tracking and reposition sense test.
7. The study found that stroke patients had a lower accuracy index in the metacarpophalangeal (mp) joint and higher reposition errors in the joint reposition test, indicating both motor and sensory deficits.
8. Ipsilateral sensory deficits showed significant correlation with motor deficits, suggesting that stroke patients have difficulty performing complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions using pure integrity of movement accuracy and proprioceptive sense.",1
609,"1. The specific targeting of nanoparticles to target cells in an organ of interest has been a long-term goal for the functional delivery of biopharmaceutical agents. However, non-specific enhanced cell uptake mechanisms can be overwhelming and compete with specific binding-mediated cell entry. Factors that influence non-specific enhanced cell uptake mechanisms include nanoparticle size and heterogeneity, surface hydrophilicity and charge, ligand conformation, points of attachment, and surface density.
2. Ph-triggered, pegylated siRNA nanoparticles (also known as ph-triggered siRNA-ABC nanoparticles) have been developed to mediate passive targeting of siRNA to liver cells in vivo, providing proof of concept for an effective RNAi therapeutic approach to hepatitis B virus infections. These nanoparticles have also been shown to enable long-term circulation and mediate passive targeting of tumor cells in vivo, providing proof of concept for an effective RNAi therapeutic approach to cancer treatment.
3. A post-coupling methodology has been adapted to introduce integrin-targeting peptide motifs onto liposome and nanoparticle surfaces, enabling integrin receptor-mediated cellular uptake of agents to cells. This methodology has been used to create imaging nanoparticles with integrin-targeting rgd ligands, which can mediate integrin-specific delivery of an API such as siRNA to v3/5 integrin-receptor presenting cells. This post-coupling chemistry and premodification-postcoupling methodology could be applicable to other nanoparticle platforms with equal success, provided that the biophysical properties of the nanoparticle platform also conform to certain biophysical parameters.",1

The study aimed to collect and evaluate data on health, behavioral risk factors, and occupational characteristics related to military service that may be associated with adverse health outcomes.
2. The study included three sleep variables: trouble sleeping, sleep duration, and sleep apnea. Trouble sleeping was assessed using the sleep items on the Prime-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C). Sleep duration was reported as the whole number of hours slept in an average 24-hour period over the past month. Participants with sleep apnea were identified by self-report as being told by a doctor or other health professional they had sleep apnea.
3. Of the 77,047 participants enrolled at baseline, follow-up surveys were completed by 55,021 participants at year 3 and 54,790 at year 6. The study found that 871 participants newly self-reported diabetes during the follow-up period, for a cumulative annual incidence of 3.6/1,000 person-years. Participants who newly self-reported diabetes during follow-up were significantly more likely at baseline to have reported trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours, and sleep apnea.
4. Factors associated with new-onset diabetes included no deployment, having separated from the military since baseline, army or navy/coast guard service branch, reserves/national guard service component, enlisted pay grade, and administration/supply occupation. Binge or problem drinking was less likely to have been reported in people reporting new-onset diabetes, and current and former smoking frequency was similar in groups with and without new-onset diabetes.
5. After adjustment for sex and known type 2 diabetes risk factors, factors associated with a higher odds of incident diabetes included trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours compared with 7 hours, and sleep apnea. Several military service characteristics remained significantly related to the outcome, including no deployment, enlisted pay grade, administration/supply occupation, and having separated from the military since baseline.

2. The study classified each tumor into one of three types based on the extent of the cystic component on CT scans: multiseptated cystic, mixed cystic and solid, and solid.
3. The study found that the amount of hepatocytes was significantly different among the three types of tumors.
4. The study also found that the other pathological findings such as the amount of mesenchymal stroma and the presence of bile duct or vessel proliferation were not statistically significant among the three groups.
5. The study noted that mesenchymal hamartoma is the second most common benign hepatic tumor in children and typically appears as a disordered arrangement of mesenchyme, bile ducts, and hepatocytes.
6. The study also mentioned that mesenchymal hamartoma can rarely occur as a solid tumor and in such cases, radiological differential diagnosis should include various hepatic tumors such as hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, infantile hemangioendothelioma, hepatic adenoma, or focal nodular hyperplasia.
7. The study concluded that mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver in children can show a wide spectrum of radiological features from a multiseptated cystic tumor to a mixed solid and cystic tumor, and even a solid tumor.",1

The prevalence of RA in Northern Europe and North America is estimated to be 0.5-1%, while in Southern Europe, it is estimated to be lower, at 0.45-0.66%. The annual incidence of RA is also lower in Southern European countries.
2. The cost of RA is significant for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The cost of RA is affected by methods of calculation, reimbursement policies, availability of drugs and social services, and country-specific treatment guidelines. The macroeconomic condition and treatment guidelines remain the most important determinants that drive choice of therapy. The cost of RA is expected to increase in Italy due to the aging population.
3. A review of the literature found that the prevalence of RA in Italy is around 0.5%, but most studies have been conducted in small communities or at a regional level. The largest study, which involved more than 4.5 million people, indicated that both the prevalence and incidence of RA progressively increase in both men and women up to the age of 80 years.
4. The cost of RA includes direct costs (hospitalizations, specialist visits, treatments, diagnostics, and nonmedical costs) and indirect costs (productivity loss and informal care). A retrospective study conducted in 1998 in Italy found that indirect costs accounted for the largest part of the disease management costs and that social costs increased as RA worsened. The calculated average annual cost for each patient varied significantly depending on disease severity and correlated with the health assessment questionnaire disability index and ACR criteria. Total costs ranged from €3,718.3 for patients in functional class I to €22,946.0 for patients in class IV. Both the direct costs and indirect costs over the 12 months of observation increased significantly across the four functional classes.",1

The text describes the case of a patient with limited mouth opening due to oral submucous fibrosis, who required prosthetic rehabilitation with a sectional maxillary and mandibular complete denture. The treatment plan included taking primary impressions with a small stock tray and impression compound, followed by fabricating maxillary hinged and mandibular sectional and hinged complete dentures.
2. The text also discusses various techniques for fabricating sectional and hinged tray/complete dentures for patients with microstomia, a reduced maximal oral opening. These techniques include modified impression procedures and prosthesis design, as well as the use of denture aids. The text highlights the advantages of using sectional impression techniques and sectional dentures in managing clinical difficulties associated with limited mouth opening.
3. The text also mentions the disadvantages of using sectional tray/prosthesis designs, such as additional time, labor, and materials required. However, it suggests that with careful treatment planning, prudent designing, and periodic recall, maintenance, and further improvements in design, the long-term success of this technique can be determined.",1

Risk factors for HCC include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens such as aflatoxin B, and genetic metabolic disease. HCC is relatively resistant to chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products, and p53 mutations. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Met, promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. HGF-c-Met axis activation is implicated in cellular invasion and metastases.
2. HGF is secreted primarily by mesenchymal cells as an inactive single-chain precursor (pro-HGF) which is bound to heparin proteoglycans within the extracellular matrix. Circulating pro-HGF undergoes proteolytic conversion into an active two-polypeptide chain heterodimeric linked by a disulfide bond. HGF is a ligand for the c-Met receptor, also known as cellular Met or c-Met. The c-Met receptor is expressed predominantly on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells of many organs, including the liver. HGF binding induces autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the c-Met tyrosine kinase domain activation loop, forming a multifunctional high affinity binding docking site that recruits a range of intracellular adaptors containing Src homology-2 domains. Recruited adaptor proteins and kinase substrates include growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, phospholipase C-, stat3, shc, src, shp2, PI3K, and ship1. These and other adaptor proteins provide scaffolding for a larger apparatus of network proteins, ultimately promoting activation of multiple signaling pathways. Alterations in transcription indu",1
615,"1. The association between diabetes and cancer has been debated for over a century, but most diabetologists do not view cancer as a specific risk for diabetes patients.
2. Diabetes is a disease of increased intracellular oxidative stress and accelerated biochemical aging, and the use of insulin in type 2 diabetes has raised concerns about promoting the growth of nascent malignancies.
3. Recent epidemiologic studies have confirmed that type 2 diabetes confers increased risk for certain types of malignancies, in particular breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors.
4. A study in Germany suggested a specific cancer risk associated with the long-acting insulin analogue, glargine, but three additional studies did not support this finding.
5. A UK study found that any type of insulin therapy increased the risk of occurrence of solid tumors, but concomitant metformin therapy attenuated this effect.
6. A meta-analysis found comparable malignancy risks associated with detemir and glargine, but the number of events was very small.
7. Further research is needed to address the relationship between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues and secretagogues, and cancer, and to explore potentially protective effects of metformin.",1
616,"1. Adamantinoma of the tibia is a slow-growing primary bone tumor, with approximately 300 cases reported in the English language literature. The most common site of metastasis is the lungs, but regional lymph node metastases are rare and there is limited information on their management.
2. The text presents two cases of tibial adamantinoma with problematic diagnoses. The second case was initially diagnosed as a cutaneous adnexal carcinoma but was later reinterpreted as metastatic adamantinoma after obtaining additional clinical history.
3. A review of inguinal nodal metastatic adamantinoma is provided, including the clinic-pathological data of the two cases. The first case had a new node along the left external iliac in the retroperitoneum, which was detected and biopsied under radiological guidance, confirming the presence of metastatic adamantinoma.
4. A literature search was conducted to provide a comprehensive chronological review of 10 cases with inguinal lymph node metastases. The table includes details of the reference number, year reported, author, sex, age at diagnosis, bone involved, location in bone, character and duration of symptoms, latent period, treatment, and outcome.
5. Adamantinoma of the tibia can be a diagnostic dilemma due to its rarity and varied histological phenotypes. It can be divided into two main groups based on their histology and biological behavior: classical adamantinoma and differentiated adamantinoma. Differentiated adamantinoma has a predominance of an osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia-like pattern and is commonly seen in an intracortical location.
6. Risk factors for metastases in adamantinoma of the long bones include male sex, persistent pain, symptoms of less than five years duration, and inadequate initial treatment. Early metastases within the first two years of initial diagnosis are commonly seen in the regional lymph nodes, whereas delayed metastases are almost always pulmonary or osseous. The current practice recommends surgical extirpation as the primary mode of treatment for localized regional lymph node metastases. Increased clinical awareness of such rare neoplasms is essential",1

2. For crystalline silicon solar cells, a low light reflectivity can be obtained by combining surface texturization with thin-film deposition.
3. To further reduce light reflectivity, various nanostructures based on wide bandgap materials have been proposed, including ZnO nanostructures.
4. ZnO has a wide bandgap and is popularly used in photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices; it can be used as AR layers in photovoltaic applications.
5. Various approaches can be used to fabricate ZnO nanostructures, including a seeding and growth two-step process in zinc salt and amide mixed solutions.
6. This two-step process is acceptable for photovoltaics due to its low cost and good potential for scale-up.
7. Experiments have shown that ZnO nanorod arrays can exhibit better AR properties than other oxide compounds.
8. A weighted global reflectance of 6.6% has been achieved in the broadband range from 400 to 1,200 nm using ZnO nanorod arrays.
9. Most work on ZnO nanorod arrays as AR layers is performed on naked silicon wafers, and the application of ZnO nanostructures in practical silicon solar cells is seldom reported.
10. In this work, ZnO nanowhiskers (NWS) with different lengths were grown by the seeding and growth two-step process and integrated into the fabrication of Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells. The density and length of ZnO NWS were optimized for the improvement of solar cell performances. The efficiency of CZ silicon solar cells was improved by a value of 3% relatively using the ZnO NWS as the AR layer in practice.",1
618,"1. The text describes a study comparing the impact of sympathicotomy at the third (r3) and fourth (r4) rib levels for the treatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. The study found that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, and positive family history. However, the incidence of moderate to severe compensatory sweating was higher in the r3 group (71.8%) than in the r",0
619,"1. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons with Lewy bodies. The clinical diagnosis of PD is often straightforward, but it can be challenging in mild or uncertain cases and in differentiating it from other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration.
2. Molecular imaging techniques such as PET or SPECT have improved the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and the sympathetic innervation of the heart are popular and widely used in clinical practice.
3. DAT SPECT abnormalities can support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism. However, DAT imaging alone cannot differentiate between the various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy.
4. A retrospective study compared the results of SPECT studies of striatal DAT receptors and myocardial MIBG scintigraphy with the clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes.
5. The study found that the combined use of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy improved the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between PD and non-PD.
6. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined use of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy for differentiating between PD and non-PD were 86.7% and 73.7%, respectively.
7. The study also found that the myocardial sympathetic nervous system of MSA patients typically shows mild degeneration, which may result in false-positive results on [I]-mibg scintigraphy.
8. The combination of dopaminergic and sympathetic scintigraphic imaging tests for differentiating between PD and non-PD has been explored by other authors, and some studies showed the complementary role of [I]-mibg scintigraphy and DAT SPECT in the differential diagnosis between PD and non-PD.",1
620,"1. The tick species Amblyomma testudinarium is a large, ornate, longirostrate blood-feeding ectoparasite that has been reported to bite humans in Asian countries.
2. A case of perianal infestation with A. testudinarium in a 73-year-old Korean man is reported, along with histopathologic observations of its attachment to the skin.
3. The tick was found to be deeply embedded in the skin, causing intense skin reactions and pathological changes through all skin layers.
4. The tick was identified as a female adult of A. testudinarium based on morphological characteristics and was found to have eosinophilic cement in the perirostral portion.
5. A. testudinarium is more common in tropical areas, including South East Asia and the Indian peninsula, and is distributed in the southern coastal area of the Korean peninsula.
6. The tick's saliva has anti-inflammatory effects, causing a paucicellular zone around the lesion abutting the cement, which might reflect tick-induced suppression of cellular migration into the injury site.",1
621,"1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, with predominant involvement of the interventricular septum. It can be caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with the major genes including MYH7, TNNT2, MYBPC3, and others.
2. TNNT2 mutations are responsible for approximately 15% of familial HCM and are associated with a severe form of the disease. Most TNNT2 mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle, especially the calcium sensitivity of force development and ATPase activity.
3. The relationship between certain genetic mutations and clinical outcome has been suggested to be more consistent, allowing for the classification of benign and malignant mutations. However, the phenotypic expression of these mutations varies considerably, and clinical parameters such as the degree of LVH, the presence or absence of a left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and electrophysiology testing have not been predictive markers of poor prognosis.
4. A study of 173 Japanese patients with familial HCM found that three reported mutations and a new mutation of TNNT2 were identified in 11 individuals from four families. The study also found that the genotype-phenotype correlation of the TNNT2 gene still remains insufficient in Japanese familial HCM.
5. The study found that the phenotype of each family was often different from reported cases, even if they had the same genetic mutation. Additionally, families with the same genetic mutation showed a similar trend in the phenotype, but it was not exactly the same. However, sudden death in youth was observed in all of these families.
6. The study suggests that in Japanese familial HCM, the type of genetic mutation of TNNT2 does not seem useful in distinguishing the prognosis. However, if mutations are found, there is a risk of sudden death in youth. Therefore, regardless of the type of genetic mutation, it would be more important to observe the patient in detail from birth in each lineage. The development of a case-based method would be useful to treat and help each individual, and more attention needs to be paid toward searching for the modifier and environmental factors including diet",1
622,"1. Schistosomatidae is a family of digenetic endoparasites with complex life cycles that alternate between intermediate (freshwater gastropods) and definitive hosts (birds, reptiles, fishes, and mammals). The Schistosoma species, which includes the avian and mammalian blood flukes, can live in the human host for over 5 years. Six species of Schistosoma infect humans and cause schistosomiasis, a chronic and debilitating disease.
2. The genomes of S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni have been sequenced, revealing that they carry a nuclear genome of approximately 385, 397, and 363 megabases, respectively. The genetic linkage map of S. mansoni has been obtained, allowing for gene discovery and function analysis, as well as the identification of genetic loci that determine important traits such as host specificity, virulence, and drug resistance.

623,"1. The text describes a study that aimed to determine which patients could benefit from staged resections instead of simultaneous resection for synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCLM). The study analyzed the medical records of patients who underwent liver resections for colorectal liver metastases from 1992 to 2004.
2. The study found that the overall morbidity rate and the rate of anastomotic leakage were higher in patients with operation time greater than 8 hours compared to those with operation time less than or equal to 8 hours. The study also found that the extent of hepatic resection, sequence of colectomy, hepatectomy, anastomosis, use of the pringle maneuver, and total time of the pringle maneuver were not predictive factors for anastomotic leakage or postoperative complications in patients with resected SCLM.
3. The text also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of simultaneous resection and staged resections for SCLM. Simultaneous resection can simplify and shorten the treatment schedule, but staged resections might offer a chance to evaluate liver or extrahepatic metastases between the two operations.
4. The study concludes that staged resections should be selected to prevent anastomotic leakage or serious complications when the scheduled operation would result in considerable surgical stress, i.e., predicted operation time greater than 8 hours. The study also suggests that a prospective study of SCLM to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the operation time-based decision model is in progress.",1
624,"1. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the performance of daily activities and requires pharmacological treatment to achieve and maintain clinical control.
2. Inhalation is the most widely used approach for asthma treatment, allowing drugs to reach the lungs in a selective manner, increasing drug concentration in the airways, and reducing systemic adverse effects.
3. However, only half of all asthma patients use the prescribed medication correctly, and low treatment adherence is related to incorrect inhaler use.
4. Instruments that assess the difficulties patients face in using inhaled drugs can help healthcare professionals devise educational programs targeting common errors, improving treatment adherence.
5. A scoring system to assess the difficulties that patients face in using metered dose inhalers (MDIs) has been developed, and new scoring systems for dry powder inhaler (DPI) technique have been derived from it.
6. These instruments have not been validated yet, but they are used in a hospital to assess inhaler technique in patients with asthma and COPD.
7. Validation of these instruments will increase their reliability and ensure data quality, yielding results that are more reliable in evaluating patients using inhalers.
8. The present study aimed to validate two scores quantifying the ability of patients to use MDIs or DPIs, identify the most common errors made during their use, and identify patients in need of an educational program for the use of these devices.",1
625,"1. Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that have potential use as food preservatives and in human and veterinary applications. They can inhibit the growth of closely related bacteria as well as bacteria from different genera.
2. The antimicrobial sensitivity of a target strain to a bacteriocin can depend on environmental conditions such as salt concentration, pH, and the presence of membrane disrupting molecules.
3. Gram-positive bacteriocins can be classified into four classes, including class I or lantibiotics, class II, class III, and class IV. Class II bacteriocins can be further divided into three subgroups: subclass iia, iib, and iic.
4. Many strains of Enterococcus, a genus of gram-positive bacteria, have been found to produce bacteriocins called enterocins. These enterocins have diverse structures and can be active against a wide range of bacteria, including foodborne pathogens and bacteria of environmental and medical interest.
5. The bacteriocin enterocin S37, produced by a strain of Enterococcus faecalis recently isolated from chicken feces, has been found to be active against the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and, to a lesser extent, against Campylobacter jejuni.
6. The activity of enterocin S37 increased during the purification process and was found to be stable at different pH values and high temperatures. It is likely a class II bacteriocin based on its characteristics.
7. The effect of k channel modulators on enterocin activity was studied for the first time in this research. The use of k channel activators and blockers suggested that enterocin S37 may be involved in a depletion of intracellular potassium levels, leading to uncontrolled efflux of intracellular potassium and affecting the growth of sensitive cells.",1
626,"1. The text describes two clinical trials for the drug nusinersen in children with spinal muscular atrophy, which were conducted in compliance with various guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. The phase 1 study was a first-in-human, open-label, escalating-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single intrathecal dose of nusinersen. A total of 28 children were enrolled and received dosing in the phase 1 study, with 15 children having spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 13 having spinal muscular atrophy type 3.
2. The trials involved a total of 73 lumbar punctures, which were performed by pediatric anesthesiologists, neurologists, or neuroradiologists in either inpatient or outpatient settings. The majority of lumbar punctures were carried out using either a 22- (48%) or 25-gauge (37%) needle inserted in the l3-l4 (44%) or l4-l5 (29%) space, and nearly half (44%) of the lumbar punctures were guided using fluoroscopy. Of the 73 lumbar punctures performed, the majority (68%) had no complications, but lumbar puncture-related adverse events were reported in 23 (32%). The most common adverse events were headache (9 events), back pain (9 events), and post lumbar puncture syndrome (8 events), and all events resolved without long-term complications.
3. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that headache, back pain, and post lumbar puncture syndrome were observed more frequently when a 21- or 22-gauge needle was used, in older children (8 - 14 years of age), and in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3. The use of a 24-gauge needle or smaller atraumatic needle inserted with the bevel parallel to the dura fibers had been suggested to considerably reduce damage to the dura and consequently decrease the risk for cerebrospinal fluid leak after lumbar puncture. The text also discusses other considerations that may facilitate lumbar puncture",1
627,"1. Clinical governance (CG) is a system for improving the quality of healthcare services and ensuring high standards of care. It was introduced in the UK in 1997 and has been adopted in Iran since 2009.
2. The CG model in Iran consists of seven interlocking components, including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information. Systems awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication are considered the foundation of this model.
3. Several studies have identified various barriers and facilitators to the implementation of CG. These include insufficient knowledge and attitude toward CG, lack of resources, inadequate information technology systems, resistance to change, necessity of cultural change, and professional boundaries.
4. A qualitative study was conducted to capture the facilitators and barriers to CG implementation from the viewpoint of curative deputies in Iranian medical universities. The study identified five main themes, including knowledge and attitude, culture, organizational factors, managerial factors, and barriers.
5. The study found that most senior managers believed that knowledge and attitude toward CG and culture were the most important factors in CG implementation. A positive attitude, ownership, and a sense of involvement were also considered crucial for successful implementation.
6. The study also identified several barriers to CG implementation, including lack of adequate managerial support, resource issues, structural and cultural challenges, and professional boundaries.
7. To overcome these barriers and ensure successful CG implementation, the study recommended developing educational courses and workshops to raise staff awareness, creating a supportive culture, ensuring all levels of staff commitment and involvement, effective communication, developing clinical guidelines, using incentive tools, and overcoming legal challenges.",1
628,"1. Hydatid cyst disease is a common zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus parasite. It is spread through contaminated soil, water, and vegetables, and is common in regions with traditional animal husbandry. Iran is a hyper-endemic area for this disease.
2. In Khorasan Razavi province, the majority of hydatid cyst cases were found in women, rural areas, and housewives. The most common symptom was abdominal pain, and the most common localization was the liver. The most common diagnosis methods were radiology and CT scan.
3. Risk factors for hydatid cyst infection include contact with dogs and improper hygiene practices such as not washing vegetables properly. Educational programs to improve recognition of disease symptoms and identification of infection sources are needed in high-risk populations.",1
629,"1. Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare, congenital liver cysts that were first described by Friederich in 1857. They are thought to result from the evagination of the foregut during embryogenesis and are characterized by the presence of four layers, including a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer with interspersed mucus cells, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule.
2. CHFCs are typically found in the left lobe of the liver and are usually asymptomatic. However, they can present with abdominal pain or be found incidentally on imaging studies. The majority of CHFCs are solitary and unilocular, and their imaging appearances can be variable.
3. The recommended treatment for CHFCs varies, but most authors agree that surgical excision is necessary for cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, and asymptomatic lesions with wall abnormalities on imaging or in patients with otherwise unexplained abnormal liver function tests. Laparoscopic excision is a feasible and effective approach for CHFCs, particularly for lesions located in the anterolateral portion of the liver.",1

The strip is designed to dissolve within a minute in the oral cavity without the need for water or chewing, improving bioavailability and patient compliance.
2. The formulation of clobazam as an orally dissolving strip involves the use of film forming polymer pva and disintegrating agent ssg. A 3-factorial design was used to evaluate the influence of these polymers on the film's mechanical properties, disintegration time, and dissolution rate. The study also assessed the in vivo performance and IVIVC of the optimum formulation by administration to healthy rabbits.
3. The text also discusses the physicochemical characterization of the clobazam films, including their thickness, folding endurance, surface pH, and in vitro disintegration time. The in vitro dissolution test was performed according to the USP type II paddle apparatus, and the release mechanism of clobazam from the oral strip was determined by fitting the release data to different kinetic models. The surface morphology of the optimized orally dissolving strip formulation was observed with a scanning electron microscope. The optimized orally dissolving formulation of clobazam was subjected to stability studies as per ICH guidelines for 180 days at 40°C/75% RH/5%.",1

Recovery following stroke is complex and multidimensional, encompassing biological, psychological, and sociological elements.
2. Self-management interventions (SMIs) are designed to enable people to manage their health more effectively, and their evaluation should consider whether people develop the skills to manage their own health and if this results in better health. However, the mediators of change and theoretical premises in SMIs are unclear, making it difficult to monitor and maintain intervention fidelity.
3. A recent international Delphi study resulted in a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties, referred to as the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. This checklist has good inter-rater agreement and reliability and represents the first critical appraisal tool that is based on the consensus of experts in psychometric theory.
4. This systematic review aims to examine the outcome measures adopted in stroke SMIs in terms of their methodological quality and the strength of their psychometric properties for use with stroke populations, using the COSMIN checklist to assess the measurement properties of the outcome measures identified.",1

The study found that the Koos questionnaire, a self-reported measure of knee osteoarthritis (OA), had a weak correlation with the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), which measures functional limitation. However, the Koos questionnaire had a strong correlation with body mass index (BMI) and weight, indicating that increased BMI and weight are associated with worsening OA symptoms.
2. The study also found that there was no correlation between age and Koos subscales, except for a weak correlation between age and Koos quality of life (QOL) subscale. This is consistent with previous studies that have reported a lack of correlation between age and OA symptoms.
3. The study supports the use of the Koos questionnaire in Indian OA knee patients, as it had similar trends in mean scores and correlation with other measures as in previous studies. The study also highlights the importance of considering BMI and weight in the management of OA symptoms.",1
633,"1. Obesity is a low-level, chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of factors including a sedentary lifestyle, caloric food consumption, and genetic predisposition. Adipose tissue secretes cell-signaling molecules such as adipokines, proinflammatory factors like IL-6, TNF-, and leptin, and anti-inflammatory factors like IL-10 and adiponectin.
2. Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian function, which promotes adverse changes in lipoproteins, glucose and insulin metabolism, distribution of body fat, clotting, and vascular endothelium. These changes, combined with weight gain, place women at a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.
3. The hormonal changes that occur during menopause are responsible for specific physical and metabolic remodeling that, when associated with weight gain and obesity, have a negative impact on women's health.
4. A high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy in rats caused an increase in body weight gain, hyperleptinemia, and decreased cytokine levels in mesenteric adipose tissues.
5. The study emphasizes the importance of decreasing fat consumption in women after menopause to reduce the risk of proinflammatory processes associated with a high-fat diet.",1

2. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is a safe and effective treatment for both massive and chronic or recurrent hemoptysis.
3. The first step in BAE is a complete angiography of the pulmonary vascular tree, and embolization is performed if bleeding bronchial arteries are seen.
4. This study is a retrospective analysis of 344 patients who underwent BAE between 2006 and 2013.
5. The main causes of hemoptysis in this study were tuberculosis (55.2%), bronchiectasis (28.8%), and malignancy (5.8%).
6. BAE was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 96% of patients, but 17.7% had recurrent hemoptysis within 1 month.
7. Of the 344 cases, 97.7% underwent BAE, and there were 1530 embolization coils used for a total of 920 arteries embolized.

635,"1. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and celiac disease (CD) can both cause lymphocytic gastritis (LG), a condition characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the stomach.
2. The study found that the highest proportion of LG was in CD patients without H. pylori infection, followed by patients with CD infected by H. pylori, H. pylori positive patients without CD, and none in the control group.
3. H. pylori infection was associated with an increased number of lymphoid aggregates in the antrum, regardless of CD status.
4. CD patients, with or without H. pylori infection, had a significant increase in CD3+ and CD8+ IELs compared to controls.
5. The study suggests that in undiagnosed patients with histological features compatible with LG, higher counts of CD8+ IELs may imply that the diagnosis is CD rather than H. pylori gastritis.
6. The study also found that the number of lymphoid follicles was highest in children who were H. pylori positive, independent of the presence of LG.
7. The study suggests that immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 lymphocytes in the antrum may help differentiate between CD and H. pylori infection in undefined cases.",1
636,"1. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is required for the growth of solid tumors. VEGF is a primary stimulant of angiogenesis, and its inhibition has been shown to reduce tumor size and microvessel density in breast and pancreatic tumors. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human VEGF, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2/neu-negative breast cancer.
2. In addition to reducing tumor size and microvessel density, inhibition of VEGF has also been shown to decrease macrophage infiltration in breast tumors. This is thought to be due to the expression of VEGFR2 on tumor-associated macrophages. Other changes in immune cell infiltrates, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, have also been observed following anti-VEGF therapy. VEGF is a major chemoattractant for inflammatory cells, and inhibition of VEGF has been shown to reduce angiogenesis and modulate immune cell infiltration in orthotopic breast cancer xenografts.",1

2. An estimated 32 million postmenopausal women in the US suffer from VVA symptoms, including dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation.
3. VVA is chronic, progressive, and will not resolve without treatment, which can negatively impact women's quality of life and sexual relationships.
4. The REVIVE survey, conducted among a large cohort of postmenopausal women in the US, highlights the poor understanding of VVA and its symptoms among women.
5. Many women are unaware that their vaginal symptoms can be caused by menopause or hormonal changes, and assume that VVA will abate over time.
6. The survey also reveals that women are hesitant to discuss VVA symptoms with healthcare providers (HCPs), often due to embarrassment or the assumption that the symptoms are a natural part of aging.
7. Women who have discussed VVA symptoms with HCPs report inadequate understanding and poor communication, which may contribute to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
8. The survey demonstrates the considerable impact of VVA on women's lives, with the most commonly reported symptoms being vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and local irritation.
9. Effective patient education and communication are essential to improve women's understanding of VVA, promote earlier diagnosis and treatment, and enhance patient satisfaction and adherence.",1

The most common symptomatic manifestation of PAD is intermittent claudication, which affects around 5% of individuals over 60 years old. The presence of PAD, even when asymptomatic, is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
2. The study found that patients with PAD (group i) had significantly higher concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared to patients on simvastatin therapy (group ii) before surgery. Group i patients also had enhanced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of MDA, compared to those treated pharmacologically. However, there was no significant decrease in LOOH and MDA concentrations in group i patients after surgery.
3. The total antioxidant capacity (expressed as FRAP) and -SH group concentrations in the serum of patients on statin therapy and in those before surgery were similar. However, a decrease was observed in FRAP level 35 days after surgery, and 710 days after surgery, it was significantly lower in comparison to the values before surgery and on simvastatin therapy. Thiol group concentrations 35 days postoperatively were lower than those before surgery and 710 days after surgery and were lower than those in patients treated with simvastatin.
4. The study found that lipid peroxidation may be one mechanism through which several risk factors may promote PAD. The findings suggest that simvastatin therapy may relieve symptoms and improve function in patients with lower extremity PAD. The study also highlights the importance of antioxidant enzyme systems and nonenzymatic antioxidants in protecting against the action of toxic free radicals.",1

The use of herbal remedies, such as the FIJK herbal mixture, in Nigeria is common despite little scientific data supporting their medicinal benefits or information about their potential toxicity. The FIJK herbal mixture is made from a combination of 13 medicinal plants and is used to treat a variety of ailments. However, there is a lack of scientific data on the safety or toxicity of this herbal remedy. A study was conducted to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to FIJK on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology.
2. The study found that oral administration of FIJK to rats caused a significant reduction in rat plasma protein levels and elevated plasma levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and the atherogenic index. Additionally, exposure to FIJK resulted in significant alterations to levels of rat plasma ALT and AST, which may indicate tissue toxicity and liver injury. The study also found that oral exposure to FIJK caused lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in rats, as indicated by increased levels of MDA and decreased levels of GSH. The histopathological examination of rat liver sections revealed morphological lesions in groups exposed to FIJK, further supporting the biochemical alterations caused by the herbal mixture.",1

Preconceptional carrier screening can benefit prospective parents by making them aware of the genetic risks to their future offspring and the reproductive options available, such as prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, using donor sperm or oocytes, seeking adoption, or refraining from having children.
2. Carrier screening and carrier testing are two approaches to identifying carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders. Carrier screening is offered to persons who do not have an increased risk, while carrier testing is offered to persons who have a higher a priori risk based on their or their partner's personal or family history.
3. Preconceptional carrier screening can be offered on an individual basis or as an organized screening program, and its goal is to strengthen reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making. It can be less time-constrained, less pressured, and less emotionally stressful than testing during pregnancy.
4. Preconceptional carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been studied extensively and has received positive attitudes from healthcare providers, patients, their relatives, and the general public. The National Institutes of Health, the American College of Medical Genetics, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended CF carrier screening for couples with no family history of CF.
5. However, traditional healthcare systems have hesitated to implement carrier screening programs for the entire population of couples planning a pregnancy due to concerns such as the psychological impact, risk of stigmatization/discrimination, impairment of freedom of choice, medicalization, difficulty in reaching couples before conception, and provider-related barriers.
6. Recently, commercial companies have been offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers (DTC) through the internet. These tests provide information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring. While the availability of DTC genetic testing services has created a debate about their desirability, the discussions have mainly focused on the commercial DTC offer of genome-wide testing for common disorders, which have limited or no medical or health benefits to the individual user. DTC testing for preconceptional carrier tests may be regarded differently and should be discussed in terms of the informed consent procedure, medical supervision and follow-up, and the appropriate use of existing resources.",1

These implants are often made of titanium alloys or stainless steel and may remain in the body after fracture union, potentially causing issues such as pain, discomfort, or prominence.
2. The removal of asymptomatic hardware is still debated, and there is a lack of clear guidelines. While there are presumed benefits to implant removal such as functional improvement and pain relief, the surgical procedure can also lead to complications such as neurovascular injury and refractures.
3. The study conducted at a teaching hospital found that the most common reasons for implant removal were pain or discomfort, infected hardware, and implant failure. The most commonly removed implants were distal tibial/ankle plates, femoral intramedullary nails, olecranon wires and plates, and tibial intramedullary nails and patellar tension band wires.
4. The study also found that the most consistently encountered obstacle during surgery was difficulty in removing the hardware from the bone, especially in locked plates of the distal humerus and forearm. Additionally, there is a low but definite possibility of complications during removal, such as ulnar nerve neuropraxia and refracture.
5. The text highlights the need for large studies on implant removal in symptomatic patients and the development of concrete indication guidelines for implant removal. The authors also emphasize the risks of implant removal surgeries and the need for careful consideration before embarking on such a process.",1
643,"1. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve atrophy. Multiple factors are related to glaucoma, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
2. Müller cells are the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina that support and nourish retinal neurons, maintain extracellular ion homeostasis, and are involved in synaptic transmission.
3. Müller cells are involved in retinal function and are also implicated in multiple pathological retinal diseases, including glaucoma. Reactive Müller cells can aggravate retinal damage by releasing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-).
4. Increased glial production of TNF- contributes to the neurodegeneration in glaucoma. TNF- is a secreted inflammatory cytokine responsible for apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation.
5. -Aminoadipic acid (AAA), a six-carbon homolog of glutamate, is a compound that induces specific glial toxicity by blocking the glutamate uptake. The use of AAA to interfere with glial influence on neuronal tissues has been reported.
6. The current study aimed to determine if AAA treatment inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities induced in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
7. The results showed that AAA treatment rescued RGCs from the cell apoptosis induced in the AOH model, and significantly attenuated TNF- levels in the retinas of the rat model of AOH.
8. AAA treatment also markedly reduced GFAP immunoreactivity across the inner plexiform layer (ipl), indicating attenuation in Müller cell gliosis.
9. These findings suggest that AAA may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma by promoting survival of RGCs, likely through the inhibition of AOH-induced",1

A new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFR-L) has been developed for the treatment of nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms (SDNs). This technique was used in 5 patients and found to be effective and safe in achieving complete resection without complications or peritoneal exposure of tumor cells.
2. The LAEFR-L technique involves the use of a ligation device to mark and resect the targeted lesion, followed by intraluminal retrieval of the specimen. This technique has several advantages over conventional full-thickness resection (FTR) methods, including avoidance of peritoneal exposure of tumor cells and the ability to collect the resected specimen intraluminally. However, tumor size and location are important factors to consider when determining the indication for LAEFR-L.",1
645,"1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive conditions caused by defects in various enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). In patients with 21-OHD, some precursors are shunted into the androgen synthetic pathway, causing signs and symptoms of androgen excess. Medical treatment typically consists of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens.
2. Recent reports reveal a high prevalence of small adrenal tumors in patients with untreated 21-OHD CAH. The development of adrenal adenoma or carcinoma in patients with CAH is rare, but the incidence of adrenal masses appears to be higher in CAH patients and in heterozygotes than in the general population. The pathogenesis of adrenal tumor in patients with 21-OHD CAH is thought to be related to a consequence of ACTH hypersecretion, which results from the lack of glucocorticoid synthesis. Patients with 21-OHD CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumor, improve its symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorder, particularly hyponatremia.",1
646,"1. Self-rated health (SRH) has been shown to predict mortality and is a valid tool for predicting mortality in populations with and without cardiovascular diseases and functional ability. It has gained popularity as a health-indicating tool in the US and other countries.
2. Poor health in persons with chronic diseases has been attributed to a lack of adherence to medical recommendations, including diet and physical activity. Lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases.
3. A study of a half-Hispanic population with non-Hispanics who were predominately black found significant differences in SRH by ethnicity, but these differences were adjusted in the final models. Other studies have found an association between lifestyle behaviors and SRH.
4. Modifiable lifestyle behaviors, such as low fruits and vegetables intake and high fat intake, were associated with poor/fair SRH in males and females. Poor SRH was significantly associated with low physical activity in females only, and low physical activity was more common in women than men in this study sample.
5. The study's limitations include the inability to establish causality due to the single time point and the lack of collection of other factors that may have influenced SRH, such as socioeconomic status, neighborhood, housing situation, and psychosocial factors. The results suggest that gender differences may have implications in designing and monitoring lifestyle interventions to prevent cardiovascular diseases.",1
647,"1. Endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA), also known as Deflux, has become a popular alternative to open surgery for treating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children.
2. Deflux has been FDA approved since 2001 for treating grade 2-4 VUR in single systems without accompanying urological malformations in children above one year of age.
3. The ease of technique, short procedure and recovery time, and repeatability of injections have made Dx/HA injections popular among surgeons and parents.
4. Expanded use of Dx/HA injections has been reported in patients of all ages and grades of VUR, even in the presence of duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies.
5. The initial success rate of Dx/HA injections was quoted as 68%, but it has improved over time. The success rate for the intraureteric injection technique is reported to be as high as 89%.
6. However, the worldwide success rates differ considerably (55%-89%), and up to 25% of patients may still have remaining VUR after Dx/HA injection.
7. Intraoperative positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography has been developed to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) after a negative standard voiding cystogram.
8. PIC cystography has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystogram and can detect occult VUR. If a positive PIC is found, Dx/HA injection can be performed during the same anesthesia.
9. In a study of 116 patients and 177 renal units (RUs) treated with Dx/HA injections, the overall radiographic success rate was 80% for RUs and 75% for patients. The grade of VUR, age and gender of the patient, and amount of Deflux injected did not influence the result.",1
648,"1. The accuracy of ultrasound in detecting fetal pathology depends on the sonographer's expertise and is affected by factors such as fetal head descent, skull bone ossification, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios.
2. Fetal MRI has an increasing role in diagnosing prenatal anomalies, especially in central nervous system pathology, and is used as an adjunct to ultrasound in cases of ventriculomegaly.
3. Ventriculomegaly can be classified based on the maximal diameter of the atrium of the lateral ventricles or the thickness of the overlying brain parenchyma, and has a wide range of causes, including an imbalance in cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, abnormal cerebral development, and destructive disease processes.
4. Fetal MRI has advantages over ultrasound, including excellent contrast resolution, the ability to directly visualize the cortical region and the fossa posterior, and a big field of view, but is limited by fetal motion and lower spatial resolution.
5. The added value of MRI in detecting additional cerebral anomalies in cases of ventriculomegaly is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to various factors such as the expertise of the sonographer, the selected patient population, and the interobserver agreement.
6. MRI is useful in detecting and characterizing additional anomalies in cases of moderate and severe ventriculomegaly, and may demonstrate difficult-to-detect findings in mild unilateral ventriculomegaly. However, the use of fetal MRI is still a topic of debate due to practical issues such as availability, cost, and expertise.",1
649,"1. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, with a high proportion of cases diagnosed at an advanced stage. Bone is a common site of metastasis for lung cancer, which can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain. These SREs can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and overall survival.
2. A study was conducted using data from the SEER cancer registry and Medicare claims database to analyze the impact of bone metastasis and SREs on mortality in older lung cancer patients. The study found that having bone metastasis, with or without SREs, was associated with an increased risk of death in lung cancer patients. The risk was particularly high in patients with localized stage lung cancer and bone metastasis complicated with SREs.
3. The study also found that SREs were common in lung cancer patients with bone metastasis, with radiotherapy to bone being the most common SRE. The majority of patients with SREs had a pathological fracture, with the spine being the most common site of occurrence. The study suggests that early detection and treatment of bone metastasis and SREs are crucial in improving the survival and quality of life of lung cancer patients.",1
650,"1. Fiber-reinforced posts have superior advantages over cast posts, including esthetics, physical properties, and modulus of elasticity similar to root dentin. They are typically cemented with resin cements, and the proper selection of resin cements can influence the retention of posts and the success of restoration.
2. Failure of glass fiber-reinforced post-and-core restorations often occurs due to debonding at the post-resin interface and/or resin-dentin interface as a result of bond deficiencies. Self-adhesive resin cements are the least investigated group among resin cements.
3. Self-adhesive cements are resistant to moisture and can release fluoride comparable to glass ionomer cements. They also have satisfactory esthetic and mechanical properties, making them suitable for the adhesive cementation of fixed prostheses and posts.
4. Removing the smear layer that contains gutta-percha remnants, microorganisms, and infectious dentin is necessary for the penetration of the adhesive system and resin cement into the dentin tubules. Self-adhesive resin cements cannot completely remove the smear layer, which could cause a lower bond strength compared with an etch and rinse adhesive system.
5. Sodium hypochlorite, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, orthophosphoric acid, and different laser systems can remove the smear layer and alter the characteristics of the dentin substrate, increasing the micromechanical retention of the cement.
6. A study compared the effect of the photodynamic diode laser and other smear layer removal methods on bond strength of the self-adhesive cement. The results showed that the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups had higher bond strength values compared to other groups.
7. The smear layer should be removed according to some authors due to the increase of antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness. However, other authors insist upon retaining the smear layer for adaptation of the materials to the root surface. The study found that the photodynamic diode laser group had a higher bond strength than other groups except for the 37% orthophosphoric acid group without the removal of the smear layer.",1
651,"1. Recent efforts have identified and quantified the bacterial communities in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, with major initiatives such as the Human Microbiome Project in the USA and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) consortium in Europe. These initiatives aim to characterize the microbial communities in various sites of the human body and look for correlations between changes in the microbiome and prevalence of diseases.
2. Collaborations have been initiated to identify a common core of bacterial species shared among all or the majority of human beings, with studies suggesting that the human gut flora mainly belongs to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Archaea, mostly represented by the methanogenic Methanobrevibacter smithii, have also been discovered in the human gut.
3. The composition of the bacterial flora seems to strongly depend on the environment and the maternal input during delivery and upon breastfeeding. Members of the same family were shown to have bacterial communities that were more similar to each other than to unrelated individuals, suggesting that the environment and maternal flora, rather than genetic factors alone, have greater impact on establishing bacterial communities in a new individual.
4. Recent studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities, with one major study specifically aimed at assessing whether a common bacterial core shared by all or at least a majority of humans could be determined. The study found that the bacterial groups that were present in the samples in vast numbers were Bacteroidetes and Dorea/Eubacterium/Ruminococcus, with only 18 species present in all individuals examined, while 57 species were seen in more than 90% of samples and around 50% shared 75 species.
5. The minimal gut microbiome and minimal gut metagenome are not mutually exclusive, and there are many genes that will belong to both groups, being necessary both for the survival of the bacterium as well as for gut function. A higher degree of redundancy at the gene level suggests that the core microbiome should exhibit shared bacterial functions that need to operate to ensure survival and successful symbiosis in the gut.

652,"1. The text reports the results of a study on the use of tazarotene gel for the topical treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis, a chronic fungal infection of the nail. The study found that tazarotene was effective in reducing the affected area and improving clinical symptoms, with no significant side effects. Mycological cure was observed in 40% of patients at the first follow-up visit and in all patients at the end of the 12-week treatment period.
2. The study also investigated the in vitro fungistatic activity of tazarotene against several fungal species commonly implicated in onychomycosis, including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata. The results showed that tazarotene inhibited the growth of these fungi, suggesting a direct antifungal effect.
3. The text notes that successful topical treatment of nail onychomycosis is difficult due to factors such as slow nail growth and the physical presence of the nail plate. Current topical therapies, such as amorolfine 5% nail lacquer and ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, require prolonged application and strong patient adherence. The text suggests that tazarotene may be a promising new topical treatment option for onychomycosis, particularly in treatment-resistant cases or those with enhanced nail thickening. However, further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of tazarotene in terms of relapse and reinfection.",1
653,"1. The study examines the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in the treatment of heart failure and left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony, which is effective in most patients but can have a clinical non-response rate of 25-35%. The authors focus on the delivery of CRT therapy and the challenges of positioning the lead in one of the tributaries of the coronary sinus.
2. The study looked at 24 patients who remained in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV despite at least 6 months of CRT and adequate medical therapy. These patients underwent an acute hemodynamic study to find alternative LV endocardial pacing sites that could improve their CRT response.
3. The results showed that in 5 out of 24 patients, the CRT response increased by more than 15% during LV endocardial pacing. However, in 3 out of these 5 patients, endocardial pacing did not substantially increase the CRT response when the coronary sinus lead was in a posterolateral position.
4. The study also found that the best haemodynamic response was obtained in the basal or mid-posterolateral segments of the LV endocardium, and that the longest time interval between the onset of the QRS complex and LV sensing (q-LV interval) resulted in the best haemodynamic response in most patients.",1
654,"1. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity. It may not show symptoms until the third or fourth decade of life, and only half of patients will progress to renal failure.
2. Pregnant women with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis face complications such as hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, infected cysts, pyelonephritis, and risk of cerebral artery aneurysm rupture during labor.
3. An 80 kg, 35-year-old full-term primigravida with ADPKD and oligohydramnios was scheduled for an emergency lower segment cesarean section (LSCS). She was hospitalized and hemodialyzed for two months to maintain acceptable blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and potassium levels.
4. The patient's preoperative investigations showed a hemoglobin of 10.2 gm%, normal leucocyte count, mild proteinuria, and pus cells in urine. Her biochemical profile revealed elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels.
5. Coagulation profile was within normal limits, and arterial blood gas analysis showed normal values. The anesthetic plan included monitoring pulse oximeter, cardioscope, noninvasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urine output measurement.
6. Spinal anesthesia was successfully administered using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl. The patient maintained stable hemodynamic and biochemical parameters throughout the surgery and postoperatively.
7. Pregnancy can exacerbate renal disease, but the pathophysiology is unclear. One hypothesis is that increased glomerular perfusion causes further injury, while another suggests that preexisting renal disease may induce a cascade of platelet aggregation, microvascular fibrin thrombus formation, and endothelial dysfunction.
8. Increased cardiac output and decreased intrarenal vascular resistance in pregnancy cause an 80%",0
655,"1. The milk yield in cows is influenced by the persistency of lactation, which is the rate of decline in production after peak milk yield. High persistency is associated with a slow decline, while low persistency is associated with a rapid decline.
2. Lactation curve models have been used to predict milk yield at any point during lactation. Different models have been tried by researchers to fit the lactation curve in various breeds of cattle.
3. A study was conducted using data from 733 Karan Fries cows to compare the lactation curve between normal cows and cows suffering from clinical mastitis. The data was collected over a period of 12 years and the lactation curve was modeled using a gamma type function.
4. The results showed that the fortnightly test-day milk yield (ftdmy) was lower in the first fortnight and increased gradually to attain a peak in the third and fourth fortnights in both normal and mastitis cows. However, the peak milk yield was maintained only for the third fortnight in mastitis cows.
5. The cows exhibited a steady decline in milk yield with advancement in lactation. The ftdmy increased till the third or fourth fortnight and declined thereafter in both normal and mastitis cows.
6. The parity-wise estimated lactation curve parameters for ftdmy indicated higher average initial milk yield in normal cows compared to mastitis cows in different parities. The peak milk yield was observed in the fourth parity, while the minimum yield was observed in the first parity in both normal and mastitis cows.
7. The study also found that the gamma type function had a high score of goodness of fit, indicating that it is a suitable model for predicting milk yield in cows. Approximately one third of lactation curves were named atypical, with 44.19% downhill, 45.08% concave, 7.32% LNA negative, and 3.39% C negative.
8. The lactation curve parameters for ftdmy exhibited a similar trend in normal and mastitis infected cows, with a steeper decline in descending slope and an increase in initial ftdmy due to a steeper rise in ascending slope from the",1
656,"1. Male B6C3F1 mice were fed diets supplemented with Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) at different concentrations to study its effects on lifespan, body weight, and food consumption.
2. NDGA consumption extended murine and drosophila lifespan but was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis in mice.
3. NDGA did not affect energy uptake or utilization in drosophila, and the effects on drosophila lifespan were not due to caloric restriction (CR) or altered locomotor activity.
4. In mice, 3.5g/kg diet (373 mg NDGA/kg bw/d) extended lifespan, but higher and lower dosages were ineffective. The NIH-ITP found that NDGA extended male mouse lifespan at 2.5 g NDGA/kg diet, but the actual dose was uncertain.
5. NDGA consumption was associated with an increased incidence of liver, lung, and thymus tumors, and increased hemorrhagic diathesis in mice.
6. NDGA inhibits the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is a well-established mechanism for the extension of mouse and drosophila lifespan.
7. NDGA decreased the mass of liver tumors, suggesting that it decreased the rate of liver tumor growth. However, it appeared to increase hepatic tumor number and the prevalence of lung and thymus tumors.
8. The development of less toxic derivatives of NDGA, such as tetra-o-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid, is underway for potential use as cancer therapeutics.",1
657,"1. Genetic variation contributes to disease susceptibility and treatment response, with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enabling the discovery of genetic variants contributing to complex genetic diseases and detection of pharmacogenetic markers.
2. Personalized medicine aims to improve medical decision-making by promoting the identification of the optimal drug and dosage for a subgroup of patients, but current applications are broader and may include withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.
3. Biomarkers are diversely defined in the literature, but a commonly adopted definition states that a biomarker is any substance or biological structure that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain, or predict the incidence or outcome of disease.
4. Prognostic biomarkers help predict the progress of the disease, while predictive biomarkers are connected with the response to a treatment.
5. DNA biomarkers are stable over an individual's lifetime, while DNA tumor biomarkers are specific to cancerous tumors and general biomarkers may be measured in biofluid, tissue, or cell lines.
6. Biomarkers have various applications in personalized medicine, including diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction, and are used in both retrospective and prospective studies.
7. The validation of predictive biomarkers requires specific study designs, including retrospective or prospective studies, and the use of biobanks for prospective validation may play a role for already approved drugs if biomaterial allows systematic investigations into improved efficacy or safety in biomarker-defined subgroups.",1
658,"1. Myosin VA (MyoVA) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. It consists of a pair of motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain.
2. MyoVA's movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms for processive motion. Each lever arm has six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains.
3. Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of MyoVA, but high calcium (>1 mM) reduces motor processivity and may cause one or more calmodulins to dissociate from each lever arm. This could reduce the efficiency of both the lever arm displacement amplification and the strain-dependent gating between the two heads.
4. MyoVA is adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. It requires sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search, allowing MyoVA to switch actin tracks even at large angles.
5. The structural domains critical to MyoVA's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction.
6. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVA motors and their subdomains by anchoring a MyoVA-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor.
7. By comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered qdot to a stationary, reference qdot, the motion of the tethered qdot can be determined, providing information about the flexibility and flexural stiffness of the MyoVA molecule.
8. The study found that the flexural stiffness of MyoVA subdomains, such as the lever arms and distal rod, is critical to the motor's processive movement and can be tuned via calcium signaling.
9. The study also found that the lever arm flexural stiff",1
659,"1. A study was conducted to determine if clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 genes were genotyped in a cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
2. In multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients carrying the wild-type T/T genotype. Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) GA/GA genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type G/G genotype.
3. The study suggests that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC.
4. The study also highlights the potential of using host genetic variability to identify individuals that may have the best chance of survival, and the potential of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the germ-line as molecular markers for clinical outcome in patients with EAC or ESCC who underwent surgical resection.
5. The study also suggests that collection of blood samples or fresh frozen tissue samples of esophageal cancer patients is necessary and should become standard procedure in order to perform genome-wide association studies.",1

661,"1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and it primarily spreads through the lymphatic system to locoregional lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla.
2. A newer technique for SLNB uses a magnetic tracer and a handheld magnetometer as a radiation-free alternative to the traditional combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye. This magnetic technique has been found to be noninferior to the combined technique in identifying sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), but there is a discordance in SLNs identified between the two techniques, which could potentially lead to false-negative staging.
3. A study evaluating the performance of three different-sized superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-based formulations licensed for human use found that particle size is the most important property influencing lymphatic uptake and lymph node retention. The study used a porcine model to compare the performance of three SPIO-based magnetic tracers and found that the tracer with a mean particle size of approximately 60 nm (Sienna+) had a higher identification rate than the other two tracers.
4. The use of magnetic tracers for SLNB has several advantages over the traditional combined technique, including ease of use, no radiation exposure, and potential for real-time imaging. However, there are also some drawbacks, such as the need for specialized equipment and the potential for false-negative results.
5. Further research is needed to optimize the clinical application of the magnetic technique for SLNB, including studies to evaluate the optimal particle size and coating for magnetic tracers, as well as clinical trials to compare the efficacy and safety of the magnetic technique to the traditional combined technique.",1
662,"1. Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine proteinase inhibitor (vaspin) was identified in the visceral adipose tissue of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
2. Vaspin is also expressed in the skin, hypothalamus, pancreatic islets, and stomach.
3. Plasma vaspin concentrations are higher in men with the metabolic syndrome compared with those without the metabolic syndrome.
4. Serum vaspin levels are negatively correlated with creatinine levels and are significantly reduced in Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients.
5. A study measured serum vaspin and adiponectin levels in subjects with normal renal function and renal insufficiency with or without T2DM and compared various clinical parameters.
6. The study found that patients with renal insufficiency (RI) and T2DM were older and had lower BMI, higher systolic blood pressure, and higher serum vaspin levels compared with those without RI.
7. However, serum vaspin levels were lower in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic individuals, regardless of RI status.
8. Multiple regression analyses found that HbA1c levels were independently and significantly associated with vaspin concentration in all subjects.
9. The study suggests that measuring the levels of adipokines, including vaspin, in patients with RI may be beneficial for predicting cardiovascular events and patient survival.",1
663,"1. Data from two clinical trials were used to test surrogate variables for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and explore the correlation between granulation tissue development and complete healing.
2. The trials involved patients with Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs larger than 1 cm, treated with intralesional injections of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (RHEGF) or placebo, in addition to standard care.
3. Surrogate markers of complete healing were generated, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT).
4. The EOT data were used as the comparison points for the 4-week area change, and ulcer areas and percent granulation were measured using a validated portable wound measurement device.
5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals.
6. The most efficient predictor of healing was the granulation tissue covering > 75% of the ulcer area at the EOT, with 79.5% correct classification and a high negative predictive value.
7. The proportion mediated for granulation variables at 2 weeks and at the EOT was very high, suggesting that almost 100% of the effect of the treatment on complete healing may have been mediated by the formation of granulation tissue.
8. The validation tests using multivariate analyses were developed with the data of the randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of intralesional RHEGF in advanced DFUs.
9. The results suggest that granulation tissue development can be taken as a surrogate of complete wound closure in advanced DFUs, with good capacity to discriminate healers from nonhealers.
10. The study provides the first evidence for the use of granulation tissue development as a predictor of wound healing in advanced DFUs, which can be useful for clinical trial design and healthcare programs managing diabetic foot ulcers.",1
664,"1. The text describes a study comparing two advanced minimally invasive approaches to laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) mesh repair for inguinal hernia: needlescopic TAPP (ntapp) and single-incision laparoscopic surgery TAPP (stapp). The study found that ntapp resulted in less perioperative surgical trauma to the abdominal wall, as evidenced by a smaller umbilical skin incision length and shorter operative time. However, both procedures had similar rates of hernia recurrence, abdominal wall mobility, and cosmetic satisfaction.
2. The ntapp procedure was also associated with less immediate postoperative pain in wound regions compared to stapp repair, but this did not significantly improve the incidence of chronic groin pain. The ntapp procedure also resulted in a shorter mean period of sick leave compared to stapp repair.
3. Despite the greater extent of scar tissue in the stapp group, both groups regained equal abdominal wall mobility and satisfactory cosmetic results after an approximate observation time of 30 months. However, more stapp than ntapp patients remained on sick leave, even with an absence of postoperative wound pain.
4. The text notes that there are multiple factors that influence the period of sick leave, including psychological factors related to the larger scar caused by stapp repair. The study concludes that the ntapp procedure with smaller caliber trocars can further minimize surgical trauma to the abdominal wall tissue and offers distinct advantages in the immediate postoperative phase in reduced postoperative wound pain and shorter sick leave. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the benefits of needlescopic surgery.",1

2. The accurate diagnosis of the cause of mouth breathing is crucial for effective treatment. This often involves the participation of a multidisciplinary team, including otorhinolaryngologists, odontologists, phonoaudiologists, physiotherapists, and pediatricians.
3. The study found a regular and positive correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing the grade of hyperplasia in the pharyngeal tonsils, but cephalometry tended to underestimate the size of the tonsils compared to nasopharyngoscopy.
4. The sensitivity of cephalometry in diagnosing hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils was found to be 35%, and a negative cephalometric exam might not provide a proper assessment of the nasopharynx when compared to the nasopharyngoscopic exam. Therefore, children with classical symptoms of respiratory obstruction and normal or next to normal pharyngeal tonsil size on radiological exams should undergo flexible nasopharyngoscopy for a more accurate diagnosis.",1
666,"1. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in patients previously treated for breast carcinoma is less than 6%, but it is necessary to distinguish between true local recurrence (TR) and the appearance of a new primary tumor (NPT) based on the location of the new tumor, staging, and histological subtype.
2. IBTR can be classified as either TR or NPT based on pathologic features, genetic sequencing, and whether the relapse occurs at or near the original site of the primary tumor. Patients with NPT are significantly younger at initial diagnosis than those who experienced TR.
3. Currently, salvage mastectomy is the standard treatment for all types of IBTR, but there is no conclusive evidence of its superiority compared to conservative surgery. TR has a poor prognosis and may benefit from more aggressive adjuvant treatment, while patients with NPT generally have a favorable prognosis and therapeutic decisions concerning systemic therapy should be similar to those in patients with de novo breast carcinoma.",1
667,"1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in developed countries. The neovascular form of AMD, involving choroidal neovascularization associated with fluid exudation or bleeding, accounts for the majority of cases of AMD-related severe central vision loss.
2. Upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in the development and progression of AMD. The management of neovascular AMD has been transformed with the development and advent of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, which is significantly more effective in preventing progressive vision loss from neovascular AMD than previous alternative treatment modalities.
3. Current management of neovascular AMD involves the use of continuing anti-VEGF treatment to control signs of exudation by blocking the growth of abnormal blood vessels to prevent vision loss and potentially improve visual acuity. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents ranibizumab and aflibercept are Health Canada-approved options for the treatment of neovascular AMD.
4. A study was conducted to determine and evaluate change from baseline to week 12 in Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity (CS) as the primary clinical end point in patients with recalcitrant exudative AMD, despite previous ranibizumab treatment who were switched to aflibercept therapy. Other outcome measures recorded and assessed were mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT), and vision-related quality of life using the National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) single composite score. The study found that there was a statistically significant increase in CS and a statistically significant decrease in CRT from baseline to week 12, while mean VA was stable. There was an associated relationship between improvement in CS and mean change in CRT. Of the 40 patients, 65% experienced an overall improvement in NEI VFQ-25 composite score from baseline to week 12.",1
668,"1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system and causes severe cognitive and physical impairments. It is most commonly found in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40. The exact cause of MS is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors, especially viruses, are believed to be involved in its pathogenesis.
2. A study was conducted to evaluate the association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in an Iranian population. The study found that there was no significant association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in the Iranian population.
3. The study also found that the expression level of IL-25 decreased in MS patients, similar to what has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene was not associated with IBD.
4. Another study on Iranian patients with MS revealed that other polymorphisms within the IL-25 gene are associated with MS. Therefore, it may be concluded that other polymorphisms like 4076a > a, 3672 t > ta, 3712 g > ga, and 3463c > ca, but not the c424c/a polymorphism, may regulate IL-25 expression.",1
669,"1. Aortic aneurysm (AA) can be life-threatening, and aorta size is the best criterion for determining if an intervention is necessary to prevent ruptures, dissections, or aneurysm-related deaths. However, even large AAs seldom cause symptoms, and the incidence of aortic disease increases with age.
2. The study aimed to use non-contrast CT in a prospective manner to explore the prevalence of AAs and determine whether screening for CHD and AAs is necessary in a population with multiple risk factors for CHD in a Korean population.
3. The study found that the prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) was 36.5% (181/496) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was 6.0% (30/496). The prevalence of TAA was higher in patients with AAA (64.6%) compared to those without AAA (40.0%).
4. The study found that TAA was associated with various clinical factors, including older age, larger body surface area, and higher diastolic blood pressure. However, TAA was associated with the absence of dyslipidemia, while AAA was significantly associated with the presence of dyslipidemia.
5. The study also found that race influences AAA prevalence and that Asians generally have a low prevalence of AAA. The present study reported a low prevalence of AAA in an Asian population and reinforced the impact of smoking on AAA.
6. The primary limitation of this study is that a CT scan with axial images could not properly evaluate the very proximal portion of the ascending aorta including the aortic root. The study was performed in a population of elderly Asian males with hypertension at high risk for cardiovascular disease, and the results cannot be applied to females, other ethnicities, or groups with a low risk of cardiovascular disease.",1
670,"1. Endometrial cancer has become the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries, surpassing cervical cancer.
2. Early screening methods for cervical cancer have been successful due to improved cytologic preparation methods and a unified evaluation system. There is a need for an effective approach to screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursors to reduce new cases and deaths.
3. A study was conducted to investigate the adequacy of specimens obtained using the SAP-1 device for endometrial cytology tests (ECT) and to evaluate the three-dimensional structure of the endometrium using histology as the gold standard.
4. The SAP-1 sampling device is a flexible latex loop with spines and a smooth tip, designed for minimal pain during sampling. It is noninvasive, cost-effective, and user-friendly, making it suitable for repeated tests.
5. The study found that the SAP-1 sampler provided more sufficient materials for cytology than d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy for histology (p < 0.01). The device was also found to be easier to collect cytology specimens than histology specimens (p < 0.05).
6. The sap-1 sampler combined with surepath preparation may become a reliable method for screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor, especially in postmenopausal and asymptomatic women. If this screening procedure can be used in high-risk factor women, some unnecessary d & c may be avoided, and asymptomatic women with the precursor may benefit from early detection and management.",1
671,"1. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a developing technology in mammographic imaging that has shown promising results in improving the accuracy of mammogram interpretation and reducing recall rates. DBT creates image slices of a tissue volume, which decreases the problem of confusing overlapping tissue and allows for the differentiation of tissues in slices.
2. The addition of DBT to standard mammography has been shown to increase mammogram accuracy, with limited studies demonstrating the potential to decrease recall rates and increase cancer detection. A recent population-based prospective clinical trial (Oslo trial) reported a 40% higher invasive cancer-detection rate when integrating 2-D and 3-D (DM + DBT) mammography screening compared to DM screening alone.
3. The use of DBT doubles the radiation dose in screening, but synthetically reconstructed 2-D images can be made from the DBT data, eliminating the need for double exposures and reducing the radiation dose to that of conventional mammography. The most recent studies of these synthesized images have demonstrated similar accuracy as those of conventional DM.",1
672,"1. Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications, including diphenhydramine, have been criticized for a lack of evidence supporting their efficacy.
2. Diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, is classified as an antitussive (cough suppressant) in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) OTC monograph.
3. Cough is the most common complaint for which patients in the United States seek medical attention, and billions of dollars are spent annually on OTC cough preparations.
4. A study found that diphenhydramine inhibits citric acid-induced cough in healthy volunteers and diminishes pathological chronic cough relative to placebo.
5. The FDA has approved three OTC antitussive products: chlophedianol, dextromethorphan, and diphenhydramine, but none has been shown to inhibit experimentally induced cough in subjects with acute cough due to a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI).
6. Capsaicin cough challenge testing has become an important tool in clinical research, allowing for the accurate measurement of the effect of a pharmacological intervention on the sensitivity of the cough reflex.
7. The study found that a diphenhydramine-containing multicomponent syrup was more effective in suppressing cough reflex sensitivity in subjects with acute URI than a dextromethorphan-containing syrup and placebo.",1
673,"1. The global population is aging, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. Aging is defined as a decreased ability to resist cellular stresses or insults and is a major cardiovascular risk factor. The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases increase dramatically with age, making it the most common cause of death among the elderly.
2. The endothelium, a monolayer of cells that lines blood vessels, plays a primary role in adjusting vascular function. Alterations in the control of endothelial processes, a feature of endothelial dysfunction, often leads to atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders. The endothelium is vulnerable to aging due to its exposure to hemodynamic stresses, oxidized lipids, and oxidative radicals.
3. Exercise has clear health benefits in the elderly, including improvements in endothelial function. Exercise training upregulates antioxidant defense mechanisms and increases nitric oxide (NO) availability, leading to better endothelial function. Regular aerobic exercise can slow down age-related losses in endothelial function.
4. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production of oxidizing agents and opposing antioxidant systems, interferes with endothelial function by reducing NO bioavailability. This reduction is due to the increased production of superoxide anions and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the aging vascular wall, which rapidly inactivate NO.
5. Inflammation also plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Aging increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and CRP, which activate the NF-kB pathway and induce the expression of proinflammatory genes.
6. Exercise has anti-inflammatory effects and can reduce CRP, IL-6, and TNF- levels while increasing anti-inflammatory substances such as IL-4 and IL-10. IL-6, in particular, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting TNF- and IL-1 production and stimulating lipolysis and fat oxidation. Exercise-induced increases in plasma IL-",1
674,"1. The number of metastatic lymph nodes in breast carcinoma patients is associated with the number of removed lymph nodes, and the ratio of metastatic lymph nodes to removed lymph nodes (LNR) provides more useful prognostic information than nodal disease classification.
2. Previous studies have shown that LNR threshold values vary for different prognostic groups, and there is limited research on the prognostic value of LNR in patients with only n1 disease.
3. The current study evaluated the prognostic significance of the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR in breast carcinoma patients with 13 axillary metastatic lymph nodes.
4. The study found that patients with 15 lymph nodes removed had significantly worse DFS, LRFS, and DMFS than those with 6 or more lymph nodes removed.
5. The most significant LNR threshold value separating patients in low- and high-risk groups was 0.20 for DFS, 0.30 for LRFS, and 0.15 for DMFS.
6. LNR has independent prognostic significance for DFS and LRFS, and for DMFS while the number of removed lymph nodes does not.
7. LNR can be used to separate patients with n1 disease in low- and high-risk groups regardless of the total number of lymph nodes removed.",1
675,"1. The text describes the use of phosphatases as catalysts for the phosphorylation of various alcohols using inorganic di/tri/polyphosphates as phosphate donors. Three specific phosphatases, phonsf, phonse, and piacp, were found to be efficient catalysts for this reaction. The substrate scope of these enzymes includes primary and secondary mono- and dihydroxy compounds, as well as cyclic substrates. However, substrates containing N or S nucleophiles or charged groups were not converted.
2. The use of these phosphatases allows for the formation of phosphate monoesters as sole products, yielding environmentally innocuous inorganic monophosphate and unreacted phosphate donor as byproducts. The thermodynamically favored hydrolysis of phosphate esters can be minimized by controlling various reaction parameters, allowing the use of phosphatases in the synthetic direction. Scaleup of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of 4-hydroxybutyl phosphate using an immobilized enzyme in flow mode.",1
676,"1. Non-native biological invasions have been causing damage for centuries, with examples including the phylloxera that destroyed grapevines in Europe and the chestnut blight that eliminated a dominant tree species in North America.
2. Although particular invasions have attracted attention, it wasn't until the 1980s that an international project by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) triggered a surge of research on invasions, recognizing it as a major global environmental change.
3. Research has shown that impacts of introduced species are more varied and widespread than previously thought, with studies focusing on ecosystem-level effects, hybridization and introgression with native species, and the use of molecular genetic techniques to trace sources and routes of invasions.
4. Introduced populations often combine genes derived from multiple source populations, and environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to detect invaders. The burst of research also revealed an increasing number of cases of ""invasional meltdown"" and lag effects.
5. Criticism of invasion biology and management includes claims that the problems are overblown, that introduced species can increase native biodiversity, that the antipathy toward introduced species is xenophobic, that it's a hopeless battle to slow the spread of invasions, and that the methods used to combat invasive species are inhumane.
6. However, research shows that introduced species can cause significant harm, and that managing invasions is both possible and necessary, with biosecurity measures, early detection and rapid response, and eradication or maintenance management methods all playing a role.",1
677,"1. Schwannomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the nerve sheath of the peripheral nervous system and can cause significant morbidity due to nerve involvement or local mass effect.
2. Approximately 25% to 45% of all schwannomas are found in the head and neck, and can originate from any cranial nerve.
3. The most common schwannoma is the vestibular schwannoma, which arises from the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve and accounts for 51% of all nerve sheath tumors.
4. Schwannomas of the vidian canal are much rarer and can present with a variety of clinical symptoms, including decreased lacrimation, corneal desiccation, dryness of the nasal mucosa, and cluster headaches.
5. The vidian nerve contains both parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers, which synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion and innervate the lacrimal gland and secretory pathways of the nasopalatine glands.
6. Damage to the vidian nerve can result in decreased lacrimation, corneal desiccation, dryness of the nasal mucosa, and cluster headaches.
7. Vidian schwannomas can also compress the adjacent internal carotid artery or bulge through the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus to expand into the cavernous sinus.
8. Only four cases of biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannomas and 11 cases of histologically unconfirmed peri-vidian tumors have been reported in the literature.
9. Treatment options for vidian canal schwannomas include endoscopic surgical resection, single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and conventional fractionated radiotherapy using stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT).
10. The choice of treatment modality depends on patient choice, functional status, presenting symptoms, tumor location, tumor volume, and in rare instances, malignant potential.",1
678,"1. The text describes a study comparing the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws placed at the level of a burst fracture in a calf experimental model. The study found that the addition of an intermediate screw decreased the range of motion (ROM) of the spine, indicating enhanced stability. The increase in stiffness was more significant for the monoaxial construct, and there was a significant difference between monoaxial and polyaxial screws in flexion and extension.
2. The text also discusses management options for unstable burst fractures, including anterior, posterior, or combined fixation. Short-segment posterior spinal instrumentation using pedicle screws is a standard method, but it is associated with loss of reduction and instrumentation failure. The biomechanical properties of monoaxial pedicle screws have been widely reported, and additional screws at the level of the fracture increase construct stiffness.
3. The study found that the addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation, irrespective of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used. However, the short-segment construct in the polyaxial screw group had significantly greater ROM in flexion and extension when compared with the monoaxial screw group. The increase in stiffness was more significant for the monoaxial construct, possibly due to better coupling between the polyaxial screw heads and the connecting rod.",1
679,"1. The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for obtaining photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering that is typically needed for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, which prevents the use of conductive plastic substrates. The authors have previously demonstrated the use of ESA with ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes. Minor addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to the ZnO surface brought about a significant impact on the crystal growth for the evolution of various nanostructures and alteration of the crystallographic orientation of the film.
2. The authors have been seeking to perform cathodic electrodeposition of CuSCN, a p-type, wide-bandgap semiconductor, into highly crystallized thin films at low temperature. They have succeeded in achieving 1.3% conversion efficiency for a DSSC in an inverted structure employing a porous p-NiO electrode sensitized with a specially designed dye to achieve a high rectification with kinetically reversible Co(ii/iii) ethylene diamine complex electrolyte. They have also presented a method for ESA of hybrid CuSCN/Rb nanoporous films in which the Rb SDA may be nearly completely removed. By varying the relative concentration of Cu and SCN, they can change the crystal orientation of the resulting nanostructure with respect to the substrate. They explore several preliminary dyes and show photoinduced hole transfer to the CuSCN; in addition, they tested the best systems in photoelectrochemical studies to check the dye-sensitized photocathodic properties. However, they still do not have a good combination of dye and electrolyte for CuSCN. The recent progress with the photocathodic DSSC presents a new opportunity to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized cathode systems that can eventually be combined with existing sensitized anodes for realization of a tandem solar cell to achieve high efficiencies in very simple structures.",1
680,"1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, and is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx.
2. A Tornwaldt's cyst can develop if the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, and if crusts adhere to the orifice without obstruction, this will form the crust type.
3. The crust type of Tornwaldt's cyst is less common and its symptoms include an offensive smell and unpleasant taste caused by the shedding of the crust from the nasopharynx.
4. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, but it can appear at any age, and most of the published literature comprises selected case reports describing the cystic type.
5. A two-year clinicoanatomical audit of nasopharyngeal bursitis at a rhinology practice in a university unit during 2008-2009 was conducted to identify the incidence of nasopharyngeal bursa disease, its different types, and its clinical presentation.
6. Six patients were diagnosed with nasopharyngeal bursitis, and the incidence was less than 1% of all rhinitis patients seen during the study period.
7. The classical cyst type presented with postnasal discharge resulting in hemming, throat irritation, and cough, while the fibrosed type was discovered incidentally in a patient who complained of snoring.
8. The crust type presented with crust expectoration and retching, with or without fetid postnasal discharge, and occasional occipital pain that lasts for a few days, with symptom-free intervals of a few days.
9. Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx after proper nasal decongestion will clearly show either a cyst or ulcer-like lesion covered with crusts, in the midline of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx.
10. The combined endoscopic endonasal and transoral approach with good electrocauterization is a minimally invasive and effective way of treating both types of",1
681,"1. The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing, with an estimated 76,250 new cases and 9,180 deaths in the USA in 2012. Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world.
2. Early diagnosis of melanoma is crucial for successful treatment, and dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that can enhance the visualization of morphological features.
3. Different dermoscopy techniques, such as solar scan, epiluminescence microscopy (ELM), cross-polarization epiluminescence (XLM), and side transillumination (TLM), can increase the morphological details visualized.
4. Dermoscopy can improve diagnostic sensitivity by 10-30% but may lower diagnostic accuracy in inexperienced dermatologists. The diagnosis is highly dependent on subjective judgement and is scarcely reproducible.
5. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve diagnostic performance, but within- and between-observer concordance is low, even for expert observers.
6. In the last two decades, there has been growing interest in automated analysis of digitized images obtained by ELM techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions.
7. Computational intelligence methods can help physicians and dermatologists in faster data processing to give better and more reliable diagnoses.
8. Various border detection, feature extraction, selection, and classification algorithms have been used in automated diagnostic systems, but more research is needed to identify and reduce uncertainties to improve diagnosis accuracy.
9. A comprehensive up-to-date review of automatic diagnostic models for skin lesions is not available, and the emergence of new classification algorithms and techniques necessitates such a review.
10. The paper describes a standard automatic decision support system based on semantic analysis of melanoma images and further classification of characteristic objects commonly found in pigmented skin lesions. The review summarizes and compares advanced dermoscopic algorithms and discusses important issues affecting the success of classification.",1
682,"1. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose, which is induced by both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.
2. The complications of T2D, such as cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and blindness, bring a heavy burden to society.
3. The International Diabetes Federation reported that the number of people with diabetes in the world would rise to 552 million by 2030 if no action is taken.
4. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC-1) gene is a multifunctional regulatory factor involved in various cell functions, and genetic association studies have found associations between PGC-1 loci and T2D.
5. Estrogen-related receptor- (ESRRA) protein binding PGC-1 protein can regulate the expression of the mitofusin-2 (MFN2) gene, and ESRRA is a vital regulator involved in a wide variety of cell functions.
6. MFN2 gene maps on chromosome 1p36.22 and serves as a mitochondrial fusion protein, and tissues with high energetic requirement show high expression of MFN2 gene.
7. A study found that the mfn2-dependent mechanism of mitochondrial control is disturbed in skeletal muscle in animal or human obesity and in patients with T2D.
8. A study examined the associations between the MFN2 and ESRRA genetic polymorphisms and T2D and found that the c allele of rs2878677 of MFN2 gene in the diabetic group was lower than in the control group.
9. The study also found that the allele frequencies and genotype distributions of rs873458 and rs2878677 of MFN2 gene had more significant effects on type 2 diabetes susceptibility in combined populations.
10. The study confirmed that g allele of rs873458 and t allele of rs2878677 in MFN2 gene are associated with higher T2D risk compared with a and c allele, respectively.",1
683,"1. Inter-individual variations in platelet aggregation during clopidogrel therapy have been linked to reduced exposure of the active clopidogrel thiol metabolite and differences in p2y12 receptor occupancy. High on-treatment platelet reactivity and low platelet inhibition during clopidogrel therapy are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, in particular stent thrombosis.
2. Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (cyp2c19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting.
3. Clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation. First, it is oxidized to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic cyp450 enzymes, and then a thiol metabolite is generated. A recent study suggested that a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (pon1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in this second step.
4. A common polymorphism of pon1 (q192r) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the qq (aa) haplotype. In two cohorts of patients with coronary stenting, the pon1 (qq192) genotype was associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis.
5. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 10q24 in linkage equilibrium with the cyp2c19 * 2 loss-of-function variant to be significantly associated with clopidogrel platelet inhibition. However, the GWAS did not find evidence of a significant association of SNPs located on or near the pon1 gene on chromosome 7 with variation in platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.
6. The current study aimed to assess the impact of pon1 (q192r) and cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphisms on clopidogrel platelet inhib",0
684,"1. Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, and humans can become infected as intermediate hosts.
2. If a pregnant woman becomes infected, the parasite can enter the fetal circulation through the placenta and cause congenital toxoplasmosis, which can lead to a range of clinical manifestations including seizures.
3. Seizures are a common presenting symptom in patients with congenital toxoplasmosis, and many of these patients require constant anti-epileptic drug (AED) therapy.
4. There are few reports of detailed descriptions of seizure semiology in patients with congenital toxoplasmosis.
5. The document describes a patient with congenital toxoplasmosis who suffered from intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS).
6. The patient was a 34-year-old Arabian female who presented with medically intractable seizures, hydrocephalus, and visual impairment.
7. Brain imaging revealed multifocal encephalomalacic change related to ventriculoperitoneal shunting, left HS and left amygdala hypertrophy, and multifocal parenchymal calcification including left perihippocampal region.
8. Ictal and interictal SPECT, as well as FDG-PET, confirmed the diagnosis of TLE with HS.
9. The patient underwent left anteromesial temporal resection including the calcified lesion, achieving seizure control.",1
685,"1. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been found to offer substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy in the treatment of cholelithiasis, with similar morbidity and mortality rates. The reduction in pain and disability from laparoscopic cholecystectomy can result in equal or slightly lower treatment costs compared to open cholecystectomy, despite higher charges for laparoscopic procedures. This is due to the shortened period of disability and reduced loss of income for patients.
2. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients found that the average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was significantly higher than that of open cholecystectomies. Decision tree analysis showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective than laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but if charges for laparoscopy could be reduced to certain levels, depending on the conversion rate, laparoscopic cholecystectomy would become cost-effective. Health care providers, including HMOs, are looking for cost-effective providers and institutions must evaluate their procedures to inform health care providers that they are cost-efficient. Matched-pair analysis, decision-tree and sensitivity analyses can facilitate appraisal by each institution as to what can be done to improve care, reduce charges and become cost-efficient in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",1
686,"1. The study found that 56.2% of patients with type 1 diabetes experienced partial remission (PR), without any case of complete remission. The proportion of girls and boys was comparable among remitters and nonremitters.
2. Mean age at diagnosis was similar between subgroups, and height and BMI z-scores were also similar between subgroups and to the distribution of healthy Belgian children. The absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was significantly higher in PR patients than in no PR patients, and this effect was more pronounced in boys.
3. Mean PR duration was 9.2 months, and 71.6% of patients had a PR duration shorter than 1 year. Patients entering PR had a lower baseline A1C than patients with no subsequent PR.
4. A1C levels at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after diagnosis were strongly associated with PR duration. Low A1C levels at 3 to 12 months were associated with longer PR, whereas high A1C levels were associated with shorter PR.
5. PR duration or A1C+2y levels did not correlate with occurrence of severe hypoglycemia or diabetes-related complications. The overall occurrence of PR was comparable to other studies using Idda1c or Dir and A1C levels as PR definition.",1
687,"1. Oral health is essential for the overall well-being of individuals, and oral lesions can significantly impact the daily activities and social life of the elderly population. The prevalence of oral lesions varies based on socioeconomic factors, medical and dental history, treatment expenditure, and handicap. However, there is a lack of research on gerodontology and oral mucosal lesions in the Indian subcontinent.
2. The present study aimed to find the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in 5,100 geriatric patients in India. The study found that 64% of the patients had various oral lesions, with nicotinic stomatitis and denture stomatitis being the most common ones. The hard palate was the most commonly affected site, and males were more affected than females. The study also found that 2% of the patients were diagnosed with malignancies, all of which were squamous cell carcinoma. The study suggests that further research is needed to understand the prevalence and risk factors of oral mucosal lesions in the elderly population, and community programs should be enhanced to educate the elderly and younger generation about oral-mucosal lesions.",1
688,"1. Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that accounts for less than 1% of all primary bone tumors and typically affects the epiphyseal regions of the tubular bones.
2. In the head and neck region, chondroblastoma is uncommon but can occur in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint, resulting in various symptoms such as hearing impairments, dizziness, and trismus.
3. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma are rare but have been observed after irradiation, making radiation therapy not recommended.
4. Chondroblastoma in the temporal bone has unusual histological features that make diagnosis difficult, and incomplete resection carries a high risk of recurrence.
5. A case of chondroblastoma in the temporal bone was initially misdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary treatments and a delay in suitable treatment for this rare chondroblastoma with malignant potential.
6. The patient was a 41-year-old male with a history of chronic hearing loss on the right side, initially diagnosed with otitis media and later found to have a giant cell tumor in the temporal bone.
7. Preoperative histopathologic studies and re-examination of combined MRI/CT scanning indicated the features of chondroblastoma.
8. A generous C-shaped postauricular incision was made, and subtotal resection of the temporal bone and skull base dissection with resection of the TMJ was carried out.
9. Four and a half years after surgery, the patient had no clinical evidence of tumor recurrence or postoperative dysfunction, indicating the importance of accurate diagnosis and modified surgical procedures for the treatment of chondroblastoma in the temporal bone.",1
689,"1. Regular structured exercise has well-documented benefits for cardiovascular and metabolic function, reducing the risk of chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also shows that exercise alone reduces visceral adipose tissue and intrahepatic lipid, both of which are associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk. However, it is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits in reducing these adipose tissue depots.
2. A cross-sectional study found no relationship between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat. Additionally, there was a weak positive association between vat volume and time spent in moderate activity, and total energy expenditure. The inclusion of objectively measured levels of moderate activity and sedentary behavior did not improve the potency of traditional risk factors for predicting liver fat concentration or level of visceral adiposity. The study suggests that the relationship between habitual physical activity levels, sedentary behavior, and metabolically detrimental fat depots such as vat and ihl remains uncertain.",1
690,"1. The source is a retrospective case series of fireworks-related ocular injuries during the Diwali festival over a 5-year period in a tertiary eye care hospital in North India. A total of 53 eyes of 45 patients were included, with 9.43% having open-globe injuries and 90.56% having closed-globe injuries. The majority of the patients were males (39 out of 45) and the mean age was 20.55 years.
2. The study found that the severity of ocular damage was more among patients who ignited the fireworks themselves compared to bystanders. The most common types of firecracker causing injury were bombs. Corneal abrasions, corneal foreign body, and hyphema were the most common anterior segment findings, while vitreous hemorrhage was the most common posterior segment finding.
3. The study also found that serious ocular injuries can occur due to the sudden appearance of unpredictable firecrackers before a person can deploy any defense mechanism. The use of high-velocity fireworks such as rockets and bombs is more frequently associated with facial lacerations, intraocular foreign body, endophthalmitis, and poorer visual outcome.
4. The study highlights the need for public awareness about the possible dangers, prophylactic measures, and expert primary ophthalmic care of the injured to prevent firework-related eye injuries. The manufacture and sale of dangerous fireworks such as rockets and those which produce loud noise should be prohibited to reduce significant ocular morbidity and noise pollution. Firework displays at public places by professionals should be encouraged during Diwali and other major celebrations.",1
691,"1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by an isolated elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with a normal free thyroxine (FT4) level. It is considered to represent early, mild thyroid failure.
2. The clinical significance and optimal treatment of SCH are controversial, and the disorder is typically only treated in pregnant women, infertile individuals, those with symptoms, or those at high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism.
3. SCH has been associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, as well as weight gain, worsening blood pressure, altered lipid levels, and vascular problems. It has also been linked to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome.
4. The relationship between SCH and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an active area of research, and studies have suggested that SCH may lead to impaired cardiac function and an increased risk of heart failure.
5. The European Commission has funded a large, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial (the TRUST study) to assess the potential benefits and risks of thyroid hormone replacement in older adults with SCH. The results of this study are expected to provide further insight into the risks and treatment of SCH.",1

2. CDAD diagnosis widely uses an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B (CD toxins) released by the C. difficile cells. However, the low detection sensitivity of EIA for the CD toxins has been reported.
3. If EIA testing is performed on C. difficile isolates cultured from the same specimen, an EIA GDH-positive and toxin-negative stool specimen may give a toxin-positive result. Bacterial content is higher in specimens containing colonies in solution compared to stool; therefore, toxin concentration may also be markedly higher.
4. If a specimen is GDH positive, follow-up testing with a nucleic acid amplification test, such as PCR, is recommended to compensate for the low sensitivity of EIA. PCR detection of tcdA or tcdB genes is the evidence for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile.
5. There is currently no definite method of determining whether diarrhea is caused by CD toxins present at concentrations below the detection sensitivity of EIA in patients with EIA toxin-negative stool or whether diarrhea is due to a cause other than CD toxins, despite the presence of C. difficile in the stool.
6. The present study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA and found that patients with toxin-negative stool may be dismissed as non-CDAD and thus overlooked in terms of treatment and infection countermeasures.
7. The study also found that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates had milder symptoms, despite having toxin-positive isolates.

693,"1. The DREAM trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with IFG or IGT.
2. The trial recruited 5,269 participants with IFG, IGT, or both, who were randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone and followed for a median of 3 years.
3. The primary outcome was new-onset diabetes or all-cause mortality, and a substudy of 982 participants had OGTTs at baseline, 2 years, and at the end of the study.
4. The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow-up, assessed using the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
5. Participants receiving rosiglitazone had a significant increase in IGI/IR and a significant decrease in PI/C, while participants receiving ramipril had no significant changes in IGI/IR or PI/C.
6. Longitudinal analyses found that rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI and reduced PI concentrations over time, while ramipril did not significantly affect adjusted IGI or PI concentrations.
7. After accounting for baseline -cell function, rosiglitazone significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes, while ramipril did not have a significant impact on diabetes incidence.",1
694,"1. Microbial communities differ from monocultures in terms of the toxins they degrade, the natural products they produce, and their capacity to grow in certain environments. A complete understanding of microbial metabolism must consider both the properties of individual strains in pure culture and the combinatorial interactions supported by complex communities.
2. Interacting partners in microbial communities share metabolites such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose. It is possible to extrapolate interactive dynamics from the individual characteristics of the participating strains.
3. Optimization-based techniques of flux balance analysis have been successful in describing metabolic systems. These approaches can be extended to higher-order systems of multiple strains in coculture.
4. Certain pairs of auxotrophs will complement one another's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites, a relationship referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT).
5. The SMIT interactions constitute a class of synthetic genetic interactions, reflecting and elucidating the genetic and metabolic network from which they derive.
6. A quantitative and predictive theoretical model has been developed to reveal the extent to which complex metabolic interactions emerge from the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network.
7. The study selected 46 conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli strains from the Keio collection, each exhibiting robust growth in rich medium but no measurable growth in minimal medium.
8. A subset of mixed pairs showed improved growth relative to either corresponding monoculture, indicating metabolic synergy. Growth phenotypes were variable, with alternately one strain, both, or neither benefiting from the interaction.",1
695,"1. Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome (BSS) is a rare genodermatosis characterized by the progressive formation of adnexal skin tumors, including trichoepitheliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas, due to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CYLD on chromosome 16q12q13.
2. A 71-year-old woman was evaluated for progressive development of asymptomatic lesions on her head for the past 4 years, and biopsies confirmed the presence of spiradenomas and one cylindroma.
3. Her family history and physical examination of her daughters suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the disease.
4. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation c. 1628_1629delct in the patient and her two affected daughters.
5. The syndrome is characterized by the progressive development of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, with clinical manifestations starting since puberty and a higher incidence in females.
6. BSS has been associated with an increased risk of salivary gland neoplasms and other tumors, although with little evidence.
7. The loss of deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis, and germ-line mutations predispose to the disease.
8. The case presents a late onset and a relatively low number of cylindromas and trichoepitheliomas found, which may support the hypothesis about the influence of the concrete germline mutation and the variable presence of a somatic mutation in the development of the final phenotype.
9. Proper diagnosis, periodic follow-up, and genetic counseling are imperative for patients with BSS.",1
696,"1. Biological scaffold materials derived from human, bovine, and porcine dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa have been used in soft tissue repair applications such as hernia repair, breast reconstruction, staple-line reinforcement, and orthopedic applications. These scaffold materials are particularly useful in clean-contaminated or contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria.
2. Absorbable polymer scaffolds, such as Dexon and Vicryl, have been developed and are comprised of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and a copolymer of glycolide and lactide, respectively. These scaffolds degrade in vivo via hydrolysis, with full resorption expected in approximately 60-90 days for Dexon and 60-90 days for Vicryl. However, animal studies have shown that Dexon is quickly resorbed and associated with hernia formation after just 14 days, and clinical studies have shown that Dexon has primarily been utilized in damage control situations to cover the open abdomen until granulation tissue is present and a skin graft can be applied.
3. More recent absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, TIGR Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly. These scaffolds have been evaluated in animal studies and clinical trials, with promising outcomes for hernia repair applications. However, larger, more comprehensive clinical trials are needed to fully understand the long-term capabilities of these scaffolds.",1
697,"1. Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, mediated by van genes with vanA and vanB being the most prevalent, has been a significant issue in hospitals for over 25 years, leading to high mortality and costs.
2. Several European countries, including Denmark, have reported a rising incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in recent years.
3. Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, using selective culturing and/or detection of the resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR.
4. A study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert VANA/VANB assay and its impact on infection control decision-making was conducted in a laboratory serving a population of 800,000 inhabitants in Denmark.
5. The Xpert VANA/VANB assay, a fully automated system integrating DNA extraction and real-time PCR, provides results within an hour and was implemented to guide rapid infection control measures.
6. The study found that the vanA pcr results were useful in guiding infection control measures, with 141 isolation days saved due to faster available negative pcr results and 292 saved transmission risk days due to rapidly available positive pcr results.
7. However, false-negative or false-positive pcr results led to additional transmission risk days and isolation days.
8. The diagnostic accuracy of the vanA part of the Xpert VANA/VANB assay was excellent, but the vanB part had low specificity and positive predictive value.
9. The study demonstrated that the Xpert VANA/VANB assay had a considerable impact on infection control decision-making, but further studies are needed to conclude on the generalizability of the results.",1
698,"1. The study found that aldosterone antagonism, specifically with the drug ru28318 (ru), can prevent or reverse ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in both normal and diabetic hearts. Ru was generally more effective in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal hearts compared to treatment with an ACE inhibitor (captopril) or ARB (losartan) alone. In diabetic hearts, ru was similarly effective as captopril or losartan treatment. Dual therapies involving ru were similarly effective as capt + los therapy, whereas triple combination was generally equal to or the most effective strategy in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal or diabetic hearts.
2. The study also found that the effectiveness of drugs generally appeared to be cardiac parameter specific, with some drugs being better at improving one cardiac function parameter over others. For example, ru was ineffective at improving pmax (peak rate of pressure development) but was the most effective at improving dp/dt (rate of pressure development) when administered to diabetic hearts after ischemia. This may imply that ru may not improve systolic function but may show marked improvements in diastolic function in diabetic hearts when given after ischemia.
3. The study showed that ru importantly improves diastolic function (as measured by dp/dt) in diabetes especially when given after ischemia and thus early-stage ru treatment may represent a novel strategy for treating diabetes-induced diastolic dysfunction. The study also found that irrespective of whether drugs were administered before or after ischemia, their effectiveness in recovering cardiac function appeared to be time-dependent, with drugs rapidly improving cardiac function within the first 10 minutes of reperfusion followed by a period of steady improvement thereafter up to the 30-minute study period.
4. The study suggests that mr signaling is detrimental for all cardiac parameters in nondiabetic hearts during ischemia as well as reperfusion phases, whereas in diabetic hearts, at least for pmax, it may be detrimental only during the ischemia-induced phase of i/r injury. The reasons for the differential response in pmax in diabetes are not understood but clearly require further study. The study also highlights that in addition to the",1
699,"1. Modern nasal surgery aims to improve both the cosmetic appearance and natural functions of the nose, while respiratory medicine emphasizes objective measurement of airway patency.
2. Acoustic rhinometry (AR) is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry by analyzing reflected acoustic impulses, and it has shown a close correlation with rhinomanometry measurements.
3. In a study of healthy Iranian volunteers who underwent cosmetic rhinoplasty, nasal dimensions such as length, minimal cross-sectional area (MCA), and volume were evaluated using AR before and after surgery.
4. The study found that certain nasal dimensions, such as bilateral D1 and both MCAs, decreased significantly after surgery, while MCA1 increased significantly in the decongested state of the group with septoplasty.
5. Double osteotomy in rhinoplasty alone led to a significant increase in MCA1, and placing a columellar strut had a significant effect on both MCA1 and MCA2 levels in rhinoplasty plus septoplasty cases.
6. Regression analysis showed no significant effect of septoplasty, osteotomy, or placing a columellar strut on the difference after surgery in MCA1, MCA2, and v.
7. AR evaluation of the nasal airway is accurate when compared with MRI and CT, and it provides less variability of results than rhinomanometry. It can also offer objective documentation and diagnosis for better treatment of nasal airway blockage.
8. A meta-analysis demonstrated that an overall significant improvement following septal surgery is present, and operations on the nasal septum are frequently performed to improve the nasal airway.",1
700,"1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths, and its incidence is still increasing. Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
2. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to have beneficial effects in reducing the risk of CVD. The lipid-lowering action of n-3 PUFAs was detected at the beginning, and they were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders. Their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects were observed later. Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease featured by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through the disease progression.
3. N-3 PUFAs, specifically EPA and DHA, have been shown to exert pleiotropism, modulating a range of diverse target mechanisms involved in CVD development. The incorporation of EPA and DHA into the cell membrane influences its organization, fluidity, and permeability, as well as the activity of transmembrane proteins, including receptors, enzymes, and ion channels. Both EPA and DHA modulate K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channel activities in myocardial cells, regulating myocyte electrical excitability and contractility.
4. DHA incorporation into the membrane of endothelial cells stimulates ATP release from the endothelium, increasing vasodilation by stimulating nitric oxide (NO) release. The induction of NO release, together with the decrease in noradrenaline levels, may also account for the BP-lowering effect of DHA. A recent meta-analysis including thirty randomized controlled trials showed that prolonged fish oil intake may reduce HR, especially in populations with a high baseline HR. In dyslipidemic males and postmenopausal women, this decrease appears to be mediated by DHA rather than EPA.",1
701,"1. The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is based on the work of three pioneering pathologists.
2. Rudolf Virchow, the father of modern pathology, proposed that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation.
3. Pelayo Correa, a pathologist from Colombia, published a model for gastric cancer development in 1975, hypothesizing that the development of the more common intestinal subtype of gastric cancer results from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over the next 30-50 years.
4. Robin Warren and Barry Marshall, awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005, discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.
5. H. pylori infection is a definite (group 1) carcinogen and significantly increases the risk of gastric cancer.
6. The odds ratio for h pylori in gastric cancer is no different when considering intestinal vs diffuse histologic cancer subtypes.
7. H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer.
8. Recent studies have shown that h pylori eradication decreases the risk of gastric cancer development by approximately 40% in studies of primary prevention and by 54% as a tertiary prevention strategy.",1
702,"1. The study compares the functional and anatomical outcomes of bevacizumab and ranibizumab therapies in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Turkey. The results show that both groups had significant improvements in mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) at every time point, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The mean number of injections and complications were also similar in both groups.
2. Previous clinical studies have reported similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes with bevacizumab and ranibizumab treatments. A retrospective study by Feng et al. found no statistical difference in visual acuity changes between the two groups after a median follow-up time of 12 months. The study also reported that both drugs were effective in stabilizing visual acuity in AMD patients after 12 months of follow-up.
3. The CATT study, a multicenter noninferiority trial, found that as-needed bevacizumab was equivalent to as-needed ranibizumab in visual acuity and anatomical outcomes at 12 months. However, the mean injection numbers were higher in the ranibizumab group than the bevacizumab group. The study also addressed safety issues and reported no statistically significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two drugs. However, other studies have shown that the safety issue remains a debate. The study's strengths include similar baseline characteristics of the two groups and no other forms of treatment received by patients in the bevacizumab and ranibizumab groups.",1
703,"1. Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, complicating 25% of all pregnancies. The presence of proteinuria in women with gestational hypertension is clinically diagnosed as PE and is associated with increased maternal or neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, several studies have shown that proteinuria is not a significant predictor of adverse outcomes.
2. The incidence of PE has increased in China due to the opening of the two-child policy. Severe PE is often combined with hypoalbuminemia, which may serve as an indicator of the severity of PE. Hypoalbuminemia occurs due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged and increased permeability of vascular endothelial cells.
3. Intravascular dehydration due to hypoalbuminemia may accelerate the appearance of intravascular lesions, which is thought to be a predisposing factor of the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet) syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
4. A retrospective cohort study of 299 women with PE was conducted to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes according to the different values of albumin (25 g/l and <25 g/l). The study found that women with severe hypoproteinemia (SHP) were delivered earlier, had a higher percentage of cesarean sections, and were more likely to present with severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta than women with mild hypoproteinemia (MHP).
5. Neonatal outcomes were worse in the SHP group, with a significantly lighter average birth weight, higher rates of fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries.
6. A univariate logistic regression analysis found that SHP was a significant risk factor for cesarean section, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes in PE women.
7. Hypoalbuminemia is considered a factor of poor maternal and neonatal outcomes in PE. The study found that SHP was a significant",1
704,"1. The use of anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy, specifically the humanized monoclonal antibody Avastin (Bevacizumab), has been successful in treating various human cancers such as colorectal, lung, and renal cell carcinoma. However, its withdrawal for treating breast cancer in the United States highlights the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments and the need for careful cost-benefit analysis.
2. Other growth factors, such as VEGF-C, VEGF-D, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Placental Growth Factor (PIGF), can promote resistance to Avastin and contribute to tumor angiogenesis. These growth factors can modulate the effect of VEGF-A by displacing it from VEGFR-1 expressed on endothelial cells or act as alternative ligands for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, promoting lymphangiogenesis.
3. Inhibiting signaling by VEGF family members could potentially have pro-tumor effects, such as increased tumor metastasis due to hypoxia-induced tumor cell motility. Other signaling pathways, such as those driven by PDGF, IGF, and FGF growth factor families, and alternative molecular targets like c-Met, may also be important in promoting tumor growth and provide valid therapeutic targets for inhibiting angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis in cancer.
4. Recent studies suggest that known inflammatory pathways can enhance the spread of cancer, and existing anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin could provide a cost-effective and population-based preventative approach to cancer in Asian countries.",1
705,"1. Malaria is still a major public health concern in many countries, including Iran, particularly in the south and southeast regions. In Iran, P. vivax is responsible for the majority of malaria cases, while P. falciparum accounts for 10-15% of the cases.
2. Iran has implemented control measures that have resulted in a significant reduction of malaria incidence in recent years. The country has also initiated a malaria pre-elimination program since 2009, and interventions such as preventing strategies, active case detection, and timely appropriate treatment of patients have been performed in all endemic areas.
3. To achieve malaria elimination, early recognition of all parasite carriers bearing various disease symptoms and parasite rates is crucial. Active surveillance by precise laboratory methods in endemic areas provides an appropriate tool for detection of all kinds of infections, particularly asymptomatic ones containing low parasite densities.
4. A study was conducted in Bagh-e-Malek, a low transmission region in Hormozgan province, to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections by means of three malaria diagnostic tests (microscopy, RDT, and nested-PCR). The study found that nested-PCR detected three P. vivax carriers that were missed by microscopy and RDT. The study suggests that molecular methods should be used in addition to microscopy and RDT to improve sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for active case surveillance in endemic settings.",1
706,"1. Over the last two decades, new immunotherapy approaches for cancer treatment have been developed due to increased understanding of the immune system and its interaction with tumors.
2. Some of these agents have been approved for standard clinical use, such as infusional cytokine therapies for melanoma or renal cell cancer, intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer, and an active cellular therapy targeting prostatic acid phosphatase for patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer.
3. Other agents have shown benefit in large clinical trials and are expected to be approved, such as a monoclonal antibody targeting a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor targeting CTLA-4 for advanced melanoma.
4. To be clinically approved, these treatments need to demonstrate safety and positive impact on patient care and outcome. However, some agents may be best used in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies.
5. Evaluating these agents using traditional paradigms for clinical development has been challenging, and there is a need to identify markers of biological response associated with clinical outcome.
6. For antigen-specific vaccines, it has been relatively straightforward to evaluate immune responses to the target antigen as a biomarker of immunological efficacy. However, there are few instances in which target antigen immune response has been associated with clinical benefit.
7. For broadly active immune modulating agents, such as anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies, appropriate biomarkers of response have been more elusive.
8. Studies have sought to identify whether amplification of other T-cell costimulatory molecules or antibodies to defined antigenic tumor-associated proteins might be useful as biomarkers.
9. For whole cell tumor vaccines where there is not a specific, defined antigen being targeted, surrogate antigens known to be expressed by the tumor vaccine have been used as a means of monitoring immune responses from the vaccine.
10. Researchers have used SEREX-based studies to identify immunologically recognized proteins expressed by normal and malignant prostate tissue that might serve as targets for anti-tumor vaccines. These antigens might also have diagnostic value, as igg responses have been found to distinguish individuals with prostate cancer from men without pro",1
707,"1. Bone mass density and architecture are dependent on mechanical factors, and cell mechanical stimulation promotes the proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic lineage.
2. The study explores the use of the converse piezoelectric effect to mechanically stimulate bone using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films.
3. PVDF films were coated with an acrylic material and bonelike particles to improve cell adhesion and assure electrical insulation.
4. The actuator device was programmed to apply a 5V square wave of 1Hz and 3Hz for 15 minutes at each frequency, once every 24 hours.
5. The study found that total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher compared to static controls, and the increment of bone occupied area was due to new bone formation.
6. The study also found that the mineral apposition rate was significantly higher around actuated devices than around static devices.
7. Immunohistochemistry failed to detect differences in TRAP expression between the two groups, but there is a marked elevation in OPN detection around actuators.
8. The results suggest that the generated strains were enough to elicit a response, and the increased OPN expression around actuators is most likely associated with mechanical stress.",1
708,"1. The study was conducted to estimate the serum level of L-fucose (a tumor marker) among various TNM stages in oral cancer patients and compare them with healthy individuals. The study found that serum level of L-fucose can't be correlated with age and gender.
2. The study included 60 oral cancer patients and 30 healthy controls. The mean serum value of L-fucose in cancer group (10.85 mg/dl) and control group (3.47 mg/dl) shows a wide margin of difference (7.38 mg/dl).
3. The study found a negative correlation between serum fucose levels and histopathological tumor differentiation. The mean serum value of L-fucose increased as the stages of oral cancer progressed.
4. The study also found a significant rise in the level of glycoprotein-associated carbohydrates such as hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid in cancer patients compared to control subjects.
5. The study noted that fall in serum fucose levels after treatment has been reported in many studies, but the follow-up period has to be long enough for significant serological alteration. However, rise in serum fucose level is not specific for cancers, as elevated serum fucose levels have also been reported in other pathological states.
6. The study concluded that serum L-fucose levels can be used as an easy, noninvasive, cost-effective, biochemical indicator of cancer detection, staging, therapeutic success, prognosis, and as a posttreatment evaluation tool. Further investigation on a large scale is required to prove serum L-fucose as an effective tumor marker in the diagnosis and management of oral cancer.",1
709,"1. LCN2 mice were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells and backcrossed onto the B6 background for 10 generations. They were used in experiments along with wild-type mice to study the effects of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and cold exposure.
2. LCN2 mice gained more body weight and increased adiposity, particularly when fed an HFD or aged. Food intake, ambulatory activity, oxygen consumption, and respiratory quotient were not significantly different between RCD-fed wild-type and LCN2 mice.
3. LCN2 mice exhibited cold sensitivity and could not survive when exposed to 4°C for more than 10 hours. Cold exposure caused a 10-fold increase in LCN2 gene expression in adipose tissue in wild-type mice.
4. LCN2 mice expressed significantly lower levels of UCP-1 and PGC-1 genes in BAT upon HFD feeding, but these genes were markedly stimulated at an even higher level in LCN2 mice after exposure to 4°C for 5 hours.
5. The protein expression levels of ATGL in WAT were slightly reduced in LCN2 mice under the HFD and cold condition compared with wild-type mice. Cold-induced HSL gene expression in BAT and WAT was completely diminished in LCN2 mice.
6. The expression of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function was significantly reduced in BAT of LCN2 mice fed an HFD. The expression of transcription factors and CPT-1 gene in skeletal muscle was also significantly downregulated in LCN2 mice fed an HFD.
7. LCN2 mice were more glucose intolerant and insulin resistant than wild-type controls when fed an HFD. The changes in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity after HFD in LCN2 mice were not simply due to body weight effects.
8. LCN2 mice displayed increased inflammatory state in adipose tissue and liver, suggesting that lcn2 possesses anti-inflammatory role in metabolic regulation.",1
710,"1. Male Wistar rats were obtained from Sankyo Labo Service Co. Ltd. in Sapporo, Japan and were housed in individual cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with unlimited food and water and a 12-hour light/dark cycle.
2. The rats were given 0.3-mg/kg LPS intravenously on days 1 and 2, and 20-mg/kg methylprednisolone intramuscularly on days 3, 4, and 5 to promote the development of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).
3. The rats were divided into two groups: weight-bearing (WB) and non-weight-bearing (NWB). The WB group was allowed to walk and move independently in individual cages, while the NWB group had their hindlimbs unloaded to prevent weight bearing.
4. The rats were then sacrificed, and the femur and humerus were harvested and fixed with 10% formalin-0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.
5. The bone samples were decalcified with Kalkitox and then neutralized with sodium sulphate buffer.
6. The tissues were processed for routine haematoxylin and eosin staining to assess the general architecture and osteonecrosis of the femoral and humeral heads.
7. Histopathological osteonecrosis was defined as the diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis.
8. Femoral head osteonecrosis was observed in 63.6% of WB rats and 54.5% of NWB rats, with no significant intergroup difference.
9. The results suggest that weight bearing is not related to the development of non-traumatic ONFH in rats, but the rat model may not be useful for observing the mechanism of femoral head collapse.
10. Further research is needed to clarify the aetiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of non-traumatic ON",1
711,"1. Nurses play a crucial role in health care delivery and their experiences and insights can help improve the quality of service delivery and inform health systems strengthening. However, historically, nurses have had limited involvement in national policy and political decisions that affect health service delivery. This is partly due to lack of awareness of policy-related issues and processes, inadequate knowledge and skills on how to contribute to policies, and lack of opportunities to contribute to policy decisions. Gender differences in the health care system have also contributed to this underengagement, with men more likely than women to be involved in public policy and to influence policy decisions.
2. Several strategies can be applied to enhance nurses' engagement in policy processes, including assuming formal leadership positions in the health care system and indirectly engaging through lobbying and advocacy with policy-makers via professional organizations. Nurses can also build their understanding of and competencies in policy and politics by integrating pertinent courses in nursing training and fellowship programs. However, there is a need to strengthen LMIC nurses' research abilities to enhance their ability to understand, generate, and utilize research knowledge that is useful for policy change. Very few empirical studies have examined the extent of nurses' involvement in policy development processes in the African context, and there is a need for more research in this area.",1
712,"1. UTI is common in infants and young children, but the frequency, symptoms, and causative organisms vary by sex, age, and gender. Non-specific signs and symptoms in neonates require a complete sepsis workup and a 7-14 day course of antibiotic therapy, typically parenteral ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin.
2. Recent reports show emerging patterns of resistance toward empirical antibiotics, especially ampicillin, making the early choice of antibiotics more challenging. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent long-term consequences and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
3. Clinical manifestations of UTI in neonates are non-specific and systemic, including fever, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, growth failure, abnormal urination, and jaundice. The non-specific presentations make UTI hard to diagnose, with a reported prevalence ranging from 4-25% in very low weight infants to 0.1-1% in term infants.
4. UTI in newborns could lead to urosepsis or neonatal sepsis, which is why it is often managed as a case of sepsis. Most UTIs in infants are caused by gram-negative bacilli, with E. coli being the most prevalent organism in all ages, including the neonatal period.
5. A retrospective review of all UTI cases managed in an inpatient setting of a neonatal division aimed to determine the frequency of UTI causative organisms in neonates admitted to the neonatal division of Bahrami Children's Hospital over an eight-year period.
6. The study found that E. coli was the most prevalent organism (64.4%), followed by Enterobacter (19.2%), Klebsiella (9.6%), and S. epidermidis (6.8%). No cases of Proteus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, S. aureus, or Enterococcus were found over the study period.
7. E. coli was found to be mostly resistant toward ampicillin (93.6%), cefixime",0
713,"1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders that cause a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of all affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
2. The deficiency of 21-hydroxylase leads to decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, causing adrenal gland hyperplasia. Cortisol and aldosterone precursors are diverted to androgens, resulting in increased virilization and a chronic hyperandrogenic state.
3. There are different clinical forms of CAH associated with 21-OHD: classical CAH, which includes both salt-wasting (SW) and simple virilizing (SV) forms, and the non-classical (NC) form. Several studies have suggested high concordance rates between genotype and phenotype in patients with the classic form of CAH.
4. Treatment of CAH involves replacement of glucocorticoids and, when necessary, mineralocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and suppress abnormal androgen and steroid precursor secretion. However, conventional glucocorticoid replacement cannot mimic natural circadian rhythms of cortisol release, leading to potential over- or under-suppression and related health issues.
5. The text describes a study investigating the frequency of white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in patients with CAH due to 21-OHD. The study included 26 patients, regularly followed at the Department of Endocrinology in Mahdia and Sfax, Tunisia, and diagnosed based on clinical and biochemical criteria.
6. The study found that 42.3% of patients showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, temporal lobe atrophy, and hippocampal dysgenesis. These abnormalities could be the",0
714,"1. The human genome draft sequence, delivered by publicly funded and corporate projects, promises significant biomedical advances this century.
2. Biologists need to become adept at navigating the vast genomic DNA data, which contains rich veins of knowledge about gene function.
3. Different communities of biologists have different dialects, particularly with respect to the term 'function'. A universal vocabulary is necessary for the genome to offer up its secrets to all scientific communities.
4. There are two common ways of annotating (assigning names and functions to) genes: one is based on empirical observations, and the other on predicted evolutionary relationships.
5. The second type of annotation relies on predicted evolutionary relationships, where genes that are thought to have arisen from a common ancestor are defined as homologs.
6. Homologous gene products invariably have similar tertiary structures and frequently also have similar functions. By applying the concept of homology, the problem of predicting the functions of all genes is brought within the realms of possibility.
7. Annotating genes by homology has a pitfall: homology is defined on the basis of evolution, rather than function. Consequently, homology assignment indicates only an approximate direction for future empirical determination of function.
8. The first completely sequenced genomes, such as that of Haemophilus influenzae, were annotated following searches of all available sequence databases with each predicted gene product.
9. Domains are homologous portions of sequences that are encoded in different gene contexts and have survived the evolutionary tests of time without fragmentation. They represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution.
10. Pfam, SMART, Prosite, and Celera are some of the resources that detect domains using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments, either hidden Markov models (HMMs) or generalized profiles (GPS). These resources carry considerable redundancy, although each has its own merits.",1
715,"1. The text describes a study that compares four commercially available online heart rate monitoring systems (Polar Team Pro, Acentas Team Monitoring System, Suunto Pro Team Pack, and Activio Sport System) for their use in team sports. The study found that all systems allow real-time monitoring of multiple individuals simultaneously, and transmit data wirelessly to a receiver connected to a laptop. However, a direct comparison of these systems and the validity of the recorded data are missing in the literature. The study aimed to compare all systems in a field test against each other, evaluating operating distance, validity against a commercially available ECG, and the installation and use of the software and hardware of the systems.
2. The study found that Acentas and Polar led the field in hardware evaluation, while Activio offered the most harmonious concept in software evaluation. The installation procedure was easiest with the Acentas software, but Polar and Activio provided more developed software tools. The study also compared the systems' performance against an ECG and found that Acentas gave a reference with 349 meters, followed by Activio with 141 meters, Suunto with 107.5 meters, and Polar with 102 meters. Regarding failure quota, Acentas had an average downtime of 148 seconds (0.6%), Polar had 286 seconds (1.0%), and Activio had 552 seconds (2.0%). The study concludes that every system has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the using purpose, location, and weather. Therefore, the study cannot recommend a single system but rather shows the strengths and weaknesses of all systems and can be used for further system improvements.",1
716,"1. In the 1960s, McCulloch and Till proposed three functional characteristics of stem cells: self-renewal, extensive proliferation, and the ability to give rise to multiple cell types. These characteristics have been observed in stem cells found in the lung, which have been identified through their role in airway repair and response to injury.
2. In proximal airways, tracheal basal cells expressing keratin-5 (k5) or keratin-14 (k14) have been identified as capable of stem-like behavior in response to injury. Squamous cell carcinoma, which frequently arises in the more proximal tracheobronchial airways, has been associated with elevated levels of k5 basal cells.
3. In middle airways, mature clara cells can proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny in response to injury, and ccsp-positive cells located within neuroepithelial bodies (neb) have been shown to repair the airway. Small cell lung carcinomas, which frequently arise in the mid-level bronchioles, have been associated with cells expressing cd44 and multidrug resistance 1 (mdr1).
4. The distal airway has no consensus on the cell surface marker phenotype of representative lung stem cells. However, cells expressing surfactant protein c (sp-c), stem cell antigen-1 (sca-1), and cd34 but not expressing cd45 or pecam have been shown to act as pluripotent and self-renewing in culture.
5. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that relatively rare, multipotent cells gain unlimited proliferative potential and drive tumor growth, leading to heterogeneity within the tumor. Lung cancer stem cells have been associated with worse prognosis and increased resistance to cisplatin-based therapies. The specific targeting of lung cancer stem cells or the pathways that confer stem cell-like properties to lung cancer cells may be possible in the near future.",1
717,"1. The study evaluates the impact of urethral plate characters, such as shape and width, on the success of tip urethroplasty for managing primary anterior penile hypospadias in 100 children.
2. The study took place at Mayo Hospital, Hodeidah, Yemen, between January 2010 and December 2013.
3. The study used Snodgrass technique with modifications, and patients were categorized based on the width and character of the urethral plate.
4. The study found that patients with urethral plate width < 8 mm had a statistically significant higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibration compared with patients with urethral plate width > 8 mm.
5. The study also found that patients with flat urethral plates had a higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibration compared with patients with cleft or deeply grooved urethral plates, although not statistically significant.
6. The overall complication rate was 8% for fistula, 12% for failed 8 fr calibration, and 1% for partial dehiscence.
7. The study suggests that a narrow urethral plate (<8 mm) is inadequate for creating a neourethra, leading to a higher fistula rate.
8. The study also highlights the potential benefits of urethral plate augmentation with buccal mucosal graft (BMG) when the urethral plate is narrow and inelastic.
9. The study concludes that tip urethroplasty has good cosmetic and functional results, offering a modality for hypospadias repair with several advantages.
10. The study suggests that patients with flat and narrow urethral plates may require augmentation by BMG to improve the results in this group of patients.",1
718,"1. The study aimed to develop a prototype to measure the bracket debonding force in vivo and compare the bond strength obtained with the prototype in vitro. A polypropylene plier was modified to include a strain gauge, which was connected directly to the claw where the bracket is attached for debonding. The bond strength obtained with the prototype was compared with the tensile bond strength test in a universal testing machine.
2. The prototype showed high accuracy and precision in measuring the bracket debonding force. The mean bond strength obtained with the prototype (2.96 MPa) and the tensile test in a universal testing machine (3.08 MPa) were statistically similar. The adhesive remnant index score 3 was predominant in both groups, indicating that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding.
3. The prototype was developed to control the influence of the operator's hand on the strain gauges, which were previously placed in the active arm of the pliers. By placing the strain gauge near the claw, the new prototype was not influenced by the way it was held, confirming its superiority to the previous one.
4. The study suggests that the prototype might be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo. However, it is difficult to establish a numerical value for safe clinical performance of orthodontic bonding procedures due to several factors that affect bond strength values. Therefore, determining the bracket bond strength values in vivo would be useful.
5. Debonding with the prototype was shown to be a safe method for preserving the enamel surface, as the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding, with the least probability of harming the enamel.",1

It has been associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes including pelvic inflammatory disease, low infant birth weight, and premature delivery. TV infection can also increase transmission and acquisition of other STIs, including HIV infection.
2. A cross-sectional analysis of behavioral and biological data from a cohort of women in Peru was conducted to understand the epidemiology of TV infection in women. The study found that TV infection was more likely in older women, those with less education, single women, women who reported unprotected sex with a nonsteady partner, and women who reported multiple sex partners.
3. The study also found that there was no association between any vaginal symptoms and TV infection, suggesting that syndromic management of TV may result in both over and under treatment. The asymptomatic nature of TV infection could contribute to a long duration of infection and continued spread of infection in the population.
4. The findings support the need for improved disease control activities to reduce adverse trichomoniasis-associated reproductive health outcomes such as ectopic pregnancy, low infant birth weight, preterm labor, and non-HPV associated cervical neoplasia. Further studies are needed to determine if screening and treatment of TV will improve the reproductive health and birth outcomes of women.",1
720,"1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, characterized by specific types of seizures, EEG patterns, and cognitive impairment.
2. LGS is caused by various congenital or acquired etiologies, and it is notoriously difficult to treat due to multiple seizure types and cognitive impairment.
3. The typical age of onset of LGS is between 2 and 5 years, and boys are affected about 5 times more often than girls.
4. The prognosis of LGS is poor, with regard to both seizures and cognitive outcome.
5. Valproic acid is considered the most useful initial medication of choice for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS.
6. Rufinamide is a triazole derivative granted orphan drug status for the adjunctive treatment of LGS in the United States in 2004 and is approved for treatment of LGS in children 4 years of age and older.
7. Rufinamide's mechanism of action involves decreased firing of high frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.
8. Rufinamide has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effectiveness in animals and humans, and it has an excellent safety profile in animals and lacks obvious cognitive side effects and behavioral toxicity at clinically relevant doses.
9. A single double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial has shown that rufinamide is well tolerated and efficacious for seizures in LGS.
10. A larger number of patients must be treated with rufinamide to establish its role in the treatment armamentarium, and the role of this new medication in relationship to prior drugs with some reported effectiveness in LGS needs to be further defined.",1
721,"1. The Iberian wall lizard (Podarcis hispanica) exhibits interpopulational variation in morphology and femoral gland secretions of males, which may lead to premating reproductive isolation between some populations. Lizards from the northern populations (fuenfra and golondrina) are larger, heavier, and have larger, more robust heads than those from the southern populations (aranjuez and belmonte). These differences may be explained by phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation to different climatic conditions.
2. Chemical analyses of femoral gland secretions revealed that males from each population have a unique and characteristic mixture of compounds, which results in differential chemosensory recognition between some populations. The effectiveness of chemical and visual communication may differ between populations due to variations in the number of femoral pores and blue spots. Compounds found in femoral gland secretions varied in composition and proportions between populations, which could be due to local adaptation to habitats or differences in diets.
3. Chemosensory recognition experiments demonstrated that individuals of P. hispanica from each population could detect scents of lizards from any population. However, lizards showed different tongue-flick rates depending on the population of origin of the lizard's scent presented. Males from some populations (aranjuez, fuenfra, and pedrezuela) showed a clear discrimination and interest for scents of females from their own population against scent of females from any other population. Females also seem to discriminate male chemicals between areas (north versus south), but not between populations. These results suggest that reproductive isolation between some populations of P. hispanica is possible, which may indicate cryptic speciation.",1
722,"1. The scientific production of the Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (FMUSP) was analyzed, focusing on the full professors who were on staff during the period of 2001 to 2006. This group of professors published a total of 1,960 articles, which represents 0.04% of worldwide scientific publications, 2.4% of national publications, 4.3% of the all-time total publications of the FMUSP, and 12.33% of the total publications of the FMUSP during the same period.
2. Of these articles, 68.7% were published in international journals, and 31.3% were published in Brazilian journals. The obligatory use of the English language in some Brazilian journals has led to better visibility and accessibility of research results.
3. The study also found that approximately 89% of the articles were published in international journals with assigned IFs, providing high worldwide visibility. However, the analysis of these IFs should take specific research areas into account because some areas have a greater number of researchers in comparison to others.
4. The study found that the average publication rate of the full professors was five published articles per year per professor. This is higher than the productivity of professors and researchers from the FMUSP during the period of 2003 to 2007, which was 3.1 articles per teacher per year.
5. The data from this study can be useful in analyzing the scientific production of a group of professors from the FMUSP and for establishing a basis for comparison with other institutions in Brazil. It could also possibly be used to evaluate the output of scientific production in the entire field of health.",1
723,"1. Rubella infection during early stages of pregnancy has a 90% potential of passing through the placenta and reaching the fetus, which can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
2. Vaccination of susceptible individuals or women in reproductive age can prevent the disease and its complications in fetuses.
3. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent CRS, which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.
4. The most commonly used rubella vaccine globally is derived from the Ra27/3 virus strain, which provides more immunity and has a similar immune response to natural infection.
5. In Iran, rubella and mumps vaccines were added to the national vaccination plan in 2003, resulting in 98% vaccination of the 5 to 25 age group and a decrease in measles and rubella cases.
6. A study in Kermanshah, Iran, showed a significant increase in immunity against rubella in vaccinated versus unvaccinated girls, with 99.3% and 79.6% immunity, respectively.
7. Mass rubella vaccination in Iran has significantly increased anti-rubella antibodies and immunity in high-risk people, and there is no need to screen vaccinated girls at marriage. However, it is recommended to perform rubella seroepidemiology studies every few years to monitor immunity status and vaccinate vulnerable members if necessary.",1
724,"1. Quantum dots (QDs) are a new type of inorganic fluorophore that have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between the excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching. These properties make QDs an ideal candidate for detecting multiple mRNAs in ISH protocols and for rna detection in whole embryos.
2. Researchers have determined that the greatest limitation of QDs for use in ISH protocols is penetration, as commercially available QDs are quite large and therefore fail to penetrate the many cell layers of an embryo or are significantly trapped if they do. However, the study shows that proteinase K can render Xenopus embryos sufficiently permeable to allow QD penetration deep within embryonic tissues. The study demonstrates that QD detection of endogenous messenger RNAs is effective and that it can be used to provide ISH data of higher resolution than current techniques. The study also shows that QDs can be used to carry out two-color ISH simultaneously.
3. The use of QDs to perform nonamplified fluorescent whole mount ISHs in Xenopus embryos, one of the most highly autofluorescent (and thus demanding) vertebrate developmental organisms, suggests that QD whole-mount ISHs will find successful applications in most developmental models. The study describes a new application of QDs in nonamplified whole-mount fluorescent in situ detection of endogenous mRNAs, which provides unprecedented resolution and strong signal intensities that have not been possible to attain using traditional fluorophores. The study also suggests that QDs could be introduced as alternative fluorophores in other fluorescent in situ hybridization assays where their spectral properties can offer significant advantages.",1
725,"1. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer with a high mortality rate and a low survival rate. The survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC can vary based on several factors, including demographic characteristics, pathologic nature of the tumor, and treatment type.
2. Cox proportional regression models have been used to estimate the relative impact of distinct risk factors on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC. These models have shown that demographic factors such as gender, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, and time period of diagnosis, as well as clinical factors such as tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases, have a significant impact on PDAC survival.
3. The most dramatic influence on PDAC survival is surgical resection of the tumor, but less than 20% of patients are suitable for surgical resection. The combination of surgery with radiation and chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival compared to surgery alone.
4. Two nomograms have been developed to estimate the survival for patients who have undergone pancreatectomy and the risk of perioperative mortality in PDAC patients scheduled to undergo pancreatectomy. However, the utility of these nomograms is limited to the relatively small fraction of patients with resectable PDAC.
5. Recently, two new Cox regression models were developed to estimate the survival for patients with resectable and unresectable PDAC. These models use variables such as age, gender, race, tumor stage, tumor site, tumor grade, and radiotherapy. Based on these models, an interactive, online clinical calculator was developed to estimate survival probability for patients diagnosed with PDAC.
6. The calculator can estimate personalized survival probability, which can influence personal decision making, disease-related anxiety, and quality of life of cancer patients. However, the calculator does not provide standard errors of the survival estimates and its reliability and generalizability were not checked.
7. In the present work, SEER data on 18,352 pathologically confirmed cases of PDAC were used to develop Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted by several covariates. Based on these models, a web-based, real-time prognostic tool for estimating survival and conditional survival probabilities was developed.",0

2. The diagnosis and management of CLI were based on the Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) or its revised consensus (TASC II). PTA was utilized as the first-choice procedure for revascularization.
3. The indication for PTA was judged by consensus among vascular specialists, including vascular surgeons. Lesions that were heavily calcified and/or had diffuse occlusions were not considered feasible for PTA.
4. Major amputation was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control their foot lesions. The indication for amputation was judged by consensus among plastic surgeons as well as vascular specialists.
5. Preoperative variables considered in the analyses included sex, age, activities of daily living (ADLs), Fontaine stage, the presence of infection, diabetic condition, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, receiving regular hemodialysis, and serum albumin level as a nutritional marker.
6. Diabetic condition was determined as the presence of diabetes in the whole population and as a glycemic control in the diabetic population. The diagnosis of diabetes was based on World Health Organization criteria, whereas glycemic control of diabetic patients was evaluated by HbA1c.
7. A total of 278 CLI patients undergoing primary PTA procedures were recruited. Diabetic patients had a significantly higher prevalence of Fontaine stage IV and hemodialysis than those without diabetes.
8. The study found that diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared with nondiabetic patients (p = 0.008, log-rank test), whereas they had a similar life prognosis (p = 0.717).
9. The presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation in both the whole population and in the diabetic population. A1c level was independently associated with major amputation in the diabetic population. The categorized a1c level",1

Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus, and is common in areas with close contact between intermediate hosts (such as sheep) and definitive hosts (such as dogs). The disease often presents with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other organs. After treatment, patients require long-term follow-up to detect any relapses or newly growing cysts. Current serologic techniques for post-operative monitoring have limitations, and there is a need for improved immunodiagnostic tools.
2. A study was conducted to examine the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of CE, and to determine the diagnostic performance of Western blot. The study found that antigenic bands with molecular weights of 52, 24, 39, 46, 63, and 6061 kDa were specific for hydatid disease and had higher diagnostic value. The 39 kDa band reactivity decreased significantly in post-operative samples, but persisted in two patients who had a relapse at two-year follow-up. The antigenic fractions of 52, 46, 39, and 24 kDa in combination may serve as useful diagnostic markers. Western blotting appears to be a useful method for diagnosing hydatidosis and for post-surgical monitoring, as antibodies against proteins of 24 and 39 kDa constitute a good marker for post-surgical monitoring.",1

The study included 66 patients with obesity class I, II, or III, who were treated in the outpatient department of hypertension and lipid disorders of WAM University Hospital in Lodz, Poland.
2. The study found that patients with class III obesity had lower mean serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared with patients from the other two groups. Negative correlations were found between BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and HDL-C.
3. Positive correlations were found between WC, WHR, VAI, and TG/HDL-C. The study also found that lipid disorders were the most frequent concomitant disorders in the study population.
4. The study suggests that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C. The vai index demonstrated the strongest correlation with TG and HDL-C levels and with the lipid indices TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C. The positive correlation observed between WHR and TG/HDL-C ratio is also supported by other studies. The study highlights the relationship between some selected obesity indices, especially those pertaining to visceral obesity, and lipid parameters.",1

2. There are both positive and negative uses of the internet, including research, communication, and business transactions, as well as pornography, excessive gaming, and gambling.
3. There is concern worldwide about internet addiction, which has been labeled as a subset of behavior addiction and can be measured using the 6 core components of addiction.
4. Different terms have been used to describe internet addiction, including pathological internet use (PIU) and problematic internet use.
5. The prevalence of internet addiction varies, with estimates ranging from 6% to 14% in different populations.
6. Studies have identified various types of internet addiction, including cyber-sexual addiction, cyber-relationship addiction, net compulsions, information overload, and computer addiction.
7. A study was conducted in Mumbai, India to examine the prevalence of internet addiction and its association with psychopathology in college students.
8. The study found that out of 1000 students, 987 were included and 74.5% were moderate users, 24.8% were possible addicts, and 0.7% were addicts.
9. Males were significantly more likely to be addicted than females, and addicts had poor mental, physical, and mental health scores.
10. The study suggests that further research is needed to understand the relationship between internet usage and psychopathology, and to formulate interventions for internet addiction.",1

2. A bias voltage was used to down-mix the resistance change occurring at the actuation frequency, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier. Typical measurement values were 1.5 V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz.
3. All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same setup, with the drive electrode disconnected.
4. The allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration, and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
5. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within the resonator's bandwidth. The measurement setup was based on a previous one, but here each signal was doubled, using two drive signals at different frequencies, two bias signals, and two measurement signals.
6. The phase traces were converted to frequency traces corresponding to different integration times. The complete phase response of the resonator was used rather than the linear approximation. The correlation of these frequency traces was then calculated versus the integration time.",1

2. A study was conducted to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention in a nationally representative sample using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012.
3. The study found that among the total sample eligible for aspirin as primary prevention, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and over three fourths of primary prevention patients were classified as low risk.
4. Among high-risk primary prevention patients, less than half received a recommendation to take aspirin, while over one fourth of low-risk patients were also recommended to take aspirin.
5. Among those told to take aspirin by their physicians, the vast majority complied with the recommendation.
6. The study also found that education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention among primary prevention patients.
7. The results suggest that decisions for treatment recommendations seem to be being made on criteria other than objectively calculated future CVD risk, and there is a need for improved clinical decision support to aid in making accurate decisions.",1
732,"1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate signaling pathways related to tumorigenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses. Increased mitochondrial and oxidant content appears to correlate with stem cell differentiation, while low mitochondrial mass and oxidant content correlates with stem cell maintenance.
2. In the epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium regulated by stem cell populations, mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production promote signaling through pathways required for differentiation of mammalian stem cell populations in vivo. Conditionally deleting TFAM, a gene required for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome, in basal undifferentiated epidermal keratinocytes leads to an epidermal barrier defect and impaired differentiation.
3. MROS generation is required for activation of the Notch and β-catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth, respectively. Nucleoredoxin (NXN) has been identified as a putative target of MROS-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, with NXN becoming oxidized in wild-type keratinocytes treated with Wnt-3a, but not in TFAM cko keratinocytes.
4. Cellular differentiation may depend on availability of acetyl-CoA to carry out acetylation reactions. Most cytosolic acetyl-CoA is produced through the cleavage of TCA-cycle-derived citrate by the enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACL). Inhibition of ACL expression prevents global increases in histone acetylation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.
5. Mitochondrial metabolism may promote keratinocyte differentiation by providing substrates for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone demethylases (such as JMJD3). The demethylase JMJD3, which uses oxygen, Fe(II), and the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate as cofactors, is potentially sensitive",1
733,"1. A new in situ hybridization (ISH) technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSALII) has been established to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissue sections. This technique was found to be reliable and specific for detecting HCV RNA in humanized liver of HCV-infected chimeric mice and in human liver biopsy specimens.
2. The new ISH technique was compared with nested RT-PCR and found to be successful in detecting HCV RNA in 82% of chronic hepatitis C lesions, while nested RT-PCR was successful in 73% of the same lesions. However, no HCV-RNA was detected in hepatitis B virus-related lesions, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions.
3. The new ISH technique is relatively simple and requires no special equipment to perform, making it a valuable tool for routine histopathological diagnosis of HCV infection using FFPE liver biopsy specimens. However, further technical improvement is needed for reliable and reproducible HCV-RNA detection in FFPE specimens.",1
734,"1. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been shown to affect wild animals and humans, with many chemicals altering the thyroid system in vertebrates.
2. The OECD and EPA have established guidelines for investigating frog metamorphosis as a way to study thyroid toxicity, as frogs are particularly susceptible to contaminants in wastewater and their metamorphosis is regulated by thyroid hormones.
3. Thyroid hormones (THs) are produced and secreted in essentially the same way in amphibians and mammals, and there are several processes that can influence the thyroid hormone balance.
4. Environmental contaminants can disrupt TH metabolism by targeting various processes, such as sulfation, deiodination, glucuronidation, and competitive binding to thyroid transport proteins.
5. Amphibian thyroid hormone sulfating activity is present in the liver cytosol and can be inhibited by chemical compounds, while glucuronidation is a relatively minor pathway that can reduce circulating TH levels through biliary elimination.
6. Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 2b1 is induced by pentobarbital in some adult frogs but not in tadpoles or other adult frogs, and deiodinase enzymes are found in several peripheral target tissues in amphibians.
7. Thyroid hormone receptor antagonists and agonists can affect the rate of metamorphosis in frogs, and the sensitivity to TH varies according to the developmental stage.
8. Several thyroid disrupting substances have been tested for toxicity using amphibians, with some chemicals affecting the thyroid system and metamorphosis in frogs.
9. The OECD and EPA have established guidelines for testing chemicals using the amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA), which represents a generalized vertebrate model based on the functions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis.",1
735,"1. Cesarean sections (CS) performed for medical indications are necessary for saving lives and preventing maternal or perinatal complications. The appropriate rate of use should be one associated with the lowest rate of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
2. However, there has been an increase in the number of women undergoing CS without any medical indication, contributing to higher CS rates worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a CS rate of 10-15%.
3. A study in Iran showed that the rate of CS increased six-fold over the past three decades. The debate on the best practices to minimize postnatal morbidity is still ongoing from both professional and women's perspectives.
4. The postpartum period is a critical life event for women, leading to physiological, emotional, and social changes. Women experience certain physical health conditions that may affect their quality of life (QOL), future health, and the health of their children.
5. A study was conducted to explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health-related QOL. The study found that women with vaginal delivery (VD) had higher mean physical HRQOL scores than after CS, but mental HRQOL scores were similar.
6. The study also found that women with VD showed more improvements on total mental HRQOL from time 1 to time 2 assessment. However, mental HRQOL at 2 months after delivery was better in the CS group, but differences were not significant in each of the parameters.
7. The study suggests that VD leads to better physical health at 2 months after delivery and physical and mental health at 4 months after delivery. The findings recommend future studies to include both general and specific questionnaires in assessing postpartum QOL among women with VD, elective CS, and emergency CS.",1
736,"1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-known theory that describes human needs as a pyramid, with physiological needs at the bottom and self-actualization at the top. Physiological needs include food and sex, while safety needs include personal and financial security, and health and well-being.
2. Safety needs can be more fundamental than physiological needs, as they can block the satisfaction of physiological needs. For example, a deer cannot eat when it is being chased by wolves.
3. The brain processes threatening information faster and more sensitively than rewarding information, due to a phenomenon called negativity bias. This bias is a protective strategy that has evolved to help organisms respond adaptively to survival threats.
4. Emotions, such as fear, serve to regulate behavior and can initiate appropriate approach/avoidance behaviors in response to potential threats.
5. The amygdala is the neural basis for fear and stress-elicited fear and anxiety. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala promotes autonomic reactions and stress-like behavior, while amygdala ablation reduces fear and increases tameness.
6. Safety needs, including personal security and financial security, are the most fundamental needs for human kind and are related to the unexpected ways in which stimuli occur. The process model of appraisal theory, which proposes that emotional processes depend on the predictability of stressful events, is more accurate in explaining safety needs.",1
737,"1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are involved in various physiological functions such as blood pressure regulation, nociception, adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory activity, organ regeneration, insulin potentiation, podocyte integrity, and cellular responses to bacterial infection.
2. EETs are derived from arachidonic acid via metabolism by cytochromes P450, particularly members of the 2c and 2j families.
3. The ratio and stereocomposition of EET isomers are dependent on the specific cytochrome P450 isoform, making them species- and tissue-specific.
4. Numerous chemical and metabolic factors complicate investigations into the roles of EETs and limit their therapeutic utility.
5. The half-life of 14,15-EET is estimated to be only seconds to minutes due to hydration by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH).
6. Inhibition of sEH can elevate EET levels, offering a potential pharmacologic intervention strategy.
7. However, sEH inhibition may be less effective than agonist replacement therapy when endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised.
8. To address the stability limitations of natural EETs, various surrogates with improved stability have been prepared and evaluated.
9. The described surrogates modify the free carboxylic acid of previous generation EET mimics while retaining key structural features.
10. These surrogates were evaluated for vasorelaxation and sEH inhibition, with varying levels of activity observed depending on the bioisostere and its position along the carbon chain.",1
738,"1. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) is a model of care that aims to provide quality, coordinated, and cost-effective care to patients. It is an extension of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and has been proven to reduce patients' healthcare costs and improve patient care quality. Over 1,500 sites and 7,700 clinicians across the United States have successfully completed the NCQA recognition process and are functioning as PCMHs.
2. The transition to PCMH can be difficult, with common concerns including promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records. To become recognized as a PCMH by the NCQA, a practice must provide documentation of its guidelines for implementation and adhere to PCMH principles that fit the specific practice structure. The model emphasizes team-based care, with staff addressing patient treatment decisions collectively and care coordinators performing tasks that were previously delivered inconsistently or not at all. However, the adoption of multidisciplinary team members in the education and support of patients can be challenging due to issues with time, salary, responsibilities, and workload. Additionally, many practices face the challenge of reimbursing care coordinators' work as it is typically not covered by health insurance at all or only to a limited extent.",1
739,"1. The survival rate from cardiac arrest has improved over time due to increased CPR training and the availability of portable defibrillators. However, many patients still do not survive or have significant neurological damage upon hospital discharge.
2. Mild hypothermia therapy has been proposed as a way to protect the brain during CPR and has been shown to increase survival and improve neurological function in animal studies. This therapy has also been shown to be effective in clinical trials and is recommended by the American Heart Association for certain cases of cardiac arrest.
3. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mild hypothermia therapy in patients with cardiac arrest. The analysis included six studies with a total of 531 adult patients.
4. The results of the meta-analysis showed that hypothermia does improve the survival rate (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.05-1.49, p = 0.01) and neurological function (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.13-1.66, p = 0.001) of patients with cardiac arrest. However, mild hypothermia does not influence the incidence of rearrest or other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and bleeding.
5. The analysis also found that the methodological quality of the included studies was generally low, with only three studies describing the method of generating a random sequence correctly and two studies using a sealed envelope for allocation concealment.
6. The authors conclude that mild hypothermia therapy is safe and effective in improving the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest, but note that the number of trials and study size was inadequate and that there was clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the studies. They recommend further research to analyze the impact of different cooling measures and hypothermia duration on survival rate and neurological function.",1
740,"1. In the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, a male factor is recognized and is responsible for approximately 40% of marital infertility. Varicocele is a common male factor, characterized by persistent enlargement and elongation of the pampiniform plexus, venous convolution, and sinus formation with transient or permanent backflow.
2. The exact cause of varicocele remains unclear, but it is believed to be due to increased hydrostatic pressure within the testicular vein, leading to venous stasis, testicular hyperemia, and compromised testicular oxygen concentration. This can result in atrophic changes within convoluted tubules, leading to arrested testicular growth in children and adolescents on the affected side.
3. A high-grade varicocele can be detected during a meticulous andrologic examination involving inspection and palpation of the genital organs while standing up. Grading the varicocele is usually based on the Dubin Amelar 1 to 3 scale, and a diagnosis based on inspection and palpation should be confirmed by accessory ultrasound.
4. A retrospective study of 82 adolescents who underwent laparoscopic repair for idiopathic varicocele with testicular hypotrophy found that an increase in left testicular volume was found in 85.1% of patients with unilateral varicocele and in 85.7% of subjects operated on for bilateral disease.
5. Semen analysis performed in all subjects who had undergone laparoscopic varicocele repair in adolescence revealed normozoospermia in 85.2% of patients, while the remaining 14.7% had oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, or teratozoospermia with persistent testicular hypotrophy.
6. Laparoscopic varicocele repair resulted in a significant increase in hypotrophic testicular volume in 83.8% of subjects. However, opinions of experts on the efficacy of laparoscopic varicocele repair are divided.

741,"1. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is the standard treatment for localized prostate cancer, with numerous studies demonstrating excellent tumor control, good functional results, and low morbidity. However, the major long-term morbidity is erectile dysfunction, which is caused by injury to the cavernosal nerves.
2. The cavernosal nerves were identified as branching from the pelvic plexus and running as a plexus of small nerves within a neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates.
3. A study was conducted to describe periprostatic nerve distribution and construct a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution. The prostate, seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum were removed en bloc from five adult male human cadavers and stained with anti-s-100 antibody neural stain to delineate the precise location of neural tissue.
4. The study found that the average number of nerve fibers in the ventral part of the prostate was significantly fewer than in the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts. The average distance from the prostatic capsule to nerve fibers was similar in all four parts. The average thickness of nerve fibers in the ventral part was significantly decreased compared to the other parts.
5. The three-dimensional model of the periprostatic nerve fibers revealed an almost even distribution and nearly similar thickness of periprostatic nerve fibers on dorsal and both lateral parts. However, the nerve fibers in the ventral part were substantially fewer in number and decreased in thickness.
6. Recently, several descriptions of the neurovascular bundle have been proposed, including the presence of other nerve branches running between the prostatic capsule and endopelvic fascia. These findings challenge the traditional knowledge of the neurovascular bundle and serve as a guide for improved results for nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.",1
742,"1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive, autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and degradation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein that is released in response to inflammation or infection and its production is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines.
2. SAA is not only an acute-phase protein but also a kind of apolipoprotein, relevant in cholesterol metabolism. During inflammation, SAA can contribute up to 80% of HDL apolipoprotein composition, impairing the protective function of HDL and increasing the oxidation of LDL, which may be associated with cardiovascular disease.
3. SAA is also the precursor of amyloid A protein, a fibrillar, insoluble product deposited in major organs, which carries a risk of organ failure and premature death in the course of secondary amyloidosis. AA amyloidosis is a late complication of RA, connected with active, long-standing, and disabling disease.
4. A study was conducted to assess the concentration of SAA in RA patients with different disease activity, with reference to other inflammatory, metabolic parameters, as well as CV and renal disease risk factors. The study group consisted of 140 RA patients who were treated in the department of rheumatology and connective tissue diseases.
5. The results of the study showed that serum SAA concentration was high above normal in the vast majority of RA patients. Elevated above normal SAA levels were found not only in patients with high disease activity but also in those with low or moderate disease activity assessed with DAS28. This observation suggests that in spite of favorable clinical assessment, sustained inflammation persists in most of RA patients and may be connected with the disease complications.
6. The study also indicated that in RA patients, SAA could be considered as a biomarker associated with both the current inflammatory disease activity and chronic complications, the risk of CV and renal involvement in the course of RA. Persistently elevated SAA concentration increases the risk of amy",0

2. In an allergic asthma model, allergen challenge induces a corticosterone surge that is paralleled by increased eosinophilia of bone marrow in vivo and by increased responsiveness to IL-5, the major eosinopoietic cytokine, ex vivo.
3. Perforin deficiency, which is known to induce complex changes in leukocyte populations, presents a selective defect in granulocyte production that can be corrected by wild-type lymphocyte transfer.
4. Bone marrow cellularity, as well as bone marrow eosinophil and neutrophil counts, is significantly lower in pfp mutants than in b6 mice and that this difference can not be dismissed as created by undue comparisons of two groups differing in body weight, age, or both.
5. Perforin is mainly expressed in various effector/regulatory lymphocyte subsets, and the perforin-related defect in bone marrow response to dexamethasone could be corrected by introducing b6 lymphocytes in pfp mice.
6. The number of lymphocytes for transfer into individual mice was defined on the basis of similar reconstitution studies, and elimination of a particular lymphocyte subpopulation defined by standard surface markers prevented reconstitution of the dexamethasone response.
7. The transferred lymphocytes provided something that was lacking in the recipient, and the defect is selective for granulocytes, which are not the major circulating leukocyte subpopulation in mice.",1
744,"1. India has a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with 62.4 million reported cases.
2. Fear of hypoglycaemia and weight gain are common barriers to insulin therapy initiation.
3. Modern insulin analogues offer a convenient approach to glycaemic control, with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and favourable weight changes.
4. The A1chieve study, a 24-week non-interventional study, assessed the safety and effectiveness of insulin analogues in T2DM patients in routine clinical care.
5. The majority of patients started on or switched to biphasic insulin aspart, while others used insulin detemir, insulin aspart, basal insulin plus insulin aspart, or other insulin combinations.
6. After 24 weeks, hypoglycaemic events reduced in both insulin-naive and insulin user groups for all insulin types, and quality of life improved.
7. Body weight decreased in the insulin detemir group, and all glycaemic control parameters improved for all insulin types.
8. The study suggests that insulin analogues are effective and safe for treating T2DM in Mumbai, India, although the findings are limited by the number of patients.",1
745,"1. Many cell types have been studied for cardiac regeneration, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skeletal myoblasts, bone marrow-derived progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and resident cardiac stem cells.
2. ESCs can differentiate into cardiovascular lineages, but concerns about teratoma formation, graft-versus-host disease, and bioethics have hindered their clinical use. iPSCs, generated from adult somatic cells, may address these concerns by eliminating the need for embryos and reducing tumorigenesis risk.
3. MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, but can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes under specific conditions. They can be rapidly expanded and are less immunogenic, making them suitable for autologous and allogenic transplantation. However, their propensity to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues limits their use.
4. Skeletal myoblasts can be harvested, expanded, and autologously reimplanted, with less prone teratoma formation and higher resistance to ischemia compared to ESCs. However, true cardiomyocyte differentiation has not been observed in vivo, leading to dyssynchronous contractions and increased arrhythmias.
5. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, including hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Intracoronary infusion of these cells has shown improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct scar size, and left ventricular end-systolic volume in patients with acute myocardial infarction or chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.",1
746,"1. Polyhalite is a mineral commonly found in sedimentary evaporite successions and in rare cases in volcanic successions. It was first described in Austria and has since been found in many salt deposits worldwide.
2. Polyhalite is associated with other minerals such as halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.
3. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, and later confirmed. It can be synthesized in laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C.
4. Polyhalite forms early diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact with the precursor rock.
5. Polyhalite is stable between room temperature (0-25°C) and 255-343°C, making it useful for absolute age dating in deciphering the geological history of a region.
6. In the Haselgebirge evaporites of the Northern Calcareous Alps, polyhalite is a minor but widespread and important constituent, occurring mainly intergrown with anhydrite or as vein fillings.
7. The alpine polyhalites are of secondary origin, and their formation in marginal marine shallow water sedimentary environments is only suspected.
8. The Hallstatt salt mine in the Eastern Alps is within the Upper Permian-Lower Triassic Haselgebirge Formation and contains a wide variety of polyhalite microfabric types.
9. The age of the Haselgebirge evaporites is estimated to be late Carboniferous (?) or early Permian to Eocene, and the area experienced widespread synsedimentary and diagenetic Pb mobilization during the Permian/Middle Triassic to Lower Upper Triassic rift stage and passive margin formation. The Hallstatt-Meliata ocean was being closed during the Late Jurassic, and gravitational sliding occurred from",1

Inhibiting ROS formation, scavenging ROS, or interfering with ROS pathogenic signaling pathways could protect against oxidative stress-induced ailments.
2. Propofol, a highly lipid-soluble anesthetic, has antioxidant effects and has been shown to ameliorate oxidative injury in various organs. It is chemically similar to the endogenous antioxidant tocopherol (vitamin E).
3. The effects of high-dose propofol on the lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant indices in rodents have not been determined.
4. In this study, rats were treated with propofol at a human therapeutic dose (2 mg/kg body weight) and twice the therapeutic dose (4 mg/kg body weight) for four weeks.
5. The results showed that propofol at both doses significantly increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, while significantly decreasing the levels of serum HDL cholesterol.
6. Propofol at 2 and 4 mg/kg significantly increased the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, indicating an increased detoxifying and antioxidant capability of the liver.
7. Propofol at 2 and 4 mg/kg significantly increased the activities of serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phosphokinase, indicating cardiotoxicity.
8. The study suggests that the use of propofol in patients with cardiovascular or lipid disorders should be carefully reviewed.",1
748,"1. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is a rare genetic disorder caused by deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus.
2. The prevalence of IHH is about 1/10,000 in men and 1/50,000 in women, with a male to female ratio of 4-5:1.
3. Due to the rarity of IHH, it is often difficult for a single clinical center to perform comprehensive assessment of the disease.
4. With the advances in information technology, people have utilized networks for different research purposes, including medical research.
5. Network investigation is a new modality of medical research that can cover large populations with low investigation costs, especially for investigation of a rare disease in a particular network social group.
6. The study collected the clinical data of IHH patients in China by interviewing IHH patients through network questionnaire and their medical records.
7. The study found that the mean age of the 74 male IHH patients was 27.3 ± 3.4 years, and the mean age at disease onset was 15.2 ± 6.6 years.
8. The study also found that hormone replacement therapy could improve the conditions of IHH patients effectively, and the commonly used gonadotropin + androgen therapy appears to be superior to androgen replacement alone.
9. The study utilized a web-based disease-specific social networking group for investigation, which can include more participants, obtain information more quickly and conveniently, and express sexual function and other private information freely.
10. However, network investigation has some disadvantages, such as bias in patients selection and the use of layman's language for communication.",1
749,"1. Nonsurgical endodontic retreatment is often used to eliminate or reduce the microbial content in endodontically failed teeth. However, well-compacted root fillings can make this process difficult by resisting the instruments used for retreatment and leaving residues.
2. The use of rotary files can help remove the bulk of gutta-percha-based fillings, but complete removal is not always achieved. Extruded irritants, such as root canal filling materials, necrotic pulp tissues, bacteria, or root canal irrigants, can cause postoperative inflammation, flare-ups, and impaired healing.
3. A study was conducted to evaluate the extrusion of debris apically after the use of ProTaper Universal Retreatment Files (RFS) and different finishing files for removing residual root canal fillings. The finishing files used were ProTaper Next (PTN), WaveOne (WO), and Self-Adjusting File (SAF).
4. The null hypothesis tested was that the three different supplementary files used would exhibit no significant differences in the amount of debris extruded. However, the results showed that the Wo file used after RFS extruded significantly more debris, followed by Ptn and Saf.
5. The Saf file was associated with the least extrusion of debris among the three experimental groups. This may be due to its hollow file design, which adapts to the canal irregularities and has an abrasive surface that helps create fine dust while shaping.
6. The Wo files, which have a modified triangular cross-section and larger taper, were associated with a higher amount of debris extrusion. This can be attributed to decreased cutting efficacy and smaller chip space, which can result in auguring the formed debris after instrumentation.
7. The Ptn file system had very rare reports on the apical extrusion of debris with its instrumentation. This design provides more cross-sectional space for enhanced cutting, loading, and successfully allowing the debris to travel out of a canal.
8. The results of the study suggest that using supplementary files, such as Saf, after RFS can result in less extrusion of debris and provide a cleaner root canal, facilitating removal of the residual root fillings that cause periapical extrusion of debris.",1

The anterior and middle superior alveolar (AMSA) nerve block is a technique proposed by Friedman and Hochman in 1998 to anesthetize multiple maxillary teeth with a single injection without causing collateral anesthesia of the face. The injection site is located palatally and targets the confluence area of the anterior and middle superior alveolar nerves.
2. A controlled clinical study was conducted to determine the success rates of pulpal anesthesia with the AMSA nerve block technique using the conventional syringe. The study involved 30 Caucasian patients, with an average age of 22 years old, who received an AMSA nerve block on one side of the maxilla. The anesthetic success of the technique was monitored using an electric pulp tester.
3. The results showed that the anesthetic induction times ranged from 6 to 12 minutes, and the duration of pulpal anesthesia ranged between 23 - 40 min. However, not all patients obtained pulpal anesthesia in all experimental teeth, and some patients (26.7%) had no anesthetic success in any of the experimental teeth.
4. The study concluded that the AMSA nerve block technique using a conventional syringe has low success rates compared to studies using a computer-controlled system. The low success rates could be due to the difficulty in controlling the anesthetic flow with a conventional syringe. The technique may be clinically useful in restorative dentistry and periodontal surgery due to its excellent hemostatic control in palatal soft tissues.",1
751,"1. Malaria is a serious public health problem in South-East Asia, including India, with the majority of cases in India (76%) and a high mortality rate, particularly in rural areas and among children.
2. A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in RS Pura Health Block of Jammu District in Jammu and Kashmir State in North India to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding malaria among inhabitants.
3. The study found that the majority of participants had heard of malaria, correctly associated it with mosquito bites, and had knowledge of malaria symptoms, prevention, and treatment. However, knowledge about the cause and spread of malaria varied.
4. The study suggests that creating awareness through mass media is an effective model of intervention in the prevention of malaria and that KAP play an important role in lowering local disease burden and shaping the future discourse of research on local approaches to prevention of endemic diseases in India.",1
752,"1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have improved our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome.
2. The dynamic folding of chromatin is crucial in regulating gene expression and DNA replication.
3. The genome is folded in a hierarchical manner into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), where specific long-range looping interactions occur.
4. TADs, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size, exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions and are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions.
5. TAD boundaries are associated with the enrichment of certain proteins and histone marks and serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences.
6. BRG1, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions and for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions.
7. BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength, and its loss affects nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization.
8. BRG1 plays a role at TAD boundaries by regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization, and its loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and preclude the binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries.
9. The association between BRG1 knockdown and reduction in TAD boundary strength may be due to perturbations in the recruitment of CTCF and topoisomerases, which may affect the integrity of the chromatin structure and the stiffness of the chromatin at TAD boundaries.",1

754,"1. Electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in enzyme catalysis, assisting in ligand binding and facilitating enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions by positioning and stabilizing reacting species. These interactions are modulated by conformational changes during the catalytic cycle.
2. To understand the catalytic role of electrostatics and conformational motions, researchers probed the active site electrostatic environment of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecdhfr) using thiocyanate probes and various spectroscopic techniques.
3. The electrostatic interactions arising from the active site microenvironments led to different observed CN vibrational stretching frequencies and CNMR chemical shifts along the catalytic cycle. Mixed quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) analyses of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reproduced experimentally measured vibrational frequency shifts.
4. The electrostatic contributions from the active site microenvironments surrounding the probe were decomposed into major components (individual residues and ligands), and the experimentally validated theoretical model allowed for the examination of the electric field along the hydride transfer pathway.
5. This integrated approach provides valuable insights into the interplay between electrostatic and conformational changes along the catalytic cycle of ecdhfr, highlighting the importance of enzymatic conformational changes that alter the active site electrostatics.",1
755,"1. Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIO).
2. MPI relies on the superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and magnetic saturation ability of SPIO to provide high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios.
3. Possible application scenarios for MPI include cardiovascular imaging and intervention guidance, with the potential to visualize and quantify vascular pathologies and determine additional functional parameters in a single examination.
4. MPI requires suitable scanners and appropriate tracer material, with long-circulating SPIO being desirable for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
5. The circulation time of SPIO in blood is mainly determined by their hydrodynamic diameter, which is influenced by the size of the iron oxide core and the coatings.
6. SPIO with a hydrodynamic size greater than 50 nm have rapid and specific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream.
7. Resovist, an approved T2\* contrast agent for MRI, is the most important benchmark material for MPI, but its hydrodynamic diameter is greater than 50 nm, limiting its in vivo distribution.
8. The pharmacokinetics of Resovist, particularly its half-life in blood, are important for cardiovascular MPI applications, but results from MRI cannot be easily extrapolated to MPI.
9. A study was conducted to evaluate the blood half-life of MPI using Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS), which may differ significantly from the blood half-life in MRI.",1
756,"1. Intracellular pathogens like Leishmania have evolved to coexist with host defense mechanisms, and their interaction with the host is a complex process that involves various signaling pathways and cytokines.
2. Studying the host response to infection in vivo is challenging due to the presence of general inflammatory responses that occur as a result of tissue insult during the infectious process. These responses are driven by activation of components of the complement cascade, coagulation pathway, and the acute phase response, among others.
3. The study of Leishmania infection in a mouse model revealed that the transcriptomic response of uninfected cells exposed to inflammation can serve as a measure of the baseline or normal in vivo response to insult. Transcriptomic networks specifically observed in infected cells, but not in neighboring uninfected cells, represent cell-intrinsic pathogen-induced changes.
4. The study found that the RXRA-centered transcriptomic pathway is downregulated in Kupffer cells (KCs) in response to inflammation, and its aberrant maintenance in infected cells favors parasite survival. Pharmacological manipulation of RXR activity perturbed the transcriptomic network of infected KCs, leading to enhanced leishmanicidal activity.
5. The study also found that uninfected KCs in the immediate vicinity of infected cells respond to the infection, suggesting that the changes in KC behavior are the result of signals provided from infected KCs or from the activation of serum-derived mediators of inflammation.
6. Transcriptional events that accompany the observed change in KC behavior were examined by identifying and isolating KCs based on whether they contained parasites (infected) or not (inflamed). Both infected and inflamed KCs showed heterogeneous expression of CD11b but relatively uniform expression of F4/80.
7. The study provides insights into the transcriptomic response induced by L. donovani infection in vivo and demonstrates the potential of using cells exposed to inflammation as a powerful method for the discovery of pathogen-regulated gene pathways.",1
757,"1. The control of appetite is complex and involves both physiological and environmental factors. Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids or proteins, or adipose tissue, while more recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract. Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones from specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract.
2. A new formulation for appetite control proposes that a tonic signal for the drive to eat arises from fat-free mass (ffm) and resting metabolic rate (rmr), and is under tonic inhibition from leptin. Episodic signals in the form of peptides released from the gastrointestinal tract in response to food consumption interrupt and suppress the drive to eat. Prolonged exercise displays a dual-process action by stimulating hunger and increasing post-prandial satiety signalling.
3. The relationship between ffm, rmr, and eating behavior has implications for the research and management of obesity. The use of body weight or BMI in obesity research and management is unsatisfactory, as ffm and fat mass have different functional properties in relation to appetite. Obese individuals and people carrying a large muscle mass should have a stronger tendency to consume larger meals than smaller people. The formulation proposed here can help clarify the relative strength of biological and environmental variables that contribute to energy intake and changes in body weight and composition.",1
758,"1. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a commonly used material in prosthetic dentistry for denture base fabrication due to its desirable properties such as excellent esthetics, low water sorption and solubility, relative lack of toxicity, repair ability, and simple processing technique.
2. The conventional heat-polymerized PMMA resin is widely used as a denture base material, but it has disadvantages such as dimensional changes and inaccuracies in the fit of the denture base due to high processing stresses induced during polymerization. Chemically activated resins, when compression molded, display less polymerization shrinkage and greater dimensional accuracy but have higher solubility and inferior color stability.
3. The injection molding technique has advantages over the compression molding technique, including reduced processing time, lower cost, lower skin sensitivity to the evaporated monomer, and availability of the resin reservoir to compensate for acrylic resin shrinkage. The type of processing can affect the mechanical properties of the resins, such as the bond strength between the denture teeth and the denture base resins.
4. Debonding of denture teeth from denture bases is a significant problem in prosthodontic practice, causing distress and increased cost for patients. Previous surveys reported that 26-33% of denture repairs are due to debonded teeth. Attempts to increase the bond strength between acrylic resin teeth and denture base resins include grinding the glossy ground surface, painting the ground surface of the teeth with monomer, and cutting mechanical retention features in the ground surface of the teeth.
5. An experimental in vitro study found that the shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat-polymerized and autopolymerized denture base resins was affected by surface treatments of the denture teeth. The study found that acrylic teeth treated with monomer failed predominantly in the cohesive and mixed modes, and the airborne particle abrasion of the denture teeth ground surface improved significantly the shear bond strength compared to untreated samples. However, other studies have shown conflicting results regarding the effect of airborne particle abrasion or grinding on the bond strength of the treated teeth to denture bases.",1
759,"1. Arc welding emits intense ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that can cause acute and delayed health effects, including keratoconjunctivitis, erythema, cataracts, and skin cancer. In Japan, a survey by the Japan Welding Engineering Society found that 86% of workers at workplaces where arc welding is performed have experienced symptoms of UV keratoconjunctivitis, and 92% of welders have suffered one or more flash burns.
2. The UVR hazard during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel, which is the most commonly used welding process, depends on the type of welding wire and the magnitude of the welding current. A study found that the UVR hazard tends to increase with welding current and is dependent on the type of welding wire.
3. The effective irradiance, which measures the degree of UVR hazard as a cause of acute health effects, is used to assess the hazards of UVR emitted during welding. The effective irradiance is defined as the product of the spectral irradiance at a wavelength, the relative spectral effectiveness at that wavelength, and the bandwidth.
4. The UVR emitted during GMAW performed with a digital inverter-type pulsed arc welding machine was measured and its acute health effects were assessed in accordance with the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines. The study found that the effective irradiance measured in this study at a distance of 500 mm from the arc was in the range of 0.51 - 12.9 mw / cm, which corresponds to allowable daily exposure times of 0.23 - 5.9 s.
5. The UVR hazard is strongly influenced by the pulsed current, and the degree of the effect increases with decreasing pulsed current. In recent years, the demand for mild steel thin plate welding has increased to reduce the weight of equipment that needs to be transported. Therefore, it is necessary to take adequate protection measures for the peripheral workers who are not welding when welding with pulsed current.",1
760,"1. Many microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea, can produce intracellular energy and carbon storage compounds called polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Bacterial cells with a higher PHA content can survive longer in extreme environments or when nutrient availability is poor.
2. PHAs are divided into two groups based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units: short-chain-length (SCL-PHAs) and medium-chain-length (MCL-PHAs). SCL-PHAs, such as P(3HB), are highly crystalline, while MCL-PHAs are elastic with low melting temperatures.
3. The type of PHA produced and accumulated in the granules depends on the metabolic pathway of the particular microorganism. PHA synthases, the enzymes responsible for PHA synthesis, are classified into four classes based on their substrate specificities and subunits organization.
4. A study was conducted to determine whether bacteria inhabiting freshwater reservoirs in glacier forefield areas in Antarctica have the potential to synthesize PHAs. Samples of water and mats were collected from five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream.
5. The samples were analyzed for the presence of PHA synthase genes using PCR with two primer pairs. The first primer pair recognizes both SCL- and MCL-PHA synthase genes, while the second primer pair is specific for both genes responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis.
6. The results showed that many of the isolated strains possessed genes responsible for PHA synthesis, mainly belonging to the Pseudomonas and Janthinobacterium genera. The study also suggested that PHA metabolism in Antarctic strains could be an adaptation mechanism to withstand harsh conditions in polar regions.
7. The study also highlights the potential of microbial mats as high-level PHA production systems and a source of bacterial PHA producers. The results suggest that microorganisms inhabiting extreme environments, such as Antarctica, should be considered as potential producers of PHAs.",1
761,"1. Reclaiming arid and semi-arid lands involves modifying topography, creating appropriate surface composition, and establishing vegetation, with the latter being the most uncertain category.
2. Establishing vegetation is important for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing for productive reuse of land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape.
3. Uncertainty in vegetation establishment comes primarily from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment, with irrigation being expensive and not more successful.
4. Natural rainfall can allow the establishment of robust native or non-native vegetation, but natives are now more recommended due to their long-term stability, resource value for wildlife, and better public acceptance.
5. To maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation, a mixed plant community is needed that contains the same ratio of functional groups as a natural community in the same area.
6. The analysis assumed that the native, warm-season (C4) grass seeds were in the soil from 0.1 cm deep and that they germinate when exposed to suitable monsoon conditions.
7. The study found that the average germination date for the gage 5 2-day scenario was 20 July, and for the 3-day scenario, it was 1 August. The average germination dates for gage 6 2-day scenario was 19 July, and for the 3-day scenario, it was 27 July. In most years, there was little difference in germination date and success among the gages and the scenarios, but in a few years, there were substantive differences among the gages and treatment germination dates.",1
762,"1. Major depression (MD) is a significant cause of disability and is projected to be the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. While antidepressant medications and psychotherapies are effective for 60-80% of those affected with MD, up to 40% of patients do not show satisfactory improvement due to various biopsychosocial factors. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a challenge in mental health care, and there is increasing interest in the use of neuromodulation therapies (NTS) for its management. NTS are designed to target specific brain circuits and have a limited side-effect profile compared to psychopharmacological therapy.
2. Several NTS have been found to be effective in TRD, including seizure therapies (modified electroconvulsive therapy and magnetic seizure therapy), noninvasive therapies (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and cranial electric stimulation), neurosurgical approaches (vagus nerve stimulation, epidural cortical stimulation, and deep brain stimulation), and new approaches on the horizon (focused ultrasound, near-infrared light therapy, low-field magnetic stimulation, and optogenetic stimulation). However, more research is needed to establish the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of these therapies, and proper patient selection is crucial. Additionally, treatment teams should follow ethical guidelines, especially those concerning autonomy, voluntary consent, beneficence, and nonmaleficence prior to using NTS in individual patients.",1
763,"1. Small RNA molecules are important in regulating various molecular and biological activities in the cell, with short RNA sequences playing a critical role in regulating the expression levels of specific genes. RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene regulatory mechanism that causes sequence-specific downregulation of mRNAs.
2. Double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can knock down expression levels via the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates degradation or translational inhibition of the targeted mRNAs. RNAi can also modulate gene transcription itself.
3. In fission yeast, homologs of the RNA-induced silencing complex can regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNA. This mechanism is also seen in plants, ciliates, nematodes, and flies.
4. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing. In human cells, short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level.
5. Promoter-targeted small hairpin RNAs have been shown to efficiently upregulate genes in vivo. This approach has been used to develop a method to design sarnas for upregulation of specific cellular genes. The study focused on the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating important target genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming.
6. The klf4 and c-myc genes were the initial targets for activation. To identify potential antisense transcripts from the klf4 and c-myc loci, the genomic region surrounding each locus was searched for spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs) which mapped to the positive strand.
7. Two sarna candidates, klf4-pr1 and myc-pr2, were found to specifically activate transcription of endogenous klf4 and myc genes, respectively, in primary human MSCs. The use of sarnas may also provide a highly useful tool in studying the contribution of individual factors in iPS cell reprogramming.

Urinary tract obstruction, which can be caused by various conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and renal calculi, can result in renal injuries and fibrosis.
2. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in rats is an experimental model of renal injury that imitates the process of obstructive nephropathy in an accelerated manner. Evidence suggests that the inflammatory process plays a key role in the renal structural changes that occur after uropathy.
3. Taurine, an organic acid and a major component of bile, has been shown to have beneficial effects on renal fibrosis that occurs after cisplatin-induced injuries, diabetic nephropathy, and age-related renal changes. It also plays a role in ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, renal vascular endothelial function, and antioxidant properties in the kidney.
4. A study was conducted to determine whether taurine and taxol, a drug that stabilizes microtubules and interferes with the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division, can attenuate tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preserve normal renal histology in a rat model of UUO.
5. The results of the study showed that treatment with taxol or taurine resulted in a decrease in renal disruption, tubular atrophy, degeneration, necrosis, and fibrosis in UUO rats. Taxol was found to be more protective than taurine in preserving the volume of the kidney, cortex, and medulla, as well as the total volume of the glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules, distal convoluted tubules, Henle's loop, and collecting duct.
6. Taurine treatment resulted in an increase in degenerative tubules but a decrease in necrotic and fibrotic tissues compared to UUO rats without any treatments. Taxol treatment decreased both degenerative tubules and necrotic and fibrotic tissues compared to UUO rats.

765,"1. Autophagy, a bulk degradation system, plays a critical role in host defense responses by promoting the elimination of pathogens and the induction of acquired immunity. It is involved in the clearance of bacteria-containing vacuoles and the transport of immunity-related GTPase from the ER-Golgi to vacuoles containing invading microbes.
2. Autophagy is also important for antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells, a process essential for the induction of acquired immunity. MHC class II molecules are localized on autophagosomes, and the autophagic machinery promotes the presentation of viral and self-antigens by MHC class II molecules to antigen-specific CD4 T cells.
3. Autophagy is induced after sensing various types of stress, such as nutrient starvation, the accumulation of protein aggregates, and invasion by microbes. The autophagic machinery is recruited to the isolation membrane, a source membrane of autophagosomes, and plays a vital role in driving the membrane trafficking necessary for the generation of autophagosomes.
4. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified ATG16L1 as a candidate gene responsible for susceptibility to the inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's disease. The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex recruits an ATG3-LC3 intermediate to the isolation membrane, defining the site at which LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine, an essential process for the elongation of autophagosomes. Cells lacking ATG16L1 are deficient in the conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, resulting in enhanced inflammatory cytokine production in response to endotoxin.",1
766,"1. The habit of chewing betel quid, a cultural practice in India, has been associated with oral cancer for over a century.
2. The addition of tobacco to betel quid by European settlers has significantly increased the health risks associated with this habit.
3. The causal association between chewing of betel quid with tobacco and oral cancer is well established, with tobacco being the major culprit.
4. Betel nut chewing has been linked to oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a precancerous condition, and the incidence of OSMF and oral cancers has increased in recent decades due to the industrial manufacturing and marketing of chewable mixtures like gutkha.
5. The study of 63 oral cancer patients showed that most of them were in advanced stages of cancer and had a history of betel quid and gutkha chewing.
6. Betel nut and betel quid chewing can lead to the production of carcinogenic substances, such as n-nitroso compounds, which can cause oral and pharyngeal cancer.
7. Betel nut chewing is also associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, cancers of the larynx, stomach, lung, and cervix in humans.
8. In India, betel nut is widely consumed for various reasons, such as stress relief and mouth freshening, and is a major contributor to the high incidence of oral cancer in the country.
9. The World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have classified betel nut as a Group 1 human carcinogen.
10. There is a need for stricter regulations and a ban on betel nut and tobacco products, as well as an emphasis on health education to reduce and eliminate the use of these carcinogenic substances.",1
767,"1. Allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and are relatively high cost with a shortage of blood bank products. Postoperative severe bleeding is common following cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass are at increased risk of postoperative bleeding.
2. Several cardiac surgery studies have reported on the long-term mortality after transfusion with blood and blood products, with the majority of studies reporting a higher long-term mortality after blood transfusion. However, these reports are mainly from designated types of surgery or single center studies. The correlation between blood flow, oxygen delivery, and consumption together with hemoglobin can easily be visualized, and a decrease in hemoglobin must result in a compensatory increase in either cardiac index or oxygen extraction or a combination.
3. Patients with coexisting cardiac diseases, including coronary artery disease, tolerate moderate anemia. A restrictive transfusion regimen followed by a lower morbidity and mortality has been shown in some studies. The first priority of perioperative fluid therapy in surgical patients is to achieve optimal filling of the heart with crystalloids and colloids to optimize cardiovascular function, decrease postoperative morbidity, and shorten the length of hospitalization. In cardiac surgery patients, optimization of arterial saturation only adds little to oxygen delivery, leaving only increasing CO or Hb as possible means to increase oxygen delivery.",1
768,"1. Neurogenesis, or the creation of new neurons, was once believed to occur only during embryonic development in mammals. However, recent research has shown that neuronal regeneration continues in specific tissues, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium, even after birth.
2. The olfactory epithelium, which is responsible for the sense of smell, has the ability to regenerate and recover from significant damage. This is due in part to the presence of neural stem cells and support cells within the epithelium.
3. Recent studies have identified two populations of cells within the olfactory epithelium that may have neuropotency, or the ability to generate neurons: globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs).
4. GBCs, in particular, have been shown to function as broadly multipotent progenitors, capable of giving rise to all cell types within the epithelium. They are also able to differentiate into non-neuronal cell types when exposed to irritants.
5. The use of GBCs for neural regenerative therapies is promising due to their ability to engraft easily into damaged epithelium and give rise to both neural and non-neuronal cells.
6. Olfactory epithelial cells are an ideal candidate for use in clinical research and therapy due to their accessibility, ability to regenerate completely, and shared environmental niche and developmental hierarchy with neural cells.
7. Research is ongoing to identify the specific neural stem cell population within the olfactory epithelium and to characterize the lineage of the cells within this niche.
8. Electrophysiological studies of GBCs have shown that they are unexcitable and only possess leaky potassium channels, making them unlikely to generate action potentials.
9. Further research is needed to understand the biology and effectiveness of GBCs and other potential neural progenitor cells in the olfactory mucosa, as well as to apply this knowledge to medical treatments for various diseases.",1
769,"1. Microglia, which were once considered to play no role in the immune system of the central nervous system (CNS), are now known to be crucial for innate immunity within the CNS. They are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and invade the developing brain during embryogenesis.
2. The CNS immune system is more active than previously thought, with the presence of a glymphatic system that enables communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes. This system, along with brain microglia, facilitates immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid.
3. Microglia have multiple functions in the postnatal brain, including immune surveillance, initiating an inflammatory response, phagocytosing pathogens and apoptotic neurons, exerting scavenging actions on tissue debris, recognizing apoptotic cells, and playing a role in angiogenesis.
4. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a slowly propagating wave of near-complete depolarization of neurons and astrocytes followed by a period of electrical suppression, can initiate inflammatory activation of microglia. This activation can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which can have a deleterious effect on CNS tissue.",1
770,"1. Transposable elements (TEs) were once considered junk DNA, but they are now known to be more than simple genome parasites. They have been shown to serve as a genomic reservoir for new regulatory and coding sequences, allowing genetic innovation and organismal evolution.
2. TE-encoded proteins have properties that can be of interest for host cellular pathways. They can bind, copy, cut, process, and recombine nucleic acids, as well as modify and interact with host proteins.
3. There are many cases of TE-derived genes fulfilling important functions in plants, fungi, and animals, including vertebrates. For example, several multigenic families have been formed from different events of molecular domestication of the gag gene of Ty3/gypsy elements, a super family of LTR retrotransposons active in fish and amphibians but extinct in mammals.
4. Retroviral envelope genes have been domesticated several times independently to generate genes involved in placenta development. Syncytins mediate the fusion of trophoblast cells to form the syncytiotrophoblast layer, a continuous structure with microvillar surfaces forming the outermost fetal component of the placenta.
5. Many examples of genes derived from transposase genes from diverse subfamilies of DNA transposons have been described in vertebrates and other organisms. For example, the recombination-activating protein RAG1, which together with RAG2 catalyzes the V(D)J somatic site-specific recombination responsible for the formation and diversity of genes encoding immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors in jawed vertebrates, has been formed from the transposase of a Transib DNA transposon.
6. The mammal-specific gene CENP-B encodes a Pogo transposase-derived protein that controls centromere formation depending on the chromatin context. An independent event of molecular domestication of Pogo transposase also led to the formation of centromeric proteins in fission yeast.",1
771,"1. Progressive diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, affect millions of people worldwide and are caused by the misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins. These diseases can spread from cell to cell and lead to a dramatic loss in life expectancy and quality of life.
2. Molecular chaperones play a central role in preventing protein misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation within cells. However, during cellular stress, the amounts of misfolded/unfolded proteins and/or mis-processed and mutant polypeptides increase, leading to the activation of the heat shock response and the potential for protein misfolding and aggregation.
3. The ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy are responsible for degrading misfolded/unfolded or incorrectly processed proteins. However, when autophagy fails, protein aggregates can accumulate and cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function.
4. Misfolded protein aggregates can cause cell damage through various mechanisms, including permeabilization of plasma membranes, perturbation of membrane protein dynamics, formation of novel pathogenic signaling platforms, trapping of molecular chaperones and other partner proteins, and amplification through recruitment of the soluble form of the proteins they are formed of.
5. Fibrillar protein aggregates, made of straight or curved and twisted fibrillar material, are associated with a variety of diseases affecting the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases.
6. Recent evidence suggests that misfolded protein aggregates can spread in a prion-like manner, indicating that protein aggregates propagation and amplification is a widespread phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases.
7. The toxicity of fibrillar and oligomeric assemblies is due in part to their binding to and permeabilization of the cell membrane, which can lead to impairment of membrane integrity and permeability, and the seeding capacity of the protein assemblies, which can lead to the recruitment of fibrils soluble counterpart and exhaustion of the functional form of the protein.",1

2. The addition of first generation direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to interferon (IFN) and ribavirin treatment led to sustained virus response (SVR) in almost 80% of patients treated. Newer DAAs have achieved SVR rates greater than 90%.
3. African Americans (AA) are twice as likely to be infected with HCV and have historically had lower response rates to approved IFN-based therapies. More specific information is needed to understand the progression of liver disease in AA, especially after achieving viral clearance.
4. Studies have shown that patients who achieve an SVR have better outcomes with respect to cirrhosis, development of HCC, and all-cause mortality.
5. A study using electronic medical records from a Department of Veterans Affairs clinical registry found that AA were at lower risk than Caucasians for all liver events.
6. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the effect of IFN-based therapies on outcomes in AA patients, and found that patients who achieved SVR did not develop new cirrhosis or HCC in the follow-up period.
7. Factors such as fibrosis stage, ALT, AST, albumin, platelet counts, and AFP all correlated with HCC development in AA, but when subjected to logistic regression analysis, only stage of fibrosis was identified as an independent predictor of hcc.",1

2. The meta-analysis found a significant association between the gln27glu polymorphism of 2AR and ischemic stroke, with a higher frequency of the risk allele (glu27) in cases compared to controls.
3. The meta-analysis included three studies for allelic association and two studies for genotypic association, involving a total of 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls for allelic association and 518 cases and 510 controls for genotypic association.
4. The study also notes some limitations, such as the lack of haplotype analysis, gene-environment interaction, and gene-gene interaction studies, as well as the potential for selection bias due to hospital-based controls.
5. The study concludes that the gln27glu polymorphism of 2AR is a potential risk factor for ischemic stroke, but further research is needed to establish the underlying molecular causal pathways and to validate the finding with larger prospective cohort studies.",1

Specific cognitive abilities, such as psychomotor performance, information processing, attention, problem solving, memory, decision making, reaction time, and emotional facial expression recognition, are impaired in patients undergoing methadone maintenance programs.
2. Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) are involved in various cellular and physiological processes, including neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and gene transcription. However, excessive increases in [Ca]cyt can lead to cell death through delayed calcium deregulation (DCD), which is associated with mitochondrial calcium overloading.
3. Research using SH-SY5Y cells, a suitable model for investigating opioid-mediated responses in neurons, revealed that methadone induces necrotic-like cell death and changes in [Ca]cyt. A comprehensive pharmacological survey was conducted to study the possible contribution of various calcium-related mechanisms to the response to methadone. The study found that only drugs affecting mitochondrial handling of calcium, such as oligomycin, FCCP, CGP 37157, and cyclosporine A, were able to modulate methadone-induced DCD in SH-SY5Y cells.
4. Methadone was found to induce mitochondrial fragmentation in SH-SY5Y cells, which may contribute to its toxicity. The effect of methadone on mitochondrial calcium uptake was also studied, revealing that the drug impacts calcium uptake differently depending on the respiratory substrates used. The study suggests that an imbalance in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis might be important for both early and late stages of methadone-induced side effects, including memory impairment.",1

Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a cancer prevention strategy used by women with germline mutations in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes (BRCA1/2) to reduce the risks of breast and ovarian cancer. A fixed-effects meta-analysis of 10 published reports found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.
2. The meta-analysis included studies published between January 1999 and December 2007, which were identified through a search of the PubMed database using the terms ""oophorectomy"" and ""BRCA1"" or ""BRCA2."" The search yielded 346 studies, of which 309 included the term ""BRCA1"" in the title and 267 included the term ""BRCA2."" After evaluating the full text of these citations, 10 publications were included in the meta-analysis.
3. The meta-analysis found that RRSO was associated with an 80% reduction in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk and a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk in women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. These findings suggest a strong association between RRSO and reduced risks of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.
4. Despite the consistent evidence favoring RRSO in women with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, several questions remain, including the influence of cohort effects on cancer risk over time, the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO, and the role of RRSO in nonwhite populations and in women who have been identified through high-risk clinics.
5. Other options for risk reduction also exist, including risk-reducing mastectomy and breast cancer screening with yearly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) added to screening mammography. These strategies may also have benefits in reducing cancer incidence and mortality in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",1
776,"1. The text describes the role of the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17 axis in the pathogenesis of oral lichen planus (OLP), a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa. The IL-23/IL-17 axis is a proinflammatory signaling pathway involving two key cytokines, IL-23 and IL-17. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of a unique p19 subunit and a common p40 subunit shared with IL-12, and is secreted by various cell types. IL-23 serves an essential role in induction and maintenance of a novel subset of CD4+T cells, namely TH17, and induces TH17 to produce its distinctive cytokine IL-17. IL-17 functions as a proinflammatory cytokine, which can activate different cells to produce numerous inflammatory molecules. The text also mentions that the IL-23/IL-17 axis has been described to play a major role in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory and immune diseases. However, the role of IL-23/IL-17 axis in the pathogenesis of OLP is still unclear.
2. The study found that both IL-23 and IL-17 are overexpressed in OLP lesions, indicating that the IL-23/IL-17 axis may be involved in the local immune network of OLP. The study also found that the upregulation of IL-23 in the progress of OLP lesion is associated with the increased expression of IL-17 in reticular OLP subgroup, indicating a potential regulatory role of IL-23 to the expression of IL-17 in the early stage of OLP lesion. The study also observed that the stimulation of recombinant human IL-23 (ril-23) significantly increased the percentage of CD4+IL-17+ cells (identified as TH17) in CD4+TH cells from OLP patients, and the il-17 content in the culture supernatant of CD4+TH cells also increased under the stimulation of il-23 than the control group. These data suggest that the overexpression",1

2. Miniaturized cell separation devices offer several advantages over conventional techniques, including small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential integration with analytical techniques. These technologies are derived from the semiconductor industry or advances in synthetic chemistry.
3. Cell separation techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: techniques based on size and density, and techniques based on affinity (chemical, electrical, or magnetic).
4. Several novel size-based separation processes are being employed in micro- and nanoscale devices, which are compact, simple, and do not require additional energy sources or equipment. These devices force a fluid containing a heterogeneous particle population through a series of channels or obstacles of varied size, and the main advantage of this approach is that it does not require the presence of cell-specific markers or proteins to achieve separation.
5. The text also discusses various examples of cell separation techniques, including the use of magnetic beads and external magnetic fields, microfluidic devices, and adhesion-based systems. These techniques have been used to separate various cell types, including immunogenic T cells, leukocytes, and lymphocyte subpopulations.",1

2. The study found no significant difference between C/RL and RPN in diagnosing cirrhosis, but both were statistically significant compared to EGF. The study also found that the morphological changes in compensated and less severe clinical cirrhosis are mainly represented by the hypertrophy of the caudate lobe and atrophy of the right lobe. However, the study did not evaluate the diagnosis performance of combined C/RL, RPN, and EGF or correlate the morphological signs with the underlying cause of cirrhosis.",1

2. Currently, there are about 1.1 billion smokers worldwide, and in Poland, 43% of men and 22% of women smoke. Passive smoking is also common in Poland, particularly in the home and workplace.
3. A study was conducted to assess the reliability of patients' smoking history and compliance with smoking cessation recommendations using a questionnaire and cotinine measurement, a marker of exposure to tobacco smoke.
4. The study found that not all patients admit to smoking and not all follow recommendations to quit smoking. Three smoking patients quit smoking by the 18-month follow-up, while two non-smokers had confirmed active smoking in subsequent examinations.
5. Detection of cotinine in urine proved to be a convenient and easy way to assess active and passive smoking. Monitoring of cotinine level allows for an objective assessment and to effectively convey the recommendations for quitting tobacco smoking.
6. The study found that people exposed to tobacco smoke, passive smoking, were not aware that being in smoky areas directly exposes them to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. Satisfactory is the fact that in recent years through administrative rulings have managed to limit the number of public places where smoking is permitted.",1

2. The study found that previous obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is the strongest risk factor for self-reported AI among pregnant parous women. Among nulliparous women, low educational level and comorbidity were the most important indicators for AI.
3. The study also revealed a high frequency of self-reported AI among nulliparous women (7.8%). Socioeconomic differences, such as low income and low education, might explain part of the results for the group of nulliparous pregnant women.
4. Previous OASIS was the strongest risk factor for self-reported AI in all analyses in parous women, with and without adjusting for other factors, and in all categories of severity of AI. However, women with previous OASIS reported a lower prevalence of AI than women in previous studies on nonpregnant women.
5. The study found that urinary incontinence was significantly associated with reported AI among all parity groups. The prevalence of urinary incontinence was threefold among parous women compared to nulliparous women and increased slightly with increasing vaginal parity.",1

The study compares the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia performed with hyperbaric bupivacaine between normotensive and hypertensive patients who were scheduled for elective surgeries of lower abdomen, lower limbs, and perineum. The study found that there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups, but the number of patients who developed hypotension was greater in the hypertensive group (6/30) compared to the normotensive group (1/30).
2. The hypertensive patient group had significantly higher systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure values at all measurement times compared to the normotensive patient group (p<0.05). However, there was no significant change in heart rate within either group compared to the basal measurements (p>0.05).
3. The study also found that prehydration under the guidance of heart rate variability, an indicator of sympathovagal balance, decreased the risk of hypotension after spinal anesthesia. Venous capacitance is decreased in hypertensive patients, and antihypertensive treatment provides an improvement in venous capacitance as much as peripheral vascular resistance.
4. The study's most significant limiting factor was the lack of measurement of the basal sympathetic activities of the patients. However, the study concludes that there is no significant difference between normotensive and hypertensive patients in the incidence of hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine.",1
784,"1. Chronic pain and depression are common health problems in primary care, and they often co-occur. Pain is associated with limitations in daily activities, poor self-rated health, and increased prevalence of depressive disorders. Studies have shown that healthcare providers may underestimate the intensity of pain and its impact on patients' lives.
2. The study found that the Dolotest, a validated pain- and health-related quality of life assessment tool, can be useful as a screening tool for depression in primary care. The tool integrates measurement of the intensity of pain with assessment of the impact of pain on various aspects of patients' lives, including mood. The study found that a cut-off value of 65 on the ""low spirits"" domain provides both high sensitivity and high specificity for detecting patients who meet criteria for depression. The study also found that the prevalence of depression was statistically significantly higher in patients who visited the primary care physician due to a pain problem compared to those who visited for other reasons.",1
785,"1. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus that infects the mucosal areas of the human upper digestive tract and the anogenital region through sexual contact, leading to an increased risk of development of cancer.
2. HPV genotypes are grouped into high-risk and low-risk based on the degree of risk of development of cancer after infection. High-risk HPV genital infections in young females are transient and have little long-term significance, but when the infection persists, there is a high risk of developing a precancerous lesion of the cervix.
3. The study found that hpv igg antibodies were detected in serum samples from 42.9% (150/350) of women, indicating that the women had been infected and that the virus is circulating with a high prevalence in Kaduna state.
4. The seroprevalence of hpv was highest among widows (53.1%) and lowest among divorcees (35.7%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Hpv infection was significantly associated with educational status, with antibodies detected with the highest prevalence among women with secondary education.
5. The study also found that women who had children had a higher prevalence of antibodies to hpv (44.6%) than those without children (38.9%). Women with children were 1.3 times more likely to be infected than women without children.
6. The study recommends the introduction of a subsidized HPV vaccine in Nigeria's national immunization schedule to prevent the current scourge of cervical cancer in Nigeria.
7. The study also recommends improving knowledge at the population level by education on the mode of transmission of the virus and the risks associated with the virus as a cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening programs need to be put in place in Nigeria, given that cervical cancer has been shown to disproportionately affect African American women, who are nearly twice more likely than European American women to die of the disease.",1
786,"1. The text discusses the importance of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in improving healthcare and addressing the gap between research and clinical practice. EBM is a systematic approach to clinical problem-solving that integrates the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.
2. The text describes the components of a national evidence-based health care system, which includes a national system of clinical knowledge management, a national evidence-based practice system, and an integrated national network of clinical effectiveness. These systems aim to provide the best evidence for decision-making, promote the usage of clinical policies or knowledge products, and facilitate evidence-based practice in the country.
3. The text also highlights the challenges in implementing EBM, such as the lack of legal requirements to rely on the best available evidence, insufficient skills in using evidence in daily practice, and the need for financial and non-financial incentives to produce evidence according to local conditions. The text suggests that the government should adopt policies and interventions for changing behavior in three levels of promotion, facilitation, and guaranteeing production and application of clinical knowledge in the country.",1
787,"1. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.
2. The HMPV genome is approximately 13 kb in length and has a gene composition of n-p-m-f-m2-1/m2-2-sh-g-l. Its genomic organization is similar to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), but it lacks two nonstructural genes, ns1 and ns2.
3. HMPV has been demonstrated to have two main genetic lineages, termed subtype A and B, which contain subgroups a1/a2 and b1/b2, respectively. The a2 sublineage exhibits the greatest diversity among all the sublineages of HMPV.
4. Synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV can provide insights into its evolution profile, gene expression, and virus-host interaction. However, there is a lack of information about the codon usage pattern of HMPV and its major influence factors.
5. The study found that the preferred codons in HMPV are ended with a/u, and the g+c content of the HMPV genome is 36.91%. The enc values among HMPV genomes show a range from 45.127 to 48.28, with an average value of 45.785 and a standard deviation value of 0.8458.
6. Natural selection and mutation pressure are two key factors that affect codon usage patterns in organisms. The study found that mutation pressure might play an important role in influencing synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV.
7. The nucleotide constraint might also play an important role in influencing synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV. The first principle axis (f1) has a significantly negative correlation with u3% and negative correlation with gc3%, suggesting that nucleotide u3% and gc3% are the major factors influencing the synonymous codon usage pattern in HMPV genome.
8. The phylogenetic distant might affect the variation of synonymous codon usage in HMPV, and",0
788,"1. The text describes a suite of protein analysis tasks called ProtSweep, Domainsweep, and 2DSweep, which are used to functionally characterize protein sequences. These tasks use a combination of sequence similarity searches, protein localization prediction, and physicochemical property analysis to assign functional roles to proteins.
2. ProtSweep is a cascade of similarity searches that takes into account the differences among protein databases to improve the quality of protein characterization. It classifies proteins into categories such as identical, homologous, similar, and putative, and combines annotation from different databases based on the classification results.
3. Domainsweep identifies the domain architecture within a protein sequence and aids in finding correct functional assignments for uncharacterized protein sequences. It uses different database search methods to scan a number of protein/domain family databases and establishes different thresholds for each database.
4. 2DSweep identifies the structural domains in a protein and reports on predictions for various structural elements such as alpha-helix, beta-strand, coiled-coil, and transmembrane regions. It uses a multiple sequence alignment generated by msfgenerator as input for four different structure prediction programs.
5. The text also describes the w3h task framework, which allows the execution of compound jobs using work and data flow descriptions in a heterogeneous bioinformatics environment using meta-data information. The final output of the task is an XML file which contains all relevant information generated.
6. The development of these pipelines has been user-driven and their functionalities are continually being updated and extended in response to requests and suggestions from core users. The system is currently working on the implementation of filtering strategies and algorithms that will take into account the relationships between domain structure and homology searches.",1
789,"1. Delirium is a common and severe complication in elderly patients that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, increased risk of post-discharge institutionalization and dementia.
2. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium may shed light on its pathophysiology and help improve delirium recognition and care.
3. Oxidative stress and disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission may be involved in the pathophysiology of delirium.
4. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) functions as an essential cofactor in enzymatic reactions responsible for the production of serotonin and dopamine in the central nervous system.
5. A study was conducted to investigate BH4 status, potential disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in patients with and without delirium.
6. The study found that patients with delirium had significantly lower mean levels of arginine and significantly higher mean phe/tyr ratios than those without delirium.
7. The study also found that patients with delirium had significantly lower mean trp/lnaas ratios, although citrulline and tryptophan levels were at the border of significance lower in patients with delirium than in those without.
8. The study suggests that disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission and an increased status of oxidative stress may have played a role in the pathogenesis of delirium in the patient group.",1
790,"1. The study found that residents of deprived neighborhoods in the Netherlands, who are often characterized by a low socioeconomic status and ethnic diversity, have a higher prevalence rate of overweight and lower levels of physical activity compared to the average Dutch population. This makes them an important target group for physical activity interventions.
2. The study investigated the personal and neighborhood environmental characteristics associated with active transport among inhabitants of these deprived neighborhoods. It found that minutes of walking decreased significantly by one minute for each year increase in age, and that nss (neighborhood status score) was also a significant associate of walking. Perceived speed of traffic was the only neighborhood variable found to be a statistically significant associate of walking. Interactions between ethnicity, sex, and age with the perception of traffic exceeding maximum speed and speed of traffic were statistically significant.
3. The study also found that the native Dutch cycled more compared with the migrants, and that more attractive neighborhood surroundings were significantly associated with more cycling per week among the migrants, but not in the Dutch respondents. Personal characteristics were found to be stronger associates of active transport than neighborhood characteristics, but there were also studies that did find associations between neighborhood walkability and active transport. The study suggests that within some groups of the population under study, neighborhood characteristics are important and need to be considered in efforts to promote physical activity.",1
791,"1. Optic neuritis related to MS is an acute optic neuropathy that frequently occurs in young people, especially women, and can lead to a decline in visual acuity, eye pain, decreased contrast sensitivity, dyschromatopsia, and changes in the visual field.
2. The study found that the onset of optic neuritis was more frequent in female patients (70%) compared to male patients.
3. The analysis of the sample showed that optic neuritis was most often present in patients aged 18 to 30 years.
4. The study confirmed that optic neuritis is one of the first clinical manifestations of MS compared to other motor, sensory, and sensory events.
5. The analysis of ophthalmological parameters after 7 and 15 days, and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months found that the most frequent disturbances in the visual field were in the centrocecal region in 50% of the cases.
6. The analysis of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) by optic disc showed that the nerve fibers were thinner in the whole circumference, most often in the upper quadrant, after three months.
7. The study found that all patients with optic neuritis had a significant improvement in visual acuity after the administration of pulse corticosteroid therapy.
8. The study found that 50% of the patients with optic neuritis developed MS over a 15-year period, and in patients without MRI changes, MS developed in 25% of the cases, and in cases with one or more CNS lesions, it was 75%.
9. The study found that optic coherent tomography (OCT) registered the thinning of the nerve fibers of the neuroretinal rim in all subjects, indicating optic nerve damage in MS patients with and without optic neuritis.",1
792,"1. The study found that the rural Karen community along the Thai-Myanmar border has limited health literacy and knowledge about diabetes, with only one-third of the sample having knowledge about diabetes risk factors. Most of the community did not know that elderly age, being overweight, and physical inactivity are risk factors for diabetes.
2. The study also found that public knowledge of diabetes among the Karen ethnic rural community is at the lower extreme, with only a few rural residents able to correctly answer questions about the symptoms, diagnostic signs, and complications of diabetes mellitus. The knowledge distribution among the Karen ethnic sample was at the lower end, indicating a need for intervention.
3. The study found that diabetes knowledge among female Karen participants was lower than among males, which is a concern as diabetes and its consequent cardiovascular disease risk are higher in women. The study suggests that a television education program in the local language and creating a peer-group gathering place for women, such as a health education club for mothers and exercise club for housewives, may promote women's knowledge of diabetes and sharing of information.",1
793,"1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, including a higher prevalence of diabetes, compared to the general population. This increased rate is likely due to factors such as lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications.
2. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established Health Home programs to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions. These programs have been hypothesized to improve early recognition of developing problems and provide access to preventative somatic care for individuals with SMI.
3. A new Behavioral Health Home (BHH) was created at the University of Maryland School of Medicine to identify abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and clarify the severity of such findings for individuals with SMI. It was hypothesized that through the use of BHH services, patients would receive better quality of somatic care and that gaps in care would be readily identified.
4. Preliminary results from the BHH show that the program was able to identify individuals who did not have their HbA1c levels checked according to program guidelines and allowed for the delivery of preventative and individualized proactive care. However, more empirical data is needed to confirm these findings.
5. As a result of these findings, a Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) diabetes prevention program group has been started within the mental health clinic and closer monitoring of clinician practice with regard to monitoring and referral to specific services is being done.",1
794,"1. Valerie Oppenheimer's theory on how men's socioeconomic position influences marriage formation emphasizes the role of men's economic position in demographic change, particularly in declining marriage rates and the postponement or foregoing of marriage. This perspective was not popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the decline in marriage and increase in divorce were typically attributed to the growing economic role of women and value change.
2. Oppenheimer's theory has been influential in the study of demographic change, and her work has been supported by empirical research in Europe. However, there are still gaps in the empirical literature, and the theory's validity in different countries within the European context has not been fully evaluated. Given the recent economic crisis and growing concerns about economic inequality, the influence of men's economic position on marriage and family formation remains a vital concern.",1
795,"1. Osteoporosis is a condition of impaired bone strength that leads to an increased risk of fracture, and is associated with both bone mass and bone quality. Bone quality depends on its macro- and microarchitecture and the intrinsic properties of the materials that comprise it. Bone is continually adapting to changes in its mechanical and hormonal environment via the process of bone remodeling.
2. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease that affects the myelin sheath covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, leading to functional impairments such as visual impairment, abnormal walking mechanics, poor balance, muscle weakness, fatigue, and progressive immobilization. The disease affects mainly young adults and is more frequent in women. Impaired mobility or lack of weight-bearing physical activity in MS patients can reduce mechanical stress on bone, causing a marked imbalance in bone remodeling and disrupting the osteocytes network. Management of MS requires long-term disease-modifying therapy, such as glucocorticoids (GCS), which can have a further negative effect on bone remodeling and bone strength.
3. Several studies have shown significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with MS compared to healthy controls. The degree of disability in MS patients has been found to significantly correlate with BMD, with site-specific effects documented. Higher total body bone mineral content and a lower prevalence of osteoporosis have been found in ambulatory patients compared with nonambulatory patients.
4. Reduced mechanical stress on bone can cause a marked imbalance in bone remodeling, leading to a transient increase in bone resorption and a decrease in bone formation. The mechanism causing this decrease in bone formation probably lies in the reduction of mechanical stress during immobilization, which results in a marked disruption of the osteocytes network due to an increase in osteocyte apoptosis.
5. MS affects a wide range of neurological function and most patients with MS have abnormal muscle strength, impaired balance, and gait control, leading to frequent falls. Changes in postural control in MS patients are probably the result of slowed afferent proprioceptive conduction in the spinal cord. Disuse, inflammatory changes, GCS treatment, or vitamin D deficiency may also",0

2. The most prevalent species of Plasmodium that infect humans are P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae, with P. ovale and P. knowlesi also reported in certain regions.
3. Malaria is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, with Anopheles darlingi being the most prevalent species in the country.
4. The Ministry of Health in Brazil directs therapy and provides free antimalarial medicines, including chloroquine and primaquine, to treat malaria caused by P. vivax or P. ovale.
5. Primaquine is the only antimalarial drug effective against all species of Plasmodium gametocytes and hypnozoites, but it can cause hemolytic effects, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD).
6. Hemolysis induced by primaquine can result in discoloration of urine and faeces and is dose-related. Gastrointestinal disorders, such as nausea, dizziness, and vomiting, are common but usually not severe.
7. The study evaluated the frequency of symptoms commonly occurring in vivax malaria before and after treatment and the frequency of side effects reported during antimalarial treatment with chloroquine and primaquine.
8. The study found that after initiation of treatment, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain, but a significant increase in the frequency of nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste in the mouth, weakness, and hypochondrial pain.
9. The frequency of choluria increased significantly from 6% to 56% after initiation of antimalarial treatment.

797,"1. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) often appear concurrently in elderly men, and this coexistence can further affect quality of life. The two conditions share increased prevalence as age increases and are hypothesized to have a common pathophysiology, possibly due to overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.
2. A study was conducted to examine the effects on erectile function of a combination of the alpha-blocker tamsulosin to improve LUTS and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin to improve irritative symptoms of the bladder. Male patients aged 40 years or older who had concurrent LUTS/BPH and ED were enrolled in the study. The results showed that while both treatments improved LUTS, there was no significant improvement in erectile function in either group. Additionally, the study found that in cases where tamsulosin was administered, the iief-5 score significantly improved as the ipss-st domain score improved, but this was not the case in the group where tamsulosin and solifenacin were concomitantly administered.",1

2. During cancer initiation and progression, miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors.
3. Members of the miR-200 family are involved in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with increased motility and metastasis in cancer.
4. Zeb1, a transcription factor involved in EMT, can repress the expression of miR-200 family members, creating a double negative feedback loop that allows for plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal states.
5. The mutual repression between zeb1 and mir-200c is functional in some, but not all cells, and the reintroduction of mir-200c to cancer cells that lack it can decrease migration and invasion independently of restoration of e-cadherin.
6. Repression of tubb3, a common mechanism of resistance to microtubule-targeting agents in many types of cancer, is the mechanism whereby mir-200c restores sensitivity to paclitaxel.
7. Loss of mir-200c is a marker for chemoresistance and aggressiveness in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers.
8. The effect on migration and invasion caused by mir-200c is independent of the e-cadherin status of the cells.
9. Mir-200c affects adhesion to substrates as measured by fluorescent adhesion assays.
10. The double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1 can be exploited to identify the distinct roles of mir-200c as compared to zeb1.",1
799,"1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence involves two methods: the ""inside-out"" approach described by Delorme and the ""outside-in"" approach described by de Leval. Both approaches aim to prevent complications associated with the retropubic approach.
2. A meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence: the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator approaches.
3. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective. However, these studies have not focused on the relationship between the tape and the urethra.
4. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approaches.
5. CT scan image analysis was performed after tantalum wire marked mesh slings were implanted in a series of cadavers. The study found that the tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior.
6. The out-in tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischiopubic ramus than the in-out tapes. There was a safe distance from the tapes to the obturator canal for both techniques.
7. The mean full inner angle in a strict anteroposterior view formed by the in-out tape measured 122 (95%CI: 107-136) versus 144 (95%CI: 131-151) for the out-in tape. The differences in outcomes between the two approaches may prove to be difficult to interpret.
8. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory.
9. The findings from this study have clinical implications for surgeons, highlighting the need for strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique and the importance of paying attention to the second half of the helical pass, whichever way they chose to go. The advent of three-",1

During a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government, discussed the potential changes to the Act in the context of the new Post-compulsory Education and Training Bill.
2. The current Act has been criticized for not being strong enough to drive certain objectives, with some stakeholders suggesting that the annual remit letter has been a more effective mechanism for ensuring national priorities are met. The issue of institutional autonomy versus regulation was also discussed, with the Minister expressing a desire to carry protections for institutional autonomy into the new Bill.
3. The discussion also covered the regulation of private providers, with the current legislation requiring institutions to be charities, which has made it difficult to regulate alternative private providers. The Minister indicated that the charitable status requirement would likely continue in the new legislation. The issue of part-time and postgraduate fees was also discussed, with the Minister stating that there is no urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit.",1

Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government, attended a meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee to discuss the post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015.
2. The Minister stated that the 2015 Act will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill and that there are experiences from the implementation of the 2015 Act that they want to reflect on as they take forward the new Bill.
3. The Minister mentioned that there are four main strategic aims of the 2015 Act: around regulation of institutions in Wales, safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector, maintaining a focus on fair access, and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy.
4. The Minister also discussed the issue of private providers and stated that the Act makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, which means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act. She also mentioned that they are considering how that part of the sector will be regulated in the forthcoming legislation.
5. The Minister also discussed the issue of national outcomes and stated that they are looking to move to a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities.
