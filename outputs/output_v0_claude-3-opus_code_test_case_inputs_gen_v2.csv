The key points considered while generating the test cases:

1. Varying the number of integers (n) from small to large values within the given constraints.

2. Including test cases with integers having common factors (not relatively prime) and test cases with integers that are pairwise relatively prime. 

3. Covering edge cases like including the minimum and maximum possible values for the integers.

4. Generating test cases that are likely to have a solution (can be split into two groups with GCD 1 each) as well as test cases that are unlikely to have a solution.

5. Maintaining diversity in the test cases to cover different scenarios and thoroughly test the program's logic and correctness.",0,{}

2. A simple case where the semiknights are placed at opposite corners of the board with no obstacles, so they can easily meet.

3. Another case with the semiknights at opposite corners but the meeting square is blocked, so they cannot meet.

4. A case where the semiknights are close to each other but separated by an obstacle, preventing them from meeting.

5. A case where one semiknight is blocked in a corner while the other is free to move around, but they still cannot meet.

The test case inputs cover various scenarios:

1. The first group has the example test case from the problem statement.

2. The second group tests very large values of n with different values of k. 

3. The third group has moderately large values of n with prime and composite k.

4. The fourth group checks edge cases like n and k being equal, n being much larger than k, and n not being divisible by k.

5. The last group has a mix of very large n with large/small k, prime/composite k, and checks if n is one less or one more than a multiple of k.
