The magnetic moments are difficult to reproduce within density functional theory and are better described by either an itinerant or localized model, with no consensus on the role of correlation effects. The magnitude of magnetic moments is sensitive to computational parameters. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an essential experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides, but DFT calculations often have problems reproducing all features of the ARPES spectra correctly, which is often attributed to strong correlation effects.

The chimney model, for example, explains disk-halo features and other halo gas via processes related to underlying star formation.\r\n\t+ *External Source Model:* The alternative explanation for the supershells is the infall of massive gas clouds on to the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies. This resolves the energy problem since input energy is then a function of the mass and velocity of the infalling cloud.\r\n\r\n- **Evidence Against Star Formation Processes:**\r\n\t+ *Energy Problem:* The main difficulty with the starburst model for HI supershells lies in the required input energies for the largest shells. Hundreds of thousands of clustered supernovae are required, a conclusion which is not changed significantly if the energy is injected continuously over the lifetime of the shells.\r\n\t+ *Lack of Optical Evidence:* Recent studies have found no optical evidence for recent star formation in the numerous lower energy HI holes of Holmberg II and note that X-ray and FUV emission are also absent. This suggests that supernovae have not played a part in the formation of the HI shells.\r\n\r\n- **Proposed Explanation for HI Supershells:**\r\n\t+ *Radio Jets as Energy Source:* The authors propose that HI supershells have been formed by radio jets which plow through the interstellar medium, accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles. This allows for an internal energy source for the HI shells, provides a natural explanation for any spatial symmetries seen in the HI features, and also resolves the energy problem.\r\n\t+ *Jet-Disk Interaction Hypothesis:* The ejection of jets can take place at small angles to the large-scale galactic disk, plausibly leading to clear signatures of their dynamical interaction with the ISM. A classic case of such an interaction is the bow-shaped morphology of the radio lobe in the well-known Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1068, which strongly suggests that the kil", "format_properties": {"n_points": 3, "n_subpoints": 2, "symbol": "*"}}

The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, which can be related to 3-manifolds and cobordisms via Heegaard diagrams. However, a combinatorial description of these invariants was later developed by Sarkar and the third author, which allows for the computation of the Heegaard Floer homology of any 3-manifold and null homologous knots and links in any 3-manifold.

The LED is a fluorescent green bulb like an ordinary infrared.\r\n\t+ Features: The remote includes a switch on/off button, a mute button on both sides, one to nine buttons for controlling programs, two buttons for increasing or decreasing volume, two buttons for scrolling up or down channels, a menu button, and a swapping button for changing channels. It also has an inbuilt voice recogniser.\r\n\t+ Marketing considerations: The remote is easy to use with one thumb, has a prominent on-off button, and has symbols on the buttons for international markets.\r\n\t+ Additional feature: A holder for the remote in the shape of a snail shell.\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n\r\n\u2022 Financing: The energy source is battery, and the electronics use a simple chip on print. The case is double curved, made of plastic with special colors, and has push buttons with symbols, special form, and special material (rubber). The total cost is within budget at eight point two euros.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Production evaluation: The marketing expert suggests showing the prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups for fine tuning and to avoid any potential issues with the product. The shape, size, color, feel, and functionality of the prototype are all given high ratings.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adding voice recognition: There is no room for the voice recogniser in the current budget, but there is still four euros left to spend. The team decides to settle for whatever quality they can get for that price, even if it may not be the greatest quality.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Evaluation scale: The team evaluates the shape, size, color, feel, and functionality of the prototype, giving each a rating of one (good) or higher.
