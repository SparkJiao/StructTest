This paper studies the transport properties of chaotic deterministic ratchets, specifically the relationship between bifurcations in single-trajectory dynamics and current reversals in ensemble behavior. The authors find that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble, and it is important to discard transients when quantifying the current. While current reversals can occur without bifurcations and vice versa, in general, bifurcations for single trajectories seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the ensemble current. The authors propose a generalized heuristic that bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes, with current reversals being a special case. However, there are situations where these heuristics do not apply. The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding ensemble dependence in studies of chaotic ratchet transport properties. Open questions remain about making the conditions for the validity of the proposed heuristics more concrete.

This paper presents observations and dynamical simulations of six extrasolar planetary systems containing highly eccentric planets (HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B). The observations, obtained primarily with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, found no evidence for additional planets in these systems. Test particle simulations showed regions where additional planets could remain in stable orbits. Combining the simulations with observational detection limits, the authors were able to rule out planets down to a few Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions for some of the systems. The results demonstrate that this combined approach of observations and dynamical simulations can effectively constrain the presence of additional planets in known planetary systems.

This paper studies the rare Z-decays Z→A0γ (A0→ff̄), Z→A0A0 and Z→A0A0A0 in the Type-II 2HDM, Lepton-specific 2HDM, NMSSM and nMSSM models, which predict a light CP-odd Higgs boson A0. In the allowed parameter space, the branching ratio can be as large as 10^-5 for Z→A0γ, 10^-8 for Z→A0A0 and 10^-9 for Z→A0A0A0, making the decays Z→A0γ and Z→A0A0 potentially accessible at the GigaZ option. Different models predict different branching ratios, so these decays can distinguish between models through rare decay measurements. The paper considers various theoretical and experimental constraints on the models. For most surviving points in the NMSSM and nMSSM, the A0 is singlet-dominated, suppressing its couplings to SM fermions. The main A0 decay products are bb̄ for the L2HDM, bb̄ (dominant) and τ+τ- (subdominant) for the Type-II 2HDM, NMSSM and nMSSM, and rarely neutralino pairs in the NMSSM. The decay Z→A0A0A0 may distinguish the NMSSM from nMSSM if SUSY is found at the LHC and Z→A0A0A0 is observed at the GigaZ with a large rate.

The no-scale type boundary conditions for supersymmetry breaking, which can solve the naturalness and flavor problems, are highly predictive for the mass spectrum of superpartners. Constraints from direct searches at LEP, the cosmological bound on stable charged particles, the Higgs mass bound, and the branching ratio of b -> s gamma severely limit the allowed parameter space in the minimal scenario with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale. Giving the boundary conditions above the GUT scale relaxes the constraints, allowing some parameter space that can be probed at the Tevatron or LHC. Non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale also open up allowed regions, but the wino and higgsino LSP scenarios have a compressed spectrum that makes signals challenging at colliders. The Higgs mass bound is particularly constraining for light stops in the higgsino LSP case.

This paper analyzes the stability of quasiregular (QR) singularities in the interaction region of colliding plane waves with cross polarization, known as the CPBS spacetime. Test electromagnetic, scalar, and null dust fields are applied to the CPBS background to study their effects on the QR singularities according to the Helliwell-Konkowski stability conjecture. The conjecture predicts that QR singularities will become unstable and transform into non-scalar curvature or scalar curvature singularities. Exact back-reaction solutions are found for the cases of a scalar field coupled to the colliding electromagnetic waves and for colliding null dust shells. These exact solutions confirm the instability of the QR singularities as predicted by the conjecture. However, the conjecture fails to correctly predict the nature of the resulting singularity in the interaction region for the test electromagnetic field case. The paper concludes that the addition of cross polarization to colliding plane waves does not alter the instability of QR singularities in the incoming regions.

This study used deep Chandra X-ray observations and optical data to investigate the X-ray properties of normal spiral galaxies out to redshifts of z~1.5. By stacking the X-ray emission from galaxies not individually detected in X-rays, the average X-ray luminosity was found to increase by a factor of ~3 out to z~1 compared to spiral galaxies in the local universe, less than the factor of ~10 increase predicted by some models of X-ray binary populations. The stacked emission from these galaxies accounts for ~5% of the soft X-ray background. Many of these galaxies should be individually detectable in planned deep Chandra exposures of several megaseconds.

This paper investigates the EPR-steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals, known as T-states. The authors use the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism to develop a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for projective measurements on T-states, which they conjecture is optimal. They also obtain two sufficient conditions for T-states to be EPR-steerable via suitable EPR-steering inequalities. The necessary condition generated by their LHS model and the sufficient conditions are close to each other, with the gap between them being small. The authors prove a theorem connecting the EPR-steerability of T-states to properties of the steering ellipsoid. They also derive two asymmetric EPR-steering inequalities for arbitrary two-qubit states. The paper discusses the hierarchy of non-locality for quantum states, ranging from Bell-nonlocality to EPR-steerability to non-separability.

The idea of using electron spin to encode binary information in spintronic devices was proposed in the mid-1990s. Spin-based devices could potentially have advantages of lower power dissipation, less noise, and faster operation compared to charge-based devices. In 1994, a scheme was proposed for a universal NAND logic gate using three exchange-coupled electron spins in quantum dots. However, these early spin logic gates had a serious flaw - the bidirectional exchange interaction could not ensure unidirectional propagation of the logic signal from input to output. Clocking schemes were proposed to enforce unidirectionality, but they negated the advantages of spin-based devices. Spin-based irreversible logic gates are projected to dissipate impractical amounts of power at high integration densities. To overcome this, reversible spin logic gates acting as qubits for quantum computing have been proposed. Optical readout of spin qubits appears more practical than electrical readout which requires contacting individual quantum dots. Despite challenges, the long coherence times of electron and nuclear spins in solids make spin a promising vehicle for encoding qubits compared to charge.

This paper investigates ways to increase the minimum orbital period of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) from the theoretical 65 minutes to the observed 77 minutes, and to reduce the predicted accumulation of systems near the minimum period (the ""period spike""). The authors consider consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) mechanisms and donor stars that are bloated due to tidal deformation, but find that implausibly high efficiencies are needed. Using a modified chi-squared test, the authors find that none of their synthesized model populations fit the observed period distribution as well as a distribution that is flat in orbital period. The period minimum problem and period spike problem remain open issues, though model populations can be constructed where the period spike is sufficiently washed out. The authors conclude that most CVs likely formed at long orbital periods above the period gap and evolved to become short-period systems, consistent with evidence that CV secondaries are somewhat evolved.

Spitzer mid-infrared spectral mapping of Stephan's Quintet reveals powerful H2 emission spread over 50 kpc2, representing a significant fraction of the group-wide warm H2 that dominates the mid-infrared emission. The H2 emission is stronger than X-ray emission in the shock structures, indicating a new dominant cooling pathway. Comparison of infrared ionic lines suggests silicon and iron are depleted onto dust that survives the shocks. Star formation is low in the warm H2 regions, consistent with a turbulent model where H2 is reheated and cool clouds are too short-lived to collapse. Stephan's Quintet provides a unique laboratory for studying H2 cooling and shock excitation mechanisms that may be important in systems ranging from ULIRGs to radio galaxies to supernova remnants.

The paper presents 3D hydrodynamic models of marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) protoplanetary disks around protostars ranging from 0.1 to 1 solar mass. The models examine the mixing and transport of isotopic heterogeneity, represented by a passive color field, injected either as a one-time event or continuously at the disk surface. The results show that MGU disks can rapidly homogenize an initially heterogeneous distribution of isotopes, with the dispersion decreasing to 1-2% in the outer disk within a few thousand years, regardless of protostar mass. Single-shot injection leads to greater homogenization than continuous injection. The vigorous mixing in MGU disks may explain the observed homogeneity of short-lived radionuclides and transport of refractory grains in our solar nebula, as well as mixing in disks around M dwarf stars. MGU disk phases may commonly occur and drive protostellar accretion outbursts like FU Orionis events. The models suggest MGU mixing is a robust process in disks around low-mass stars that could have important implications for planet formation and habitability.

The data shows upward fluctuations near 200, 550, and 850 GeV/c^2, but these are not statistically significant. They set 95% confidence level upper limits on the cross section for new particles and exclude certain mass ranges for axigluons, excited quarks, technirhos, W', Z', and E6 diquarks. They also search for topgluons and topcolor Z' bosons decaying to b-quarks, using b-tagged dijets. A small fluctuation is seen near 600 GeV/c^2 but is not significant. Finally, they search for a topcolor Z' decaying to t-tbar using events from the top quark mass measurement. While no significant evidence for new particles is found, upward fluctuations in the 500-600 GeV/c^2 region in all three channels (dijets, bb, and tt) are noted as an interesting possibility that additional Run 1b data has the potential to confirm or refute.

They find no evidence for such redshifts in high signal-to-noise composite spectra of bright quasars from SDSS. Fits to median composite spectra constructed from the Hu et al. sample also do not confirm the claimed FeII redshifts. The authors suggest the Hu et al. results were driven by low spectral S/N and the presence of HeII 4686 emission which was not included in their fits. Excluding HeII from the fits can produce the apparent FeII redshifts. The results challenge the idea that FeII emission originates from a region that is dynamically distinct from that producing the broad Hβ emission. Small FeII shifts relative to the rest frame are possible but can only be reliably detected in high S/N spectra.

The improved model reproduces key features of the caloric curve, shows clear phase transition signals in the heat capacity curves, and simultaneously fits fragment multiplicity and charge asymmetry data. Comparing the model's equilibrated source sequence to experimental data suggests the experimental excitation energies contain a non-equilibrium component that increases with bombarding energy.

Water vapor is an important molecule for the chemistry of interstellar clouds, and masing transitions of H2O have been used to trace high excitation gas around star forming regions. New observations of the 5(2,3)-4(3,2) transition of H2O at 325 GHz, along with previous observations of the 3(1,3)-2(2,0) transition at 183 GHz, provide information on the abundance and spatial distribution of H2O at large scales in the Orion molecular cloud. The 325 GHz emission is found to be spatially restricted to the Orion plateau region, while the 183 GHz emission is more extended. Radiative transfer modeling indicates H2O column densities of 10^17-10^18 cm^-2 and an H2O abundance relative to CO of around 1 in the plateau region. In the ridge molecular cloud, the 325 GHz emission is very weak, and the H2O abundance is estimated to be 10^-6 - 10^-7. These ground-based observations of masing H2O transitions provide the only means to obtain the spatial distribution of H2O in interstellar clouds. Comparison of the 325 GHz and 183 GHz transitions helps constrain the physical conditions in the emitting regions.

This paper studies the entanglement distribution among bipartite subsystems of two qubits interacting with two independent amplitude damping reservoirs. It is found that the entanglement can be stably distributed among all bipartite subsystems, in contrast to Markovian approximation results. An identity about the entanglement in all subsystems is always satisfied, independent of reservoir details which only affect the explicit time evolution and final distribution. The entanglement distribution depends on the reservoir properties and its coupling to the qubit. Stable entanglement distribution occurs when the qubit and reservoir form a bound state and non-Markovian effects are important. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) of the qubits is not always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs. The results reveal the nature of entanglement under decoherence and suggest protecting entanglement by modifying the reservoir properties via quantum reservoir engineering.

The SPDs are useful for studying the interaction between a jet and its surrounding medium or between particles within a jet, which is important in nuclear collisions at high energies. The authors argue that recombination is the basic hadronization process, even for fragmentation in vacuum, though the obtained SPDs are model-dependent. They show how the SPDs can be determined from the FFs at one value of Q^2, and the same procedure can be followed for other Q^2 values. While the numerical accuracy of the SPDs can be improved, the availability of the parametrizations is important for phenomenological applications. The Q^2 evolution of the SPDs requires further investigation, which can proceed in parallel with applying the role of shower partons to heavy-ion collisions. The authors provide examples demonstrating the utility of SPDs in studying single particle distributions and dihadron correlations in jets.

In these models, a fourth input parameter is required for a consistent renormalization scheme, and the dependence of the W boson mass on the top quark mass becomes logarithmic rather than quadratic as in the SM. The scalar triplet is shown to be non-decoupling, meaning the SM is not recovered in the limit of infinite triplet mass. Cancellations between the SM Higgs and triplet contributions allow the lightest neutral Higgs to have a mass up to a few TeV while still being consistent with the W mass measurement. The results demonstrate the importance of performing the renormalization correctly according to the electroweak structure of models beyond the SM.

This paper presents an interpolative approach for calculating the self-energy in multiorbital Anderson impurity models, which is crucial for realistic dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) simulations of strongly correlated materials. The method uses a rational function representation of the self-energy, with coefficients determined by imposing constraints from the slave-boson mean-field (SBMF) approach and the Hubbard I approximation. Comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations show the interpolative method accurately reproduces trends in quantities like occupancies, spectral functions, and self-energies over a wide range of parameters, with much greater computational efficiency than QMC. Some discrepancies remain in the width of Hubbard bands, mass renormalization, and electron count, which could be improved with better algorithms for the constraints. The interpolative scheme is robust, with solutions existing for all interaction strengths, dopings, and degeneracies. With its exceptional balance of accuracy and efficiency, the method enables fast scans of parameter space to determine interactions for given dopings and bandwidths, which is important for ab initio DMFT studies of real materials.

This paper studies the hydrodynamic limit for interacting particle systems on crystal lattices, which are generalizations of classical lattices with periodic global structures but inhomogeneous local structures. The scaling limit of a crystal lattice is constructed using discrete harmonic maps, and the convergence of the combinatorial Laplacian is proved by averaging over fundamental domains. The main result shows that under certain assumptions, the empirical density of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on the crystal lattice converges to the unique weak solution of a quasi-linear parabolic equation. The proof relies on a local ergodic theorem formulated using local function bundles and two types of local averages, as well as one-block and two-blocks estimates.

However, a small subset of AGN show anomalous colors indicating either synchrotron emission from radio jets or a possible millimeter excess related to the AGN accretion disk.

This paper studies the fundamental groups of complements of line arrangements in the complex projective plane. The authors focus on arrangements whose graphs are unions of disjoint cycles and have no line with more than two multiple points. They prove that the fundamental groups of such arrangements have conjugation-free geometric presentations, meaning the relations involve no conjugations of the generators. The proof analyzes the braid monodromy around multiple points and shows the conjugations in the relations can be simplified. This implies that for this family of arrangements, the incidence lattice determines the fundamental group of the complement. The authors also determine the exact structure of the fundamental group for the simplest arrangement in this family, whose graph is a triangle.

This paper uses constrained density functional theory (CDFT) to study the energy level alignment of a benzene molecule adsorbed on a graphene sheet. The charge transfer energies between the molecule and graphene are found to depend on the distance between them due to image charge formation, an effect not captured by standard DFT but well-described by CDFT. The presence of a Stone-Wales defect in graphene does not significantly affect the energy level alignment, while the presence of other benzene molecules does alter the charge transfer energies. The CDFT results agree well with GW calculations and can be explained by a simple classical electrostatic model accounting for the finite dielectric constant of graphene. The CDFT approach is computationally inexpensive compared to GW, allowing the effects of defects and additional molecules to be studied.

The authors studied critical Casimir forces (CCFs) between two spherical colloids immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture near a substrate using mean-field theory. They calculated the normal and lateral forces on one colloid for various boundary conditions (BCs) and geometrical configurations. The presence of the substrate lifts the degeneracy between symmetric BCs seen without a substrate and can make the lateral force between opposite BCs attractive. Many-body effects, determined by subtracting pairwise forces from the total force, can be significant when colloid-colloid and colloid-substrate distances are small and the mixture is near the critical point. Comparisons are made to quantum electrodynamic Casimir forces between dielectric spheres in a fluid and van der Waals forces between atoms near a surface. For two colloids vertically aligned with the substrate, the many-body contribution to the normal force depends on whether the colloids have the same or opposite BCs. The many-body effects contribute 10-15% to the total force in this configuration.

This paper studies the hydrogenation of coronene cations (PAH molecules) in the gas phase through exposure to hydrogen atoms. Using mass spectrometry, the authors show that odd hydrogenation states of coronene cations predominantly populate the mass spectrum, indicating the presence of barriers for further hydrogenation of odd hydrogenation states. The first hydrogen atom sticks to coronene cations without a barrier, while the second and fourth hydrogenations have barriers of about 72 and 43 meV respectively, and the third and fifth are barrierless. These alternating barriers appear to persist even at higher hydrogenation states. The derived hydrogenation barriers are similar to those calculated for neutral coronene, suggesting that hydrogenation of PAH cations and neutrals are comparable. In photodissociation regions (PDRs), both PAH cations and neutrals can contribute to H2 formation depending on the UV field intensity. The authors conclude that superhydrogenated PAH cations should be present in the interstellar medium and act as important catalysts for H2 formation, similar to their neutral counterparts.

The MOPED algorithm compresses data and speeds up likelihood function evaluation in astronomical data analysis by orders of magnitude. However, MOPED has limitations and can produce erroneous peaks in the likelihood function that impede parameter estimation, especially for multimodal and degenerate distributions. The validity of MOPED's results should be verified before use by checking for multiple intersections of contour surfaces of the compressed parameters. Using multiple fiducial models and averaging the log-likelihood across them can help maintain true peaks while decreasing the likelihood of incorrect peaks. Despite the limitations, MOPED can be extremely useful for reducing computational expense of likelihood functions in some cases.

If this speculation is correct, it would replace the cosmological constant problem with the challenge of constructing a microscopic theory of gravity compatible with these assumptions, possibly requiring new ingredients or novel formalisms.

The paper presents two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studying atomic properties of higher excited states in alkalies like rubidium-87. The method uses two counter-propagating lasers, a modulated pump and a probe, through a thermal vapor to generate sub-Doppler spectra with sidebands corresponding to atomic resonances. A three-level theoretical model using density matrix formalism reproduces the main features of the experimental spectra for amplitude and frequency modulated systems. Experimentally, the pump laser is locked to a specific transition while the probe is scanned over the desired excited state manifold, with the absorption of the pump monitored. The sidebands provide in-situ calibration of hyperfine splittings and allow locking the probe frequency to the excited transition. Precise measurements of magnetic dipole constants using this method show good agreement with relativistic many-body perturbation theory calculations. The technique overcomes issues of low signal-to-noise and unavailability of detectors at desired wavelengths, making it promising for further high-precision studies of excited state atomic properties.

The trihydrogen dication H3+, consisting of three protons and one electron, is one of the simplest Coulomb systems. Its stability has been studied extensively since the 1960s, with early work by Conroy suggesting it is not stable based on variational calculations. Subsequent experimental and theoretical studies also failed to find evidence of stable H3+. More recent high-accuracy calculations by Ackermann et al. excluded the possibility of stable H3+ in the electronic ground state, though explicit electronic energy data was only reported for one particular configuration. The present study re-examines the stability of H3+ using both a specialized variational approach with physically relevant trial functions and a standard variational approach using Gaussian trial functions. Numerical computations show the total energy as a function of internuclear distance does not indicate a minimum or non-adiabatic irregularities, leading to the conclusion that the H3+ molecular ion does not exist in an equilateral triangular configuration in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

Importantly, at a fixed small-scale density, the large-scale environment does not significantly influence recent star formation history, contradicting some previous studies. This result supports ""halo model"" descriptions of galaxy formation where only the masses of host dark matter halos strongly affect the properties of galaxies. The authors conclude that considering only host halo properties, rather than the larger-scale environment, may be sufficient to understand galaxy formation.

This paper describes a new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections in the antiferromagnetic ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation. The method is applicable for any interaction strength and is illustrated for the pure Hubbard model in 2D and 3D, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit in 2D, and low-U impurities in 2D. Results show the method interpolates properly between weak and strong coupling limits, approaching spin-wave theory results as U becomes large. The method is extended to study defect-induced enhancement/suppression of transverse spin fluctuations. Spin vacancies sharply enhance the quantum correction to sublattice magnetization, while low-U impurities strongly suppress it on average, although the correction is enhanced locally at the impurity sites. The highest magnon energy is compressed compared to the localized spin picture due to the small charge gap at impurity sites.

This paper outlines a method for quantifying the effective entanglement in optical systems using only homodyne measurement results and knowledge of the initial state preparation. The key idea is to project the full qubit-mode state onto a two-qubit subspace and bound the entanglement of the full state using the entanglement of this projection. Bounds on the parameters needed to construct the projected state are derived from the homodyne measurement results. The minimal entanglement compatible with these parameter bounds is found via semidefinite programming, providing a lower bound on the entanglement of the full state. This quantification scheme works particularly well for optical channels that introduce low noise, providing a useful tool for understanding how well optical devices preserve quantum correlations.

The study of dipole moments of elementary particles over the past 83 years has provided valuable insights into subatomic physics, leading to discoveries such as spin, radiative corrections, QED, and the quark structure of baryons. The magnetic dipole moment of the muon is sensitive to radiative corrections from QED, hadronic, and weak processes, and a significant difference between the experimental value and Standard Model prediction would indicate new physics. The current experimental value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment differs from the Standard Model prediction by 2.7 standard deviations, and a new experiment aims to reduce the experimental uncertainty. The Standard Model predicts unmeasurably small electric dipole moments for leptons, so observation of a non-zero EDM would also signify new physics. A new dedicated muon EDM experiment is being planned with a sensitivity of 10^-24 e-cm, which could test predictions of supersymmetric models. If supersymmetry is discovered, the muon anomalous magnetic moment will provide a clean measurement of tan(beta). Precision measurements of lepton moments and lepton flavor violation, along with neutron EDM searches, will continue to be important probes of physics beyond the Standard Model in the 21st century.

The nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields is examined, and reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting is reported. The time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators are given and solved. The expectation value of the output fields is calculated, and the nonlinear susceptibilities for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are obtained. Normal mode splitting in output fields is discussed with and without reactive coupling, and it is found that reactive coupling is necessary for the splitting to occur. The peak separation of the normal mode splitting increases with increasing pump power, and the reactive coupling can also cause four-wave mixing which generates an anti-Stokes component.

The behavior of QCD at finite baryon density and low temperature is important for understanding the structure of compact stars and supernovae cores. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but charge neutrality and beta-equilibrium conditions induce a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of pairing quarks, which can destroy Cooper pairing. Homogeneous neutral cold dense quark matter can be in the gapless 2SC (g2SC) or gapless CFL (gCFL) phase. These gapless color superconducting phases exhibit chromomagnetic instability, with imaginary Meissner screening masses for some gluons. The g2SC phase also exhibits a paramagnetic response to an external neutral baryon current, suggesting baryon currents can be spontaneously generated. Resolving the chromomagnetic instability may involve a spatially non-uniform LOFF state, gluon condensation, or a state with spontaneously generated Nambu-Goldstone currents. More work is needed to fully understand the instabilities and determine the true ground state of dense quark matter.

Increasing system size in simulations can be insufficient and misleading if the equilibration period is not long enough.

An experiment is proposed where a birefringent disk floats on top of a birefringent plate immersed in ethanol, with the repulsive van der Waals force balancing gravity to create a low-friction bearing. The disk, initially rotated by a laser, would return to equilibrium solely driven by the quantum fluctuation torque. Calculations show the disk rotation should be measurable within minutes for calcite. The torque's periodicity of 180° and dependence on the disk material are signatures to distinguish it from spurious effects. The results are estimated to be accurate within 14% based on uncertainties in the dielectric function model used.

This paper presents an immunity system called ""phagocytes"" to defend against active peer-to-peer (P2P) worms that exploit popular P2P applications for rapid topological worm infection. The phagocytes are a small subset of specially elected P2P hosts with high immunity that monitor connection patterns and traffic to detect worm events. Upon detection, the phagocytes perform local isolation, alert propagation, and software patching for internal defense. The phagocytes also provide access control and filtering mechanisms to prevent P2P traffic from leaking to external hosts and use an adaptive, interaction-based computational puzzle scheme to prevent external hosts from attacking the P2P overlay. The proposed holistic immunity system achieves both internal defense and external protection against active P2P worms. A prototype system is implemented and validated to be effective and efficient in massive-scale P2P overlay networks using realistic P2P network traces.

This paper investigates the effects of quantum gravity on the Planck era of the universe using various formulations of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The GUP predicts the existence of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum. Applying the GUP to the Planck era, the authors derive modifications to quantities such as the Planck time, length, mass, energy, and density. They find that under certain circumstances, the GUP-modified Planck quantities are larger by a factor of α0 compared to the standard Heisenberg uncertainty principle. These quantum gravity corrections can affect cosmological quantities such as the inflaton mass in the early universe. The corrections could potentially be studied through sensitive measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. Interestingly, the dimensionless entropy enclosed in the cosmological horizon at the Planck time remains unaltered by the quantum gravity effects. The authors plan to investigate further the transition from the quantum gravitational regime to the classical regime in a future paper.

This paper explores new methods to compute correlation functions of single trace operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, both at weak and strong coupling. At weak coupling, the authors show how deforming the CFT by a marginal or irrelevant operator introduces new divergences that are determined by the couplings in 3-point functions. This allows the couplings to be computed from the deformed anomalous dimension matrix using integrability techniques. At strong coupling, the authors compute 3-point functions with two heavy operators dual to classical string states and one light chiral operator using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The heavy operators act as tadpoles that source the supergravity field dual to the light operator. Several examples are considered, including point-like strings, circular strings, and folded spinning strings. The results agree with expectations from the renormalization group and provide a new way to compute these strong coupling 3-point functions. The authors conclude by discussing the relation to integrability and open problems.

Experiments were performed on two flat circular dielectric microwave resonators to test the accuracy of a 2D approximation using an effective index of refraction for modeling 3D dielectric cavities. The measured resonance spectra and length spectra were compared to predictions from a semiclassical trace formula combined with the 2D approximation. While overall agreement was good, systematic deviations were observed between the experimental peak positions and those predicted by the model. These deviations are attributed to the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and inaccuracies in the 2D approximation. An exact trace formula for the 2D circular dielectric resonator was derived and compared to the semiclassical one, showing the need for improvements to the semiclassical trace formula for periodic orbits close to the critical angle. The results demonstrate the limits of the 2D approximation for modeling 3D dielectric cavities, with the magnitude of systematic errors depending on the ratio of disk thickness to radius in a way that is not fully understood. Further work is needed to develop more accurate analytical approaches for 3D dielectric cavities.

The optimal policy selects the mode and allocates powers to the transmitting nodes in each time slot based on the instantaneous channel state information.

The acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination provide a ""standard ruler"" scale that can be measured at low redshifts to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe. The interpretation of these low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly measures the baryon-to-photon ratio and epoch of matter-radiation equality, even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted due to undetected relativistic components. The sound horizon depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and redshift of equality, both of which are well-constrained by the CMB. Measuring the acoustic scale at low redshifts constrains distance ratios between the low redshift and recombination, independent of the overall scale set by the matter density. Massive neutrinos and decaying particles could alter the sound horizon but should be detectable through other effects. The CMB and other probes can constrain the actual matter and radiation densities. In summary, the acoustic peak method of probing dark energy is robust to uncertainties in the matter density as long as the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well measured.

This study investigated the spread of infectious diseases on scale-free networks with the same degree distribution but different topological structures. Simulations of acute and chronic diseases were performed using SI and SIS epidemic models on networks generated by various algorithms. The prevalence of disease was found to be influenced by network topology, with more centralized and efficient networks leading to higher prevalence. Increasing the number of edges in the network also increased disease prevalence. Directed networks showed lower prevalence compared to undirected networks. Among undirected networks, the MB model had the lowest prevalence, while among directed networks, the BA model had the lowest prevalence. The results demonstrate the importance of considering network structure when modeling disease spread and suggest limiting contacts may help control outbreaks.

They define cost functions based on statistical error and fidelity to quantify the quality of the estimation protocols. The authors show that using entangled qubit pairs can enhance the estimation compared to using single qubits for the Pauli channel. They generalize the estimation method to quantum channels in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces. The problem of quantum channel estimation is related to quantum error correction, as a state satisfying certain conditions acts as a one-dimensional non-degenerate error correcting code.

This paper numerically analyzes the localization length of light in one-dimensional disordered photonic systems composed of alternating layers with different refractive indices. Positional disorder is introduced by randomly shifting the positions of the layer boundaries. For homogeneous stacks composed entirely of right-handed materials, the localization length exhibits a parabolic dependence on wavelength for long wavelengths and saturates at short wavelengths. The localization length is modulated by the allowed transmission bands, and this modulation decreases with increasing disorder. For mixed stacks with alternating layers of left-handed and right-handed materials, the localization length depends linearly on wavelength for low disorder and long wavelengths. Analytical expressions are derived to characterize the localization length in terms of system parameters like the reflection coefficient between layers. The localization behavior is more irregular for non-symmetric stacks where the optical path lengths alternate between layers.

The standard cosmological model contains only 4% ordinary matter, with 23% dark matter and 73% dark energy of unknown nature.

The particle physics candidates for dark matter include neutralinos, axions, and Kaluza-Klein states. The cosmological constant could explain dark energy but its value is much smaller than predicted by quantum field theory. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) can successfully reproduce galaxy rotation curves without dark matter by modifying gravity at low accelerations. Relativistic extensions of MOND like Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) theories aim to be consistent with cosmological observations but have difficulties. An alternative is to keep General Relativity and ordinary Newtonian gravity but introduce a new form of dark matter that behaves like a polarizable medium and reproduces MOND phenomenology. Such a model of dipolar dark matter has been constructed and is successful on both galactic and cosmological scales.

This paper studies the properties of polyampholytes (PAs), which are polymers with randomly charged monomers, using exact enumeration of short chains. The ground state energy of a PA depends strongly on its net charge Q but only weakly on the specific charge sequence. For Q less than a critical value Qc, PAs are compact at low temperatures, while for Q > Qc they are stretched. In 3 dimensions, a finite fraction of PAs have Q > Qc, leading to controversial predictions about their low-temperature state. The enumeration results support the existence of a transition from a dense globular state to an expanded state as Q increases past Qc. The ground states of PAs are almost always non-degenerate, in contrast to short-range interaction models. The heat capacity of neutral PAs has a peak that may indicate a transition between molten globule and frozen states at low temperature. Annealed PAs, where the charge sequence can rearrange, expel excess charge into fingers to form compact globules.

This paper studies the transverse distribution function of the free end of a three-dimensional wormlike polymer chain with one end fixed, using the exact solution for the Green's function. Numerical calculations using truncated matrices demonstrate that the distribution function has a bimodal shape for intermediate chain lengths in the range 1 < L/l_p < 5, where L is the contour length and l_p is the persistence length. Analytical results for short and long chains agree with previous studies using different methods. The bimodal distribution is interpreted as resulting from varying curvature fluctuations along the chain, with larger curvatures near the fixed end contributing to the maximum at finite transverse displacement. As chain length increases, the bimodality weakens as the polymer conformation becomes a meandering line with fluctuations less controlled by bending energy. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations show excellent agreement. The onset of bimodality occurs at a smaller number of segments for a 3D chain compared to a 2D chain.

Morphological investigations using RHEED and AFM show that the MnGe films consist of flat islands that enlarge during growth. Although the magnetic properties of MnGe thin films are qualitatively similar to bulk, the ordering temperature is enhanced to 200K. Magnetoresistivity measurements reveal no critical fields up to 5T, indicating that the helical magnetic structure in MnGe is more rigid than in MnSi.

This paper discusses the possibility that many gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be ""failed GRBs"" (FGRBs) - baryon-contaminated fireballs with initial Lorentz factors much less than 100 that cannot produce detectable gamma-ray emission but can still produce detectable afterglows. The existence of FGRBs means that the detection of orphan afterglows (afterglows without associated GRBs) does not necessarily imply that GRBs are highly collimated. Distinguishing between orphan afterglows from off-axis collimated GRBs and those from FGRBs is difficult due to uncertainties in the afterglow trigger time. The authors suggest some possible methods to overcome this difficulty, such as improving detection limits, associating orphans with fast X-ray transients, and detecting gravitational waves or neutrinos from GRBs.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are brief, intense flashes of gamma-rays that are followed by fading X-ray and optical afterglows. Observations by the XMM-Newton satellite of the X-ray afterglows of GRB 011211 and GRB 001025 are reported. The X-ray spectra of both afterglows can be fit by a power-law model with photon index around 2, which is typical of GRB afterglows and suggests the emission is from synchrotron radiation. No significant absorption above the Galactic value was detected in the X-ray spectra of either afterglow. A previous claim of detection of blue-shifted emission lines in the X-ray spectrum of GRB 011211 is disputed, with the lines likely being an instrumental artifact. Overall, the X-ray spectra of these two GRB afterglows are consistent with the standard model involving synchrotron emission from a decelerating relativistic blast wave.

The text analyzes the spin response of iron-based superconductors with two different superconducting gap scales. A spin resonance peak appears in the sign-changing s+- state below an indirect gap scale determined by the sum of gaps on two different Fermi surface sheets connected by a scattering wave vector. Comparison of the spin resonance peak frequency from inelastic neutron scattering with the superconducting gap sizes from various experimental techniques can determine if the peak is a true spin resonance, providing evidence for the sign-changing gap structure. The indirect gap is either the sum or difference of the two gap scales, depending on the Fermi surface geometry. A review of experimental data on the spin resonance peak and superconducting gaps in various iron-based superconductors is presented.

This work studies the effects of a correlated disorder potential, which is a 2D extension of the random dimer model (RDM), on a weakly interacting Bose gas on a square lattice. In the non-interacting case, the 2D dual RDM (2D-DRDM) potential introduces delocalized states at a resonance energy that is independent of dimensionality. For the weakly interacting Bose gas, the 2D-DRDM potential enhances the spatial homogeneity of the ground state and leads to a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate delocalization and condensate fraction as a function of disorder strength. The effects can be understood by a mode-matching argument that includes the role of interactions via the healing length. The results show that short-range correlations in a disordered potential can enhance the coherence of a weakly interacting many-body system.

The paper proposes two measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) schemes using phase encoding. The first scheme uses phase locking of two laser sources, while the second converts phase encoding to polarization encoding. The security of both schemes is proven against the most general attacks, taking into account basis-dependent flaws. Simulation results show the first scheme can tolerate some imperfect phase locking and intensity errors, while the second scheme requires very precise state preparation. The fidelity between density matrices in the two bases is a key parameter affecting performance. Accurate state preparation is crucial for the security of not only MDIQKD but also standard QKD. The schemes highlight the importance of avoiding basis-dependent flaws through very accurate state preparation.

Massive stars play a key role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation process is still not well understood. Recent high-resolution observations point toward an accretion formation scenario for massive stars, similar to low-mass stars. Mid-infrared observations of hot molecular cores associated with methanol masers, which trace regions of massive star formation, can provide further evidence. The authors observed three such cores at high spatial resolution using the Gemini North telescope and found multiple mid-infrared sources in each core. The methanol masers were found closest to the brightest mid-infrared source in each core. Monte Carlo simulations showed that it is difficult to generate the observed mass distributions of the most massive cluster members from the available gas in the cores using a standard initial mass function. Further observations of a larger sample of young, massive protoclusters are needed to draw general conclusions about massive star formation.

This paper proposes an all-optical method to detect Majorana fermions (MFs) in iron chains on a superconducting lead surface using a hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator (QD-NR) system. The QD is modeled as a two-level system coupled to the NR and the nearby MF. Coherent optical spectra of the QD, obtained using an optical pump-probe scheme, are analyzed to identify signatures of MFs. The coupling between the QD and MF results in the splitting of the QD energy levels, which appears as peaks in the absorption and dispersion spectra. The vibration of the NR enhances the MF signature by inducing additional sharp peaks at the resonator frequency. The coupling strength between the QD and MF can be determined from the splitting of the peaks in the spectra. This optical detection scheme provides a new method to supplement the existing electrical detection techniques for MFs and could enable applications in topological quantum computing.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies. A plausible model for SNe Ia is a white dwarf in a binary system accreting material from its companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes. Observations have not yet confirmed the companion stars that remain after the explosions. The authors propose a method to identify companion stars located inside SN Ia ejecta by looking for absorption lines with broad blue wings in the star's spectrum, caused by the expanding ejecta. They estimate the amount of Fe I in the ejecta of Tycho's supernova remnant and calculate spectra of a star at the center of the remnant. Factors such as ionizing photons from the shocked ejecta and assumptions about ion distributions could reduce or erase the distinct absorption features. Nevertheless, the authors argue that every SN Ia should have a period where the companion star exhibits these unique Fe I absorption features.

This paper proposes a new explanation for the origin of large HI supershells observed in some spiral galaxies, namely that they are inflated by radio jets from the galactic nucleus plowing through the interstellar medium. The model is applied to the galaxy NGC 3556, which has two large, symmetrically placed HI supershells that are difficult to explain by the standard models of localized starbursts or infalling gas clouds. Numerical simulations show that jets can undergo rapid flaring upon crossing an ISM/IGM density discontinuity, providing a mechanism to inflate the HI supershells. The jet parameters required are modest and consistent with those observed in other spiral galaxies. While the jets would no longer be visible once nuclear activity ceases, the HI supershells could persist, and secondary effects like sporadic star formation in the disk may continue to be influenced by the former nuclear activity.

The first color-magnitude diagrams of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I showed features similar to globular clusters, leading to the interpretation that it was a pure Population II system. However, the discovery of carbon stars and other differences indicated the presence of an intermediate-age population. New HST observations presented in this paper reveal a broad main sequence turnoff region, indicating star formation from 10-15 Gyr ago to less than 1 Gyr ago, with no obvious discontinuities. The lack of a conspicuous horizontal branch suggests the fraction of stars older than ~10 Gyr is small. The width of the red giant branch can be explained by the age dispersion alone, but the metallicity range is constrained to be between 0.0001 and 0.004, increasing with time. Leo I appears to have a larger fraction of intermediate-age and young stars compared to other dwarf spheroidals. Quantitative analysis using synthetic color-magnitude diagrams and further observations of variable stars can provide more details on the star formation history and very old population of this unique Local Group galaxy.

This paper studies the principal eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian operator perturbed by a gradient vector field in bounded domains. The main result shows that the principal eigenvalue remains bounded as the perturbation increases if and only if there exists a first integral of the vector field in a certain Sobolev space. The proof uses estimates on the Green's function and heat kernel of the perturbed operator, as well as approximation techniques for flows of Sobolev vector fields. A key step is showing that the Green's operator is compact, which allows defining the principal eigenpair via the Krein-Rutman theorem. Lower and upper bounds are established for the principal eigenvalue in terms of the first integrals of the vector field. The domains of the fractional Laplacian with and without perturbation are shown to coincide. The paper also discusses the non-local nature of the fractional Laplacian and the challenges it poses compared to the classical Laplacian case. The authors highlight the use of the Green's function as a robust approach when dealing with functions of limited regularity.

This work uses unsupervised machine learning techniques, in particular variational autoencoders, to identify phase transitions in physical systems without prior knowledge of the order parameter. The autoencoder learns a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system that coincides with the correct order parameter. The reconstruction error from the autoencoder can serve as a universal identifier for phase transitions. The approach is demonstrated on the Ising model and the XY model, showing the autoencoder can handle systems with discrete and continuous symmetries. The latent representation learned by the autoencoder is able to capture the relevant microscopic and macroscopic properties of the systems. This unsupervised learning approach provides a promising way to find order parameters of systems where they are not known a priori.

The symbiotic system Z Andromedae, consisting of a white dwarf and red giant star, underwent an unusual double-peaked outburst in 1984-1986. Detailed modeling of the UV and optical spectra during this period reveals that the outburst was likely caused by the collision of the white dwarf wind with two shells ejected from the red giant. The dip in brightness between the two peaks is attributed to a sudden increase in distance between the white dwarf and the downstream nebula, due to the collision with the second shell. The relatively low luminosity of the outburst may be explained by distortion of the wind collision by the oncoming second shell. Periodic smaller peaks in the light curve before and after the main outburst are likely due to additional red giant shell ejections. The lack of broad emission lines and jets, seen in other symbiotic star outbursts, suggests the 1984-1986 Z Andromedae outburst had a different character. Modeling the continuum spectral energy distribution constrains the distances of the emitting nebulae from the white dwarf.

The authors test their method on a sample of metal-poor stars selected from the RAVE survey and compare the results to standard 1D LTE techniques, finding significant systematic biases in the LTE approach that increase at lower metallicities. Accurate spectroscopic stellar parameters are critical, as they are used to determine other fundamental properties like mass, age, and distance by comparing to stellar evolution models. The authors discuss the implications of the large differences between NLTE and LTE parameter estimates, such as effects on derived distances and abundance gradients in the Milky Way. They conclude that using the Balmer line method for effective temperature and NLTE calculations for surface gravity and metallicity provide the most reliable stellar parameters.

The effects of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure have been detected in samples of high redshift QSOs, galaxies, and GRBs. A more direct way to detect weak lensing is through the fluxes of standard candles like Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). The authors analyze a sample of 50 high-redshift SNIa and find that brighter SNIa preferentially lie behind overdense regions of foreground galaxies, with a statistical significance of >99%. This relation is consistent with weak lensing, where mass concentrations amplify SNIa lying behind them. Modeling shows the slope of the relation depends on the amount and distribution of matter along the line of sight but not on galaxy biasing. The observed slope is difficult to reproduce with standard models of mass distribution. Combining magnification and shear data for a large uniform set of SNIa could provide a powerful probe of the mass distribution in the nearby universe at scales of a few Mpc. The effect of lensing by these structures on the derived cosmological parameters appears to be small for the current SNIa sample.

The paper studies the periodic Anderson model for heavy fermion metals, Kondo insulators, and intermediate valence materials using the local moment approach within dynamical mean field theory. In the strongly correlated Kondo lattice regime, the problem is characterized by a single, exponentially small coherence scale in terms of which physical properties exhibit universal scaling. The theory handles all relevant energy and temperature scales, from the low-energy coherent Fermi liquid to the high-energy incoherent regime. Single-particle dynamics, optical conductivity, and DC transport are investigated, with a focus on the thermal evolution of these properties. The optical conductivity exhibits a Drude peak at low temperatures which is destroyed with increasing temperature, merging into an optical pseudogap. Significant optical absorption occurs near the direct gap, which is distinct from the low-energy coherence scale. The direct gap is thermally eroded only at very high temperatures compared to the coherence scale. The theory is able to encompass all interaction strengths from weak to strong coupling. The following paper will compare the theoretical results directly to experiments on three heavy fermion materials and an intermediate valence compound.

This paper studies the effects of static and fluctuating tension on the looping kinetics of semiflexible polymers using Brownian dynamics simulations. For static tension, the looping time increases dramatically with small tensions of ~100 fN, especially for longer chains, due to the cooperativity of the chain. With fluctuating tension that changes sign on average after time τ, the looping time shows a resonant minimum at an optimal flipping time τ_opt, which is an extension of the resonant activation phenomenon for a single Brownian particle. The effects of fluctuating tension are also more significant for longer chains. The results are consistent with recent experiments and suggest that biopolymers may self-organize optimally by utilizing ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations.

This paper presents an extension of the glassy wormlike chain (GWLC) model to describe the inelastic nonlinear mechanical behavior of sticky biopolymer networks. The extended model incorporates a dynamically evolving network of thermo-reversible sticky bonds that can break and reform under stress, leading to phenomena such as fluidization, cyclic softening, and inelastic shakedown. The yield force for the onset of fluidization is found to be sensitive to the deformation rate, and the fluidization response is accompanied by a cyclic softening effect. The model integrates experimentally confirmed features of the GWLC response with a simple bond kinetics scheme, allowing complex nonlinear physical remodeling effects to be addressed. The analysis can be further extended to account for irreversible plastic deformations by allowing transiently broken bonds to reform at new sites after strong deformations with finite residual displacement.

This paper studies the realization of topological Mott insulator (TMI) phases in electronic systems on a honeycomb lattice using mean-field calculations and multi-variable variational Monte Carlo (mVMC) methods. The authors find that charge density wave (CDW) states with 6-sublattice unit cells are more stable than previously estimated CDWs with smaller unit cells when electronic transfer is limited to nearest neighbors. To stabilize the TMI phase, the Fermi velocity at the Dirac point needs to be suppressed compared to the standard Dirac dispersion, which can be achieved by introducing third-neighbor hopping. The authors provide quantitative criteria for the emergence of TMIs based on the strength of the Coulomb repulsion and the Fermi velocity. Bilayer graphene, where the Fermi velocity can be tuned by changing the rotation angle between layers, is identified as a related real material system. Smaller Fermi velocities are found to stabilize TMIs at weaker Coulomb repulsion, offering a potential breakthrough in realizing 2D TMIs. Further analysis is needed to determine experimental methods for controlling TMI stability and to quantitatively estimate the stability in bilayer graphene systems using ab initio methods.

Histograms of equilibrium chain conformations differ noticeably between the different chain flexibilities, with inter-chain correlations being weak in flexible chains but strong excluded volume effects causing separation into coexisting chain fractions in semiflexible and rodlike chains at high grafting densities.

G65.2+5.7 is a supernova remnant that was initially observed in the 1970s but then ignored until recently, when it was found to belong to the class of thermal composite supernova remnants. These remnants have a shell-like radio morphology but a centrally-bright X-ray morphology due to thermal emission. Optical observations show that G65.2+5.7 has evolved into the radiative phase, with cool, recombining gas behind the shock front. Radio observations reveal a shell-like structure, while X-ray observations with ROSAT show centrally concentrated emission with a shallow temperature gradient, confirming its thermal composite nature. The remnant is estimated to be 90,000 years old and 900 pc distant, with the X-ray emitting gas having a density of 0.01 cm^-3. A slightly extended hard X-ray source is seen near the center, but its nature is unknown. G65.2+5.7 may be interacting with a molecular cloud, but confusion with Galactic emission makes this difficult to establish conclusively.

At least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz, which is potentially a signature of an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). Submillimetre fluxes measured with SCUBA on the JCMT indicate little contamination from dust, free-free, and extended nonthermal emissions in the LLAGNs showing inverted spectra. An inverse correlation is found between the high-frequency radio spectrum and low-frequency radio core power, suggesting flux ratios between the steep-spectrum jet and inverted-spectrum ADAF disc vary among LLAGNs. The authors conclude that radio cores with inverted high-frequency spectra, which are the long-sought signatures of the ADAF, reside in at least ten LLAGNs in their sample. These findings encourage further LLAGN surveys at higher frequencies to prove the ADAF model.

The methods are tested on simulated cluster datasets with varying levels of photometric error. For low photometric errors of 0.003 mag, the ""A_V RMS"" and ""A_V Slope"" methods can determine R_V to within ±0.3, while for errors of 0.030 mag, R_V is recovered to within ±0.8 with some biases. The ""Optical/IR"" method is less precise, yielding R_V to ±1.5 over the full range of photometric errors. Applying the methods to NGC 4833 gives a mean R_V of 3.0±0.2. The scatter in NGC 4833's horizontal branch indicates the Schlegel et al. (1998) dust map averages over small-scale variations that are ~6% of the mean reddening.

The authors use the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) combined with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the Kondo lattice model on a square lattice, allowing for antiferromagnetic order. They find no evidence of a Kondo breakdown throughout the phase diagram, even deep in the antiferromagnetically ordered state. The transition from the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic state is continuous and associated with backfolding of the large heavy fermion Fermi surface. Within the antiferromagnetic metallic phase, there is a continuous Fermi surface topology change from hole pockets centered around (π,π) at small magnetization to ones centered around (0,0) at larger magnetization. Using mean-field modeling, they show this topology change corresponds to two continuous Lifshitz transitions. The energy scales required to fully resolve the nature of this transition are currently inaccessible within the DCA+QMC approach.

This work presents a fast and efficient method, called the frozen nucleon approximation, to calculate inclusive 2-particle 2-hole (2p-2h) response functions in the relativistic Fermi gas model for neutrino-nucleus scattering. The approximation assumes the initial momenta of the two struck nucleons can be neglected for high enough momentum transfer. The presence of virtual delta excitations requires introducing an averaged ""frozen"" delta propagator. The main advantage is reducing the number of nested integrals needed from 7 to 1, making it well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross sections. The frozen approximation is validated by comparing 2p-2h response functions with exact calculations, showing good agreement except for very low energy transfer at threshold. The validity suggests that detailed information about the two nucleons' momenta is lost in the inclusive 2p-2h responses, except for the delta current which requires the averaged propagator. This efficient approach can be useful for implementing 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo event generators for neutrino experiments.

5) Experimental evidence suggests the existence of a 38 MeV quantum, possibly a light scalar glueball, that mediates quark-pair creation and corresponds to the lowest-order empty-universe solution for strong interactions.
6) This particle, designated as the σ(38), has similar properties to the electroweak Higgs boson, coupling to quarks proportionally to their mass.
7) Indications of the σ(38) and related hybrid spectrum have been observed in various data sets, including an interference effect in annihilation data and excess signals in mass distributions.
8) The σ(38) is believed to consist of a mini-universe filled with glue, forming a light scalar glueball that does not interact through electroweak forces.
9) The existence of two heavier replicas of the σ(38), with masses two and three times heavier, is also suggested by the data.
10) Further inspection of larger data sets by the BaBar collaboration is urged to confirm the existence of the σ(38) and its related hybrid spectrum with higher statistics.

The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the 1980s to describe the nonmonotonic dependence of a system's response on noise added to a periodic input signal. From a statistical perspective, stochastic resonance refers to the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by adding an optimal level of noise. This paper studies the problem of estimation and hypothesis testing for a model where a constant subthreshold signal is perturbed by adding noise from a diffusion process, and the perturbed signal is observed either by the proportion of time it spends above a threshold or by measuring its energy when above the threshold. The authors propose estimators for the two observation schemes and study their asymptotic properties, showing the emergence of stochastic resonance in an example. They also solve the problem of testing a simple hypothesis against a simple alternative using the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion, finding that the overall probability of error depends nonmonotonically on the noise level, demonstrating stochastic resonance. The paper discusses the powerful use of ergodic diffusions as noise in stochastic resonance problems and suggests areas for further investigation.

The longitudinal thermal conductivity was measured in two single crystals of YBa2Cu3O7-δ high-temperature superconductors in the presence of a planar magnetic field rotated parallel to the CuO2 planes. Fourfold oscillations in the thermal conductivity were observed below 15 K, which changed to a maximum developing at high angles above this temperature. The observed behavior can be reproduced by a model involving Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the 2D BRT expression for thermal conductivity assuming a d-wave pairing symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Small differences in the angle patterns between twinned and untwinned samples can be explained by different impurity concentrations and oxygen deficiencies.

This paper studies purely cosmetic surgeries on knots in the 3-sphere, which are surgeries along distinct slopes that yield the same oriented manifold. The authors prove that if a knot K has certain conditions on its Jones polynomial derivatives, then surgeries along K with different slopes cannot be purely cosmetic. They apply this result to show that most knots with crossing number at most 10, as well as certain two-bridge knots and twisted Whitehead doubles, do not admit purely cosmetic surgeries. The key ingredients are a surgery formula involving a knot invariant defined by Lescop, and the relation of this invariant to the Jones polynomial and finite type invariants.

This paper examines the phenomenology of hypercharged anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (HCAMSB) models at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The allowed parameter space and sparticle mass spectra of HCAMSB models are calculated, taking into account various experimental and theoretical constraints. Consequences for LHC sparticle searches are explored, with collider events typically characterized by high pT b and t quarks, missing ET, and observable tracks from late decaying charginos. The LHC reach for 100 fb-1 of data should extend up to m(3/2) = 105 TeV for small alpha and 42 TeV for large alpha, corresponding to a reach in m(gluino) of 2.2 TeV and 900 GeV respectively. HCAMSB models should be distinguishable from minimal AMSB models at the LHC based on the presence of Z->ll candidates in cascade decay events, reflecting the different mass orderings of gauginos in the two scenarios.

The authors present an analysis of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) based on data from the Norris Survey of the Corona Borealis Supercluster. They find that their local LF agrees well with the Las Campanas Redshift Survey but has a higher normalization than the Stromlo/APM survey, possibly due to photometric errors in the APM catalog. The authors observe evolution of the LF for blue, star-forming galaxies out to z~1, in agreement with several previous surveys, but do not find evidence for short-term bursts of star formation. The LFs of the Corona Borealis and Abell 2069 superclusters show an excess of very bright galaxies and a possible upturn at faint magnitudes compared to the field LF, likely reflecting environmental influences on galaxy formation and evolution. Overall, the results add to the emerging consistent picture of the evolution of the galaxy LF.

Rapidity gaps, regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron, and are attributed to color singlet exchange between partons. Bjorken predicted the fraction of dijet events with rapidity gaps using a two-gluon exchange model, but Tevatron data cast doubt on this model. This paper reconsiders the two-gluon exchange model and finds that determining the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative. Unitarization of the model leads to color singlet fractions that differ substantially from the two-gluon exchange model and depend strongly on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer. The unitarized model can fit Tevatron data on the gap fraction as a function of jet transverse energy and pseudorapidity separation by taking the survival probability and a universal Coulomb phase shift as free parameters. The authors conclude that non-perturbative information may be indispensable for quantitatively understanding hard color singlet exchange and rapidity gap formation.

Historical monthly data on energy consumption and factors like temperature, humidity, population, and GDP per capita from 1994 to 2013 was used to train the ANN model. The model was evaluated using error criteria such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error, with 2-fold and k-fold cross validation techniques. The model was able to accurately forecast energy consumption for 2012 and 2013, with error criteria within tolerable bounds.

This paper explores salient object detection, which aims to identify the most visually distinctive objects in an image. The authors collected a dataset of explicit saliency judgments from humans and found that these judgments agree with free-viewing fixations, indicating that humans tend to look at objects they consider salient. They also compiled two new benchmark datasets for salient object detection that are more challenging than existing datasets. The authors propose a simple baseline model for salient object detection that separates the problem into two steps: 1) selecting a salient region using a fixation prediction model, and 2) segmenting the object within that region. This model outperforms 8 state-of-the-art methods on the new datasets. Analysis reveals that the main reason models fail on complex images is because they often segment the wrong object, not because they fail to accurately segment the object. The authors suggest that progress in salient object detection will require both improving object segmentation as well as determining which object is most salient. The datasets enable further research on the relationship between fixations, saliency judgments, and salient object detection.

Using the homological hypotheses and U-action on Heegaard Floer groups, the problem is reduced to calculating maps induced by 2-handle additions only. A cobordism made of 2-handles can be represented by a special multi-pointed triple Heegaard diagram in which holomorphic triangles can be counted algorithmically. The 1-handle and 3-handle maps are defined using connected sum decompositions. The paper also discusses the U-action on Heegaard Floer homology and its relation to the cobordism maps.

The aim in physics is to understand the physical picture responsible for a phenomenon, which often requires selecting the essential degrees of freedom. In QCD at low energies, the essential degrees of freedom are constituent quarks and the interactions between them mediated by pseudoscalar, vector, and scalar mesons, which arise from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges produce a strong short-range spin-flavor force between quarks, while their tensor forces largely cancel and the net spin-orbit force is weak, consistent with the observed baryon spectrum. A semirelativistic chiral constituent quark model with a linear confining potential and chiral meson-exchange interactions between quarks provides a unified description of light and strange baryon spectra. The same short-range part of the chiral interaction that produces hyperfine splittings in baryons also induces a strong short-range repulsion in the NN interaction when the 6q system is treated microscopically. The long- and intermediate-range NN attraction arises from the Yukawa part of meson exchanges between quarks in different nucleons. If the strong short-range NN repulsion is mostly related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, a similar repulsion, though likely weaker, should exist in other YN and YY systems.

The solvent flow system pumps solvent from a storage tank through filters and into the tubs during the wash cycle, and drains the solvent back to the tank during the drain and spin cycles. The air flow system circulates heated air through the tubs during the drying cycle to vaporize solvent from the clothes, and the vapors are condensed and recovered. A refrigeration system cools the storage tank to minimize solvent vaporization and also condenses vapors during the drying cycle using separate evaporator coils. Controls including a timer mechanism automate the cleaning cycle, with a special ""cartridge dry"" mode to dry and recover solvent from filter cartridges before replacement. The machine has various safety features such as locking the door during operation and balancing air pressure.

The system uses a heat exchanger to separate evaporating water from the useful cooling air, and recirculates working air from the cooled enclosure to the wet side of the heat exchanger. The wet side operates by gravity flow of water down the inner surfaces of tubes, with countercurrent flow of working air, while useful air passes externally across the tubes on the dry side. Additional efficiency is obtained by flowing exhaust air in heat exchange with incoming fresh air, and a hybrid system incorporates a vapor compression refrigeration unit to cool a small portion of the useful air below its dew point for dehumidification. Specific constructional details are provided for the heat exchanger tubes and water distribution. The system provides efficient sensible cooling at a lower energy cost compared to conventional vapor compression refrigeration.

The invention relates to a method and arrangement for compressing gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method involves compressing the gas to a higher pressure, cooling it by heat exchange, and feeding it back into the pipeline at a lower temperature and increased pressure compared to the entry conditions. During warmer periods when cooling by heat exchange alone is insufficient, the gas is compressed to an excess pressure substantially higher than the desired exit pressure, cooled by heat exchange to a temperature above the desired exit temperature, and then expanded to the desired exit pressure to obtain further cooling. The arrangement includes compressors, heat exchangers, valve-controlled pipelines, and an electronic control system to carry out the compression and expansion steps. The compression is preferably carried out in three stages, with two primary compression stages having similar pressure ratios and an additional compression stage to reach the excess pressure.

The invention improves the locating and tracing of a concealed conductive object, such as a buried pipe or cable, when a second object is adjacent to the first. The system uses a transmitter with two antennae to induce distinguishable alternating currents in the two objects, and a receiver that senses the magnetic fields associated with the currents and produces an output signal dependent on sensing both fields. The transmitter antennae are optimally positioned over the two objects to induce the currents. The receiver output has two distinct nulls when positioned over the two objects, allowing easier tracing compared to prior systems. The currents can be made distinguishable by using different carrier frequencies, amplitude modulation, or pulsing. The effect is enhanced when the horizontal separation between the objects is less than 1.5 times their depth. The transmitter can also be used with a single antenna when only one object is present. The invention is an improvement over prior magnetic field and active current-inducing techniques for locating concealed conductive objects.

To reduce this time, the maximum capacity and required voltage of each cell to achieve a target range are determined. The charging time for the battery pack is calculated based on the cell requiring the greatest change in amp-hours. If the time to balance the cells exceeds the charging time, the cells are balanced first by activating resistive circuitry in parallel with each cell to shunt current around the cells that require less charging. Once all cells are balanced, the battery is charged until the target voltage is reached on all cells.

The Internet relies on the domain name system to ensure unique e-mail and website addresses, with 13 root servers at the heart of the system coordinating the translation of domain names into Internet addresses. The U.S. government supported the development of the domain name system and in 1998 began a process to transition technical management to the private sector. The Department of Commerce entered into an agreement with ICANN, a non-profit corporation, to jointly design and test the transition. ICANN has made progress on increasing competition but has been slower to address security, representation, and private-sector coordination. In 2002, ICANN's president concluded that reform was needed for ICANN to succeed in its mission. The Department of Commerce provides informal oversight of the transition but has not issued public status reports or commented on reform proposals. The transition is behind schedule and ICANN's effectiveness remains in question. The Department faces upcoming decisions on whether to extend the agreement with ICANN and what changes may be needed.

The Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) outlines nine audit standards that define audit quality, including standards for workpapers which provide documentation of the audit. A review of IRS audit workpapers found that auditors did not always meet the requirements of the workpaper standard. IRS' Examination Quality Measurement System has historically found problems with the quality of audit workpapers. Supervisory review of audit workpapers is IRS' primary quality control mechanism, but there was limited documentation of such reviews in the audits sampled. IRS officials noted that supervisors monitor audits through other means besides workpaper review, but little documentation of these other processes was found. The lack of documentation raises questions about the extent of supervisory involvement in audits. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendation to require audit supervisors to document their review of audit workpapers as a control over audit quality. IRS plans to make revisions to the IRM to implement this recommendation by October 1998. The Examination Quality Measurement System measures the quality of closed audits against the nine IRS audit standards.

Some employers are experimenting with flexible employment arrangements to retain older workers, but these programs are not yet widespread. Public employers, especially in teaching, have been more active in providing incentives for older workers to stay employed.

In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, agencies reported receiving over 24,600 and 62 IQA correction requests respectively, with the drop largely due to FEMA no longer classifying flood map corrections as IQA requests in 2004. The impact of IQA on agencies could not be determined because agencies and OMB do not track the effects of implementing the law.

Mutual funds and banks are both financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and channel them back into the economy, but mutual funds invest primarily in securities while banks make loans and invest in debt securities. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining since the 1960s as companies and households have turned more to securities markets for financing. The process of securitization, where securities issuance supplants bank credit as a source of finance, has further diminished the role of bank loans. While the total amount in mutual funds ($2,172 billion) was less than in bank deposits ($3,462 billion) at the end of 1994, mutual fund assets had grown by nearly $1.2 trillion since 1989 while deposits had declined by $89 billion. Estimates suggest that the impact of mutual fund growth on bank deposits from 1990-1994 was sizable but probably less than $700 billion. The shift from deposits to mutual funds has little effect on the overall supply of loanable funds in the economy, but affects the intermediaries through which finance flows. Mutual fund investments have provided significant liquidity to securities markets, making it easier for a broader range of borrowers to raise funds through securities issuance. The residential, consumer, and business sectors have all increased their access to finance through securities markets, although to varying degrees. There is a possibility that small businesses heavily dependent on small banks for loans could face reduced credit availability if their banks lose deposits to mutual funds, but small banks have had ample liquidity in recent years to continue lending even if faced with deposit outflows.

The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 requires specific activities to improve the nation's preparedness for bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are pursuing major public health information technology (IT) initiatives to strengthen disease surveillance systems and facilitate communication among public health entities at the federal, state, and local levels. However, these initiatives face challenges related to the lack of a national health IT strategy, data standards, coordination among federal, state and local public health agencies, and effective IT planning and management. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that HHS align its initiatives with the national health IT strategy and federal health architecture, coordinate with state and local initiatives, and encourage adoption of data standards, while DHS should align its initiatives with HHS's efforts. Until these challenges are addressed, progress toward improving the public health IT infrastructure and the ability to share critical information during emergencies will be limited.

A GAO survey of large defined benefit (DB) pension plan sponsors found that over the last decade, many have modified benefit formulas, converted to hybrid plans, or frozen plans, especially for nonbargaining employees. Most sponsors increased or maintained 401(k) contributions and adopted automatic enrollment. While all surveyed sponsors offered health benefits to active employees and some retirees, many have reduced or eliminated retiree health benefits for future retirees. Despite legislative changes, most sponsors were unlikely to make major changes to DB plans in the near future. However, the majority were pessimistic about forming new DB plans.

Medicare contracts with intermediaries and carriers to process claims, but contracting differs from most federal programs by limiting competition and not allowing performance incentives. Allowing Medicare to competitively choose contractors from a broader array of entities, have contractors specialize in specific functions, pay based on performance, and more easily terminate contracts could improve efficiency and performance. However, competitive contracting with new entities will pose challenges for CMS, requiring time to develop statements of work, integrate contractors, and establish evaluation criteria. CMS should adopt an incremental approach, as seen with program safeguard contractors (PSCs), since immediate results are unlikely.

The four programs - Program Development and Implementation Grants, Program Enhancement Projects, Comprehensive School Grants, and Systemwide Improvement Grants - share the same goals, target similar students, and provide comparable services, suggesting they could be consolidated. Consolidating the programs would reduce administrative burden and allow the Department of Education to reallocate resources to other important activities like site visits and technical assistance. However, cost savings from consolidation would likely be small since the programs are funded through a single budget appropriation and staff reductions are unlikely.

The FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a computerized criminal justice information system that serves as a repository of data on crimes and criminals and as a locator for missing persons. The CJIS division within the FBI operates NCIC in cooperation with state and local agencies. CJIS and the CJIS Advisory Policy Board have taken steps to ensure law enforcement agencies (LEAs) implement the requirement to enter reports of missing children into NCIC within 2 hours of receipt. CJIS audits of state agencies found many states out of compliance with the 2-hour requirement. Audit approaches used by state agencies to assess LEA compliance with the 2-hour requirement varied. LEA officials identified custody disputes and coordination with child welfare agencies as potential impediments to timely reporting of missing children. GAO made recommendations for CJIS to establish minimum audit standards for assessing compliance and for CJIS and OJJDP to obtain information on challenges LEAs face in meeting the 2-hour requirement.

This report examines factors affecting injury risk in automobile crashes, focusing on crash type and severity, automobile size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender. The analysis found that crash severity is the most important predictor of injury, followed by crash type, safety belt use, occupant age and gender, and vehicle weight. Different driver groups have different injury risks, with men and younger drivers more likely to be in severe single-vehicle crashes, while women and older drivers are more likely to be injured in less severe multi-vehicle collisions. The report concludes that efforts to reduce injuries should focus on increasing safety belt use, encouraging both airbags and automatic safety belts, and improving crashworthiness for women and older occupants.

The U.S. Coast Guard, a multimission maritime military service within the Department of Homeland Security, is organized into two major commands divided into 9 districts and 35 sectors. The Coast Guard's fiscal year 2008 budget request of $8.73 billion reflects a smaller increase than in previous years, with requests for new capital spending down as the agency slows the pace of new acquisitions for the $24 billion Deepwater program and other capital projects. The Coast Guard met fewer performance targets in 2006 than in 2005, but overall performance trends remain positive for most mission programs. The Coast Guard is reorganizing its command and control structure, consolidating deployable specialized forces under a single command and acquisition management under a single acquisitions officer. While some major acquisition projects like Deepwater continue to face challenges, others like the Nationwide Automatic Identification System and Rescue 21 search and rescue system are making progress. However, maintenance challenges have diminished the Coast Guard's polar icebreaking capability, and competing budget priorities have left the agency unable to pursue systematic replacement of its aging aids-to-navigation and domestic icebreaking fleets.

User fees can be an approach to financing federal programs, with fees assigned to readily identifiable users to cover part or all of the costs of the programs and activities that benefit them. The extent to which a program is funded by user fees should generally be guided by who primarily benefits from the program - the general public, identifiable users, or both. Determining a program's beneficiaries and assigning costs requires reliable accounting of program costs. Striking a balance between ensuring compliance and minimizing administrative costs is a key challenge in determining when and how to collect a fee. Congress determines the extent to which an agency may access and obligate fee collections. Regular reviews of fees can improve transparency, help ensure fees remain aligned with program costs and activities, and provide an opportunity to solicit stakeholder input. Effectively communicating with stakeholders involves sharing relevant information and analysis as well as providing opportunities for their input. Any user fee design embodies trade-offs among equity, efficiency, revenue adequacy, and administrative burden, so policymakers must balance the importance placed on each of these criteria.

In the mid-1970s, structural changes in the U.S. economy led to many workers being dislocated from their jobs. In response, Congress enacted the Unemployment Compensation Amendments in 1993, requiring states to profile new UI claimants to identify those likely to exhaust benefits and refer them to reemployment services. Most states use statistical models to profile claimants, but many have not updated their models in years, potentially reducing their predictive accuracy. Data shows that only a small percentage of profiled claimants get referred to and complete reemployment services.

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of endangered or threatened species, and requires federal agencies to ensure their actions do not jeopardize these species. If a federal action cannot be modified to avoid jeopardy to a species, the agency, governor, or permit applicant can apply for an exemption, which is decided by the Endangered Species Committee. The exemption process, created by Congress after the Tellico Dam controversy, allows the Committee to grant an exemption if certain criteria are met, while still requiring mitigation measures. Since the ESA was enacted, exemptions have been sought only six times, and granted only twice. Factors like the stringent requirements, need for the applicant to fund mitigation, and the fact that exemptions apply to actions rather than species have likely limited interest in the process. Exemptions have been considered but not sought for California water projects, with legislative action being pursued instead.

The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed repeatedly over the years, with the current system allowing a $3,000 annual deduction of net capital losses against ordinary income. Capital gains and losses are concentrated among higher-income taxpayers, with about two-thirds of gains and losses realized by the top 2% of the income distribution. Increasing the net capital loss deduction limit would primarily benefit a small proportion of high-income individuals and may not effectively stimulate the economy.

Employers cannot interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in exercising their NLRA rights, while unions are prohibited from restraining or coercing employees in exercising these rights. Employers can make non-coercive anti-union speeches to employees on company property without allowing unions equal opportunity, but cannot make speeches to massed assemblies within 24 hours before an election. Employers can prohibit non-employee union organizers from distributing literature on company property if the union can reach employees through other channels, unless the location and employee residences make them inaccessible to the union.

Banks play a central role in the U.S. financial system and economy by connecting borrowers and savers and allocating capital. Banking is inherently risky, so a regulatory system has developed over time to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks. The 2008-2009 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the regulatory system and led to regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. Key issues in bank regulation include capital requirements, restrictions on bank activities, consumer protection rules, regulation of large ""too big to fail"" banks, regulatory burden on small community banks, the appropriate balance between regulator independence and accountability, and the Congressional Review Act. In addition to regulatory issues, banks are affected by economic and market trends such as the growth of shadow banking, the emergence of financial technology (fintech), rising interest rates, and competition from other institutions like credit unions. Specific issues include whether post-crisis regulations have restricted the availability of credit, whether regulatory burden has led to consolidation among community banks, and the potential benefits and risks of fintech.

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is an alternative tax calculation that adds back certain deductions and taxes income above an exemption level at 26% or 28%. The AMT exemption is not indexed for inflation, causing an increasing number of taxpayers to be subject to the AMT over time, rising from 1/10 of 1% of returns in 1987 to a projected 6.3% in 2009. The AMT is increasingly affecting middle and upper-middle income taxpayers. Fixing the AMT is costly, with indexing the exemption estimated to cost $13.9 billion by 2008. Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liability without changing the AMT push more taxpayers onto the AMT. A large portion of the tax cuts in marriage penalty relief legislation would be ""taken back"" by the AMT. There are differing views on whether the AMT should be eliminated, maintained in its current form, or modified.

The U.S. Constitution provides two methods for the President to appoint officers: with Senate advice and consent, or unilaterally during a Senate recess. President Obama made controversial recess appointments to the CFPB and NLRB in January 2012 during a 3-day break between pro forma Senate sessions. The appointments raise legal questions about what constitutes a ""recess"" under the Recess Appointments Clause and whether the Senate can use pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments. If challenged in court, justiciability issues like standing and the political question doctrine could prevent a ruling on the merits of the appointments. If the merits are reached, a key question is whether pro forma sessions are real Senate sessions that break a recess and prevent the President from using his recess appointment power. The CFPB appointment also raises questions about whether the specific statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act prevents a recess-appointed CFPB director from exercising certain powers granted to a Senate-confirmed director.

About 27.5% of state and local government employees (6.6 million workers) are not covered by Social Security, with coverage rates varying considerably across states. Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory for most state and local government employees not already covered by a public pension plan, starting in July 1991. Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all newly hired state and local government employees have been part of the policy debate for many years. Potential advantages of mandatory coverage include improving Social Security's finances, providing better benefit protections for workers, and having all workers share in Social Security's costs and poverty reduction. Potential disadvantages include the impact on state and local pension plans, imposing significant administrative burdens on state and local governments, and being viewed as unfair by states and localities that previously chose not to participate in Social Security. The underlying issues involve Social Security's long-term financial status, benefit protections, impacts on public pension plans, and broader social considerations.

The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA) program provides federal assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to foreign competition, including funding for training, reemployment services, income support, and a tax credit for health insurance premiums. TAA is jointly administered by the federal government and states, and is funded by mandatory appropriations. To receive TAA benefits, a group of workers must first petition the Department of Labor to certify that their job loss was due to foreign trade. Once a group is certified, individual workers can then apply for TAA benefits and services through their state. TAA was first enacted in 1962 and has been reauthorized and modified several times since, most recently by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA). TAARA reinstated many expansions to TAA eligibility and benefits that had been enacted in 2011 but then scaled back in 2014. Under TAARA, TAA eligibility and benefits are authorized through June 30, 2021, after which the program will revert to a more limited set of provisions for one year before authorization expires and the program begins to be phased out, unless it is reauthorized again.

Gross job loss, which occurs even during economic expansions, is a normal part of a dynamic market economy as labor shifts to its most efficient uses. Trade, outsourcing, and economic restructuring can cause gross job losses but do not typically lead to net job losses, as the losses are offset by gross job gains in other industries. Impeding gross job losses can reduce economic efficiency and lead to higher unemployment. However, government policies such as unemployment insurance can help protect workers from risks associated with job loss by addressing market failures in private insurance markets. Policymakers face the challenge of balancing policies that mitigate risks for workers with policies that maintain the dynamism and flexibility of labor markets.

Flow cytometry was used to measure EMP levels in the perfusate at regular intervals during 70 minutes of dialysis. The decline in EMP levels was rapid, with 50% clearance in the first 30 minutes and levels reduced to 29% of starting concentration by 40 minutes. Low dialysate EMP levels and plateauing circulation EMP levels beyond 40 minutes suggest saturable EMP sequestration within the CVVH filter or tubing.

This study describes the development of a post-coupling methodology to attach integrin-targeting RGD peptide ligands to pegylated nanoparticle surfaces in a controlled manner. Experiments with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) demonstrated that the RGD-functionalized nanoparticles enabled specific integrin receptor-mediated cellular uptake, which increased with higher mol% of targeting ligands, while control nanoparticles showed minimal uptake. The results suggest that by optimizing nanoparticle size, surface charge, and ligand density using this methodology, receptor-mediated cell entry of nanoparticles can be engineered to be the dominant uptake pathway over non-specific mechanisms.

The Millennium Cohort Study, the largest prospective study using primary data collection undertaken by the Department of Defense, began in 2001 to evaluate data on health, behavioral risk factors, and occupational characteristics related to military service that may be associated with adverse health outcomes. The study found that trouble sleeping, sleep apnea, and shorter sleep duration were associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes, independent of known diabetes risk factors and mental health conditions. Military service characteristics such as deployment, officer pay grade, and remaining in the military were associated with a lower risk of diabetes. Mental health conditions characterized by excessive stress, including PTSD and panic disorder, were independently associated with a higher risk of diabetes. The study had several strengths, including a large sample size, up to 6 years of follow-up, and reliable reporting of health and exposure data by participants. The findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be associated with diabetes risk through pathways different from those of mental health conditions, and confirmation of these results could lead to new opportunities for diabetes prevention.

The authors retrospectively reviewed the radiological and clinical findings of 13 children with pathologically confirmed mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver over a 15-year period. The tumors were classified into multiseptated cystic (31%), mixed solid and cystic (38%), and solid (31%) types based on CT appearance. Ultrasound and CT features of each type were described in detail. Histologically, the tumors contained varying amounts of myxoid/collagenous stroma, proliferating bile ducts, and hepatocytes, with significant differences in hepatocyte amount between the types. A mesenchymal hamartoma can show a wide spectrum of imaging features and rarely present as a solid tumor, which can mimic other hepatic neoplasms in children. Heterogeneous enhancement and lack of a capsule may help differentiate a solid mesenchymal hamartoma from other tumors.

Recent studies have suggested a potential link between diabetes, insulin therapy (particularly the long-acting insulin glargine), and increased cancer risk. However, the evidence is inconclusive and controversial, with some studies finding an association and others not confirming it. Criticisms have been raised about the statistical analyses and motivations behind some of the studies. All parties agree that the current evidence is insufficient to warrant changes in clinical practice regarding the use of glargine. The overall benefit-to-risk ratio likely supports continued use of insulin to achieve good glycemic control in diabetes. Further research is needed to better define the relationships between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues, and cancer risk, as well as explore the potentially protective effects of metformin. A key question is why diabetes is not more strongly associated with cancer despite being a disease of increased oxidative stress and accelerated biochemical aging.

Adamantinoma of the tibia is a rare, slow-growing primary bone tumor that can be difficult to diagnose. There are two main types: classical adamantinoma, which has a predominance of epithelial tumor cells and a higher risk of metastasis, and differentiated adamantinoma, which resembles osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia and has a lower metastatic potential. Distant metastases occur in 15-20% of cases, most commonly to the lungs, and regional lymph node metastases usually develop within the first two years. The primary treatment is surgical removal of the tumor. Long-term follow-up is important due to the slow-growing nature of the tumor.

6) Solar cells with ZnO NW coatings exhibited lower reflectance and higher external quantum efficiencies compared to uncoated reference cells.
7) The ZnO NWs grown for 45 min provided the lowest reflectivity and highest efficiency improvement of 3% relative to the reference cell.
8) The antireflection properties are attributed to light trapping from multiple scattering by the ZnO NWs and their graded refractive index profile.

The analysis showed that the individual molecular imaging approaches had only mild accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD (MIBG scintigraphy 62%, FP-CIT SPECT 69%). However, combining DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy improved the accuracy to 79.4% in distinguishing PD from non-PD, which was more useful than either method alone. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined approach were 86.7% and 73.7%, respectively. Some limitations of the study included the small sample size from a single center and lack of histopathological confirmation of diagnoses. The authors conclude that combining DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy, which are commercially available radiotracers, may improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD in clinical practice without requiring short-lived PET tracers.

The study was conducted in three phases: validating the reliability of the inhaler technique scores, validating the content of the scores, and testing the criterion and discriminant validity of the instruments. The most common errors were failure to maintain total lung capacity after deep inhalation, incorrect inhalation speed, and not exhaling before inhalation. The degree of correlation between scores by observer was 0.97 (p<0.0001). There was good interobserver agreement in classifying patients as able/unable to use DPIs (50%/50% and 52%/58%; p<0.01) and MDIs (49%/51% and 54%/46%; p<0.05).

Enterocin S37 is a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis S37 isolated from chicken feces that exhibits activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Enterocin S37 is likely a class IIa bacteriocin based on its properties of being anti-Listeria, having a molecular weight < 10 kDa, sensitivity to proteases, and stability at different pH and high temperatures. The activity of enterocin S37 was enhanced by K channel activators pinacidil and cromakalim and the K channel blocker glipizide, suggesting it acts by depleting intracellular K levels via KATP channels. A resistant variant of L. monocytogenes was slightly affected by enterocin S37 combined with the K channel modulators. The mode of action of enterocin S37 involves interaction with the cell membrane and is influenced by membrane lipid composition. Combinations of enterocin S37 with K channel modulators, especially pinacidil, strongly inhibited the growth of the resistant L. monocytogenes variant compared to enterocin S37 alone.

Fetal MRI is increasingly used as an adjunct to ultrasound for prenatal diagnosis of cerebral ventriculomegaly, which has a prevalence of 0.3-1.5% and is classified as mild (10-12 mm), moderate (12-15 mm), or severe (> 15 mm). MRI provides excellent contrast resolution to visualize the brain parenchyma, cortex, and posterior fossa without interference from the skull bones. It is particularly useful for detecting additional cerebral anomalies associated with ventriculomegaly, such as corpus callosum dysgenesis, cortical malformations, posterior fossa anomalies, hemorrhage, and congenital infections. The reported incidence of additional findings on MRI ranges from 5% for mild cases to 50% for moderate and severe cases. However, the added value of MRI is still debated due to varying reports of diagnostic accuracy, lack of postnatal/postmortem confirmation, and practical considerations such as cost and availability. Most studies advocate MRI for moderate and severe ventriculomegaly to further characterize anomalies, while it may also demonstrate subtle findings in mild cases that are difficult to detect by ultrasound.

This study compared the effects of different smear layer removal methods, including photodynamic diode laser treatment, on the bond strength of self-adhesive resin cement to root canal dentin. 55 extracted maxillary central incisors were divided into 5 groups and subjected to various post space treatments: saline, sodium hypochlorite, EDTA, orthophosphoric acid, and photodynamic diode laser. Push-out bond strength tests were performed and failure modes were examined. The photodynamic diode laser and orthophosphoric acid groups showed the highest bond strength values. SEM analysis revealed that the laser treatment modified the smear layer without completely removing it. The study suggests that modifying the smear layer may be more effective than complete removal when using self-adhesive resin cements. Lower laser irradiation power was used to avoid thermal damage to the dentin.

The human gut microbiota plays a crucial role in health and disease. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the identification and quantification of gut bacterial communities, revealing that each individual harbors a unique microbiome that is influenced by factors such as diet, genetics, and early microbial exposure. The gut microbiota has been implicated in obesity, with studies in mice showing that changes in bacterial composition can impact body weight and metabolism. Inflammatory bowel disease is another complex disorder associated with gut dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in microbial diversity and abundance of specific bacterial groups. The microbiota extends its influence beyond the gut, with evidence suggesting a role in liver function, glucose metabolism, and even behavior through the gut-brain axis. Future research must move beyond metagenomic analyses to understand the functional properties of the gut microbiome and its potential as a therapeutic target.

Peak milk yield was attained in the 3rd-4th fortnight in both groups, with mastitis cows having lower yields. Milk yield and persistency increased with parity, peaking in the 4th parity. The gamma-type function was used to model the lactation curves, with initial yield (a), ascending slope to peak (b), and descending slope (c) parameters estimated. Persistency of lactation was higher in 1st parity and declined in later parities. The model fit the data well, with R^2 ranging from 83.93% to 98.18%.

NDGA extended the median lifespan of male mice by 12% at a dose of 3.5g/kg diet (373 mg/kg body weight/day), but higher and lower doses were ineffective. NDGA treatment was associated with an increased incidence of liver, lung, and thymus tumors, as well as hemorrhagic diathesis, although it decreased the size of liver tumors. In Drosophila, NDGA at 3.0mg/ml medium increased median lifespan by 23% without affecting food consumption, body weight, or locomotor activity. Possible mechanisms for NDGA's longevity effects include inhibition of mTORC1 activity and IGF-1 receptor signaling. NDGA may act as a hormetic agent, producing molecular damage at low doses that stimulates increased maintenance and repair. While NDGA is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, evidence is lacking that these properties are responsible for its lifespan extension effects.

Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along actin filaments. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains by attaching a quantum dot to the motor and measuring its motion. The flexural stiffness of the MyoVa lever arm was estimated to be 0.0346 pN/nm, which decreased by 40% in the presence of calcium, likely due to calmodulin dissociation. The distal rod domain of MyoVa had a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm. Surprisingly, the flexural stiffness of double-headed MyoVa constructs was an order of magnitude lower than the lever arms and rod domain, suggesting the lever arm/rod junction is highly compliant. This compliance likely allows the free leading head to search for new actin binding sites. The rigid lever arms allow communication between the two heads for coordinated stepping, while the flexible lever arm/rod junction allows the motor to maneuver through the complex actin meshwork in cells.

This study examined the impact of PON1 Q192R and CYP2C19*2 polymorphisms on clopidogrel platelet inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease. CYP2C19*2 carriers had higher platelet aggregation and lower platelet inhibition compared to non-carriers. PON1 QQ192 genotype was not associated with increased platelet aggregation or decreased platelet inhibition during clopidogrel therapy. In patients receiving a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose, platelet aggregation before and after the dose was not significantly different between PON1 genotypes. In a multivariate analysis, CYP2C19*2 carrier status, but not PON1 Q192R, was associated with differences in ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The study confirms the impact of CYP2C19*2 on clopidogrel response, while PON1 Q192R polymorphisms do not appear to be predictive of response as measured by platelet aggregation assays. Limitations include small sample size and lack of pharmacokinetic analysis of active metabolite concentrations.

Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, for which cats are the primary host and humans may become infected as intermediate hosts. Congenital toxoplasmosis in a fetus may occur if a pregnant woman is infected, potentially causing a range of symptoms from mild chorioretinitis to severe central nervous system issues. This case report describes a 34-year-old female with congenital toxoplasmosis who developed medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Brain imaging showed left hippocampal sclerosis, left amygdala hypertrophy, and a calcified nodule in the left perihippocampal region. Video-EEG monitoring confirmed temporal lobe epilepsy, and SPECT and FDG-PET imaging further supported left temporal lobe epilepsy. Possible mechanisms for hippocampal sclerosis in this patient include seizures from the calcified nodule leading to hippocampal damage, or inflammatory reaction around the calcified nodule impacting the hippocampus. Temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is often medically intractable, so patients with congenital toxoplasmosis and perihippocampal calcifications should be carefully evaluated and surgical treatment considered if necessary. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis has been increasing in Korea, so prenatal and neonatal monitoring for congenital toxoplasmosis is important.

Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that can occur in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint, causing symptoms like hearing loss, dizziness, and trismus. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma are rare but can occur after radiation therapy. In this case, a 41-year-old male was initially misdiagnosed, leading to a delay in accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Re-examination with CT/MRI scans and histopathologic studies revealed features consistent with chondroblastoma. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor using a modified approach to prevent postoperative dysfunction. Reconstruction of the facial tissues was performed using muscle flaps. The patient showed no evidence of recurrence 4.5 years after surgery. This case highlights the importance of accurate early diagnosis and appropriate surgical treatment for chondroblastoma in the temporal bone.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, is a common disorder associated with various adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. The precise definition and clinical significance of SCH remain controversial, particularly regarding the correct upper limit of the reference range for serum TSH. Current evidence suggests that SCH is associated with increased risks of metabolic syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, and atherosclerosis, which may be improved or reversed by levothyroxine (T4) replacement therapy. However, the indications for screening and treatment of SCH are still debated, and an ongoing randomized controlled trial (TRUST study) aims to clarify the populations that may benefit from T4 replacement by assessing multiple clinical outcomes. Until the results of the TRUST study are published and current clinical recommendations are updated, the decision to treat SCH will be based on clinical judgment, guidelines, and expert opinion.

The DREAM trial was a large, randomized controlled trial that investigated whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The study found that rosiglitazone, but not ramipril, improved measures of β-cell function over time, including increasing the insulinogenic index (IGI) and reducing proinsulin (PI) concentration. These improvements were consistent across glucose tolerance subgroups, although effects were more modest in those with isolated IFG. Rosiglitazone's effect on diabetes prevention persisted after adjusting for baseline β-cell function, suggesting some but not all of its preventive effect is mediated through improved β-cell function. The exact mechanisms are unknown but may involve reducing β-cell stress by ameliorating lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity, and inflammation.

The authors studied metabolic interactions between pairs of 46 auxotrophic E. coli strains. 17% of dissimilar strain pairings showed synergistic growth greater than 50-fold in minimal media, indicating metabolic cooperation, which the authors term synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT). Cooperation was highest when total co-culture growth was low to moderate. Clustering analysis of the auxotrophs' cooperative phenotypes identified distinct biosynthetic modules in E. coli metabolism. A genome-scale flux balance model of interacting strain pairs reproduced the experimental results, with cooperation efficiency determined by the cost to the donor strain and benefit to the recipient strain of exchanging key metabolites. The most readily exchanged metabolites were those of low value to the secreting strain but high value to the receiving strain.

Brook-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) is a rare genetic skin disorder characterized by the development of multiple skin tumors called spiradenomas, cylindromas, and trichoepitheliomas on the head and face. It is caused by mutations in the CYLD gene on chromosome 16q12q13, which acts as a tumor suppressor. The authors present a case of BSS in a 71-year-old woman and two of her daughters, who had multiple skin-colored to pink papules and nodules on the scalp and forehead. Genetic testing revealed a rare heterozygous mutation, c.1628_1629delCT, in the CYLD gene in the affected individuals. The family pedigree suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The variable clinical presentation in this family, with late onset and relatively few tumors, may be related to the specific germline mutation and the presence of a somatic mutation.

This study developed a prototype device to measure the force required to debond orthodontic brackets in vivo, using a strain gauge connected to modified pliers. The prototype was tested for accuracy and precision, and the bracket debonding force measured with the prototype was compared to the force measured using a tensile test with a universal testing machine. The prototype provided similar bond strength values to the tensile test, suggesting it may be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo. Most of the adhesive remained on the enamel surface after bracket removal with the prototype, indicating a safe debonding method that preserves the enamel. Further research is needed to determine the minimum bond strength required for clinical orthodontic applications.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple seizure types, slow spike-wave discharges on EEG, and cognitive impairment. LGS is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis. Valproic acid is considered a first-line treatment, followed by lamotrigine, topiramate, clobazam, felbamate, and other medications. Rufinamide is a novel anticonvulsant that was recently approved for adjunctive treatment of LGS in children 4 years and older. Rufinamide acts by prolonging sodium channel inactivation and has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effects in animal models. In a randomized controlled trial, rufinamide significantly reduced total seizures and tonic-atonic seizures compared to placebo when added to other antiepileptic drugs in LGS patients. Rufinamide was well tolerated, with sedation and vomiting being the most common side effects. Long-term open-label studies support the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide for LGS. While promising, further studies are needed to establish rufinamide's place in the treatment of LGS compared to other medications.

This study developed Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate survival for patients diagnosed with localized and extended pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using data from the SEER database from 2004-2009. The models accounted for demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and treatment variables, and showed that treatments like surgery and radiation were most beneficial for survival while metastasis, poor tumor differentiation, and large tumor size were the largest risk factors. The models were validated and shown to have good accuracy, reproducibility, and generalizability. Based on the models, a web-based prognostic tool was developed to estimate personalized survival and conditional survival probabilities and their standard errors for PDAC patients. The tool allows clinicians to assess the predicted impact of different treatment options on a patient's survival. While the models have some limitations, such as lack of data on comorbidities and chemotherapy, they provide distinct advantages over existing models for predicting PDAC survival. The tool removes bias and can assist clinicians and patients in making more informed treatment decisions.

The study recruited Japanese patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) between 2003 and 2009. Baseline characteristics, including diabetes status and glycemic control, were analyzed for their association with limb loss and mortality outcomes. In the whole population, the presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation, while mortality was associated with age, impaired activities of daily living, hemodialysis, and low serum albumin. In diabetic patients, poor glycemic control (A1C ≥ 6.8%) was independently associated with increased risk of major amputation compared to nondiabetic patients. The combination of diabetes with A1C ≥ 6.8%, infection, and hemodialysis led to a very high risk of limb loss after PTA. Preoperative peripheral arterial factors were not significantly associated with limb loss in multivariate models, suggesting limb outcomes may depend more on post-revascularization blood flow. Diabetes and glycemic control were not significantly associated with mortality in CLI patients undergoing PTA. The findings suggest prognostic indicators differ between limb salvage and survival outcomes in CLI patients receiving PTA.

Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate cellular signaling pathways through oxidation of protein cysteine residues. Increasing evidence suggests mitochondria and ROS play key roles in stem cell differentiation, with higher mitochondrial content and ROS levels correlating with differentiation. In the mammalian epidermis, deletion of the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM impaired keratinocyte differentiation, while ROS promoted differentiation through activation of Notch and β-catenin signaling pathways. Mitochondrial metabolism may also promote differentiation by providing acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation and α-ketoglutarate for histone demethylation.

The thyroid system plays a critical role in amphibian metamorphosis, which is regulated by thyroid hormones (THs) and can be disrupted by various chemical compounds. The thyroid hormone balance is influenced by several processes including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation, and there are many potential targets of environmental contaminants that could disrupt TH metabolism. Amphibian metamorphosis is divided into premetamorphosis, prometamorphosis, and climax stages, and the sensitivity to THs varies according to the developmental stage. Several thyroid disrupting substances have been tested for toxicity using amphibians, with some showing clear effects on metamorphosis while others have no impact. The amphibian hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis controls TH levels similarly to mammals, and the OECD and EPA have established guidelines for the amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA) to screen for thyroid-active chemicals. The primary endpoints in the AMA are mortality, developmental stage, hind limb length, snout-vent length, wet body weight, and thyroid gland histology. Histopathological changes in the thyroid gland are considered the most valuable indicator of thyroid toxicants, although developmental delay alone is not diagnostic of antithyroidal activity. The guidelines emphasize the importance of experienced toxicologic pathologists familiar with normal X. laevis thyroid histology and physiology to accurately interpret the AMA results.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs proposes that human needs can be portrayed in a pyramid, with physiological needs at the bottom, followed by safety needs, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization. Safety needs, such as personal and financial security, can be more fundamental than physiological needs and can block them, as demonstrated by animal experiments showing avoidance is a stronger motivator than reward. The amygdala and locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system form the neural basis of the ""safety circuitry"" that underlies fear and anger responses to unexpected, threatening stimuli. Appraisal theory states that emotions result from people's interpretations of their circumstances, with a fast primary appraisal process that detects threats and a slower secondary appraisal process related to coping. Mental disorders such as anxiety, phobias and depression may arise from an inability to progress through the normal ""emotion flow"" of fear, anger, happiness, sadness and calm in response to unexpected stressful events. This emotion flow is part of everyday life and is driven by the fundamental need for safety.

Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of the hierarchical folding of the genome into structures such as topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are units of chromosomes with higher frequency interactions between genes and regulatory regions, and their boundaries are enriched for CTCF, cohesin, and certain histone marks. A recent study found that the chromatin remodeling enzyme BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength, and BRG1 knockdown resulted in reduced nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions and weaker TAD boundaries. The authors propose that BRG1 regulates nucleosome positioning and occupancy at TAD boundaries, possibly through its interaction with CTCF and topoisomerases. Studies in prokaryotes and yeast also suggest a link between chromatin remodeling enzymes, architectural proteins, and topoisomerases in genome organization. The authors hypothesize that BRG1 loss disrupts recruitment of CTCF and topoisomerases to TAD boundaries, affecting chromatin structure and boundary strength. TAD boundary integrity likely depends on the overall composition and activity of factors present rather than the exact boundary sequence. Continued research into the complexes located at TAD boundaries will provide important insights into chromatin folding and genome organization.

Thiocyanate probes were incorporated at specific sites in E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) to investigate changes in the active site electrostatic environment during the catalytic cycle using vibrational and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations reproduced the experimentally observed vibrational frequency shifts and provided insights into the factors contributing to the electrostatic changes, including classical electrostatic effects, hydrogen bonding, and polarization. The electric field along the hydride donor-acceptor axis was calculated, showing that the cofactor, substrate, and enzyme impose a substantial field favoring hydride transfer. Conformational changes in the enzyme active site during the catalytic cycle alter the electrostatic environment, contributing to the catalytic mechanism. The integrated experimental and theoretical approach provides a detailed view of the heterogeneous and dynamic electrostatic landscape in the ecDHFR active site.

Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new imaging method that uses magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). Resovist, an approved MRI contrast agent, is currently the best commercially available SPIO for MPI. This study evaluated the blood half-life of the MPI signal from Resovist using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) in rabbits. The MPI signal from Resovist declined rapidly, reaching noise level within 30 minutes, which differed from the slower elimination seen on MRI. There was a significant difference in MPI signal decay between Resovist from two different manufacturers. The rapid MPI signal decay is likely due to only a small fraction of larger SPIO clusters in Resovist contributing substantially to the MPI signal. Resovist is not ideal for applications requiring long circulating MPI tracers, so dedicated SPIO tracers with optimized iron core size and coatings are needed. Standardized testing of MPI tracers will be important for future development.

The authors studied the early in vivo response of liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) to infection with Leishmania donovani in mice. They isolated Kupffer cells from infected mice and analyzed their gene expression profiles, comparing infected cells to uninfected ""inflamed"" cells exposed to the inflammatory environment. This approach identified gene networks regulated differently in infected vs. inflamed cells, including a network centered on the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa) that was associated with parasite survival. Pharmacological manipulation of RXR activity using agonists or antagonists perturbed this gene network in infected Kupffer cells and reduced liver parasite burden in vivo. The study demonstrates that analyzing uninfected ""inflamed"" cells can reveal pathogen-regulated host pathways that are important for infection but may be obscured in direct comparisons of infected to uninfected cells. Targeting such pathways, like the RXR network, may provide new therapeutic approaches against intracellular pathogens like Leishmania.

This study measured the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) emitted during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel under various conditions. The effective irradiance of the UVR, which quantifies its hazard level, was found to increase with higher welding currents and was higher when using 80% Ar + 20% CO2 shielding gas compared to 100% CO2 at high currents. Pulsed welding currents produced significantly higher irradiance than non-pulsed currents. The UVR hazard appears to be greatest during spray transfer mode compared to short-circuit or globular transfer modes. The measured irradiances correspond to allowable exposure times of only 0.23-5.9 seconds at a distance of 500 mm from the arc, indicating that GMAW of mild steel can produce very hazardous levels of UVR.

Bacteria isolated from shallow freshwater reservoirs in the foreland of Ecology Glacier in Antarctica were analyzed for their potential to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Out of 50 bacterial isolates, 20 unique strains were identified, mainly belonging to Proteobacteria. PCR amplification revealed 12 isolates possessed PHA synthase genes, with Pseudomonas and Janthinobacterium being the most common genera. Some Janthinobacterium isolates surprisingly had PHA synthase genes more closely related to other genera, suggesting acquisition by horizontal gene transfer. Canonical correspondence analysis showed bacteria with PHA synthase genes were correlated with low total phosphorus and high pheophytin levels in the reservoirs. The results suggest PHA synthesis may improve bacterial fitness and survival in the extreme conditions of glacier forefields, and these bacteria could be considered as potential PHA producers.

Researchers developed a bioinformatic approach to design short-activating RNAs (saRNAs) that target and activate expression of the stem cell reprogramming factors KLF4 and c-Myc in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Transfection of MSCs with saRNAs targeting the KLF4 and c-Myc promoter regions resulted in significant time- and dose-dependent increases in KLF4 and c-Myc mRNA and protein levels through transcriptional activation, without triggering an interferon response. Activation of KLF4 by saRNA also led to upregulation of other reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Microarray analysis revealed that saRNA-mediated activation of KLF4 and c-Myc induced gene expression profiles similar to lentiviral overexpression of these factors, particularly for stem cell- and cell cycle-related genes. However, lentiviral transduction, but not saRNA transfection, resulted in upregulation of TGF-β signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways that may hinder reprogramming.

Chronic kidney diseases lead to end-stage kidney failure and are associated with changes in kidney structure and fibrosis. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in rats is an experimental model that imitates obstructive nephropathy and leads to tubular atrophy, cell death, inflammation, and fibrosis. Taurine and paclitaxel (taxol) were investigated for their ability to attenuate tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preserve renal histology in a rat UUO model. Stereological methods were used to quantify the volumes of kidney structures in sham-operated, UUO, UUO+taxol, and UUO+taurine groups. UUO caused significant renal damage, while treatment with taxol or taurine helped preserve kidney structures and reduce necrosis and fibrosis, with taxol showing greater protective effects. The protective mechanisms of taxol and taurine may involve antioxidant effects, modulation of TGF-β signaling and microRNAs, and reduction of inflammation and cell death. In conclusion, both taxol and taurine show promise in preventing structural kidney damage in this rat model of obstructive nephropathy.

The study had some limitations, including small sample size, potential confounding by cognitive function, and possible fluctuation of biomarker levels. Strengths included intensive monitoring for delirium and investigation of multiple pathophysiological pathways. The results require confirmation in a larger study, and differences in delirium pathophysiology between patients with and without cognitive disorders should be further explored.

Optic neuritis (ON) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) is an acute optic neuropathy that occurs more often in young women, with symptoms including decreased visual acuity, pain with eye movement, decreased contrast sensitivity, and visual field changes. This retrospective study aimed to determine the onset of ON as the first clinical presentation of MS and analyze the significance of morphometric changes in the optic nerve using OCT and perimetry. The study found that ON was the first clinical manifestation of MS in a statistically significant number of patients compared to other symptoms. Centrocecal scotoma was the most frequent visual field disturbance, and OCT showed thinning of the nerve fibers in the neuroretinal rim after three months. Visual acuity improved significantly in all ON patients one month after pulse corticosteroid therapy. The disease appeared most often in female patients aged 18-30 years. Studies confirm that ON patients treated with intravenous corticosteroids have a delayed development of MS compared to oral corticosteroids. OCT can discover in vivo atrophy of nerve fibers in MS patients, with more significant atrophy in those with ON.

The BHH was able to identify 54 individuals who did not have their HbA1c levels checked according to guidelines, and found that 27% of the sample had diabetes, with another 4 patients in the diabetic range without a prior diagnosis. Results were mixed in terms of health improvements, with some patients' HbA1c levels improving while others worsened. The BHH model may be useful for understanding the characteristics of the SMI population, recognizing common medical disorders through monitoring, and promoting preventative care.

Osteoporosis is a condition of impaired bone strength that leads to increased fracture risk, and it occurs more frequently in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) than healthy controls. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in MS include progressive immobilization, long-term glucocorticoid treatment, vitamin D deficiency, and skeletal muscle atrophy. Clinical evaluation of osteoporosis risk factors should be performed in MS patients, including assessment of disability level, glucocorticoid use, and vitamin D status. Bone mineral density (BMD) testing and vertebral fracture assessment are recommended in high-risk patients. Management of osteoporosis in MS involves non-pharmacological interventions like weight-bearing exercise and vitamin D supplementation, as well as pharmacological treatments such as bisphosphonates and teriparatide. Further research is needed to establish specific diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for osteoporosis in MS patients.

This cadaveric study compared the specific relationship between midurethral slings (MUS) and the urethra in the inside-out and outside-in transobturator approaches for treating female stress urinary incontinence. CT-scan image analysis was performed after tantalum wire marked mesh slings were implanted in 10 cadavers. The inside-out MUS angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion (mean angle 122°) than the outside-in approach, which followed a more horizontal trajectory (mean angle 144°). Both MUS approaches formed U-shaped bands that were positioned dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior, suggesting a passive role in achieving continence. The inside-out trajectory showed higher variability than the outside-in trajectory. The outside-in tape stayed closer to the ischiopubic ramus while the inside-out tape was seated in more muscular tissue, possibly explaining some differences in clinical outcomes. Surgeons must pay attention to the 2nd half of the helical pass for each approach. Three-dimensional ultrasonography and MRI-visible mesh may provide future insights into the in vivo action and tissue interaction of MUS.

1. Professor C announces that Hans-Guenter will be visiting for 3 weeks to collaborate and provide input on their research.
2. Grad E reports on experiments using mean log magnitude spectral subtraction for the SmartKom system, finding that using past frames to calculate the mean only slightly reduces performance compared to a centered window.
3. PhD B presents results on using Wiener filtering for noise compensation, achieving a 56% improvement on the SpeechDat-Car data, close to the performance of the France Telecom system.
4. PhD B also experimented with using the clean channel 0 data to estimate the noise, which improved performance to 67%, showing the potential gains from a better VAD.
5. PhD D has been working on spectral subtraction, using an overestimation factor that depends on the SNR to subtract more noise when the SNR is low.
6. Applying spectral subtraction on the FFT bins or mel bands alone did not yield improvements, so PhD D applied a nonlinear smoothing technique to the spectral subtraction gain values over time.
7. The nonlinear smoothing performs more smoothing when the gain is low to reduce musical noise artifacts, and less smoothing when the gain is high.
8. PhD D's smoothed spectral subtraction method outperformed PhD B's Wiener filtering on the Italian data but was slightly worse on Finnish.
9. The group discusses how the France Telecom system uses a variant of Wiener filtering with both time and frequency domain smoothing, and they hope incorporating their neural net VAD will provide further gains over the noise compensation techniques alone.

The professor reported that at a recent meeting in Amsterdam, it became clear that the Aurora project participants are competitors rather than friends, with disagreements over issues like voice activity detectors. There was debate over whether the improvement criterion should be lowered from 50% to 25% for mismatched conditions, with some participants like Nokia objecting to lowering the bar. The professor's group at OGI is working on improving noise robustness, such as by using temporal patterns (TRAPs) for recognition, though this likely won't be ready for the next evaluation. Stephane observed that the C1 cepstral coefficient is not very important for recognition performance. This led to a discussion of how the importance of different cepstral coefficients could be systematically tested by modifying the variances of the Gaussian mixture models, without needing to retrain the models. The professor suggested this could be an interesting experiment for a graduate student to run many recognition tests on.
