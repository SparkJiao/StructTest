Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as $x$.

### 2
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has $x + 6$ candies.

### 3
John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has $2x$ candies.

### 4
Given that John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation $2x = 54$.

### 5
Solving for $x$ in the equation $2x = 54$, we find that $x = 27$.

### 6
Substitute $x = 27$ into the expressions for James and John's candies:
- James has $27 + 6 = 33$ candies.
- John has $2(27) = 54$ candies.

To find how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

- Since Cera is currently 46 years old, her age six years ago would have been 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

**Step 3** *Calculate the population of Chile six years ago*
- The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which would be 3000 * (N - 6).

**Step 4** *Determine the population of Chile now*
- The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
- Therefore, the current population of Chile is 2 times the population six years ago, which is 2 * 3000 * (N - 6).

**Step 5** *Determine the relationship between Noah's age and Cera's age*
- Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, which means N - 6 = 0.5 * (46 - 6).

**Step 6** *Solve for Noah's current age*
- From Step 5, we have N - 6 = 0.5 * 40.

1. Let's denote the number of students in each of the equal groups as x.
2. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.
3. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can write the equation: 2x + (x - 10) = 200.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x - 10 = 200.
5. Adding 10 to both sides, we get 3x = 210.
6. Dividing by 3, we find that x = 70.

Let's first calculate the total time John spent on vacation activities.

### 2
John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which means he spent 6 hours boating and 3 hours swimming.

### 3
He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so he spent a total of 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours watching shows.

### 4
The time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows was 30% of the total time he spent on vacation activities.

### 5
Let's calculate the total time spent on these activities by adding the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since this time is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 15 hours = 0.30 * Total time.

The total number of people kicked out is x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50.

### 5
Combining like terms, we get 13x - 20 = 50.

### 6
Adding 20 to both sides, we get 13x = 70.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathered 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, so she gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

We can solve the system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 2:

Substitute the value of **C** back into the first equation to find **D**:

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as **C**.

### 2
According to the given conditions, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be represented as:  
$\frac{C}{2} + 2 = 5$

### 3
Solving the equation from step 2 for **C**:  
$\frac{C}{2} = 5 - 2$  
$\frac{C}{2} = 3$  
$C = 3 \times 2$  
$C = 6$

- The shark is 10 feet long.
- Each remora is 6 inches long.

**Step 2** Convert the length of the remoras to feet:
- 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

Let's denote the number of cards the boy has as $x$.

### 2
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has $x - 3$ cards.

### 3
Together, they have $x + (x - 3)$ cards.

### 4
Substitute $x$ back in to get the total number of cards they have together: $x + (x - 3) = 2x - 3$.

### 5
Since the boy has 5 cards, we can substitute $x = 5$ into the equation: $2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$.

### 6
Therefore, the boy has 5 cards and his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as $x$ inches.

### 2
According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equivalent to $8 \times 12 + 4 = 100$ inches.

### 3
We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be represented as $100 = 9x + 10$.

### 4
Now, we can solve the equation $100 = 9x + 10$ to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

### 5
Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: $100 - 10 = 9x$.

### 6
This simplifies to $90 = 9x$.

### 7
Divide both sides by 9 to solve for $x$: $x = \frac{90}{9} = 10$.

First, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. 
She has 3 stuffed puppies + 5 stuffed koalas + 2 stuffed zebras + 4 stuffed frogs = 14 stuffed animals.

### 2
Next, we need to calculate what 30% of her total stuffed animals is. 
30% of 14 = 0.30 * 14 = 4.2

### 3
Since Bubbles cannot have a fraction of a stuffed animal, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
Therefore, she needs to have at least 5 stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.

### 4
Now, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she already has. 
Since she currently has 0 stuffed goats, we need to subtract this from the 5 stuffed goats she needs to have.

### 5
5 stuffed goats - 0 stuffed goats = 5 stuffed goats

### 6
Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats in order to have enough stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals.

### 7
Let's double check our answer by calculating the percentage of stuffed goats after she buys 5. 
Total number of stuffed animals after buying 5 goats = 14 (current) + 5 (new goats) = 19
Percentage of goats = (5 / 19) * 100% ≈ 26.32%

### 8
Since 26.32% is less than 30%, Bubbles will need to buy more goats to reach the desired 30%.

Let's represent the number of cards that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have as variables: B, S, and P respectively.

### 2
We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: B + S + P = 341.

### 3
We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so we can write the equation: B = S + 12.

### 4
Additionally, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can write the equation: S = 3P.

### 5
Now we can substitute the equations from steps 3 and 4 into the equation from step 2 to solve for the number of cards Becca has.

### 6
Substitute S + 12 for B in the equation B + S + P = 341: (S + 12) + S + 3P = 341.

### 7
Substitute 3P for S in the equation S = 3P: 3P + 12 + 3P + P = 341.

Combine like terms: 7P + 12 = 341.

### 9
Solve for P: 7P = 329, P = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out that Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Let's denote the total number of letters Craig has spelled as C and the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled as B.

### 2

After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters Craig has spelled is 20 * 15 = 300.

### 3

Let's represent the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled as B. We are given that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so B = C + 50.

### 4

Substitute the value of C from step 2 into the equation from step 3 to get B = 300 + 50 = 350.

### 5

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the total number of letters Craig has spelled and the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled, which is C + B = 300 + 350 = 650.

- Given that the total population of porcupines in the park is 50.
- The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
- Therefore, the number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30.

**Step 2** *Calculate the number of babies born by each female porcupine in a month*
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.

**Step 3** *Calculate the total number of babies born in a month*
- Total number of babies born in a month = Number of female porcupines * Number of babies born by each female porcupine
- Total number of babies born in a month = 30 * 4 = 120.

**Step 4** *Calculate the total population after a month*
- Total population after a month = Total population + Total number of babies born in a month
- Total population after a month = 50 + 120 = 170.

**Step 5** *Calculate the total number of babies born in a year*
- Total number of babies born in a year = Total number of babies born in a month * 12 (months in a year)
- Total number of babies born in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440.

**Step 6** *Calculate the total population after a year*
- Total population after a year = Total population + Total number of babies born in a year

1. Half of the students at Brook Hills High School are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16 years old.
   
2. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

3. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which means there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.

4. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

5. To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students for each age group.

6. For students over 16 years old, there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students.

7. For students under 16 years old, there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students.

8. Adding the number of female students in each age group, we get a total of 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students at Brook Hills High School.

- This means that the power bank lost 9% * 5 = 45% of its total capacity during this time.

**Step 2** After the initial 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
- This means that the power bank lost 7% * 3 = 21% of its total capacity during this time.

**Step 3** In total, the power bank lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its total capacity.
- This means that the power bank had 100% - 66% = 34% of its total capacity remaining.

**Step 4** The remaining charge was 28%.
- This means that the power bank had 34% - 28% = 6% of its total capacity lost after Maria went out to the park.

**Step 5** The 6% lost corresponds to the 5 hours charging her friends' phones.
- This means that 6% corresponds to 5 hours.

**Step 6** To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to calculate how much 1 hour corresponds to in terms of percentage.

- Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000.
- 40% of $100,000 is $40,000.

**Step 2** Calculate how much Lauren plans to save annually during retirement:
- Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck.
- 20% of $100,000 is $20,000.

**Step 3** Calculate Lauren's total annual retirement income:
- Lauren's total annual retirement income will be the sum of what she plans to live on and what she plans to save.
- $40,000 (living expenses) + $20,000 (savings) = $60,000.

**Step 4** Calculate how much Lauren needs to save for 20 years of retirement:
- Lauren plans to save $20,000 annually for 20 years.
- $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

**Step 5** Calculate how much Lauren will need for 20 years of retirement:
- Lauren plans to live on $40,000 annually for 20 years.
- $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

**Step 7** Calculate how much Lauren will have saved by the time she retires:
- Lauren is saving $20,000 annually.
- If she plans to retire in 20 years, she will have saved $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

**Step 8** Calculate how much Lauren will have in total for retirement:
- Lauren will have the sum of what she saved and what she plans to live on during retirement.
- $400,000 (savings) + $800,000 (living expenses) = $1,200,000.

**Step 9** Calculate how many more years Lauren needs to work:
- Lauren needs to work until she has saved enough for retirement.
- She currently has $400,000 saved and needs $1,200,000 in total.
- $1,200,000 - $400,000 = $800,000.
- Lauren saves $20,000 annually.

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is $2x$ miles per minute.

### 3
If Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, the distance she covers on the beach is $40x$ miles.

- Abraham sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 20 square meters, for $30.

### 4
Calculate the remaining land Abraham has:
- Abraham has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left.

### 5
Calculate the amount earned from selling the remaining land:
- Abraham sold the remaining 20 square meters of land for $3 per square meter.

### 6
Calculate the total amount earned:
- Total amount earned = $50 + $30 + (20 * $3)

### 7
Substitute the values to find the total amount earned:
- Total amount earned = $50 + $30 + ($60) = $140

### 8
Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, purple, and yellow paint used in the mural as $r$, $w$, $p$, and $y$ respectively.

### 2
Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say $r = w = p$.

### 3
We are also given that half the mural is yellow, so $y = \frac{1}{2}(r + w + p)$.

### 4
Given that the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, we have the equation $r + w + p + y = 12$.

### 5
Substitute $r = w = p$ into the equation $r + w + p + y = 12$ to get $3r + y = 12$.

### 6
Substitute $y = \frac{1}{2}(r + w + p)$ into the equation $3r + y = 12$ to get $3r + \frac{1}{2}(r + r + r) = 12$.

### 7
Simplify the equation to get $3r + \frac{3}{2}r = 12$.

### 8
Combine like terms to get $\frac{9}{2}r = 12$.

- The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
- 45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

**Step 2** Calculate the remaining length of chalk after Monday:
- The initial length of the chalk was 5 inches.
- The teacher used 2.25 inches on Monday.
- Therefore, the remaining length of chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

**Step 3** Determine if the remaining chalk length is less than 2 inches:
- The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
- The remaining length of chalk is 2.75 inches, which is not less than 2 inches.

**Step 4** Calculate the length of chalk used on a regular day:
- The teacher uses 20% of the chalk on a regular day.
- 20% of 5 inches is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

**Step 5** Calculate the length of chalk that will be used each day:
- The teacher used 2.25 inches on Monday, leaving 2.75 inches.
- The teacher will use 1 inch each day.
- Therefore, the teacher will have to use 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches before recycling.

**Step 6** Calculate the number of days before the teacher has to recycle the chalk:
- The teacher has 0.75 inches left before recycling.
- The teacher uses 1 inch per day.

- The current dock length is 200 feet.
- The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- Total line needed for the current dock length = 200 feet * 3 feet = 600 feet.

**Step 2** Calculate the total amount of line the caretaker already has:
- The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.

**Step 3** Calculate the remaining amount of line needed to meet the total requirement:
- Remaining line needed = Total line needed - Line already owned
- Remaining line needed = 600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet.

Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

## 2. Calculate James' current age
Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

## 3. Calculate John's current age
John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

## 4. Calculate the age difference between John and his youngest son
John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the age difference is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

## 5. Calculate John's youngest son's current age
Since John's youngest son is 5 years younger than John, he is currently 37 - 5 = 32 years old.

2. **Each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs.**
3. **The total number of legs can be represented by the equation: 2x + 4y = 70.**
4. **We also know that the total number of animals is 20: x + y = 20.**
5. **Solving the system of equations 2x + 4y = 70 and x + y = 20 will give us the values of x and y.**
6. **Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get 2x + 2y = 40.**
7. **Subtracting this equation from the first equation, we get 2y = 30, which means y = 15.**
