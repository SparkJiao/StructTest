In 1994, a concrete scheme was proposed for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field. The system relies on exchange interaction between neighboring spins and the tendency for anti-ferromagnetic ordering to be stronger than the tendency for all spins to align along the magnetic field. However, the system has a metastable state issue, which was recognized in 1996, that prevents the unidirectional flow of logic signals from the input to the output of the logic device, a required attribute of any logic device. Desperate measures to enforce unidirectionality, such as using the input device to do so, were studied but found to be inefficient. In 1996, a more elegant solution was proposed, inspired by charge-coupled device arrays, which uses clocking to impose unidirectionality in time. This solution requires a three-phase clock and allows the input state to be propagated through a linear array.

The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors exhibits a lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have not been able to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off. Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation reach a minimum period at around 5 minutes. The probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region, leading to an accumulation of systems (a spike) at the minimum period. The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which in turn is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer and thermal relaxation. The minimum period occurs where the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time are about equal. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses. In this paper, the authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and investigate ways to \"hide\" the spike by introducing a spread of period minimum values in the CV population.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 6}}

ESD and ESB have been observed in qubits and reservoirs, but not all qubit entanglement undergoes ESD. Instead, revived entanglement plays a role in quantum information protocols. The lost entanglement of qubits is transferred exclusively to reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD is always accompanied by ESB of reservoirs. Similar results have been found for spin entanglement. The entanglement dynamics and distribution in bipartite partitions are determined by the time-dependent factor of single-qubit excited-state population. Population trapping, responsible for the suppression of spontaneous emission in PBG reservoirs, manifests the formation of bound states between qubits and reservoirs, which affects the entanglement distribution.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

However, the inefficient sticking of H atoms in monomers is an obstacle to enter the catalytic regime for H2 formation. The hydrogenation of pah edges is an important route to form H2 in the ISM. Neutral pahs, when highly hydrogenated, are efficient catalysts for H2 formation. Pah cations, which are usually present at lower extinction aids, also represent an important route to form H2. The first hydrogenation of coronene cations is associated with a barrier, but subsequent hydrogenation barriers vanish. Our experiments show that odd hydrogenation states of coronene cations predominantly populate the mass spectrum, and the further hydrogenation of pah cations is associated with a barrier if the number of already attached hydrogen atoms is odd and no barrier if this number is even.

{"idx": 60, "result": 0, "generated": " <summary>\nA recent paper by Li et al. introduced a new optomechanical system design consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide. This system has attractive features, including universality and the ability to study reactive effects in optomechanical coupling. The reactive coupling originates from the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator and further phase-dependent gradient forces. The authors argue that this design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, but they also explore other possibilities to investigate effects arising from strong reactive coupling without relying on cooling. They focus on the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields and report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting. In contrast to previous works on normal mode splitting in optomechanical devices, which used only dispersive coupling, this paper reports on normal mode splitting due to reactive effects. The system is modeled using a Hamiltonian that includes the energy of the cavity field, waveguide, interactions between the waveguide and incident fields, and coupling of the cavity field to the pump field and stokes field. The authors find that there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling, but normal mode splitting occurs in output fields in the presence of reactive coupling. They also observe that the output fields depend on the behavior of the roots of the denominator of the system response, leading to normal mode splitting in the output stokes field and the generation of an anti-stokes field due to reactive coupling.\n</summary>\n\n[Note: The summary is limited to 8 sentences, so some details had to be omitted.

The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is the most widely accepted theory, describing two separate continuous transitions as the solid transforms into a liquid. The theory is compatible with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids exact long-range positional order in 2D for a wide range of pair potentials at finite temperatures. However, it assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which contradicts observations of alignment and accumulation of dislocations into small angle domain walls. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of 2D Lennard-Jones systems have revealed the metastable nature of the hexatic phase, supporting PFC simulations operating on the diffusive time scale. The observation of the hexatic phase is strongly linked with the thermodynamic equilibration of the systems, and the necessary equilibration time depends on the measured quantity of interest. Local properties can equilibrate rapidly, while long-range relaxations usually take significantly longer. Monitoring the velocity distribution function alone to verify the equilibration of the system is insufficient.

The magnetic moment of a charged particle with spin is given by the Dirac equation, and anomalous magnetic moments arise from radiative corrections. The situation for baryons is different due to their internal quark structure. The magnetic and electric dipole moments can be represented as the real and imaginary parts of a generalized dipole operator, and the interaction Lagrangian becomes a function of the magnetic and electric fields and dipole moments. The electron anomaly is now measured with a relative precision of about four parts in a billion, which is better than the precision on the fine-structure constant. The muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million and is sensitive to physics at the 100 GeV scale. The hadronic contribution to the anomaly cannot be calculated directly from QCD due to the low energy scale, but dispersion theory provides a relationship between the vacuum polarization loop and the cross section for a process involving the magnetic field and dipole moments. The hadronic light-by-light contribution, which can only be calculated from a model, is likely to provide the ultimate limit to the precision of the standard-model value of the muon anomaly. Susy contributions to the anomaly could be at a measurable level in a broad range of models, and there is a complementarity between the susy contributions to the magnetic and electric dipole moments and the transition moment for the lepton-flavor violating process. The muon magnetic moment has a substantial standard-model value, but the predicted edms for the leptons are unmeasurably small and lie orders of magnitude below the present experimental limits.

The interpretation of the low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, which are well-measured in the CMB. The sound horizon, which depends on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma, can be used to measure the wavelength of baryonic features in the mass power spectrum. Measuring this scale at lower redshifts, such as in large galaxy surveys, can constrain cosmology by measuring the distance ratios between low and high redshifts. The acoustic oscillation standard ruler method depends only on the redshift of equality, but other cosmological measurements can be used to measure the actual densities and thereby constrain the presence of unknown relativistic species. The standard ruler defined by the acoustic oscillations prior to recombination can deal with uncertainties in the matter density provided that the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well-measured, and the CMB has good leverage on this quantity.

However, they ignored thermal conduction and the effects of transition layers between different stable phases, arguing that such layers are of little importance due to their negligible Thomson depths. However, without taking into account the role of thermal conduction, their method of connecting two different stable layers is considered ad hoc. Additionally, even though the Thomson depths of these transition layers are small, it does not guarantee that the x-ray emission and reflection from such layers are negligible, as some of the most important lines can have appreciable emissivity only in these layers, and resonance line scattering has much larger cross sections than Thomson scattering.

LHMs can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, or yield slow light propagation. In disordered systems, the presence of negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) disordered LHMs strongly suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length @xmath0 at long wavelengths. A recent study reported a sixth power dependence of @xmath0 with wavelength under refractive index disorder instead of the quadratic asymptotic behavior. Another study found a suppression of Anderson localization of light in 1D disordered LHMs combining oblique incidence and dispersion. A fourth order perturbation theory was developed to resolve the problem of non-conventional Anderson localization in bilayered periodic-on-average structures. The effects of polarization and oblique incidence on light propagation in disordered LHMs were also studied. In this article, the authors calculate numerically the localization length of light for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with alternating indices of refraction @xmath1 and @xmath3 and thicknesses @xmath2 and @xmath4. They introduce disorder by changing the position of layer boundaries while maintaining the same values of the refraction indices. They analyze homogeneous stacks (h) and mixed stacks (m) of alternating LHMs and right-handed materials (RHMs). The authors find that for h stacks, the localization length is quadratic for long wavelengths, while it saturates for lower values. They also perform an exhaustive study of @xmath0 in the allowed and forbidden bands of weakly disordered systems and show that the localization length is modulated by the corresponding bands and this modulation decreases as the disorder increases. For low-disordered m stacks and wavelengths of several orders of magnitude greater than the grating period, the localization length depends linearly on wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

The energy of the polymer is determined by various interactions between its constituent amino acids, which in turn determine the protein's shape and activity. However, given the large number of monomers and the complexity of their interactions, finding the configuration of a particular molecule is a formidable task.\n\nA physicist's approach is to simplify the problem by sacrificing specificity in the hope of gaining more general information.

The core entropy is the topological entropy of a polynomial restricted to its hubbard tree, a finite topological tree that is forward invariant under the polynomial. The main goal of the paper is to prove that the core entropy function extends continuously from the set of postcritically finite parameters in the Mandelbrot set to the complex plane. Thurston introduced the concept of core entropy and showed it can be defined purely combinatorially but displays a rich fractal structure. Hubbard trees have been used to classify postcritically finite maps and provide a new tool to study the parameter space of polynomials. The restriction of the core entropy to non-real veins of the Mandelbrot set is also monotone, which implies that the lamination for the Mandelbrot set can be reconstructed by looking at level sets of the polynomial. The value of the core entropy equals, up to a constant factor, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for the polynomial. For dendritic Julia sets, the core entropy also equals the asymptotic stretch factor of the rational map as a complex function. The simplest way to compute the entropy of a postcritically finite map is to compute the Markov transition matrix for the map acting on its hubbard tree and take the logarithm of its leading eigenvalue. However, this requires knowledge of the topology of the hubbard tree, which changes wildly after small perturbations of the parameter. The paper develops an algorithm to bypass this issue by considering instead a larger matrix whose entries are pairs of postcritical angles, and no knowledge of the topology of the hubbard tree is required. The algorithm is used to prove the continuity of the core entropy function.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

However, practical QKD systems can be vulnerable to attacks due to the difficulty of meeting the requirements for perfect security. A new scheme called Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD) has been proposed, which allows for the removal of all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing performance. MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol and can cover twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD. The only assumption needed is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources is almost perfect and carefully characterized. The characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit. MDIQKD removes the need to worry about imperfections of the measurement unit (mu) and instead focuses attention on the imperfections of the signal sources. One of the important imperfections is the basis-dependent flaw, which decreases the achievable distance in standard BB84. To investigate the practicality of MDIQKD, it is necessary to generalize the analysis of the basis-dependent flaw to MDIQKD. Another issue is the need to consider phase encoding instead of polarization encoding in some situations. Two schemes for phase encoding MDIQKD have been proposed and proven to be unconditionally secure with basis-dependent flaw. The first scheme employs phase locking of two separate laser sources, while the second scheme uses the conversion of phase encoding into polarization encoding. The security of these schemes has been proven using the quantum coin idea, and simulation results imply that the first scheme covers shorter distances and may require less accuracy of the state preparation, while the second scheme can cover much longer distances when the state is prepared very precisely.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion scenario for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion, increases mass, and then explodes. The WD model has made significant progresses since the introduction of the stellar wind from the WD during accretion. Two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia are the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. The companion stars leading to SNe Ia have not been confirmed by observations, requiring the identification of the companion star at the explosion site. A possible method to prove the companion star's location inside the ejecta is by observing broad blue wings in the absorption lines of a star located behind the SN ejecta. The S-M star, discovered near a Type Ia SNR 1006, was not the companion of this supernova due to broad wings in its Fe II absorption lines. The broad wings are likely formed by Fe II in the ejecta of SNR 1006.

They have been proposed to occur as quasi-particle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems, particularly in topological superconductors. MFs obey non-Abelian statistics, which is important for potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing. Various platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains, have been proposed to support majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect. Experimental evidence for MFs includes zero-bias peaks in tunneling spectroscopy experiments, which have been observed in semiconductor nanowires. However, these experimental results cannot definitively prove the existence of MFs in condensed matter systems, and it is a major challenge to uniquely distinguish MFs from conventional fermionic subgap states.\n\nTo obtain definitive signatures of MFs, alternative schemes for detecting them are necessary. In this work, an alternative all-optical scheme is proposed to detect MFs in iron chains on the superconducting Pb surface via a coupled hybrid quantum dot (QD) - nanomechanical resonator (NR) system with optical pump-probe scheme. Unlike electrical detection means where the QD is coupled to MFs via tunneling, in the optical scheme, there is no direct contact between MFs and the hybrid QD-NR system, which can effectively avoid introducing other signals disturbing the detection of MFs. The interaction between MFs in iron chains and the QD in the hybrid system is mainly due to the dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted by several tens of nanometers, making tunneling between the QD and MFs negligible. The QD is considered as a two-level system, and once MFs appear in the end of iron chains and couple to the QD, the majorana signature will be carried out via the coherent optical spectrum of the QD. The change in the coherent optical spectrum as a possible signature for MFs is another potential evidence in the iron chains.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

The authors employ unsupervised learning to analyze the Ising model and the XY model, finding that the reconstruction error of the autoencoder is higher in the disordered phase and lower in the ordered phase, suggesting its use as a universal identifier for phase transitions. The authors also compare the performance of principal component analysis, kernel principal component analysis, traditional autoencoders, and variational autoencoders in identifying phase transitions and find that the latter two methods are the most effective.\n</summary>\n\nThe text describes the ongoing effort to infer macroscopic properties of physical systems from their microscopic descriptions, focusing on phase transitions, which often involve symmetry breaking processes. Landau's phenomenological model and the renormalization group were used to formulate the theory of phase transitions from microscopic principles. In some systems, the order parameter cannot be determined by symmetry considerations and must be defined in a non-local way. These systems include topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin hall states, and quantum spin liquids.\n\nSince the 1990s, machine learning has undergone significant changes with the development of more powerful computers and artificial neural networks. Neural networks have been shown to approximate every function under mild assumptions and have found applications in image classification, speech recognition, natural language understanding, and predicting from high-dimensional data. Physicists have started to employ machine learning techniques, primarily using supervised learning algorithms and reinforcement learning.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is an orthogonal linear transformation of the data to an ordered set of variables, sorted by their variance. The first principal component has the largest variance, and subsequent principal components are obtained by subtracting the already calculated principal components and repeating. Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) projects the data into a kernel space in which the principal component analysis is then performed.\n\nTraditional neural network-based autoencoders consist of two artificial neural networks stacked on top of each other. The encoder network encodes the input data into latent variables, and the decoder network decodes these parameters to return an accurate reconstruction of the input data.

The most prominent pattern was the 'heartbeat' pattern. The first six months of RXTE observations revealed many other variability patterns similar to those observed in GRS 1915+105, and a high frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) with a frequency of 66 Hz was detected, almost identical to that in GRS 1915+105.

ZRP is conventionally represented as a boundary condition on the wavefunction or as a pseudopotential. Darboux transformation (DT) can be used to construct exactly solvable potentials and modify the generalized ZRP boundary condition, creating potentials with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum. The text discusses the application of DT to dress the ZRP model and obtain a chain of integrable potentials. The dressing procedure involves defining the free parameters of the solutions and obtaining the dressed potential and wavefunction. The text also considers the scattering problem for a dressed multi-center potential and expresses the partial waves as a superposition of green functions. The integral cross section is derived using the optical theorem. The text mentions previous investigations of multi-center scattering within the framework of the ZRP model and provides examples of structures that belong to different point groups. The phases can be found from the compatibility condition of the system, and the partial and integral cross sections can be expressed in terms of the phases. The structures can be used to study slow electron scattering by polyatomic molecules. The text also discusses the limitations of the ZRP model and the importance of polarization effects at low energies. The calculations were carried out using the ZRP model and compared to experimental results and numerical calculations, showing the agreement in shape but differences in size.

{"idx": 183, "result": 0, "generated": " <summary>\nA conformally symmetric model was proposed in [xcite] for strong interactions at low energies based on the observation that gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form under conformally-flat metrical fields. The model introduces two scalar fields that spontaneously break the symmetry down to @xmath8 and @xmath9, respectively. A symmetric second-order tensor field serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism. Quarks and gluons, which do not couple to this tensor field, are confined to an anti-de Sitter (ads) universe with a finite radius in the flat space-time. The model describes quarks and gluons oscillating with a universal frequency inside a closed universe, as well as photons freely traveling through flat space-time. The model comprises one real scalar field @xmath10 and one complex scalar field @xmath11. Their dynamical equations were solved for the case that the respective vacuum expectation values satisfy the relation @xmath14, leading to ads confinement via the associated conformally flat metric given by @xmath15. The only quadratic term in the lagrangian is proportional to @xmath16, resulting in a light @xmath10 field associated with confinement and a very heavy complex @xmath11 field associated with electromagnetism. Weak interactions were not considered in [xcite], but the strategy proposed is to study the supposedly light mass of the scalar field that gives rise to confinement. The model has been simplified to only survive its main property, namely its flavor-independent oscillations, in order to compare its properties with measured cross sections and branching ratios. The ads spectrum reveals itself through structures observed in hadronic mass distributions, but there is no simple relation between enhancements in experimental cross sections and the ads spectrum. The model has been studied in parallel for mesons in a coupled-channel model, and empirical results agree well with the observed results for meson-meson scattering and meson-pair production in the light, heavy-light, and heavy flavor sectors. The model also includes the coupling of quark-antiquark components to real and virtual two-meson decay channels via quark-pair creation, which gives a clue about the size of the mass of the @xmath10 field.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

In some cases, theories formulated in terms of fundamental degrees of freedom cannot answer certain questions due to their complexity at the related scale. The task then becomes to select the essential degrees of freedom. For instance, in crystals, heavy electrons, phonons, and their interactions are essential for understanding electric conductivity, heat capacity, and other properties. In QCD, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important phenomenon for understanding the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties. Light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting by the exchange of goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement. The chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to a lower symmetry by the QCD vacuum, and this is evidenced by a nonzero value of the quark condensates for the light flavors. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry leads to the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass, which represent the associated approximate goldstone bosons, and valence quarks acquire a dynamical mass, called constituent quarks. The flavor-octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit tells that the constituent quarks and goldstone bosons should be coupled with the strength of a quark analog of the Goldberger-Treiman relation. The microscopical mechanism for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD is not yet known, but it is believed that a sufficiently strong scalar interaction between quarks will induce it.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

The authors explain that Heegaard Floer theory is a decorated topological quantum field theory in 0 dimensions, which associates vector spaces and maps to closed, connected, oriented three-manifolds and cobordisms decorated with a two-structure. The maps can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on manifolds with boundary. The authors then discuss the Heegaard Floer invariants of two four-manifolds, which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic, and provide examples of their non-equality using Donaldson or Seiberg-Witten invariants and Heegaard Floer homology. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, but the authors show that every three-manifold admits a nice heegaard diagram, which allows for combinatorial counting of holomorphic disks and the description of Heegaard Floer homology for any three-manifold and nice knots or links. The goal of the paper is to provide a combinatorial description of the ranks of the maps when the induced maps from the cobordism are surjective. The authors explain that this case includes all cobordisms for which the induced maps are torsion or consist only of two-handle additions. The computation of the ranks goes by decomposing the cobordism into one-handle additions, two-handle additions, and three-handle additions, reducing the problem to the case of a cobordism map corresponding to two-handle additions only, and then representing the cobordism by a multi-pointed triple heegaard diagram with a special form.

{"idx": 192, "result": 0, "generated": " Rapidity gaps, which are regions without hadronic activity in hadronic collisions, have been observed at both the HERA @xcite and Tevatron @xcite colliders. These gaps are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, with the simplest model being the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state. At the Tevatron, a fraction @xmath9 of dijet events with jet transverse energies @xmath10  gev and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets. This observation raises hope that perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions. However, recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations have not observed such an effect, and the data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet @xmath20, casting doubt on the validity of the two-gluon exchange model. In this paper, the authors reconsider the basic ideas behind the two-gluon exchange model and demonstrate its limitations, showing that the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative. They find that the one- and two-gluon exchange amplitudes are too large to be compatible with unitarity, and phase shift unitarization leads to more realistic descriptions with substantially different color singlet exchange fractions. The predicted color singlet fractions depend strongly on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer and cannot be reliably calculated within perturbation theory. The non-perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift. Implications for the formation of gaps at the Tevatron are analyzed, including the variation of the gap fraction with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation.

The tool's functioning parts are housed in a stronger design to improve reliability, and additional power is delivered per stroke from modular stacked piston units. The tool can be run in a manner where high amplitude low frequency oscillating forces are delivered to the stuck fish without impacts on the housing. The tool has an outer body with a lower end attached to a stuck object, an upper end connected to the surface through a string, and a mandrel with a passage in fluid communication with the string. Pressure delivered from the surface to lateral ports pushes down on the pistons attached to the mandrel, displacing fluid from a chamber and moving the mandrel downwardly. A drop-in plug is used to close off the passage and initiate vibratory operations. The dump valve is cylindrically shaped with a seal ring that initially rides on the valve surface to hold pressure in the chamber. At some point, the ring seal moves off the surface to allow the pressure in the passage to drive the valve in tandem with the mandrel, eventually relieving the pressure built up in the passage. The mandrel continues to move downhole due to momentum, but the valve in the open position and the dissipated pressure quickly dissipates the momentum. The seal ring gets back into sealing contact with the valve surface to close off the passage again, allowing the next cycle to begin. The tool can be operated with or without jarring blows depending on the amount of surface overpull applied to the string before and during the vibratory operation. The tool is activated by dropping a simple and cheap plug into the passage to seal its lower end, and the design of the valve as an annular ring allows for wireline access before the plug is dropped.

The method involves calculating total mass flow for N parallel flow valves as a function of control valve position and determining the difference in flow characteristics between N and N-1 turbine flow control valves. A test compensation circuit uses this information to compensate for the flow change caused by the closure of one valve during testing. The compensation circuit is reproduced along with the test control circuit and valve servo position loop for each valve. The test compensation array in the circuit provides the required flow compensation for the three input control valves not under test based on the mass flow demanded by the TCV Reference signal. The lift flow array in the circuit translates the stem lift of the tested valve to a total flow demand value for the three input control valves not being tested. The divider circuit in the circuit determines the fraction of flow demand that remains constant during the test closing of a given valve and the varying flow demand for the other three input control valves. The output of the divider circuit is then used to calculate the valve stem lift compensation signal, which is multiplied by the compensation factor to move the lift for the other valves as the tested valve closes. The select circuit in the circuit determines whether the reference signal or the output of the multiplier circuit is fed into the summing circuit, which then calculates the valve lift of the tested valve.

The method involves starting with hot- or cold-rolled steel plates coated with aluminum or aluminum alloy. Before heat treatment, the coating is heated to form a surface alloy by interdiffusion between the steel and the aluminum coating, preventing decarburization and oxidation during heat treatment.\n\nTo reduce vehicle weights, parts have been developed using steel blanks of different compositions or thicknesses continuously butt-welded together. These welded parts, known as \"butt-welded blanks,\" are produced using laser beam welding, which allows for the variation of mechanical strength, pressability, and impact absorption properties within the parts.\n\nThe fabrication method described in the patent can be applied to butt-welded blanks by heating and pressing the blanks to form a surface alloy and then quenching them to create parts with thicknesses and intrinsic mechanical characteristics that vary, responding to local loading requirements.\n\nHowever, this method faces difficulties when welding coated steel blanks, as a portion of the initial surface pre-coating is transferred into the molten area during welding and forms intermetallic areas. These intermetallic areas tend to be the site of onset of rupture under static or dynamic conditions, significantly reducing the overall deformability of the welded joints after heat treatment.\n\nTo address this issue, the present invention eliminates the source of these intermetallic areas by removing the initial surface metal coating in an area around the future welded joint. This prevents the formation of intermetallic areas during welding and subsequent alloying and austenizing heat treatment.\n\nThe invention also ensures good corrosion resistance by converting the precoat throughout its thickness into an intermetallic alloy compound during heat treatment, providing protection against corrosion and decarburization of the steel substrate. The method is economic, can be integrated into existing welding lines, and is compatible with subsequent pressing or heat treatment phases.

{"idx": 393, "result": 0, "generated": " The text describes an invention for detecting and eliminating defective or incorrectly positioned cigarettes in a cigarette magazine of a production or packaging machine. The problem is that cigarettes can end up transversely located, blocking individual shafts or shaft groups, resulting in disruptions that require laborious and costly elimination. The invention uses an optical checking element, such as a camera, to scan and evaluate images of cigarettes in the magazine. If a deviation from a reference image or reference value is detected, an error signal is produced, triggering the actuation of an ejecting unit to eject a plurality of cigarettes located in an assigned ejecting zone. The ejected cigarettes are recycled, reducing tobacco waste. Each ejecting unit has a housing with a linear cylinder and a guiding carriage connected to the actual ejector. The ejector has a front and rear wall, and when actuated, both walls are displaced, allowing cigarettes to be ejected without obstruction. The four front walls and housing-like devices of the ejectors are spaced apart, and the evaluation zones above the ejecting zones are monitored by the camera, which picks up an image of all zones and evaluates them separately. The time delay between detection and actuation is determined by the time required for a cigarette to move downwards from an evaluation zone into an ejecting zone. The invention can also be used to register defective cigarettes, such as those with missing filters or bent or broken cigarettes. The greatest advantages are achieved when the automatic detection of a defective or incorrectly positioned cigarette is coupled to an ejecting unit.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

In the conventional method, an oxide film is used as a mask during the ion implantation process to form the LDD structure, but the width of the oxide portion on the gate sidewall is difficult to control, leading to issues such as etching away the source/drain region or degradation of the transconductance. The first embodiment of the invention involves forming a conformal layer on the insulating film on the gate sidewall and anisotropically etching it away using RIE, leaving a portion on the gate sidewall. This improves the controllability of the width of the polycrystalline silicon on the gate sidewall and avoids the possibility of etching away the source/drain region. The second embodiment employs a larger gate electrode thickness to achieve a larger width of the polycrystalline silicon portion on the gate sidewall, allowing for easier removal of the polycrystalline silicon during the ion implantation process. The third embodiment uses a nitride film as a mask during the formation of the gate sidewall oxide and high concentration region of the source/drain, followed by their removal. The fourth embodiment forms the low concentration region of the source/drain before the high concentration region, and the fifth embodiment forms the high concentration region before the low concentration region. The sixth embodiment uses a high melting point metal or silicide of such a metal as the gate sidewall portion, allowing for the derivation of hot carriers through the gate electrode and preventing transconductance degradation. The seventh embodiment silicides the gate electrode and the source/drain, reducing the sheet resistance of the source/drain region and preventing short-circuits between the gate electrode and the source/drain. The eighth embodiment silicides only the source/drain region, eliminating the need to remove the portion of the high melting point metal which is not silicided.

Scraped surface heat exchangers are commonly used in industry, particularly for processing foodstuffs. They consist of a long cylindrical outer tube with a material inlet and outlet, a central drive shaft, and radially extending paddles or blades hingedly connected to the shaft. The blades help mix the material and scrape the inside surface of the outer tube to prevent buildup.\n\nIn one known method, the blade is mounted by sliding it between two figures of a pin at an installation angle, and then pivoting it to a shallower angle to restrain it from lateral movement. This method can be cumbersome for horizontally and vertically arranged heat exchangers, as the blades may swing outward during installation and require manual holding or tying.\n\nThe invention provides an apparatus that facilitates the mounting of a scraped surface heat exchanger blade onto a drive shaft while still using a pin type connection. The blade includes a blade body with a first side, a second side, a scraper edge, a hinge edge, and at least one mounting hole. It also has two L-shaped locking tracks, one on each side, with entry tracks and intermediate tracks that interfere with the pin.\n\nDuring installation, the blade is placed at an angle relative to the pins, and the outer fingers of the pin slide into the entry tracks on the blade. The inner fingers then slide into the entry tracks and the blade is held at an angle by contact between the fingers. The blade is then moved longitudinally so that the inner fingers align with the mounting holes, and the blade is angularly rotated downward into an installation position.\n\nThe arrangement prevents the blades from falling downward off the pins, even if they are at the installation angle. This is an advantage for vertically oriented heat exchangers, where each blade can be positioned at the installation angle, slid onto the pins, and then slid downwardly along the pins until reaching the installation position. The provision of locking tracks on both sides of the blade reduces the amount of thinned track blade area compared to what would be necessary in an arrangement utilizing the tracks only on one side of the blade.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

From fiscal years 1997 through 2005, CMS generally increased funding for each of these activities, but the amount and percentage increase varied. CMS officials told us they generally allocated funds based on historical funding and high-level priorities, but this approach does not take into account data or information on the effectiveness of one activity over the other in ensuring the integrity of Medicare or allow CMS to determine if activities are yielding benefits commensurate with the amounts spent. CMS has not fully assessed whether MIP funds are appropriately allocated within the audit, medical review, benefit integrity, and provider education activities. For example, audit's role has changed as Medicare's payment methods have changed, but it continues to have the largest share of MIP funding. CMS allocates funds for the five activities based primarily on an analysis of previous years' spending and may also consider other information when developing the MIP budget, such as current expenditures by individual contractors and high-level priorities. However, CMS does not have a means to compare quantitative data or qualitative information on the relative effectiveness of MIP activities that it could use in allocating funds. Instead, it calculates the quantitative benefits for two activities, medical review and secondary payer, and assesses the qualitative benefits for the other three.

{"idx": 464, "result": 0, "generated": " <summary>\nThe text discusses the impact of mutual funds on bank deposits and the role of securitization in financing. Mutual funds and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and invest them in the economy. While banks use deposits for loans and investments in debt securities, mutual funds invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining since the 1960s due to securitization and other factors. Securitization is a process through which securities issuance replaces bank credit as a source of finance. The Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds Accounts data shows that mutual funds attracted sizable amounts of money that otherwise might have been placed in bank deposits. However, the exact impact is difficult to quantify, with estimates ranging from $200 billion to over $700 billion. The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds should have little effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy. Both mutual funds and banks generally invest a substantial portion of the funds they receive, with mutual funds investing mainly in securities and banks investing in loans and certain kinds of securities. The availability of finance for residential, consumer, and business borrowers could be disproportionally affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds. Residential finance has been extensively securitized, with only 34 percent of home mortgages directly held by commercial banks and thrifts in 1994. Consumer credit is still largely provided by commercial banks, but some of it is securitized, and consumers have another avenue of indirect access to the securities markets through borrowing from finance companies. The corporate sector has also increased its access to finance raised in the securities markets, with net issuance averaging $100 billion annually from 1991 to 1993. Mutual funds are major purchasers of corporate securities, including those of smaller companies and those with lower credit ratings.

The agreement included a $970 million capital infusion from FDIC and $500 million of private capital raised by the new bank management.

{"idx": 473, "result": 0, "generated": " In the early 1980s, Congress passed the Single Audit Act of 1984 to address concerns about inadequate oversight and accountability of federal assistance provided to state and local governments. The act required entities receiving over $100,000 in federal financial assistance to undergo a single audit instead of multiple grant audits. The objectives of the act include promoting sound financial management, reducing burdens on grantees, and ensuring federal departments rely on audit work. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the act and established uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients. The amendments required the Director of OMB to designate a Federal Audit Clearinghouse as the single audit repository and increased the audit threshold to $300,000. Federal award recipients without a cognizant agency for audit are assigned an oversight agency. The quality of single audits conducted under the Single Audit Act has been a concern since its passage, with issues including insufficient evidence related to audit planning, internal control, and compliance testing, and auditors' adherence to GAGAS. In response, OMB and several federal OIGs developed the National Single Audit Sampling Project to determine the quality of single audits and make recommendations to address any issues. The project found that approximately 49 percent of the universe of single audits fell into the acceptable group, but only 35.5 percent of these audits were deemed acceptable when considering the results in both strata. The most prevalent deficiencies related to the auditors' lack of documentation of an understanding of internal control over compliance requirements, testing of internal control, and compliance testing. The PCIE report recommended revisions to OMB Circular No. A-133, the AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 74, and the AICPA Audit Guide to emphasize correctly identifying major programs, provide more detailed requirements and guidance for compliance testing, and require compliance testing to be performed using sampling.

DOD previously evaluated three pilot programs to improve the quality of household goods moves and submitted recommendations to Congress in 2002. These recommendations included reengineering the liability and claims process, changing the acquisition process, and implementing information technology improvements. In response, DOD developed a new program called Families First to improve the quality of household goods moves for servicemembers, DOD civilian employees, and their families. However, DOD's legacy data management system, TOPS, is not feasible for supporting the goals of Families First due to its age, lack of support, and poor reporting and data capabilities.

Under the current system, servicemembers are provided with basic claims coverage using depreciated value for losses or damages incurred during a move. DOD has taken initial steps to achieve the goals and benefits of the Families First program, but delays in developing a new information management system have put achieving the program's goals and benefits at risk. DOD continues to rely on the implementation of DPS to achieve other program goals such as improving the quality of service and claims processing.

Specific deductions, such as charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes, tended to benefit different types of itemizers based on their income.

The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 expanded the scope of hate crime victims to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability. The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13th and 15th Amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned in discussions of Congress's authority to proscribe hate crimes and civil rights legislation.\n\nThe commerce clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce and activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. However, the Supreme Court's decision in Morrison narrowed the \"affects interstate commerce\" category, rejecting the argument that Congress may regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on its aggregate effect on interstate commerce. The Violence Against Women Act, which allows victims of gender-motivated violence to bring federal civil suits for damages, was challenged under the commerce clause but was ultimately struck down due to concerns about federalization of crime and traditional state regulation.\n\nThe legislative clauses of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments give Congress the power to enforce the Amendments by appropriate legislation.

Banks connect borrowers to savers and allocate capital, making them vital to economic health. However, banking is an inherently risky activity, and panics and failures can cause significant losses. Over time, a regulatory system has developed to foster benefits while limiting risks, with both banks and regulation evolving as market conditions change. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 threatened the collapse of the financial system and economy, leading to significant regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III Accords. Some argue that these changes may have excessive costs, such as reduced credit availability and slower economic growth. The text covers various banking-related issues, including prudential regulation, consumer protection, \"too big to fail\" banks, community banking, regulatory agency structures and independence, and market and economic trends.\n\nBanks use a balance sheet to manage assets, liabilities, and capital. Assets are loans and securities, liabilities are deposits and borrowings, and capital is raised through various methods. Capital is essential because it does not require repayment and can absorb losses, allowing banks to meet their obligations and avoid failure. Regulators use prudential regulation to ensure banks are safely profitable and reduce the risk of failure. This includes ratio requirements, such as capital and liquidity ratios, and restrictions on permissible activities.\n\nCapital ratios are a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses and come in two main types: leverage ratios and risk-weighted ratios. Leverage ratios treat all assets the same, while risk-weighted ratios assign risk weights to assets based on their likelihood of loss. Riskier assets receive higher risk weights, requiring more capital to meet the ratio requirement. Regulatory ratio requirements and permissible activity restrictions have evolved over time, with the Basel Accords setting international standards.\n\nThe financial crisis revealed weaknesses in consumer protection regulations, leading to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and new mortgage lending rules.

The Commemorative Works Act was enacted to guide the process for creating a commemorative work in the District of Columbia, with the goals of preserving the integrity of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans, ensuring public use and enjoyment of open space, preserving and maintaining existing open space, and ensuring appropriate design and location of future commemorative works.

The Act sets forth criteria for memorial placement in different parts of the District, including Area I for works of preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States and Area II for subjects of lasting historical significance to the American people. The text also discusses the importance of balancing the placement of commemorative works with other uses of public lands and the need for donor recognition policies.

These policies have been based on practical or policy considerations and have not been grounded in arguments that the statutory provisions themselves are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. The Administration has justified its actions as consistent with the proper exercise of enforcement discretion, a legal doctrine that shields executive branch enforcement decisions from judicial review. This report focuses on two forms of enforcement discretion: prosecutorial discretion, exercised in the criminal context, and administrative enforcement discretion, exercised in the administrative context. The Department of Justice has used prosecutorial discretion to curtail the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act in states with medical and recreational marijuana legalization initiatives. The Secretary of Homeland Security relied on administrative enforcement discretion to establish guidelines for enforcing immigration laws against certain young people who entered the country as children. However, some argue that these policies contravene statutory mandates and violate the President's constitutional obligation to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" The House of Representatives has focused on the judicial process as a means of addressing the Administration's nonenforcement policies, passing legislation that would allow for expedited lawsuits challenging nonenforcement decisions. The Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires the President to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" and has been interpreted as both placing an obligation on the President and ensuring Presidential control over the enforcement of federal law. The Supreme Court has generally held that the President has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend the enforcement of laws, and that the Clause does not provide the President with the authority to frustrate legal requirements imposed by law.

HRPs target individuals who have sought coverage in the individual market but have been denied or offered coverage with exclusions or high premiums. Many states use HRPs to comply with HIPAA requirements for portability and guaranteed availability. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was passed, requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a temporary HRP program before 2014.\n\nMost Americans receive health coverage through the group market, which provides benefits to groups formed for purposes other than obtaining insurance. Public programs are another source of health coverage, but individuals must meet eligibility requirements. Those who cannot access group or public coverage may seek insurance in the individual market, which involves rigorous underwriting and may result in denials, exclusions, or high premiums.\n\nHigh risk pools were designed to assist individuals with preexisting health conditions who have limited options for private health coverage. They appeal to policymakers who prefer an incremental approach to coverage expansion and rely on state oversight. Supporters argue that HRPs efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals, stabilize the market, and retain insurance carriers. Critics contend that HRPs are too small and underfunded to meet the needs of a significant portion of the uninsured.\n\nState high risk pools have existed since the mid-1970s, but congressional support began in the 1990s. Federal grants have been provided to states to establish and operate HRPs. Premiums for HRPs are capped, and most states cover operating expenses with a combination of premiums, assessments on insurers, and federal grants.\n\nHigh risk pools offer coverage that reflects what is available in the private nongroup market, with varying deductibles, cost-sharing requirements, and benefit maximums. Eligibility criteria vary, but most states allow HIPAA-eligible individuals to enroll, and some allow individuals with specific medical conditions or coverage denials.

In response, Congress has proposed legislation to expand federal efforts in recovering vulnerable adults who go missing due to cognitive or physical disabilities. The proposed program is similar to the AMBER Alert system, which funds training and technical assistance for state and local agencies to recover abducted children.\n\nEleven states have established alert systems for missing vulnerable adults, with Colorado and Georgia being the first in 2006.

Training on the use of the alert system is provided to state and local enforcement agencies, as well as the public and other stakeholders in some states. The process for activating an alert involves filing a missing persons report, ensuring the criteria for activating the alert have been met, and disseminating the alert through various media outlets.\n\nMost states reported that their alert systems have been instrumental in recovering missing adults, although some reported that the alerts did not directly assist in recovery efforts.

These programs aim to achieve goals such as wildfire planning and response, and the development of new wood product markets. The State and Private Forestry (SPF) branch of the FS manages most of these programs. Forestry assistance for non-federal landowners has been a part of USDA programs since 1881. The FS has three primary mission areas: managing National Forests, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. The Senate and House Agriculture Committees oversee forestry programs. Eligible states must prepare a State Forest Action Plan to receive funding for most programs. These plans include a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term strategy for addressing threats. Most forestry assistance programs are administered by the FS but implemented by state partners. Technical assistance includes guidance, skills training, and technological innovations, while financial assistance is provided through grants or cost-sharing. The Forest Health Protection program offers both types of assistance. Forestry assistance programs have declined in funding over the past 15 years, making up 7% of the FS's total annual discretionary appropriation on average.

Costs for maintenance and construction are funded through appropriations and user fees. The Corps pays for 100% of the cost for studies and operations and maintenance on the IWS, while the cost for new construction or major rehabilitation is shared equally between the Corps and the commercial industry.

Thirty-four patients who underwent both DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy within a 4-month period were enrolled. The study used Siemens and Toshiba gamma cameras and reconstructed the data using different methods. The final diagnosis was made by neurologists based on medical history, symptoms, response to dopaminergic treatment, and diagnostic MRI findings. Five patients were diagnosed with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) and two with probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The SPECT scans were acquired according to European Association of Nuclear Medicine procedure guidelines, and the data were reconstructed using filtered back projection and ordered subset expectation maximization methods. The specific binding ratio (SBR) was calculated semiquantitatively using the dat view software program.

While diabetes is a disease associated with increased intracellular oxidative stress and accelerated biochemical aging, most diabetologists do not view cancer as a diabetes-specific risk. The use of insulin, particularly long-acting insulin analogues like glargine, has raised concerns due to its potential mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on cancer cells.

Deflux was FDA approved in 2001 for treating grade 2-4 VUR in children above one year of age without accompanying urological malformations. The technique's ease, short procedure, and recovery time have made it popular. Reports suggest its use in patients of all ages and grades of VUR, even with complications like duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies. The American Urological Association (AUA) endorses Deflux as a management option for pediatric VUR. The initial success rate was 68%, but it has since improved. The High-Pressure Intraureteric Injection Technique (HIT) introduced by the Atlanta group reports success rates of 89%. However, worldwide success rates vary, and our institution reports an overall radiographic success rate of 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection. Since up to 25% of patients may still have remaining VUR, follow-up voiding cystograms are performed 2 months post-surgery. Positional Instillation of Contrast (PIC) cystography was developed to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent UTIs after a negative standard voiding cystogram. It has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystograms and can detect occult VUR. Parents can be advised to undergo Dx/HA injection during the same anesthesia if a positive PIC is detected. In the current study, two different PIC techniques and scenarios were evaluated: detecting de novo contralateral VUR in the case of preoperative unilateral VUR and predicting successful surgical outcomes by correlating intraoperative and postoperative PIC results with standard 2-month postprocedure VCUG.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

Multiple factors contribute to glaucoma, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure. M\u00fcller cells, the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina, support and nourish RGCs, maintain extracellular ion homeostasis, and interact in synaptic transmission. Investigations indicate that M\u00fcller cells are involved in multiple pathological retinal diseases, including glaucoma. Reactive M\u00fcller cells can aggravate retinal damage by releasing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Increased glial production of TNF-\u03b1 contributes to the neurodegeneration in glaucoma. A study aimed to determine if 1-aminoadipic acid (AAA), a compound that induces specific glial toxicity, inhibits M\u00fcller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.\n\nThe study used adult male Sprague Dawley rats and was approved by the animal care committee of the capital medical university.

The study used 55 extracted maxillary central incisors, which were prepared using a rotary system and irrigated with sodium hypochlorite, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, or orthophosphoric acid, or treated with a photodynamic diode laser. The results showed that the higher bond strength values were obtained for the laser and orthophosphoric acid groups, while the other groups showed mixed failures.

The smear layer should be removed to increase antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness, but some authors insist on retaining it for material adaptation. In the photodynamic diode laser group, bond strength was higher than the other groups except for the orthophosphoric acid group without smear layer removal. This may be due to the fact that collagen fibrils are more stable and less affected by dehydration, which improves the infiltration of the luting agent.

{"idx": 658, "result": 0, "generated": " <summary>\nmyosin VA (myova) is a molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. Each myova dimer consists of motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in processive motion. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of myova, but high calcium levels reduce motor processivity and may cause calmodulin dissociation from the lever arms. Calmodulin dissociation decreases the lever arm's flexural stiffness, affecting the motor's processivity. Myova can maneuver through actin intersections and travel along actin bundles in vitro. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains. TPM involves anchoring a myova-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle to a desired location along the motor. Thermal energy causes the particle to be randomly displaced, and the resulting motion is measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered particle to a stationary reference particle.

The study drugs were prepared as 20 ml liquid doses, and subjects inhaled single breaths of ascending capsaicin concentrations until 5 or more coughs resulted. The primary end point was the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs (C5). The study found that cough reflex sensitivity was significantly inhibited (log C5 increased) after diphenhydramine administration (p < 0.01), but not for dextromethorphan versus placebo. Five subjects reported slight drowsiness after diphenhydramine, and five reported side effects after dextromethorphan. The majority of OTC cough preparations contain dextromethorphan or diphenhydramine as the active component, and significant criticism has been directed at the OTC cough and cold market due to the lack of adequate clinical trials demonstrating their efficacy as antitussives. This study represents the first demonstration of the ability of diphenhydramine to suppress cough reflex sensitivity in subjects with acute URI, and the diphenhydramine-containing formulation proved a more effective antitussive than dextromethorphan.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

Approximately 25-45% of all schwannomas occur in the head and neck, including the vidian canal. Vidian nerve schwannomas originate from the vidian nerve, which arises from the joining of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and deep petrosal nerve. The parasympathetic fibers of the vidian nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, while the sympathetic fibers innervate the lacrimal gland and nasopalatine glands. Vidian nerve schwannomas can present with decreased lacrimation, corneal desiccation, dryness of nasal mucosa, and cluster headaches, as well as compression of the internal carotid artery or expansion into the cavernous sinus. Only four documented cases of biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannomas have been reported in the literature. A 49-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis presented with an incidentally identified vidian canal schwannoma, which was asymptomatic. The patient underwent a biopsy, and treatment was pursued with stereotactic radiotherapy due to the benign histology, the patient's young age, and the potential risks of late normal tissue injury. Radiation therapy is a common alternative to surgical resection for intracranial schwannomas, with options including single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or conventional fractionated radiation.

Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that enables the visualization of morphological features not discernible by the naked eye, improving diagnostic sensitivity by up to 1030%. However, it requires great experience to use effectively, and inexperienced dermatologists may lower diagnostic accuracy. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve diagnostic performance, but they have limitations, particularly in terms of low inter- and intra-observer agreement. In recent decades, there has been growing interest in automated analysis of digitized images obtained by epiluminescence microscopy (ELM) to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions. Computational intelligence methods help physicians and dermatologists in faster data processing for better and more reliable diagnoses. Research on automated classification of pigmented skin lesion images dates back to 1987, and the utility of machine vision and computerized analysis is increasingly important. Numerous computerized diagnostic systems have been reported, using various border detection, feature extraction, selection, and classification algorithms. However, more research is needed to identify and reduce uncertainties in automatic decision support systems to improve diagnosis accuracy. A comprehensive review of automatic diagnostic models for skin lesions is not available due to the continuous emergence of new classification algorithms and techniques for dermoscopic image analysis. This paper describes a standard automatic decision support system based on semantic analysis of melanoma images and further classification of characteristic objects commonly found in pigmented skin lesions.

VRE is associated with high mortality and costs, and is mediated by van genes, with vanA and vanB being the most prevalent. Several European countries have reported an increase in VRE in recent years, with Denmark experiencing a dramatic increase since 2012 due to multiclonal outbreaks of vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium. Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, which relies on selective culturing and/or detection of resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR. Rapidly available results from PCR can lead to substantial indirect savings. In autumn 2014, a laboratory implemented the Xpert vanA/vanB assay, which provides results within an hour, to supplement routine culture-based screening. The study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert vanA/vanB assay and its impact on infection control decision making. The laboratory serves a population of 800,000 inhabitants and includes four university hospitals with a total of 1577 beds. The infection control units employ six infection control nurses. VRE in a clinical sample results in roommate screening and isolation precautions until results are available. If any roommate is found positive, an outbreak is declared and all patients in the ward are screened weekly until no new patient is diagnosed with VRE. For roommate and weekly screenings, the routine culture-based screening is supplemented by vanA PCR. Before transfer of patients from an outbreak ward, PCR is performed and isolation precautions are based on the PCR result. For VRE-positive patients readmitted within 6 months after the last positive screening sample, isolation precautions are implemented at admission independently from screening results.

Biologists must navigate the vast genomic data to uncover hidden knowledge. Two common ways to annotate genes are through empirical observations and predicted evolutionary relationships. Homology assignment indicates an approximate direction for future empirical determination of function. The first completely sequenced genomes were annotated using all available sequence databases. A major problem arises when encountering sequence-similar, homologous portions of genes in otherwise sequence-dissimilar contexts. Domains represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution and are compact units of structure. Pfam, SMART, and InterPro are domain resources that carry considerable redundancy but each has its own merits. Annotation of individual proteins or complete proteomes using domains is achieved automatically. The human genome draft publications found that the majority of human genes have no orthologs in important model organisms. Comparative proteomics has played a major role in understanding the evolution of chordates. The Gene Ontology project has created an initial hierarchy of defined terms to deal with the issue of restricting descriptions of function to a common and broad vocabulary.

Demographic factors, such as gender, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, and time period, as well as clinical factors, such as tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases, have been shown to have a significant impact.\n\nSurgical resection is the most effective treatment for PDAC, but only 20% of patients are suitable candidates. The combination of surgery with radiation and chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival compared to surgery alone.\n\nThe reliability and generalizability of cox models are essential for clinical practice. In this work, a web-based, real-time prognostic tool was developed using SEER data on 18,352 pathologically confirmed cases of PDAC diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. The tool estimates survival and conditional survival probabilities, as well as their corresponding standard errors, for patients with PDAC based on individual demographic and clinical data.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

The introduction of tobacco by European settlers four centuries ago led to the mixing of tobacco with betel quid and its preparation for chewing. During the second half of the 20th century, the causal association between chewing betel quid with tobacco and oral cancer was established, making it no longer considered innocuous. Betel nut was erroneously thought to play a more significant role due to its exotic appeal, but studies showed it was safe when only tobacco in the quid was held responsible for oral cancers. However, betel nut chewing was later found to be responsible for oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a precancerous condition with trismus. OSMF was rare in the early 1980s but increased among young Indians due to the increasing use of gutkha. The incidence of oral cancer in India is 12.5/100,000, making it the largest number of oral cancer patients in the world. The rampant use of betel nut, betel quid, and gutkha and pan masala chewing in India is the major cause of oral cancer in Indian men, making it the major cause of cancer-related death.\n\nDespite large funds spent on public education, law implementation, rehabilitation, and healthcare infrastructure, the betel nut, betel quid, gutkha, and pan masala chewing habit continues to be a significant public health problem in India.

Its genome is approximately 13 kb in length and has a similar genomic organization to human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv), with the gene composition being n-p-m-f-m2-1/m2-2-sh-g-l. Comparative analysis suggests that hmpv has two main genetic lineages, subtype a and b, with the greatest diversity found in the a2 sublineage. Synonymous codon usage bias can provide insights into the evolution profile, gene expression, and virus-host interaction of hmpv, but there is a lack of information on its codon usage pattern and major influencing factors. In this study, the authors performed a comparative analysis of synonymous codon usage in hmpv genomes and investigated their influencing factors.\n\nThe authors retrieved 17 complete hmpv genomes and 10 ampv genomes as a reference frame from the NCBI database. They calculated the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of each complete coding region in the hmpv genomes and the RSCU value of each codon for its amino acid. The preferred codons in hmpv are all ended with a/u, and the high abundance of a/u nucleotides is consistent with this phenomenon. The nucleotide composition is the main force affecting the codon usage bias in hmpv genome. The effective number of codons (ENC) among hmpv genomes shows a range from 45.127 to 48.28, with an average value of 45.785 and an SD value of 0.8458, indicating that their genomic compositions are conserved.\n\nThe authors observed a complex correlation map between nucleotide compositions, with u3% having a significant positive correlation with u%, but negative correlations with c% and gc%.

The HE sector in Wales contributes about \u00a35 billion annually and supports 50,000 jobs. Uncertainty about the relationships and arrangements with Europe is causing difficulties for university management, particularly in relation to EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding. Applications from EU students have decreased by 8%, while applications from non-EU students have also decreased by 9%. The financial impact of these decreases is uncertain, but there are signs of increasing difficulties in collaborative research activities with EU partners. The Welsh Government is expected to receive a share of the UK's net contribution to the EU, but the extent to which Wales will benefit depends on the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. The Diamond report, which recommends re-establishing funding for higher cost provision, innovation, and maintaining research funding in real terms, is expected to help address some of these challenges. However, the implementation of the Diamond report is expected to take some time, and institutions are currently trying to minimize cost reductions to maintain infrastructure. The sector is also facing challenges from the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales and the uncertainty surrounding the level of transition funding that will be available. The HE sector in Wales is currently running deficit budgets, and any significant disruption to the timeline or implementation of the Diamond report could require more 'houskeeping' to maintain infrastructure.
