### Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue
Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the annual cost
The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

### Step 3: Calculate the annual net profit
The annual net profit is the revenue minus the cost:
\[
\text{Annual Net Profit} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the number of years to recover the initial cost
The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. To find out how many years it will take to recover this cost, we divide the initial cost by the annual net profit:
\[
\text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \text{ years}

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike.
Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile trail. The formula for average speed is:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking.
Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So, the total time spent so far is:

\[
\text{Time Spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the remaining distance and the time left.
The total distance is 12 miles, and Marissa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:

\[
\text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}

25,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, let's break down the costs of all the items she purchased and then solve for the unknown number of pizza boxes.

1. **Cost of the chicken meal**:  
   Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs **$12**.

2. **Cost of the milk**:  
   She bought 5 packs of milk, each costing **$3**.  
   Total cost for milk = \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

3. **Cost of the apples**:  
   She bought 4 apples, each costing **$1.50**.  
   Total cost for apples = \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Cost of the pizza boxes**:  
   Let \(x\) be the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered. Each box costs **$8.50**.  
   Total cost for pizza boxes = \(8.50x\) dollars.

5. **Total cost**:  
   The total amount Marie paid is **$50**.  
   So, we can write the equation:  
   \[
   12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50
   \]

6. **Solve for \(x\)**:  
   Combine the known costs:

1. **Total trip distance:** 60 miles.
2. **First stop:** After 20 miles.
3. **Second stop:** 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, calculate the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip:
- Since the second stop is 15 miles before the end, the distance from the second stop to the end is 15 miles.

Next, calculate the distance from the start to the second stop:
- Total trip distance = 60 miles.
- Distance from the second stop to the end = 15 miles.
- Therefore, distance from the start to the second stop = 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, calculate the distance between the first and second stops:
- Distance from the start to the first stop = 20 miles.
- Distance from the start to the second stop = 45 miles.

1. Let \( W \) be the number of games the team won.
2. Let \( L \) be the number of games the team lost.

From the problem statement:
- The team played a total of 22 games, so:
  \[
  W + L = 22
  \]
- They won 8 more games than they lost, so:
  \[
  W = L + 8
  \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(L + 8) + L = 22
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
2L = 14
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
L = 7
\]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. Her initial annual salary is:
   \[
   \text{Initial Annual Salary} = 600 \times 12 = 7200
   \]

2. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: After 5 years, Sylvie's salary increases by 10% of her initial salary. The increase is:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 7200 = 720
   \]
   So, her new annual salary after 5 years is:
   \[
   \text{New Annual Salary} = 7200 + 720 = 7920
   \]

3. **Salary After Three More Years**: The problem states that the salary increases by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. Since Sylvie has already clocked 5 years, the next three years will each add another 10% of the initial salary to her annual salary.

   Each year, the increase is:
   \[
   \text{Yearly Increase} = 0.10 \times 7200 = 720

1. **Monday and Tuesday**:  
   - Each night, he watched a 1-hour episode.  
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Wednesday**:  
   - He watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show.  
   - Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched.  
   - Total time on Wednesday: \(x \times 0.5 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Thursday**:  
   - He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.  
   - Total time on Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Friday**:  
   - He watched two 1-hour episodes.  
   - Total time on Friday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

Now, sum up all the time Frankie spent watching TV:  
\[
2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours}.

1. **Monday's Distance:**
   - Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Distance:**
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
   - So, Tuesday's distance = 6 × Monday's distance = 6 × 4 = 24 miles.

3. **Total Distance (Monday through Wednesday):**
   - The total distance walked from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - Let’s denote Wednesday's distance as \( W \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Monday's distance + Tuesday's distance + Wednesday's distance = Total distance.
   - \( 4 + 24 + W = 41 \).

5. **Solve for \( W \):**
   - Combine Monday and Tuesday's distances: \( 4 + 24 = 28 \).
   - So, \( 28 + W = 41 \).
   - Subtract 28 from both sides to find \( W \): \( W = 41 - 28 \).

- Each back-and-forth run covers 100 yards (to the end) + 100 yards (back) = 200 yards.
- Total distance for Blake: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

### Kelly's Distance:
- Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards (100 yards to the end + 100 yards back).
- After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Each run to the 40-yard line and back covers 40 yards (to the 40-yard line) + 40 yards (back) = 80 yards.
- Total distance for the 34 runs: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Total distance for Kelly: \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

### Difference:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.
- The difference is \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

Blake runs 80 yards farther than Kelly.

2. **Tadpoles coming out of hiding**: Suddenly, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad. These 6 tadpoles were already part of the initial 11, so they are now visible. This does not change the total number of tadpoles Finn can see; it just means that 6 more are now visible.

3. **Tadpoles hiding under a rock**: Next, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock. These 2 tadpoles were part of the 11 that Finn was initially watching. Since they are now hiding, they are no longer visible.

162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the cumulative effect of the 20% price increase every two months.

### Step 1: Determine the number of price increases
Since the price increases every two months, we first calculate how many such intervals occur in 36 months:
\[
\text{Number of increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months}} = 18
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the price after each increase
The price increases by 20% of the original price each time. This means the price after each increase is:
\[
\text{New price} = \text{Original price} + 0.20 \times \text{Original price} = 1.20 \times \text{Original price}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the increase repeatedly
Since the price increases by 20% every two months, we apply this increase 18 times. The final price can be calculated using the formula for compound growth:
\[
\text{Final price} = \text{Original price} \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the final price
Substitute the original price ($20) and calculate:
\[
\text{Final price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 18.488

\[
\text{Final price} = 20 \times 18.488 \approx 369.76

   - Jan's current age is given as 30.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark:
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2}(30 - 2)
     \]
     Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2}(28) = 5 + 14 = 19
     \]
     So:
     \[
     M - 2 = 19
     \]
     Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 19 + 2 = 21

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6.
   - Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%.

3. **Comparing the two probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.
   - The difference between these probabilities is \( 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \).

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Half a dozen plates = 6 plates.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Total cost of plates = 6 × $6000 = $36,000.

2. **Express the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups = 20 × 12 = 240 cups.
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( C \).
   - Total cost of cups = 240 × \( C \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, \( 240C = 36,000 - 1,200 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - \( 240C = 34,800 \).
   - \( C = \frac{34,800}{240} \).
   - \( C = 145 \).

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Since there are two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

2. **Egg Production:**
   - Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, so the total eggs from red chickens are \( 3r \).
   - Each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, so the total eggs from white chickens are \( 5(r + 2) \).

3. **Total Eggs Collected:**
   - The total eggs collected per day is 42, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Expand the equation:
     \[
     3r + 5r + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8r + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:

   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   
   Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles:

   So, the number of customers on the second day is:  
   \( 100 + 50 = 150 \) customers.

3. **Third Day:**  
   Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \).

4. **Total Customers Over Three Days:**

287,"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total stars on the flag**: 76 stars.
2. **Stars in the 8-star rows**: There are 3 rows with 8 stars each, so the total number of stars in these rows is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) stars.
3. **Stars in the 6-star rows**: There are 2 rows with 6 stars each, so the total number of stars in these rows is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) stars.
4. **Stars in the 5-star rows**: Let \( x \) be the number of 5-star rows. The total number of stars in these rows is \( 5x \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of stars on the flag:

\[
24 \text{ (from 8-star rows)} + 12 \text{ (from 6-star rows)} + 5x \text{ (from 5-star rows)} = 76
\]

Combine the known quantities:

\[
24 + 12 + 5x = 76
\]

\[
36 + 5x = 76
\]

Subtract 36 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[
5x = 76 - 36
\]

\[
5x = 40
\]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = \frac{40}{5}
\]

\[
x = 8
\]

So, there are **8 rows of 5 stars** on the flag.

1. **Determine the speed of the car in the slow lane:**
   - The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
   - The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, so:
     \[
     \text{Speed of slow car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken by the slow car to travel 480 miles:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

**Given:**
- Total number of students = 200
- The class is split into 3 groups.
- Two of the groups are equal in number.
- The smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
- Then, the smallest group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

**Total number of students:**
\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

**Simplify the equation:**
\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

**Solve for \( x \):**
\[
3x = 200 + 10
\]
\[
3x = 210
\]
\[
x = \frac{210}{3}
\]
\[
x = 70

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of cows.
   - Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2c \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of animals is 60, so:
     \[
     c + 2c = 60
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3c = 60
     \]

3. **Solve for \( c \):**
   \[
   c = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   - So, there are 20 cows.

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   \[
   2c = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]
   - There are 40 chickens.

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**
   - Cows have 4 legs each, so:
     \[
     20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs/cow} = 80 \text{ legs}
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, so:
     \[

     \]
   - Total legs:
     \[

1. **Understand the ratio**: The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.

2. **Let’s define variables**: Let’s assume that Betty has \(5x\) popsicles and Sam has \(6x\) popsicles, where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

3. **Set up the equation**: The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   5x + 6x = 165
   \]

4. **Combine like terms**: 
   \[
   11x = 165
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
   \]

6. **Find the number of popsicles each has**:
   - Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
   - Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

7. **Calculate how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty**:
   \[
   90 - 75 = 15

   - **Shortest trees:** Half of 30 = 15 apples
   - **Average trees:** Let's denote this as \( x \) apples

   So, Joanne's total apples = \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \)

2. **Sister's Apple Gathering:**
   - **Tallest trees:** Twice as many as Joanne = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples
   - **Shortest trees:** Three times as many as Joanne = \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples
   - **Average trees:** 0 apples (since she doesn't take any from the average trees)

   So, sister's total apples = \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \) apples

3. **Combined Total Apples:**
   - Joanne's total + Sister's total = \( (45 + x) + 105 = 150 + x \)
   - According to the problem, the combined total is 500 apples.

   So, \( 150 + x = 500 \)

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - \( x = 500 - 150 \)
   - \( x = 350 \)

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

416,"To solve this problem, we'll set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( C \) = number of camels
- \( D \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. Each camel and dromedary has one head, so the total number of heads is:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]
2. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each, so the total number of humps is:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

Now, we can solve this system of equations.

**Step 1:** Solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[
C = 180 - D
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( C = 180 - D \) into the second equation:
\[
2(180 - D) + D = 304
\]

**Step 3:** Simplify and solve for \( D \):
\[
360 - 2D + D = 304
\]
\[
360 - D = 304
\]
\[
-D = 304 - 360
\]
\[
-D = -56
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

443,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long it took James to complete the run.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's total time
Jon's times for each part of the triathlon are:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Jon's total time is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate James's swim time
James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time:
\[ \text{James's swim time} = 40 \text{ minutes} - (10\% \times 40) \]
\[ \text{James's swim time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Calculate James's bike time
James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
\[ \text{James's bike time} = 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Let James's run time be \( x \) minutes
We need to find \( x \), the time James took to complete the run.

### Step 5: Calculate James's total time
James's total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times:
\[ \text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 6: Jon won by 10 minutes
Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 121 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]

### Step 7: Solve for \( x \)
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

445,"To determine how much change Michael has after buying the hay, let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse runs
The horse runs at a speed of 32 MPH for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, the distance \( d \) the horse runs is:
\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of hay consumed
The horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bale of hay for every mile it runs. For 16 miles, the total amount of hay consumed \( H \) is:
\[
H = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bale/mile} \times 16 \, \text{miles} = 8 \, \text{bales}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay
Each bale of hay costs $3. The total cost \( C \) of the hay is:
\[
C = 8 \, \text{bales} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bale} = 24 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate Michael's total money
Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so his total money \( M \) is:
\[
M = 6 \times 5 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the change
The change \( \Delta \) Michael has after buying the hay is:
\[
\Delta = M - C = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow Cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each item per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow Cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 \]

Finally, to find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, multiply the number of pieces per room by the number of rooms:

505,"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make while spending no more than $24, we need to compare the cost-effectiveness of the two types of wood: 2x4 and 2x8.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per popsicle stick for each type of wood
- **2x4 wood**:  
  - Cost: $4  
  - Number of sticks: 200  
  - Cost per stick: $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick

- **2x8 wood**:  
  - Cost: $6  
  - Number of sticks: 400  
  - Cost per stick: $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

The 2x8 wood is cheaper per stick ($0.015) compared to the 2x4 wood ($0.02).

### Step 2: Maximize the number of sticks by buying the cheaper wood
Since the 2x8 wood is more cost-effective, Frederick should buy as much 2x8 wood as possible within his $24 budget.

- Number of 2x8 pieces he can buy:  
  $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

- Total sticks from 2x8 wood:  
  4 pieces * 400 sticks = 1600 sticks

### Step 3: Check if any remaining budget can be used for 2x4 wood
After buying 4 pieces of 2x8 wood, Frederick spends $24 exactly, so there is no remaining budget to buy 2x4 wood.

### Final Result:
The maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is **1600**.

1. **Tony's picking rate**:  
   Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's picking rate**:  
   Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.  
   So, Bobby's rate = Tony's rate - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's picking rate**:  
   Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.  
   So, Kathy's rate = 2 × Bobby's rate = 2 × 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's picking rate**:  
   Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.  
   So, Ricky's rate = Kathy's rate - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

5. **Total picking rate**:  
   To find the total quarts picked per hour by all four, we add their individual rates:  
   Total = Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Kathy's rate + Ricky's rate

572,"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and compare it to the number of roses Ford grows.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week.
- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
Ford grows 40 roses per week.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of roses Ford lacks per week.
Roses lacking per week = Total roses ordered per week - Roses grown per week
Roses lacking per week = 65 - 40 = 25 roses

### Step 4: Calculate the number of roses Ford lacks per month.
Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
Roses lacking per month = Roses lacking per week × 4
Roses lacking per month = 25 × 4 = 100 roses

1. **Define the smallest angle:**
   
   Let the smallest angle be \( x \) degrees.

2. **Express the other angles in terms of \( x \):**
   
   - The second angle is twice the smallest angle: \( 2x \).
   - The third angle is three times the smallest angle: \( 3x \).

3. **Set up the equation for the sum of angles in a triangle:**
   
   The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
   \[
   x + 2x + 3x = 180

The first mixture consists of:
- \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound of almonds
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts

The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound.

Now, we can solve the system of equations.

From the second equation, we can express \( g \) in terms of \( s \):
\[
g = 20 - s

Substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:

674,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches.

### Step 1: Convert the current height to inches
The current height of the bamboo is 20 feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we convert 20 feet to inches:
\[
20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required growth
The bamboo needs to reach a height of 600 inches. The difference between the desired height and the current height is:
\[
600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed
The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:
\[
\frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
\]

### Final Result
The bamboo will reach a height of 600 inches in **12** days.

675,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.

2. **First Increase in Dogs:**
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs becomes 4 + 8 = 12.
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys in total.
   - He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

3. **Second Increase in Dogs:**
   - After buying the toys, the number of dogs doubles. So, the number of dogs becomes 12 * 2 = 24.
   - James now needs 24 toys in total.
   - He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 newly bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

4. **Decrease in Dogs:**
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs becomes 24 - 3 = 21.
   - James now needs 21 toys in total.
   - He already has 24 toys (4 original + 8 first purchase + 12 second purchase), but since 3 dogs are gone, he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore.

5. **Total Toys Needed:**
   - James initially needed 4 toys.
   - He bought 8 more toys for the first increase.
   - He bought 12 more toys for the second increase.
   - Total toys needed: 4 + 8 + 12 = 24.

However, since 3 dogs are gone, he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore. But the problem asks for the total number of toys James needs, not the final number of toys he has. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 24.

726,"To solve this problem, we need to find the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Convert Topher's shoe length to inches:**
   - Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches.
   - Adding the extra 4 inches, Topher's shoe length in inches is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( B \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.
   - According to the problem, Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe length.
   - This can be written as: 
     \[
     100 = 9B + 10
     \]

3. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     100 - 10 = 9B
     \]
     \[
     90 = 9B
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 9:
     \[
     B = \frac{90}{9} = 10
     \]

So, the length of Bobby's shoe is 10 inches.

### Step 1: Initial Stickers
- **Small Stickers:** 30
- **Large Stickers:** 40

### Step 2: Trade Small Stickers for Large Buttons
- Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
- 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
- Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, but since she is trading for large buttons, we need to consider the conversion rate.
- A large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small stickers can be traded for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

### Step 3: Remaining Small Stickers
- Lorraine started with 30 small stickers and traded 27, so she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

### Step 4: Trade Large Stickers for Buttons
- Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons.
- 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
- Each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons.
- She trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.
- The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons: 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

### Step 5: Total Buttons
- **Large Buttons:** 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
- **Small Buttons:** 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons.

### Final Result
- **Total Buttons:** 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons.

1. **Determine the hiking speed:**
   - The family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour.
   - Distance hiked = speed × time = \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.

3. **Calculate the time spent driving:**
   - Total time spent driving and hiking is 6 hours.
   - Time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.
   - Therefore, time spent driving = \( 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove at 50 miles per hour for 4.5 hours.
   - Distance driven = speed × time = \( 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot:**
   - Total distance = distance driven + distance hiked = \( 225 + 30 = 255 \) miles.

### Scoring System:
1. **Enemies Jumped On**: 10 points per enemy
2. **Berries Collected**: 5 points per berry
3. **Time Left on Timer**: 30 points per second

### Differences in Performance:
1. **Enemies Jumped On**: Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
2. **Berries Collected**: Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
3. **Time Left on Timer**: Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

### Let's define:
- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

### Ava's Performance:
- Enemies Jumped On: \( E + 8 \)
- Berries Collected: \( B + 3 \)
- Time Left on Timer: \( T - 4 \) (since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower)

### Calculating Scores:
1. **Emma's Score**:
   \[
   \text{Emma's Score} = 10E + 5B + 30T
   \]

2. **Ava's Score**:
   \[
   \text{Ava's Score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Ava's Score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Ava's Score} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
   \]

### Difference in Scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Ava's Score} - \text{Emma's Score}

2. **Cost of two pizzas:**  
   Two of the pizzas cost \$30 in total.

3. **Cost of the remaining two pizzas:**  
   Let the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas be \( x \). Since they cost the same amount, the total cost of these two pizzas is \( 2x \).

4. **Set up the equation:**  
   The total cost of all four pizzas is the sum of the cost of the two expensive pizzas and the two cheaper pizzas:
   \[
   30 + 2x = 64

### Step 1: Convert hours to minutes
First, convert the total playing time from hours to minutes:
\[
4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of quarters for each player
- **Jack**: He can play for 20 minutes per quarter. The number of quarters he uses is:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **Two friends (worse players)**: They can play for half as long as Jack, which is 10 minutes per quarter. The number of quarters each of them uses is:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
  \]
  Since there are two such friends, the total quarters for both are:
  \[
  24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **One friend (better player)**: This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 30 minutes per quarter. The number of quarters this friend uses is:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of quarters
Add up the quarters used by all players:
\[
12 \text{ (Jack)} + 48 \text{ (two friends)} + 8 \text{ (one friend)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Assuming each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is:
\[

  \text{Distance cost} = 20 \, \text{miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
  \]

- **Total shipping cost**:
  \[
  \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the refund from Amazon
Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.

- **Refund amount**:
  \[
  \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total loss
Milly's total loss is the sum of the shipping cost and the portion of the book's price that is not refunded.

- **Non-refunded portion of the book's price**:
  \[
  \text{Non-refunded portion} = \$32 - \$24 = \$8.00
  \]

- **Total loss**:

1. **Initial Condition**:  
   On day 0, there are 10 infected people.

2. **Daily Infection Rate**:  
   Each infected person infects 6 others every day. This means the number of new infections each day is proportional to the current number of infected people.

3. **Exponential Growth Formula**:  
   The number of infected people after \( t \) days can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   N(t) = N_0 \times (r)^t
   \]
   where:
   - \( N_0 \) is the initial number of infected people (10),
   - \( r \) is the infection rate per day (each infected person infects 6 others, so \( r = 6 + 1 = 7 \)), and
   - \( t \) is the number of days (3).

4. **Calculation**:  
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   N(3) = 10 \times (7)^3
   \]
   \[
   N(3) = 10 \times 343

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times (since it was thrice as many as Joe's).
- She also mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times (since it was five times as many as Joe's).

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn. So, for \( x \) times, she earned \( 6x \) dollars.
- Kamala paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed her lawn. So, for \( 3x \) times, she earned \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \) dollars.
- Alba paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed her lawn. So, for \( 5x \) times, she earned \( 6 \times 5x = 30x \) dollars.

The total earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[
6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equation for total earnings
Tasha's total earnings from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade were $80. Therefore:
\[
54x + \text{Lemonade Sales} = 80
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
We know that Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times and earned $6 each time, so:

### Step 1: Calculate material for small masks
Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.  
So, the material required per small mask is:  
\[
\frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
\]

For 20 small masks, the total material required is:

   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.
   - The number of red balloons is 20, so \( r = 20 \).

3. **Set up the equation:**

   - Speed of the bus = 60 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the bus = 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 mph × 5 hours = 300 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the car:**
   - Speed of the car = 30 miles per hour
   - Time traveled by the car = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 30 mph × 8 hours = 240 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car

931,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be John's age.
   - Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
   - Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is \( (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Assuming ""Jean"" is a typo and should be ""John,"" the equation is:
   \[
   \text{Peter's age} + \text{Paul's age} + \text{John's age} = 100
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for Peter and Paul:
   \[
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
   \]
   \[
   4J + 20 = 100
   \]

4. **Solve for \( J \):**
   Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   4J = 80
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   J = 20
   \]

5. **Find Peter's age:**
   Peter's age is \( 2J + 10 \):

2. **Pages per inch**: The stack has 100 pages per inch.

Since each sheet of paper has two pages (one on each side), we need to calculate the total number of pages based on the thickness and the pages per inch.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages in the stack
The stack is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch. Therefore, the total number of pages is:

984,"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to calculate how many additional plants she needs to purchase.

### Step 1: Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit
- The width of each plant is 12 inches, which is equivalent to 1 foot.
- The spacing between each plant is 1.5 feet.

### Step 2: Calculate the total space required per plant
Each plant requires space for itself plus the spacing between plants:
- Total space per plant = Width of the plant + Spacing = 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed
- The length of the flower bed is 111 feet.
- The number of plants that can fit is calculated by dividing the total length by the space required per plant:
  \[
  \text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Total space per plant}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet}} = 44.4
  \]
  Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

### Step 4: Determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy
- Pat already owns 17 plants.
- The total number of plants needed is 44.
- Therefore, the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy is:
  \[
  \text{Additional plants} = 44 - 17 = 27

1003,"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the following:

1. **Fixed Cost per Session**: The studio costs $25 per session to rent.
2. **Variable Cost per Student per Session**: It costs $1.50 per student per session.
3. **Number of Students**: There are 10 students.
4. **Number of Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Number of Weeks in a Month**: We assume there are 4 weeks in a month.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost per Session
The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost for all students:
\[
\text{Total Cost per Session} = \text{Fixed Cost} + (\text{Variable Cost per Student} \times \text{Number of Students})
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost per Session} = 25 + (1.50 \times 10) = 25 + 15 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost per Week
The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the total cost per week is:
\[
\text{Total Cost per Week} = \text{Total Cost per Session} \times \text{Number of Sessions per Week}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost per Week} = 40 \times 3 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost per Month
Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the total cost per month is:
\[
\text{Total Cost per Month} = \text{Total Cost per Week} \times \text{Number of Weeks in a Month}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost per Month} = 120 \times 4 = 480
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Expected Earnings
The expected earnings are the total cost per month, as the problem does not specify any revenue or profit margin. Therefore, the expected earnings are equal to the total cost per month.

\[
\text{Expected Earnings} = 480
\]

1. **Base Mining Rate with Bare Hands:**
   - One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with bare hands.

2. **Mining Rate with an Iron Pickaxe:**
   - With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands.
   - So, the mining rate with an iron pickaxe is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.

3. **Mining Rate with a Steel Pickaxe:**
   - With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.

1. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for \$3.
2. The second package offers 4 sandwiches for \$6.

We can calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

- For the first package: 
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\$3}{2} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
  \]

- For the second package:
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\$6}{4} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
  \]

Since the price per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can conclude that the prices are proportional. Therefore, the price per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be \$1.50.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the third package:

1. **Total Loans**: Jim takes out $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years.
2. **Lost Income**: Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had continued working instead of going to college.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Loans
Jim takes out $50,000 per year for 4 years:
\[
\text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Lost Income
Jim could have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years:
\[
\text{Lost Income} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
\]

### Step 3: Total Amount to Recover
The total amount Jim needs to recover is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
\[
\text{Total Amount to Recover} = \text{Total Loans} + \text{Lost Income} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Jim's New Income After College
Jim's income triples after college. His original income was $25,000, so his new income is:
\[
\text{New Income} = 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Additional Income from the Degree
The additional income Jim earns each year due to the degree is:
\[
\text{Additional Income} = \text{New Income} - \text{Original Income} = 75,000 - 25,000 = 50,000
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Time to Recover the Total Amount
To find out how long it will take Jim to recover the total amount, we divide the total amount to recover by the additional income per year:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Amount to Recover}}{\text{Additional Income}} = \frac{300,000}{50,000} = 6

   - There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of days worked is:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - The team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

3. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over 21 days:**
   - Multiply the fraction of a day worked each day by the total number of days:
     \[

   - In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore:

1048,"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Determine the number of years
The car was bought in 2007, and we want to find its price in 2010. The number of years between 2007 and 2010 is:
\[ 2010 - 2007 = 3 \text{ years} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the depreciation factor
The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, so the depreciation factor per year is:
\[ 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \]

### Step 3: Apply the depreciation over 3 years
The price of the car after 3 years can be calculated by multiplying the original price by the depreciation factor raised to the power of the number of years:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the final price
Now, compute the value:
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

### Final Result
The price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Result: } \$9860.78 \]

1. **Calculate the Cost of the Roses:**
   - Jenny buys 15 roses.
   - Roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen (12 roses).
   - Since 15 roses is more than a dozen, she can buy one dozen for $15 and 3 additional roses at $2 each.
   - Cost for the dozen: $15
   - Cost for the additional 3 roses: 3 * $2 = $6
   - Total cost: $15 + $6 = $21

2. **Determine the Amount Paid:**
   - Jenny arrives with five 5-dollar bills.
   - Total amount she has: 5 * $5 = $25

3. **Calculate the Change:**
   - Change = Amount paid - Total cost
   - Change = $25 - $21 = $4

4. **Convert Change to Quarters:**
   - Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $4 to quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters

### Step 1: Calculate the total minutes for regular classes
- John has 6 periods each day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has a total of 8 classes per day.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- He attends classes for 5 days a week.

So, the total minutes for regular classes per week is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the extra learning time on weekends
- John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
- First, we need to find out what \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes is.

The total weekly minutes are 1600 minutes (from regular classes). So:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends 100 minutes on both Saturday and Sunday:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weekly learning time
- Add the regular class time and the extra weekend time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Convert minutes to hours
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

1105,"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for her retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save and then determine how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

### Step 1: Calculate Lauren's Annual Savings
Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary. Her current salary is $100,000.

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Lauren's Annual Retirement Expenses
Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement.

\[
\text{Annual Retirement Expenses} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Retirement Savings Needed
Lauren plans for a retirement period of 20 years. Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is:

\[
\text{Total Retirement Savings Needed} = \text{Annual Retirement Expenses} \times \text{Retirement Period} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Years Needed to Save
Lauren saves \$20,000 each year. To find out how many years she needs to work to save \$800,000:

\[
\text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Total Retirement Savings Needed}}{\text{Annual Savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40

   - After giving away half, Seth has \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers left.

2. **Luis uses half of the stickers and gives the rest to Kris:**
   - Luis uses half of the stickers he received, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \).
   - Luis then gives the remaining \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.

3. **Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives the remaining 7 to Rob:**
   - Kris receives \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers from Luis.
   - Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives 7 to Rob.
   - Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris received is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).

4. **Setting up the equation:**
   - We know that \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
   - To find \( S \), multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     S = 16 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     S = 64
     \]

So, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

1. **Initial Temperatures:**
   - Mug 1: 33 degrees (4 ounces)
   - Mug 2: Unknown temperature (let's call it \( T \) degrees) (1 ounce)

2. **Mixing the Waters:**
   - When Donny pours 4 ounces from Mug 1 and 1 ounce from Mug 2 into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle becomes \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

3. **Final Temperature Calculation:**
   - The final temperature of the mixed water must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.
   - The final temperature \( T_{\text{final}} \) can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures:
     \[
     T_{\text{final}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
     \]
   - We know that \( T_{\text{final}} \geq 40 \), so:
     \[
     \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
     \]

4. **Solving for \( T \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 5:

1. **Identify the probabilities:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. In decimal form, this is \( P_1 = 0.20 \).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. Therefore, its probability of winning is \( P_2 = 3 \times P_1 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

2. **Calculate the combined probability:**
   - Since the two events (winning with the first ticket and winning with the second ticket) are independent, the probability that both events occur is the product of their individual probabilities:

- The total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.
- The total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

The total number of reports received in the week can be expressed as the sum of the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday:

\[

   - Simplify:  
     \( 5B + Y = 37 \).

4. **Express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \):**

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \).
   - So, the new box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the new box:**
   - The new box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod = \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - Since each pod costs $0.10, for $1 you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.

### First Half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

### Second Half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half they score \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
- Team A scores \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) goals.

### Total Goals:
- Team A's total goals: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.

2. **First Statement:**
   - ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""
   - Colin's age seven years from now: \( C + 7 \).
   - Wendy's current age: \( W = 5(C + 7) \).

3. **Second Statement:**
   - ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""
   - Colin's age in 25 years: \( C + 25 \).

The average number of miles walked by the 4 dogs is given as 3 miles per day. The formula for the average is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total miles walked by all dogs}}{\text{Number of dogs}}
\]

We know the average (3 miles) and the number of dogs (4). We can rearrange the formula to find the total miles walked by all dogs:

\[
\text{Total miles walked by all dogs} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs: 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles. Let's denote the miles walked by the last dog as \( x \). The total miles walked by all four dogs can also be expressed as:

\[
1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar
The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:

\[
V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = (6 \, \text{in} \times 6 \, \text{in}) \times 15 \, \text{in} = 36 \, \text{in}^2 \times 15 \, \text{in} = 540 \, \text{in}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar
Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches, and the packing efficiency is 80%. The effective volume occupied by jelly beans is:

\[
\text{Effective volume} = V \times \text{packing efficiency} = 540 \, \text{in}^3 \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{in}^3
\]

The total number of jelly beans \( N \) is:

\[
N = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432 \, \text{in}^3}{0.15 \, \text{in}^3/\text{jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}

### Step 3: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans
Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. The estimated number of red jelly beans \( R_{\text{estimated}} \) is:

\[
R_{\text{estimated}} = N \times 0.30 = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans}

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and Tim's estimate is:

Let:
- \( c \) = number of chickens
- \( w \) = number of cows

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve the system of equations.

**Step 1:** Solve the first equation for \( c \):
\[
c = 20 - w
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( c = 20 - w \) into the second equation:
\[
2(20 - w) + 4w = 70
\]

**Step 3:** Simplify the equation:
\[
