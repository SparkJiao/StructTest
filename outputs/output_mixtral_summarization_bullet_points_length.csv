0,"1. The transport properties of nonlinear, non-equilibrium dynamical systems, such as ratchet systems, are not well understood.
2. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials that can direct the transport of an ensemble of particles.
3. The interest in ratchet systems comes from the possibility of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems.
4. Recent research has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.
5. The behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is sensitive to the system's parameters.
6. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model and found that the current can change direction based on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.
7. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics, but this has been disputed.
8. A study by Barbi and Salerno proposed an alternative origin for current reversal, but their arguments assume ergodicity, which is not always true for chaotic systems.",0
1,"1. The discovery of over 200 extrasolar planets has revealed a wide range of eccentricities, with many having moderate to high eccentricities.
2. Planet-planet scattering and merger scenarios have been proposed to explain the architecture of some extrasolar planetary systems.
3. Interactions with stellar companions can also boost a planet's eccentricity, and the Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in a planet's eccentricity.
4. Of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity, six also have stellar-mass companions in wide binary orbits.
5. Test particle simulations have been used to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six extrasolar planetary systems.
6. The simulations revealed regions in each system where additional planets could remain in stable orbits.
7. The radial-velocity measurements from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) were used to determine the regions in which planets could be detected with 99% confidence.
8. The companion limits were highly varied, with the tightest limits obtained for hd 3651 and hd 45350.
9. The results suggest that there is no evidence for additional planets in the six systems studied.",0
2,"1. The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z decay into fermion pairs with high accuracy. The good agreement between LEP data and SM predictions has constrained new physics at the Z pole.
2. The physics of the Z boson is expected to play a central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Z factory is realized, with generated Z events several orders of magnitude higher than that of LEP. This factory can be achieved in the Gigaz option of the International Linear Collider (ILC).
3. The ILC is a proposed electron-positron collider with tunable energy ranging from 12 to 13 GeV and polarized beams in its first phase. The Gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of the Z boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
4. The high luminosity, cross section at the resonance of the Z boson, and the number of Z events generated in an operational year of Gigaz can improve the sensitivity to the branching ratio of Z decay.
5. The properties of the Z boson, especially its exotic or rare decays, should be investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential in probing new physics.
6. Among the rare Z decays, flavor changing (FC) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics.
7. The Z decay into light Higgs bosons is another type of rare process that was widely studied, and the rates of these decays can be as large as the kinematic forbidden of these decays in the SM.
8. The work extends the previous studies of these decays to some new models and investigates these decays altogether, motivated by recent studies on the singlet extension of the MSSM and the more stringent constraints on the properties of the light Higgs boson.",0
3,"1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles, with their masses expected to be below the TeV range.
2. The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector is an important problem in SUSY phenomenology. In many models, this dynamics is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak scale.
3. If SUSY breaking is mediated by gravity, the structure of SUSY breaking masses of scalars is determined by the Kähler potential. In the no-scale type Kähler potential, the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes.
4. The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory. It is also realized naturally in a five-dimensional setting with two branes, where the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other.
5. In the no-scale scenario, the degrees of freedom of SUSY particle mass spectrum are limited because only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given.
6. Current limits from the lightest Higgs mass and the branching ratio for h → γγ are used to constrain the no-scale scenario. When universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, almost all the parameter region is excluded.
7. When the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale, a relatively large parameter region is allowed. The case of non-universal gaugino masses given at the GUT scale is also important when the higgsino-like neutralino is the LSP.
8. The minimal scenario, where universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, is severely constrained by the cosmological bound and direct search limit at LEP 2. The other two scenarios, where universal gaugino masses are given above the GUT scale or non-universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, are not constrained by the cosmological",0
4,"1. * Colliding plane waves (CPW) can result in spacelike singularities, but this strength is weakened by relative cross polarization prior to collision.
2. * A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) has a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity, which led to a literature focused on horizon stability.
3. * CH formed in spacetimes of CPW was shown to be unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and any such perturbation turns the CH into an essential singularity.
4. * The electromagnetic (EM) field itself weakens the singularity strength in CPW collisions, with pure EM waves having special significance for singularity formation.
5. * A solution by Bell and Szekeres (BS) describes the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves, with a removable singularity in the interaction region but essential curvature singularities on the null boundaries.
6. * A cross-polarized version of the BS (CPBS) solution was found, with regular Weyl scalars in the interaction region but unremoved singularities on the null boundaries.
7. * The paper tests the validity of the Helliwell and Konkowski (HK) conjecture on CH stability using the CPBS solution with various added test fields.
8. * The paper also discusses singularity classifications, the backreaction effect on CH, and presents an exact back reaction calculation for the collision of cross-polarized EM field coupled with scalar field.
9. * The metric for collision of EM waves with cross polarization is analyzed, and the stability of quasiregular (qr) singularities in the incoming region is investigated using geodesics and test EM and scalar field analyses.",0
5,"1. Deep X-ray surveys, such as the CDF-N, have detected normal galaxies with X-ray emission at cosmologically interesting distances. These galaxies contribute significantly to the X-ray background (XRB) and are likely the most numerous extragalactic X-ray sources.
2. Normal galaxies are expected to dominate the number counts at 0.52 keV fluxes of ~10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2. The CDF-N survey has reached the depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies at redshifts up to ~5.
3. The ratio of X-ray luminosity to K-band luminosity in normal galaxies is an indicator of the current level of star formation. Spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies are drawn from catalogs, while photometric redshifts are used for the redshift interval where spectroscopic determination is difficult.
4. The study focuses on galaxies at z~1 due to extensive spectroscopic redshift coverage and superb imaging for morphological studies. The CDF-N data provide extremely deep X-ray coverage over this area.
5. The sample is constructed by filtering galaxies based on optical luminosity and morphology, and excluding galaxies with X-ray detections. The synthetic photometry package synphot in IRAF is used to calculate the X-ray to K-band luminosity ratio.
6. The sample is divided into several bins based on redshift, ensuring a sufficient number of galaxies per bin. The number of galaxies, median redshift, median look-back time, and median optical magnitude are listed for each bin.
7. Stacking analysis of galaxies in the redshift bins results in significant detections in the soft band for all bins up to z~1. The results for two different spiral galaxy SED samples are nearly identical, except for the detection in the highest redshift bin.
8. The X-ray luminosities of individually detected galaxies are generally much higher than those of the stacked galaxies, suggesting that they are atypical of the normal galaxy population. The percentage of radio detections among individually detected galaxies is higher than that among stacked galaxies.
9. The average X-ray luminosity of spiral galaxies in the stacking sample is higher than that of the Shapley et al. (2001) sample, consistent with",0
6,"1. Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with different degrees of non-classicality. 
2. At the weaker end, there are non-separable or entangled states, which cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states.
3. At the stronger end, there are systems that can violate Bell inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality.
4. EPR-steering is a phenomenon where one party can steer the state of another party's system through local measurements.
5. A bipartite state is EPR-steerable if it allows for a demonstration of EPR-steering, and a state is not EPR-steerable if there exists a hybrid LHV-LHS model explaining the Alice-Bob correlations.
6. The logical hierarchy of non-separability, EPR-steerability, and Bell-locality leads to a hierarchy for bipartite states.
7. The interplay of quantum and classical correlations in mixed states produces a richer structure compared to pure states.",0
7,"1. The concept of using an electron's spin to encode binary information was first proposed by an unidentified individual, with Richard Feynman mentioning it in casual conversations around 1985.
2. Spintronic devices may offer advantages such as lower power consumption, reduced susceptibility to noise, and faster operation compared to traditional charge-based devices.
3. In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed.
4. The ground state of the array has an anti-ferromagnetic ordering, with the spin configuration determining the logic state (1 or 0).
5. The system's response to different input configurations is determined by the magnetic field, exchange interaction, and energy differences between triplet and singlet states.
6. A shortcoming of spintronic devices is their inability to ensure unidirectional flow of logic signals, which is essential for classical logic devices.
7. A proposed solution to this problem is the use of clocking, as demonstrated in charge-coupled device arrays, to impose unidirectionality in time.
8. However, implementing this solution in spintronic devices requires a three-phase clock and presents challenges in lithography and energy dissipation.
9. Reversible logic gates, not constrained by the Landauer limit, are a potential solution to the energy dissipation challenge in spin-based classical irreversible logic gates.",0
8,"1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary that transfers mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
• The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors has a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.
• Theoretical models have not been able to accurately reproduce the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
• The minimum period for CVs that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum (AM) is reached at approximately 80 minutes.
2. The probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region.
• The orbital period evolution of CVs reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer expands the star, while thermal relaxation contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius.
• The minimum period occurs where the two corresponding time scales, the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time, are about equal.
• The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital AM losses.
3. The orbital AM loss rate of a CV can be written as the sum of two terms: the systemic AM loss rate and an explicit function of the mass transfer rate.
• The systemic AM loss rate is independent of mass transfer, while the second term is a function of the mass transfer rate.
• The AM is assumed to be lost via mass loss that is axis-symmetrical with respect to an axis fixed at the WD center but perpendicular to the orbital plane.
• The total fraction of mass lost from the secondary that leaves the system is defined as @xmath19, and a fraction of the transferred mass leaves the system with some fraction of the angular momentum it had on leaving the @xmath4 point.
4. The mass transfer rate is seen to decrease with increasing deformation, which can be understood from the functional dependence on orbital period and donor mass in the usual quadrupole formula for the",0
9,"1. Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of galaxies with a highly disturbed intragroup medium due to a complex sequence of interactions and harassment.
* A large-scale intergalactic shock wave has been produced by the high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy with the intergalactic medium of the group.
* The shock-heated gas is responsible for the X-ray emitting gas, and the region is powered by strong shocks, not star formation.
* The main elements of SQ include a primary shock, an intruder galaxy (NGC 7318b), a Seyfert 2 galaxy, and other group members.
2. The discovery of extremely powerful pure rotational H2 line emission from the center of the shock using the Spitzer Space Telescope has sparked intense interest in the SQ system.
* Warm molecular hydrogen emission was found with a line luminosity exceeding the X-ray luminosity from the shock.
* The mid-infrared (MIR) H2 linewidth was resolved, suggesting that the H2-emitting clouds carry a large bulk-kinetic energy, tapping a large percentage of the energy available in the shock.
* A recent model of SQ involving the collision between two inhomogeneous gas flows describes H2 formation out of the multiphase, shocked gas, and an efficient cooling channel for high-speed shocks as an alternative to X-ray emission.
3. Since the SQ detection, several other systems exhibiting similarly strong H2 emission have been discovered.
* A large subset of local 3CR radio galaxies have extremely dominant MIR rotational H2 lines, often seen against a very weak thermal continuum.
* The low AGN and star formation power are insufficient to drive the MIR H2 emission.
* Mechanical heating driven by the radio jet interaction with the host galaxy ISM is the favored mechanism.
4. The study of nearby prototypes may provide valuable insight into the nature of these more distant systems.
* The large scale (~30 kpc) of the SQ shock is well-suited for such a study.
* The authors extend the single pointing observations of SQ to full spectral maps of SQ using the IRS instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope.
* In paper II, they will",0
10,"1. The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, suggesting that at least some SLRIs in the solar system may have been injected by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
* This injection could have occurred as a single event that was spatially heterogeneous, reducing the usefulness of @xmath4al as a spatially homogeneous chronometer for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation.
* However, previous models have shown that initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and small particles.
* Other elements and their isotopes suggest a similarly well-mixed solar nebula, but stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous, possibly due to UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula.
2. Refractory particles in comet 81P/Wild 2, thought to have formed close to the protosun, imply large-scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula.
* MGU disks offer a means to accomplish this early large-scale transport, and are likely to be involved in FU Orionis outbursts experienced by young solar-type stars.
* MGU disk models can easily lead to the high mass accretion rates needed to explain FU Orionis events, and may also offer an alternative mechanism for gas giant planet formation.
* The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is likely to be involved in FU Orionis outbursts, operating in the ionized innermost disk layers and at the disk surfaces.
3. Zhu et al. (2009c, 2010a, b) have constructed one- and two-dimensional (axisymmetric) models of a coupled MGU-MRI mechanism, with MGU slowly leading to a build-up of mass in the innermost disk, which then triggers a rapid MRI instability and an outburst.
* Alternatively, MRI may operate in the outermost",0
11,"1. The analysis searches for new particles with a narrow natural width that decay to dijets, including axigluons, excited states of composite quarks, color octet technirhos, new gauge bosons, and scalar diquarks.
2. Four triggers from run 1a and 1b are used, and dijet mass spectra are combined with integrated luminosities ranging from 0.089 pb@xmath0 to 69.8 pb@xmath0.
3. Jets are defined using a fixed cone clustering algorithm and corrected for detector response, energy lost outside the cone, and underlying event.
* The analysis takes the two highest @xmath15 jets and requires they have pseudorapidity @xmath16 and a cms scattering angle @xmath17| < 2/3.
1. A cut on the pseudorapidity provides uniform acceptance as a function of mass and reduces the QCD background.
2. The dijet mass distribution is presented as a differential cross section in bins of the mass resolution.
3. The data is systematically higher than a prediction from Pythia plus a CDF detector simulation, similar to the inclusive jet spectrum.
4. To search for new particles, the QCD background is determined by fitting the data to a smooth function of three parameters.
5. The analysis notes upward fluctuations near 200 gev / c@xmath1, 550 gev / c@xmath1, and 850 gev / c@xmath1.
6. For narrow resonances, the mass resolution is determined for only one type of new particle because the detector resolution dominates the width.
7. A binned maximum likelihood fit of the data to the background parameterization and the mass resonance shape is performed for each value of new particle mass in 50 gev / c@xmath1 steps.
8. The best fit and 95% confidence level upper limit for a 550 gev / c@xmath1 resonance are displayed.
9. The angular distribution of the fluctuation in the mass region is studied and found to be compatible with both QCD alone and with QCD + 5% excited quark (best fit).
10. The 95% CL upper limit on the cross section for new particles is obtained from the likelihood distribution including experimental systematic uncert",0
12,"1. The first observational evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was discovered when supernovae type Ia (SNIA) were found to be fainter than expected. This has been confirmed by various independent observations, including temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), and gamma-ray bursts.
2. Within the framework of General Relativity, the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, known as dark energy (DE). The nature of this unknown matter field has sparked significant scientific effort to understand its properties. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of the DE driving the current epoch of accelerated expansion, along with a dark matter (DM) component responsible for the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures.
3. The currently favored model, known as Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), is not theoretically satisfactory, as the value of the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than estimates from particle physics. Suggestions have been made that DE could be dynamic and evolve with time, but this introduces the coincidence problem, which questions why the time variation of matter and DE are so similar if their current values are vastly different.
4. Interacting dark sector models have been introduced to address the coincidence problem, with the potential to constrain the DM/DE interaction using observations of the background evolution and the emergence of large-scale structure. These models can also help explain the emergence of galaxies and large-scale structures, as well as the growth of matter density perturbations, which are connected to the anisotropies of the CMB.",0
13,"1. The spectra of Type 1 AGNs show a variety of broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized gas in the vicinity of the central massive object.
2. Broad emission lines like Hβ are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk, and two populations of Type 1 AGNs have been identified based on the width and profile of these lines.
3. Population A has the smallest broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ = 1000-4000 km/s) and includes narrow-line Seyfert 1 sources, while Population B has larger broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ = 4000-12000 km/s) and includes both radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars.
4. Narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are generally considered a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame, except in the case of ""blue outliers"" found in sources with FWHM Hβ = 1500-3500 km/s and weak [OIII].
5. Broad FeII emission has been found in Type 1 quasars, and its profile and strength correlate with that of Hβ, suggesting a common origin in the broad-line region.",0
14,"1. Nuclear multifragmentation is the study of the break-up of atomic nuclei into several fragments, and is being researched both theoretically and experimentally due to its similarities with the liquid-gas phase transition in matter. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995, which identified a wide plateau at around 5 meV temperature lasting from 3 to 10 meV/nucleon excitation energy. This was associated with the possible existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter.
2. However, subsequent experiments by EOS and INDRA using different reactions obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region being absent in the majority of cases. These discrepancies are attributed to the precision of experimental measurements and finite-size effects of the caloric curve, which depend on the reaction type. Recent reevaluations of the ALADIN group concerning the kinetic energies of the emitted neutrons brought corrections of about 10%.
3. Theoretical calculations suggest that for the reactions studied, the equilibrated sources sequence should be the same, indicating the presence of an important nonequilibrium part included in the measured source excitation energies. This nonequilibrium energy may belong to both pre-equilibrium or pre-break-up stages. The SMM calculations also suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy in the case of the 600 meV/nucleon bombarding energy reaction.
4. To accurately distinguish between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies, accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and of the sequential secondary particle emission are necessary. These approaches should strictly obey the constraints of the physical system, which in the case of nuclear multifragmentation are purely microcanonical.",0
15,"1. The solar corona is heated to a temperature of about 12 million kelvins, while the visible surface of the sun is roughly 250 times cooler.
2. Magnetic fields or waves are thought to play a key role in heating the solar corona.
3. The primary energy source for this heating is believed to be in the convection zone below the solar photosphere.
4. The debate is focused on whether the energy to heat the corona comes from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events.
5. Two types of magnetic disturbances in coronal structures can be produced by the interaction of the magnetic field with convective flows in or below the photosphere.
6. High-frequency MHD waves have been sought using the Fe XIV green line at 530.3 nm and the Fe X red line at 637.5 nm.
7. Observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations of the coronal structures have been made using ground-based equipment.
8. A set-up has been described to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations using the mid-sized coronagraph at Lomnicky Peak Observatory.",0
16,"1. Water vapor is an important molecule for interstellar and circumstellar cloud chemistry, and the 6@xmath8 - 5@xmath9 masing transition of H@xmath3O at 22 GHz has been used to trace high excitation gas around star-forming regions and evolved stars. However, the spatial information obtained from this line is limited due to the size of the emitting regions.
2. Other H@xmath3O lines have been detected from ground or airborne-based telescopes, including the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition at 183 GHz, which has been used to map the emission of H@xmath3O at very large spatial scales. The Iso satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared.
3. Mapping of the SgrB2 molecular cloud has shown that water vapor is an ubiquitous molecule in molecular clouds with an abundance of 10@xmath7. Maps of the emission of several H@xmath3O lines in Orion IRC2 have been obtained by Cernicharo et al. (1997a, 1998, 1999).
4. The Iso observations of H@xmath3O have drawbacks, including limited spectral resolution, high opacity of the thermal lines, and poor angular resolution in the far-infrared. An important aid in deriving H@xmath3O abundances could come from the observation of another masing transition of H@xmath3O with similar properties to those of the 183 GHz line.
5. The 325 GHz line of H@xmath3O was observed by Menten et al. (1990b) in the direction of Orion IRC2 and other molecular clouds, but no maps were obtained. The present data show the importance of ground-based observations of H@xmath3O in deriving the abundance of H@xmath3O in molecular clouds.
6. The observations were performed with the 10.4 m telescope of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory at the summit of Mauna Kea (Hawaii) on April 1@xmath22 1998. The receiver",0
17,"1. Threshold nets are obtained by assigning weights to nodes and connecting those with a combined weight above a certain threshold.
2. They can be produced with various degree distributions, including scale-free, and encompass a wide range of architectures.
3. Hagberg et al. exploit the fact that threshold graphs can be encoded by a two-letter sequence, with nodes of two types.
4. New nodes connect to existing nodes based on their type, resulting in a modular structure.
5. Modularity is highlighted by enclosing nodes of the same type in boxes, with links between boxes indicating connections between all nodes in the boxes.
6. Fast algorithms exist to compute structural benchmarks, such as degree distribution, triangles, betweenness centrality, and the graph laplacian.
7. This allows for the design of threshold nets with specific degree distributions and eigenvalues, which are crucial for dynamics and synchronization.
8. The broader class of nets constructed from sequences with deterministic rules of connectivity also exhibits modularity, easily computable structural measures, and high compressibility.
9. Each additional letter in the alphabet increases the diameter of the nets by one, making sequence nets suitable for describing many everyday life complex nets.
10. The ensemble of sequence nets admits a natural ordering, which can be used to explore eigenvalues and other structural properties.",0

2. Bayesian developments of the lasso and its variants have been proposed, using a Gaussian scale mixture to express the Laplace prior.
3. Nonconvex penalization under a parametric Bayesian framework has also been studied, with the local linear approximation (LLA) algorithm being used to derive the LLA penalty with a stable density mixture.",0
19,"1. The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and the possibility of exotic gap symmetry with nodal behavior have led to a renewed effort to find novel experimental probes of order parameter symmetry.
	* One proposal by Sauls and co-workers is to examine the nonlinear current response of d-wave superconductors, which introduces a nonanalyticity in the current-velocity relation at a specific temperature due to the presence of nodes in the order parameter.
	* An anisotropy in the nonlinear current as a function of the direction of the superfluid velocity relative to the position of the node is predicted, which would be reflected in an anisotropy of a term in the inverse penetration depth that is linear in the magnetic field.
	* Early experimental work did not verify these predictions, and it was suggested that impurity scattering or nonlocal effects may be responsible. However, a more recent reanalysis of experiment has claimed to confirm the predictions.
2. An alternative proposal was given by Dahm and Scalapino, who examined the quadratic term in the magnetic response of the penetration depth, which shows a temperature dependence at low temperatures as first discussed by Xu et al.
	* Dahm and Scalapino demonstrated that this upturn would provide a clear and unique signature of the nodes in the d-wave gap and that this feature could be measured directly via microwave intermodulation effects.
	* Experimental verification of this has been obtained, confirming that nonlinear microwave current response can be used as a sensitive probe of issues associated with the order parameter symmetry.
	* This has led to a consideration of further cases of gap anisotropy and the examination of the two-band superconductor MgB2, which is already under scrutiny for possible applications, including passive microwave filter technology.
3. MgB2 was discovered in 2001, and since then, an enormous scientific effort has focused on this material.
	* On the basis of the evidence available, it is now thought that this material may be our best candidate for a classic two-band electron-phonon superconductor, with s-wave pairing in each channel.
	* A heightened interest in two-band superconductivity has led to claims of possible two-band effects in many other materials, both old and new",0
20,"1. The 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is a well-performing classifier for time series data, outperforming other methods like SVM, ANN, and decision tree.
2. The selection of an appropriate distance measure is crucial for 1-NN classification, with the DTW distance being more suitable for time series data than the commonly used Euclidean distance.
3. The Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band) was initially introduced to speed up DTW calculation and later used as a global constraint, with its width affecting classification accuracy.
4. The Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band) generalizes the global constraint model and allows for adjustments according to each class of data, using a hill climbing search algorithm for discovery.
5. Overfitting is a problem with the R-K band learning algorithm, as it uses an accuracy metric as a heuristic function.
6. The proposed novel learning algorithms, band boundary extraction and iterative learning, address overfitting and adjust band structures to improve classification accuracy.
7. The 1-NN with DTW distance and the discovered band is used for unlabeled data classification, with a lower bound (lb\_keogh) used to speed up the process.
8. The novel learning algorithms are based on four fundamental concepts: DTW distance, S-C band, R-K band, and silhouette index.",0
21,"1. The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles has been successful in describing nature at the electroweak scale, and the recent discovery of a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson further strengthens its correctness.
2. However, there is an anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) that has consistently shown a discrepancy between experimental measurements and SM predictions.
3. This discrepancy has led to the possibility of new physics beyond the SM, particularly in the muon sector, with new particles and interactions.
4. The paper explores the possibility of a new gauge interaction for the muon beyond the SM.
5. The SM Lagrangian contains terms that contribute to lepton masses, with the neutrino mass determined by Yukawa couplings, Majorana masses, and seesaw mechanism.
6. The seesaw mechanism provides the observed order one neutrino mixing if the Majorana masses are of the same order.
7. Interactions that break lepton symmetry and baryon asymmetry are discussed, with the sphaleron process being efficient at the early universe by the finite temperature.
8. A condition is calculated for the washout not to occur, with the sphaleron process being efficient only at the temperature above the electroweak scale.
9. The decay rate of right-handed neutrinos is given, which is efficient around a certain temperature, and they decay before the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis begins and do not affect it.",0

3. * The absorption of the pump beam is always noticeable, even for small powers, because a vast amount of atoms are in the ground state and any excitation to the last step of the transition will be noticeable.
4. * The spectra do not show a Doppler background due to the lack of an equilibrium thermal population in the intermediate state, and the method is expected to stimulate further experimental and theoretical work in excited atomic states.",0
50,"1. Central exclusive production (CEP) is a process at the LHC where protons remain intact and a central system is separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap, which is constrained to be in a color singlet state.
* Observation of any particle in the CEP channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers and allow for mass measurement regardless of decay products.
2. Proposals exist to install forward proton detectors at the LHC, such as the FP420 collaboration, which aims to install detectors 420m from the interaction points to detect central systems in the approximate mass range of 70 GeV to 1 GeV.
* Additional proposals suggest upgrading the capabilities of ATLAS and CMS to detect protons in the 220m region, which would extend the accessible mass range when used in conjunction with 420m detectors.
3. The paper focuses on the CEP of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and a Supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson, with a mass of 120 GeV, in the dominant decay channel of H→b\bar{b}, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches at the LHC.
* The CEP process is suppressed by a factor, making the H→b\bar{b} decay channel observable at the LHC in certain scenarios if appropriate proton tagging detectors are installed.
4. The proposed forward detector upgrades at 220m and 420m at ATLAS and CMS include a simulation of the acceptance of the detectors.
* The predicted signal cross sections and background processes are discussed, with a simulated analysis performed for a 120 GeV SM Higgs boson, including an estimation of the detector acceptance and smearing effects and level 1 trigger strategies.
5. The acceptance of the forward detectors is critical to this analysis, as it determines the smallest measurable energy loss of the outgoing protons and imposes an upper limit on the measurable momentum loss of the protons.
* The distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam depends primarily on the beam size at each detector location, with the closest distance given by d=σ+0.5mm, where σ is the Gaussian beam size at the detector",0
51,"1. The zero-field Hall effect in chiral p-wave superconductors (SCs) has been studied extensively due to the broken time-reversal symmetry, which allows for a nonzero Hall conductivity.
2. Spontaneous Hall effect can arise from the intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs and spontaneous surface current, as well as from impurity effects or multiband SC structure.
3. In this work, the authors investigate the zero-field Hall effect in a chiral p-wave SC originating from vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition.
4. In two-dimensional superfluid or SC films, quantized vortices are topological defects in the condensates, and their dynamics have been crucial in understanding 2D phase transition phenomena.
5. The KT transition is related to the unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs across a transition temperature, and the renormalization of the logarithmic vortex-antivortex interaction is used to describe the static screening of pair interaction.
6. The authors combine the static theory with a dynamical description of vortex motion to analyze the effect on the phase transition, resulting in a broadening transition observed in superfluid films and charged fermi systems.
7. The authors suggest that the KT transition in a broken time-reversal symmetry state, such as in superconducting Sr2RuO4 or He-A phase thin film, could have physical consequences worth exploring.
8. The authors also discuss the contribution of free vortex motion and the resulting total conductivity tensor in the chiral p-wave pairing state.",0

Its kinematics suggest a cored DM density profile, which is different from the cusped profile predicted by cold dark matter (CDM) simulations.
* Recent studies have shown that the rotation curves (RCs) of dwarf galaxies are better fitted by a DM halo with a constant density core than by one that is centrally peaked. The velocity field of DDO 47, for example, is best fitted if the DM halo is cored.
* The Orion dwarf galaxy has an extended disk and is one of the few known galaxies whose kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored profile. This makes it a critical system for investigating the nature of the DM particle and the evolution of DM halos.
* The Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) scenario accounts for the evidence that RCs of spiral galaxies are inconsistent with the corresponding distribution of luminous matter. It advocates that the gravitational force at low accelerations leaves the standard Newtonian regime to enter a very different one, without requiring the existence of a dark halo made by massive collisionless elementary particles.
2. The Orion dwarf galaxy has a favorable inclination, very regular gas kinematics, a small asymmetric drift correction, a well-understood baryonic matter distribution, and a large discrepancy between luminous and dynamical mass. These characteristics make this system a decisive benchmark for the MOND formalism and a promising target for further detailed studies.
* The distance to the Orion dwarf galaxy is estimated to be 5.4@xmath41.0 mpc, but it remains a significant source of uncertainty. The intrinsic uncertainty in the brightest stars method used to estimate the distance may allow a distance ambiguity much larger than the formal errors estimated.
* A direct measurement of the distance, for example, infrared observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, would allow a direct distance measurement via the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch.
* The kinematic data can be reproduced in the MOND formalism if significant adjustments of the distance and/or value of the gas mass are allowed. However, the present interfer",0

2. In the antiferromagnetic ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are crucial in both two and three dimensions, significantly reducing the zero-temperature order parameter and Néel temperature.
3. Recent interest has focused on spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet.
4. A new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections has been developed, applicable in the whole range of interaction strength.

56,"1. The study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory, particularly in cosmology, has gained significant attention due to the success of inflation in explaining the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe. With observations now able to test the detailed predictions of specific inflationary models, the focus has shifted towards understanding inflation and its dynamics.
* One area of interest is the dynamics of multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation. These models can lead to features unavailable in single-field models, such as hybrid inflation models.
* The subsequent phase of energy transfer between the inflaton and other degrees of freedom after inflation has also been intensely studied. The inflaton can decay through perturbative processes and non-perturbative parametric amplification, leading to explosive particle production and efficient reheating of the universe.
* Both hybrid inflation and reheating models involve the coupling of two or more dynamical, interacting scalar fields. An important aspect of such systems is the possibility of mixing between the fields, which can significantly affect the dynamics of the system.
2. The renormalization of time evolution equations in single-field models has been understood for several years. However, hybrid models and the dynamics of reheating typically include processes such as spinodal decomposition and parametric amplification, which require the inclusion of quantum effects beyond the tree level.
* Going beyond tree level brings in the issue of renormalization. The problem of renormalization of time evolution equations in single-field models was understood several years ago, with methods such as the WKB expansion and adiabatic methods being used to extract the divergences of the theory.
* In contrast, the renormalization of time evolution equations in multi-field models is more complex. A method proposed by Baacke et al. in 1996 uses dimensional regularization to extract the divergences of the theory, which can be extended for coupled systems.
* This procedure will be used in the paper, which works in the context of a closed time path formalism appropriate for following the time-dependent evolution of the system. The in-vacuum plays a predominant role, with quantities being tracked by their in-in expectation values.
3. The paper focuses on the two-field case, which is often encountered in inflationary models. The physical applications presented in the next section are both in this category.

2. A viable WIMP dark matter candidate can be accommodated in models beyond the Standard Model (SM) by introducing an inert scalar field.
3. Neutrino oscillation measurements have confirmed that neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses, which may indicate that neutrinos are of Majorana type.
4. Many models have been proposed to explain tiny neutrino masses, with the seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) being the simplest ways.
5. However, these scenarios do not contain a DM candidate, but in some models where tiny neutrino masses are generated by higher orders of perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained.
6. In the HTM, Majorana masses for neutrinos are generated via the Yukawa interaction with a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) of an SU(2) triplet scalar field with hypercharge of 1.
7. The direct information on the neutrino mass matrix can be extracted from the decay of the doubly charged component of the triplet field if it is light enough to be produced at collider experiments.

This design allows for the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling, which arises from the dependence of the resonator's extrinsic losses on mechanical motion.
2. The design is shown to be effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, but the paper also explores other possibilities for investigating the effects of strong reactive coupling that do not depend on cooling.
3. The nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields is examined, and reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting is reported.
4. The system's behavior is studied by scanning the stokes laser, and it is found that the cavity-waveguide dispersive and reactive coupling strength can be described by the quantities G and J, respectively.
5. The response of the system is shown to be especially significant when the stokes laser corresponds to a sideband, and the normal mode splitting is found to be solely due to the reactive coupling. The output fields are shown to depend on the behavior of the roots of the system's characteristic equation, and reactive coupling can lead to the appearance of normal mode splitting in the output stokes field.",0

2. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase, which is proposed to be unstable with respect to the formation of particle-particle Cooper pairs.
3. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the charge neutrality condition and chemical equilibrium can induce a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks.
4. The Cooper pairing will eventually be destroyed with the increase of mismatch, leading to a first-order phase transition or a spatial non-uniform Loff state.
5. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system, and the mixed phase can be favored if the surface tension is small.

63," * The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is a widely accepted theory for the melting phase transition of two-dimensional systems, which involves two separate, continuous transitions as a solid transforms into a liquid in quasi-equilibrium steps. The theory is compatible with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids the existence of exact long-range positional order in 2D for a wide range of pair potentials at finite temperatures. However, the theory assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which contradicts observations of alignment and accumulation of dislocations into small angle domain walls.
* Recent developments in the fabrication of 2D materials have led to renewed interest in the KTHNY theory. Experimental and simulation results have shown a variety of phase transition behaviors, including first-order, second-order, and KTHNY-like transitions, in different systems with various pair interactions. These include hard-sphere (disk), Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, dipole-dipole, and Debye-Hückel (screened Coulomb or Yukawa) inter-particle interactions. The range of the potential and deviation from the mathematically perfect 2D plane have been found to affect the formation of the hexatic phase. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of 2D Lennard-Jones systems have revealed the metastable nature of the hexatic phase, which may explain the discrepancies in previous studies.",0

3. Accurate planetary radii are crucial for understanding the distribution of planetary structures, especially for distinguishing between ""rocky"" and ""non-rocky"" planets.
4. The Kepler mission has followed up on candidates with spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging, but only half of the candidates have been observed due to the brightness distribution of the stars.
5. The presence of stellar companions can change observed transit depths and planetary radii, potentially introducing systematic uncertainties in occurrence rate distributions.
6. Undetected stellar companions can lead to misclassifications of planet sizes, as seen with hot Jupiters, where 30% were classified as smaller planets due to unaccounted transit dilution.

2. * Mapping the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission is impossible with present technology due to the weak line caused by the small transition probability.
3. * The identification of DLAs as absorbers in background QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, but the lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground.
4. * There are few known DLAs whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present-day radio telescopes due to the expansion of the universe.
5. * Observers often resort to optical wavelengths to study DLAs, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been mostly unsuccessful.

	* The initial phases of a star cluster's life consist of a combination of gas and stars.
	* However, stellar winds and supernova explosions can remove the gas within the cluster, causing a rapid change in gravitational potential energy.
2. The removal of gas from a star cluster can result in a cluster that is far from equilibrium, with significant effects on its internal dynamics.
	* This process is well understood theoretically, but its effects have not been considered in many observational studies of young massive star clusters.
	* Some studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by measuring the velocity dispersion and half-mass radius, assuming virial equilibrium.
3. However, there is disagreement in the results of these studies, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs.
	* Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, with all clusters older than 1100 Myr being well fit by Kroupa or Salpeter IMFs, while the youngest clusters showed a significant scatter.
	* They suggest that this is due to the youngest (tens of Myr) clusters being out of equilibrium, undercutting the assumption of virial equilibrium needed for such studies.

2. Theoretically, it is proposed that a thermodynamic transition triggers the transition from a liquid to a glassy state, with only one minimum-energy basin accessible at the Kauzmann temperature.
3. However, simulations of polydisperse hard-core disks have failed to detect any evidence of a thermodynamic transition, leading to questions about the discrepancies between hard-disk and soft-sphere models.

70,"1. Dyadic data is common in psychosocial and behavioral studies, with many social phenomena being interpersonal in nature. This means that related observations refer to both individuals in the dyadic relationship, and the attributes and behaviors of one dyad member can impact the outcome of the other.
	* In longitudinal dyadic data, repeatedly measuring dyads can result in two complications: within-dyad correlation and within-subject correlation. It is important to account for these correlations simultaneously to ensure valid analysis results.
	* Longitudinal dyadic data is also prone to the missing data problem caused by dropout, where subjects are lost to follow-up and their responses are not observed thereafter. In psychosocial dyadic studies, dropouts are often nonignorable or informative, leading to biased estimates if conventional statistical methods are used.
	* There is extensive literature on statistical modeling of nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal studies, with two broad classes of likelihood-based nonignorable models: selection models and pattern mixture models. Other likelihood-based and estimation equation approaches have also been proposed. However, the nonignorable dropout problem has not been addressed in the context of longitudinal dyadic data, and the interdependence structure within dyads brings new challenges to this missing data problem.
2. A fully Bayesian approach to deal with longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts based on a selection model is proposed. This approach models each subject's longitudinal measurement process using a transition model that includes both the patient's and spouse's characteristics as covariates to capture the interdependence between patients and their spouses.
	* A dyad-specific random effect is introduced into the transition model to account for the within-dyad correlation. To accommodate nonignorable dropouts, a selection model approach is taken by directly modeling the relationship between the dropout process and missing outcomes using a discrete time survival model.
	* The proposed Bayesian selection-model-based approach for longitudinal dyad data with informative nonresponse is presented, along with estimation procedures using a Gibbs sampler. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

	* In 1948, H. B. G. Casimir predicted that two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other due to a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation.
	* The force arises because the plates act as a cavity where only the electromagnetic modes that have nodes on both the walls can exist.
	* The zero-point energy per unit area is smaller when the plates are kept at close distance than when they are at infinite separation, causing the plates to attract each other to reduce the energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.
2. E. M. Lifshitz, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii, and L. P. Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics.
	* The force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions can be derived according to an analytical formula that relates the Helmholtz free energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field to the dielectric functions of the interacting materials and of the medium in which they are immersed.
	* At very short distances, Lifshitz's theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force.
	* At larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction that in the case of two ideal metals in vacuum reduces to Casimir's result.
3. Lifshitz's equation also shows that two plates made out of the same material always attract, regardless of the choice of the intervening medium.
	* For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed.
	* While the force is always attractive in vacuum, there are situations for which a properly chosen liquid will cause the two plates to repel each other.
	* One of the limitations of Lifshitz's theory is the assumption that the dielectric properties of the interacting materials are isotropic.

2. Current patching systems and reputation models can help mitigate passive P2P worm attacks, but active P2P worms require more sophisticated defense mechanisms.
• The proposed holistic immunity system involves electing a small subset of P2P overlay nodes, called phagocytes, which are responsible for detecting and mitigating active P2P worm attacks.

3. Researchers have been searching for circumstellar gas phase absorption in debris disks, but only a few have shown gas phase absorption, such as HD 181327, due to its disk morphology and edge-on orientation.
4. The Spitzer Space Telescope observed HD 32297, HD 85905, HR 10, and AU Mic, but did not find strong infrared excesses, although optical monitoring campaigns showed gas variability.
5. The magnitude of circumstellar absorption in these systems is lower than observed toward HD 181327, and long monitoring campaigns of HD 181327 found significant short-term absorption variability.
6. The variability can be explained by gas clouds very close to the star, caused by evaporating, star-grazing, km-sized objects, and a stable absorption component is also detected.
7. The stable absorption component is likely caused by intervening circumstellar or interstellar gas, and measuring the interstellar medium along the line of sight is critical to characterizing any contaminating ISM absorption.
8. The debris disk surrounding HD 32297 has an edge-on orientation, making it an ideal target for gas phase absorption measurements, and observations of the D doublet were made over several epochs.",0

- The text discusses the concept of quantum gravity and its effects on the Planck era of the universe, with a focus on the modifications of quantities such as Planck time, length, mass, energy, density, effective number density, and entropy.

They find that the GUP extends smoothly to the HUP and can lead to modified Planck quantities under specific circumstances.",0

This scheme enables the solution of the Dirac equation within a limited region of a larger system, with the influence of the rest of the system taken into account by adding an energy-dependent non-local potential. The method has been successfully applied to various problems in surface electronic structure, such as image states, surface states, static and dynamic screening, atomic adsorption and scattering, surface optical response, and field emission.
2. The embedding scheme has also been extended to include relativistic effects, which are significant in materials containing heavier elements. These effects can lead to shifts in inner core levels and valence bands, as well as spin-orbit splitting. The embedding scheme has been used to study a diverse range of problems, including photoemission, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, hyperfine interactions, and magnetotransport. The scheme has particular advantages, such as the ability to include extended substrates for surface and interface calculations, the study of isolated point defects in solids, and the flexibility to perform full-potential studies with relative ease.",0

The size of these dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths. Semiclassical methods have been used to treat these systems successfully, providing approximate solutions in terms of the properties of the corresponding classical system, which is an open dielectric billiard. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics.
2. The text also mentions the use of trace formulas, which relate the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system. A trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators has been developed and tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and with polymer microlasers of various shapes. However, the text notes that typical microlasers are three-dimensional (3D) systems, and while trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators. The main reason for this is the difficulty of the numerical solution of the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities.",0

The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) can radiate around 10^47 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.6 kHz. The rate of DNS coalescence is another crucial factor in determining their potential as GW sources. Despite previous work, uncertainties persist in estimating the DNS coalescence rate.
* Using the estimated DNS merging rate from a previous study, the GW background spectrum produced by these coalescences has been calculated. Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods were performed to determine the critical redshift at which the duty cycle condition required for a continuous background is satisfied. The study focuses on the last few thousand seconds before the last stable orbit is reached, where more than 96% of the GW energy is released.
* The signal frequency is in the range of 10-1500 Hz, covered by ground-based interferometers. The simulations were conducted using the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and the probability distribution of the coalescence timescale. The resulting distribution of the number of coalescences as a function of redshift was shown for both SFR1 and SFR2, while the corresponding coalescence rate per redshift interval was also presented. The coalescence rate does not fall to zero at a specific redshift due to a non-negligible fraction of coalescences occurring later than expected.

81,"1. Diffusive shock acceleration is a well-studied phenomenon, but some issues like the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock are still being debated. This backreaction changes the spectrum of particles and the structure of the shock, making it a nonlinear problem.
2. There are three main approaches to account for this backreaction: numerical simulations, fluid approach, and analytical methods. The fluid approach, which treats cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, allows for the calculation of the thermodynamics of modified shocks but does not provide information about the spectrum of accelerated particles.
3. Analytical methods, on the other hand, can help understand the physics of nonlinear effects in a way that simulations may not always achieve due to their complexity. A perturbative approach and an assumption-based approach have been proposed, with the latter avoiding many limitations of previous approaches.
4. Numerical simulations have shown that even a small fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas can channel a significant part of the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid, making the test particle approach unsuitable. The most visible effects of the backreaction appear in the spectrum of accelerated particles, which shows a peculiar flattening at the highest energies.
5. While several calculations exist of nonlinear effects in shock acceleration for quasi-monochromatic particles injected at a shock surface, there is no description of how these effects appear when the shock propagates in a medium with preaccelerated particles. The backreaction can severely affect the process of re-energization of preaccelerated particles.
6. The paper discusses the first analytical treatment of shock acceleration in the presence of seed nonthermal particles, with the inclusion of their nonlinear backreaction on the shock. The authors present a generalization of the analytical method introduced in [xcite] to describe the nonlinear shock acceleration with monochromatic injection of quasi-thermal particles.
7. Nonlinear effects in shock acceleration can result in multiple solutions in certain regions of the parameter space, resembling critical systems. A two-fluid approach has been used to demonstrate that when three solutions appear, the one with intermediate efficiency for particle acceleration is unstable to corrugations in the shock structure and emission of acoustic waves.",0

* The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, but it faces the cosmological constant problem.
* Over the past decade, various dark energy models and modified gravity theories have been proposed to explain the acceleration.
2. * Teleparallel gravity is a modified gravity theory that uses the Weitzenböck connection instead of the Levi-Civita connection.
* It is equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but is based on torsion instead of curvature.
* Teleparallel gravity can be used to construct various gravitational modifications based on torsion, such as f(T) gravity.
3. * f(T) gravity is a modified gravity theory that generalizes the teleparallel action by introducing an arbitrary function of the Weitzenböck scalar.
* It has second-order field equations, making it simpler than other extended gravity theories.
* f(T) gravity can represent an alternative to inflationary models and effective dark energy models.
4. * Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is a crucial test for cosmological models, as it provides constraints on the energy density of the universe during the first few minutes.

2. Several protocols have been proposed for this network, including traditional two-way relaying, time division broadcast (TDBC), and multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocols.
3. The TDBC protocol combines the relay-to-user phases into one broadcast phase, while the MABC protocol combines the user-to-relay phases into one multiple-access phase.

5. The authors propose a protocol that utilizes all available degrees of freedom of the three-node half-duplex bidirectional relay network with fading.
6. The protocol selects the optimal transmission mode from six possible modes and allocates the optimal powers to the nodes transmitting in the selected mode.

2. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB accurately provides the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
3. The actual densities of matter and radiation are not required for the calculation, only their ratio.
4. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, determines the acoustic peak method.
5. The sound horizon depends on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, with the latter being insensitive to the cosmology.
6. The baryon-to-photon ratio is precisely measured in the CMB power spectrum, and the potential envelope measurements robustly constrain equality.
7. The acoustic oscillations method can deal with uncertainties in the matter density if the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well-measured, and the CMB anisotropies have good leverage on this quantity.",0
85,"1. Recent experiments have provided evidence for neutrino oscillations, suggesting non-zero neutrino masses. This has led to interest in determining neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles, which could help infer the neutrino mass matrix and potentially lead to a more fundamental theory beyond the Standard Model.
2. A plausible ansatz for the 3-generation neutrino mass matrix is proposed and its consequences are investigated. The neutrinos are represented by 2-component spinors, and the mass matrix is assumed to be hermitian. This ansatz can be motivated from an SO(10) grand unified model, and it corresponds to the well-known approximate signature of grand unification.
3. In SO(10) grand unification, each generation contains one light massive two-component neutrino and a very heavy one. The effective neutrino mass matrix takes the form of equation (1.1), where the second term is generally considered to dominate. However, the present derivation assumes the first term to be dominant, which requires the seesaw term to be negligible.
4. The SO(10) grand unification model includes Higgs mesons that contribute to fermion masses at tree level. The down quark, charged lepton, and light neutrino mass matrices are given by equation (2.1), where the matrices s(10), a(120), and s(126) are of the yukawa type and couple the fermions to the 10, 120, and 126 Higgs mesons, respectively.
5. The mass matrices are essentially unrestricted complex ones, but assuming they are hermitian allows for a more straightforward analysis. In this case, the mass matrices can be brought to diagonal form by unitary transformations, and the right-hand side of equation (2.3) can be evaluated to yield equation (2.6), which is a good approximation even if the cancellation is not perfect.",0

* Many real-world networks, including sexual contact networks, show a power-law degree distribution and are scale-free.
* Epidemics propagate faster in scale-free networks than in single-scale networks, and simulating the spread of diseases on these networks can provide insights on how to prevent and control them.
2. The Barabasi-Albert (BA) algorithm generates scale-free networks with distinct structural properties, such as being more centralized and efficient than networks generated by other methods.
* The BA algorithm was used to generate networks with varying numbers of vertices, edges, and directionality.
* The degree distribution from BA networks was used as input to build other networks following different algorithms, resulting in distinct structural properties.
3. The networks generated by the Molloy-Reed (MR) and Kalisky algorithms have intermediate characteristics between the MB and BA models.
* The MB algorithm generates decentralized networks with a larger number of components, a smaller giant component size, and low efficiency compared to the centralized and efficient BA networks.
* The other three models (MA, MB, and Kalisky) generate networks with intermediate characteristics between MB and BA models.
4. The spread of diseases on the network was simulated using the SI and SIS epidemic models.
* The SI model assumes that a susceptible vertex can get infected and return to the susceptible state after the infectious period.
* The SIS model assumes that an infected vertex remains infected until the end of the simulation.
5. The simulations were carried out for hypothetical acute and chronic diseases with different values of the probability of disease spread.
* The prevalence of the simulated disease was calculated for each time step and averaged for each network.
* The average prevalence of the network models was calculated after grouping the simulations by network algorithm.
6. The results showed that the disease spreads independently of the value of the probability of disease spread in undirected networks.

The parameter @xmath0, which determines the strength of the gravitational field, presents the most obstacles. For certain ranges of @xmath0, LC describes the spacetime of an infinite line mass or a cylinder, but its interpretation for other values of @xmath0 is unclear.
* The absence of circular test particle orbits for certain @xmath0 values and the fact that most known material sources for LC require a minimum @xmath0 value led to the belief that LC describes the field of a cylinder only for specific @xmath0 ranges. However, interior solutions matching to LC exist for all @xmath0 values, and the absence of circular test particle orbits could be due to the centrifugal force required to balance gravitational attraction, which may imply velocities greater than the speed of light.",0

2. Quantum channels can be parametrized by a vector with multiple components, and the goal of channel estimation is to specify the parameter vector.
3. The protocol for estimating the properties of a quantum channel involves Alice and Bob agreeing on a set of quantum states, which Alice prepares and sends through the channel.
4. Bob then performs measurements on the received states and deduces an estimated vector that should be as close as possible to the underlying parameter vector of the quantum channel.
5. The quality of channel estimation protocols can be quantified using statistical and fidelity errors.
6. The fidelity error is a more general cost function that is independent of any specifications of the quantum channel.

The study aims to establish a more complete mathematical model for phenomenology based on the energy dependence of single-particle spectra and integral densities and 2D angular correlations.

• The study addresses several issues, including the connection between centrality and the low-x gluon transverse structure of the proton, the nature and systematics of the UE, the systematics of minimum-bias dijet production, and the possible existence and phenomenology of a nonjet azimuth quadrupole component in 2D angular correlations.

• The study presents a three-component model for soft, hard, and nonjet quadrupole components and explores possible correspondence with centrality, UE structure, dijet production, and the partonic structure of projectile protons.

• The article also discusses systematic uncertainties, same-side ""ridge"" properties, and the role of minijets in the UE.

2. The text discusses the role of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data in interpreting the concentration of low-x gluons at small radius in the proton and its correlation with centrality, soft hadron production, and dijet production. The study also discusses the assumption that the conventionally defined transverse region (TR) on azimuth includes no contribution from a triggered dijet.

• The study finds that most dijets emerge from low-multiplicity collisions and that a hijing Monte Carlo model based on pythia fails to describe RHIC and LHC data due to the eikonal-model assumption.

• The study also finds that the eikonal approximation is invalid and that centrality is not a useful concept for collisions, as the dijet production trend is inconsistent with an eikonal approximation for collisions.

- Left-handed metamaterials (LHMs) have attracted significant attention due to their negative indices of refraction and potential applications in modern optics and microelectronics. They can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, and yield slow light propagation. Additionally, LHMs suppress Anderson localization in one-dimensional (1D) disordered systems, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths.
- Researchers have reported a sixth power dependence of the localization length with wavelength under refractive-index disorder, instead of the well-known quadratic asymptotic behavior. The suppression of Anderson localization has also been observed in 1D disordered metamaterials combining oblique incidence and dispersion. A fourth-order perturbation theory has been developed to address non-conventional Anderson localization in bilayered periodic-on-average structures.
- The article discusses the numerical calculation of the localization length of light for a 1D arrangement of layers with alternating refractive indices and thicknesses. Disorder is introduced by changing the position of the layer boundaries while maintaining the same refraction indices. Two structures are analyzed: homogeneous stacks (h) composed entirely of traditional right-handed materials (RHMs) with positive indices of refraction, and mixed stacks (m) with alternating layers of left- and right-handed materials.
- The localization length is found to be modulated by the corresponding bands in weakly disordered systems, and this modulation decreases as the disorder increases. For low-disordered m stacks and wavelengths much greater than the grating period, the localization length depends linearly on the wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.",0

The rest is 23% dark matter and 73% dark energy, whose nature is unknown. Dark matter allows for the explanation of the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of visible matter. It also plays a crucial role in the formation of large structures by pulling in ordinary matter through gravitational collapse.
2. Dark matter is thought to be non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation, and is therefore referred to as cold dark matter (CDM). There is no explanation for dark matter or dark energy within the standard model of particle physics, but extensions to the model provide promising candidates for dark matter particles.
3. The distribution of dark matter in galaxies is not well-explained by CDM simulations, which predict a central density peak and an overabundance of satellite galaxies. The observed rotation curves of galaxies, which become flat at large distances from the center, suggest the presence of a massive, invisible halo of dark matter.
4. Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a recipe that accurately predicts the rotation curves of many galaxies using a single free parameter. It suggests that the force of gravity is stronger in regions of weak gravitational acceleration, which could be explained by a modification of the law of gravity or by a modification of inertia.
5. The theory of TeVeS (Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity) is a relativistic extension of MOND that accurately predicts the motion of stars in galaxies, but has difficulties with the motion of galaxies in clusters and the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background. An alternative approach is to assume the existence of a new form of dark matter with different properties than CDM, which would explain the phenomena attributed to MOND while preserving the standard law of gravity.",0

2. Theoretical studies have also explored the possibility of half-metallic behavior in ordered zb compounds of transition metals with p, As, Sb, S, Se, and Te elements.
	* These studies have found that the half-metallic ferromagnetic character of these compounds is preserved over a wide range of lattice parameters and for transition element-terminated (001) surfaces.

They have a power law energy spectrum that decreases as the cube of the primary energy and are isotropically distributed in space for energies above a few tens of GeV. The highest energy events detected, however, do not follow this trend and present a challenge to theory.
* The origin of these high-energy events is not well understood, and they could be protons, photons, or iron nuclei. If they are protons, they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background over distances of order 50 Mpc, producing a cutoff in the cosmic ray spectrum known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. However, no such features are seen in the observed cosmic ray spectrum.
* Alternative theories have been proposed to explain these high-energy events, including annihilation of topological defects created in the early universe, decay of heavy relics, non-thermal particles that couple to gravity, or annihilation of relic neutrinos with messenger neutrinos coming from remote places.
* The composition of cosmic rays is important for distinguishing between these different scenarios. If the observed particles are accelerated, they can reach higher energies if the accelerated particles have large charge. If they are decay products of other particles, they will have a very different composition, dominated by photons and neutrinos.",0

2. Atoms can be cooled and trapped in these optical lattices, which can be manipulated to form one-, two-, or three-dimensional arrays. The behavior of the atoms in these lattices can mimic the behavior of electrons in a crystalline solid.
3. The superfluid to Mott insulator (SF-MI) transition is an important phenomenon in condensed matter physics that has been observed in cold atoms in optical lattices. This transition is a consequence of quantum effects and is achieved by lowering the temperature of a bosonic system.
4. The observation of the SF-MI transition was made possible by the laboratory observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), a state of matter in which a large number of bosons occupy the same quantum state.
5. BEC was first proposed by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924 and is considered a consequence of quantum effects from statistical mechanics. However, it was not observed in experiments until 1995, when it was observed in rubidium atoms.
6. The observation of BEC led to the observation of the SF-MI transition and the possibility of using cold atoms in optical lattices as a test laboratory for phenomena in condensed matter physics.
7. The use of cold atoms in optical lattices as a test laboratory for condensed matter physics has led to a deluge of studies, as it brings together atomic physicists, quantum opticians, and condensed matter physicists.
8. The two-mode approximation is a theoretical framework used to describe the behavior of atoms in a double-well potential, which is a simple experimental setup for studying spin hamiltonians in optical lattices.
9. The two-mode approximation can be used to investigate the behavior of atoms in a double-well potential by considering the system as two localized spatial modes separated by a barrier.
10. The behavior of atoms in a double-well potential can be controlled and measured in an arbitrary two-spin basis by dynamically changing the lattice parameters, making it a useful tool for studying spin hamiltonians in optical lattices",0
100,"• The family of iron pnictides is an important prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with various sub-families and a wide structural variety.
• Understanding the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides is crucial for unveiling the physics underlying the superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated due to debates on the magnetic moments' description and the role of correlation effects.",1
101,"1. The M31 globular cluster B158 (also known as BO 158) contains a bright X-ray source, XB158, that was discovered by the Einstein Observatory and has been observed in every X-ray observation of the region since.
* XB158 exhibited strong intensity modulation on a 10017@xmath050 s period during a 2002 January XMM-Newton observation and similar variations were found in folded lightcurves from 1991 June ROSAT and 2000 June XMM-Newton observations.
* The amplitude of modulation decreased with increasing source intensity and no such modulation was found in the 2001 June XMM-Newton observation, leading researchers to conclude that it is likely a neutron star binary with a low mass donor.
* However, analysis of the unfolded 2000 June XMM-Newton lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, and further analysis of proprietary XMM-Newton observations in 2004 July found dipping for one orbital cycle, indicating that the disk is precessing.
2. Superhumps, a phenomenon observed in accreting binaries, are associated with this type of behavior and are characterized by a periodic increase in optical brightness on a period slightly longer than the orbital period.
* Superhumps were first identified in the superoutbursts of the SU UMa subclass of cataclysmic variables, which are accreting white dwarf binaries that exhibit occasional superoutbursts that last longer than normal outbursts.
* These superoutbursts are enhanced by a tidal instability that occurs when the outer disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the secondary, causing the disk to elongate and precess, and greatly enhancing the loss of angular momentum and accretion rate.
* The secondary modulates the disk's viscous dissipation on the beat period between the orbital period and the precession period, giving rise to the maxima in the optical lightcurve known as superhumps. Some short period, persistently bright CVs exhibit permanent superhumps.
3. XB158 appears to be somewhat analogous to 4U 1",0
102,"1. The energy and lifetime of a resonance state can be calculated using various methods, with the complex scaling method revealing a resonance state as an isolated complex eigenvalue on the spectrum of a non-Hermitian complex scaled Hamiltonian.
2. The rotation angle in the complex scaling method must be large enough to rotate the continuum part of the spectrum beyond the resonance's complex eigenvalue.
3. The complex virial theorem and graphical methods can help determine the best numerical solution for a given problem, which corresponds to stabilized points in the trajectories.
4. Other methods to calculate the energy and lifetime of a resonance state must also address the problem of identifying physically acceptable solutions.
5. The density of states (DOS) can be used to obtain the energy and lifetime of a resonance state as least square fitting parameters.
6. The DOS method has its own drawbacks, including the difficulty of assessing the accuracy and convergence properties of the numerical findings.
7. Finite size scaling arguments have been used to analyze the properties of the DOS when the size of the Hamiltonian changes.
8. The DOS method relies on the possibility of calculating Ritz-variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter.",0
103,"1. The concept of parity-time symmetric systems was introduced as an alternative to standard quantum theory, where non-hermitian Hamiltonians can still produce real spectra. This has been experimentally realized in optics using controllable gain and loss in waveguiding arrays.
2. Theoretical works have considered more general models of linearly coupled active and passive waveguides, and found stable solitons in these systems. These ideas have been implemented in electronic systems and microwave billiards, and have inspired studies on nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems with balanced nonlinear terms.
3. Most of the @xmath0-invariant systems considered thus far have been one-dimensional, but there is interest in creating @xmath0-symmetric oligomers and lattices in higher dimensions. This work aims to introduce fundamental 2d plaquettes as a basic step in this direction.
4. The proposed 2d plaquettes are inspired by earlier works on 2d Hamiltonian lattices and should be accessible with current experimental techniques. The authors focus on analytically tractable modes and study their stability using numerical methods. They find that the plaquettes are not @xmath0-symmetric in the usual matrix sense, but the nonlinear terms satisfy a modified symmetry condition.",0
104,"1. The cataclysmic variable (CV) Hu Aqr consists of a white dwarf and a main-sequence star, with two planets orbiting the binary system. The planets were discovered through irregularities in the observed-calculated variations of the CV, and their existence has led to the hypothesis that planetary systems around CVs could be common. However, the two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable, with only a small fraction of numerical simulations exhibiting long-term stability.
2. The presence of the inner planet in orbit around Hu Aqr allows for the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and core mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) to be broken, providing a way to derive the rate of mass loss during the common-envelope phase. The outer planet can be used to validate this calculation and determine the conditions under which the CV was born.
3. The response of the planetary orbit to mass loss during the common-envelope phase depends on the total amount of mass lost and the rate at which it is lost. Numerical common-envelope studies indicate that for an in-spiraling binary, the entire envelope can be expelled within one orbital period of the inner planet, leading to an impulsive response and the possible loss of the planet.
4. The eccentricity of the inner planet in Hu Aqr can be used to further constrain the rate at which the common-envelope was lost from the planetary orbit. The higher eccentricity of the outer planet indicates a more impulsive response, which is a natural consequence of its wider orbit. The orbital solution for the inner planet is insensitive to the semi-major axis of the zero-age binary, and each of these solutions was tested for dynamical stability, which turned out to be the case.",0
105,"1. The No-Core Shell Model with Resonating Group Method (NCSM/RGM) is a microscopic cluster technique that treats both structure and reactions in light nuclear systems.
2. The method has been successful in describing two-body cluster systems, but its extension to three-body cluster states is essential for studying more complex nuclear systems.
3. Three-body cluster configurations have been introduced into the NCSM/RGM, and preliminary results for the ground state and continuum states of 1he within a 2he+n+n basis have been presented.
4. The NCSM/RGM approach for three-body cluster systems involves expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states.
5. The resulting system of coupled-channel integral-differential equations is then solved using the microscopic R-matrix method on a Lagrange mesh.
6. The approach has been applied to the study of 1he, the lightest borromean nucleus, and the results show good convergence and stability.
7. The inclusion of core excitations and the study of continuum states in the NCSM/RGM are ongoing areas of research.",0
106,"1. The discovery of skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric compounds with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction has generated significant interest in the scientific community.
2. The preparation of thin films of B20-type MnSi on silicon substrates has offered promising prospects for spintronic device applications.
3. MnSi films provide a variety of magnetic phases and are easy to integrate into devices due to the established silicon technology.
4. The benefit of thin films is the existence of the skyrmion phase in an extended region of the magnetic phase diagram due to uniaxial anisotropy.
5. The drawback of using MnSi films is the low magnetic ordering temperature, which is below the liquid nitrogen temperature.
6. A potential alternative is the B20 compound MnGe, which has a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K and a helical spin structure.
7. A large topological Hall effect, attributed to a skyrmion phase, has been observed in MnGe, and small angle neutron scattering experiments provide further evidence.
8. The synthesis of MnGe is challenging, but molecular beam epitaxy allows for thin film growth under non-equilibrium conditions.
9. A preparation method for MnGe thin films on Si substrates using a MnSi seedlayer has been developed, and the structure and morphology of the films have been investigated.",0
107,"1. The core entropy of a polynomial is a concept introduced by W. Thurston that generalizes the entropy theory of real quadratic maps to complex polynomials. It is defined as the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its hubbard tree, which is a forward invariant, finite topological tree contained in the filled Julia set. The core entropy function can be extended to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers, which answers a question posed by W. Thurston.
2. The core entropy function displays a rich fractal structure that reflects the underlying geometry of the Mandelbrot set. It can be defined purely combinatorially, and its value at a non-real vein of the Mandelbrot set is monotone. The restriction of the core entropy function to non-real veins is also monotone, which implies that the lamination for the Mandelbrot set can be reconstructed by looking at level sets of the core entropy function. The value of the core entropy function is equal, up to a constant factor, to the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for the polynomial, and for dendritic Julia sets, it is equal to the asymptotic stretch factor of the polynomial as a rational map.",0
108,"1. The detection of afterglows in various wavelengths has confirmed that most long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are of cosmological origin, supporting the fireball model. However, the degree of beaming and the energetics involved in GRBs are still not well understood.
2. Three methods have been proposed to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs: the break in the light curve of optical afterglows, the polarization of optical afterglows, and the detection of orphan afterglows. However, each method has its limitations and is not conclusive.
3. The break in the light curve of optical afterglows is not always sharp and can be affected by other factors such as the cooling of electrons, a dense interstellar medium, or a wind environment.
4. Optical afterglows from a jet can be strongly polarized, but polarization can only be observed under certain conditions and is not always present.
5. Orphan afterglows, which are not associated with any detectable GRBs, can help measure the collimation angle of GRBs. However, the absence of large numbers of orphan afterglows in many surveys has been regarded as evidence that the collimation cannot be extreme.
6. The discovery of a possible optical orphan by vanden berk et al. (2002) has raised the possibility that GRBs should be collimated. However, there is also the possibility of failed gamma-ray bursts (FGRBs), which are baryon-contaminated fireballs with initial Lorentz factor less than 100 but still much greater than unity.
7. FGRBs can contain similar initial energy as normal GRB fireballs but are polluted by baryons with mass greater than 10^15 g. They can manifest themselves as fast x-ray transients or x-ray-rich GRBs, and their afterglows should also be associated with prominent afterglows.",0
109,"1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are elusive events that produce X-ray afterglows which can be detected by modern X-ray observatories for several hours to days after the burst.
2. The text discusses observations of GRB 011211 and GRB 001025, including their X-ray afterglows and optical counterparts. The afterglow of GRB 011211 was observed by XMM-Newton and found to have a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.16, while the afterglow of GRB 001025 was observed later and had a lower measured flux but a similar spectrum.
3. The text also discusses the lack of significant absorption above galactic values in the X-ray spectra of both GRBs, which is unexpected if the bursts occur in high-density star-forming regions.
4. Additionally, the text addresses the discovery of a blue-shifted line complex in the spectrum of GRB 011211, but concludes that the spectrum is featureless and does not contain any significant line emission.",0
110,"1. * Ai3, a layered organic material, has recently regained interest due to the discovery of low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure.
2. * Ai3 differs from graphene and topological insulators in several ways, such as the tilt of Dirac cones, anisotropy in the Fermi surface, and slower average Fermi velocity.
3. * The effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions is expected to be ten times larger in ai3 than in graphene due to the smaller Fermi velocity.
4. * Additional massive carriers are present near the Fermi level in ai3, but their interplay with massless Dirac fermions has not been proven experimentally.
5. * High-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes have been observed in ai3 crystals under high hydrostatic pressure.
6. * The measured mobilities for both carrier types suggest scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.
7. * The carrier density can be calculated using the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the density of states for massive and Dirac carriers.
8. * The mobility of carriers in ai3 follows a power-law behavior, with different exponents for low- and high-mobility carriers.
9. * The nature of carriers can be determined through Hall measurements and thermopower measurements, which show a sign change around a specific temperature.
10. * The analysis of magneto-conductivity data allows for the determination of all carrier contributions, avoiding challenges associated with Hall effect interpretation.",0
111,"1. Fe-based superconductors (FEBS) are a non-cuprate class of high-temperature superconductors that can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides. The superconducting state in FEBS is still debated, but it is known that the Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the @xmath11 point and two electron sheets around the @xmath12 and @xmath13 points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone.
2. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which can result in different superconducting gap symmetries and structures. The Random-Phase Approximation Spin Fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach suggests that the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets is the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations.
3. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure in FEBS, as the measured dynamical spin susceptibility in the superconducting state carries information about the gap structure. However, recent measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy have shown that there are at least two distinct gaps present in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LiFeAs. This raises questions about the spin resonance frequency in systems with two distinct gaps and whether the observed peak in INS in BaCo122 system at a frequency of 25 meV can be the spin resonance.",0
112,"1. The presence of impurities can significantly alter the properties of a quantum system, leading to changes in its coherence and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, a completely random impurity distribution results in the exponential localization of all states in dimensions one and two, while a mobility edge exists in three dimensions. However, if the impurity positions are correlated, some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum.
2. The effects of correlated disorder have been studied in various physical contexts, including the random dimer model and the dual random dimer model in one dimension. In two dimensions, the impact of correlations is less explored, except for the case of a speckle potential and for pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions. Correlations in speckle potentials can mimic the presence of a mobility edge, but all states are localized in the thermodynamic limit. Random dimers introduce a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2D lattices, as in 1D.
3. A 2D generalization of the dual random dimer model (2D-DRDM) has been introduced, where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites. In the non-interacting regime, a resonance energy exists at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized. This resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and is the same as in the 1D-DRDM. The 2D-DRDM affects the homogeneity of the ground state in a weakly interacting Bose gas, inducing a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength.",0
113,"1. The paper studies the maximum independent set problem for generalized Petersen graphs, which is known to be NP-hard, by finding upper and lower bounds or exact values for the independence number for certain classes of graphs.
2. The authors prove Behzad-Hatami-Mahmoodian's conjecture for some cases and provide an algorithm to find the independence number of generalized Petersen graphs with fixed g in linear time.
3. They also show that for any fixed g and any integer k, the treewidth of the generalized Petersen graph is bounded, which is a key step in their algorithm.
4. The paper includes a table of the independence number for some generalized Petersen graphs and acknowledges the contributions of referees, Professor E. S. Mahmoodian, and Nima Aghdaei and Hadi Moshaiedi for their computer program and algorithm.",0
114,"1. Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be proven secure under the condition that the users' devices meet certain requirements, but practical devices often struggle to meet these requirements, leading to potential security breaches.
2. Some attacks on QKD have been successfully demonstrated against practical systems.
3. To combat these attacks, countermeasures such as device-independent security proofs and experimental measures have been proposed.
4. A new scheme called measurement-device-independent QKD (MDIQKD) has been proposed, which removes potential loopholes in detectors without sacrificing performance.
5. MDIQKD has been shown to cover twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD, and its only assumption is that the preparation of quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is nearly perfect.
6. The characterization of the signal source is easier than that of the detection unit, as it involves estimating the response of devices to known input signals rather than unknown ones.
7. The imperfections of the sources, such as the basis-dependent flaw, can decrease the achievable distance in QKD.
8. The security of MDIQKD under imperfections needs to be investigated.
9. Two phase encoding MDIQKD schemes have been proposed and proven secure, and their key generation rates have been simulated with realistic parameters.
10. The schemes consider the most general type of attacks allowed by quantum mechanics and establish unconditional security.",0
115,"1. Massive stars play a crucial role in shaping the energy flow and material cycles in galaxies, but their formation process remains unclear.
* Recent observations with advanced instrumentation have revealed the environment surrounding individual massive protostellar systems, providing evidence for Keplerian disks and a Salpeter-like mass function for protostellar dust clumps.
2. High-resolution observations suggest that massive stars form via accretion, similar to low-mass stars, but further discrimination between competing models is possible by studying the properties of hot molecular cores.
* The mid-infrared (7-25 µm) window offers a powerful view of these regions, with large column densities of material processing stellar light to infrared wavelengths and diffraction-limited observations readily obtained.
3. Class II methanol masers are found to exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are generally not associated or are offset from UCHII regions.
* Multi-wavelength (mm to mir) observations of five star-forming complexes traced by methanol maser emission have revealed that maser sites with weak radio continuum flux are associated with massive, luminous, and deeply embedded cores, characterizing protoclusters of young massive (proto)stars in an earlier evolutionary stage than UCHII regions.
4. In three observed regions, multiple point sources at close angular separation correspond to linear separations of 1700 to 6000au, but it remains unclear whether these stars are physically bound or simply close due to projection effects.
* Assuming they are physically bound in a Keplerian orbit, the maximum proper motions and velocity differences are too small to be detected on short temporal baselines and by high spectral resolution observations, respectively.
5. The mass distribution of stars is generally well described as a power law through the initial mass function (IMF), and the likelihood of forming the most massive stars in a cluster can be estimated based on the gas mass available.
* Monte Carlo simulations show that it is difficult to generate the observed mass distributions using a standard form of the IMF, suggesting that the mass distribution of the most massive stars cannot be produced by sampling a standard form of the IMF from the reservoir of gas available for star formation.",0
116,"1. Modified gravity theories have gained attention due to the discovery of the accelerated expanding universe, with dark energy being the mysterious force responsible for this change.
	* The Lovelock theory of gravity is a direct generalization of General Relativity in higher dimensions, with the Ricci scalar and Gauss-Bonnet invariant as the first and second Lovelock scalars, respectively.
	* The Gauss-Bonnet invariant is a topological term in 4-dimensions and can be discussed in 4-dimensions by coupling it with a scalar field or adding a generic function in the Einstein-Hilbert action.
	* The first scheme appears in the effective action in string theory, while the second approach, known as f(GB) gravity, is introduced as an alternative for dark energy and is endowed with a rich cosmological structure.
2. The action for f(GB) gravity is defined as a function of the metric tensor determinant, a coupling constant, and a Lagrangian associated with matter distribution.
	* The field equations for f(GB) gravity are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric tensor and are based on the suitable choice of the matter Lagrangian.
	* The energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid is given by the product of the four velocity, energy density, and pressure of the matter distribution.
	* The field equations for a perfect fluid matter distribution in f(GB) gravity are recovered if the coupling constant between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian vanishes, and General Relativity is achieved for a specific choice of the matter Lagrangian.
3. The de Sitter cosmic evolution is a well-known scenario that describes the current expansion of the universe.
	* The scale factor of this evolutionary model grows exponentially with a constant Hubble parameter, and the energy density is given by the product of a constant and the scale factor raised to a power.
	* The Gauss-Bonnet invariant takes a specific form for this scale factor, and the field equation becomes a complicated partial differential equation.
	* The de Sitter universe can be described in f(GB) gravity, and the solution of the field equation is given by the product of integration constants and the scale factor raised to a power.

117,"1. Majorana fermions (MFs) are real solutions of the Dirac equation and are their own antiparticles. They were originally proposed as a model for neutrinos but have recently been predicted to occur as quasiparticle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems.
2. MFs obey non-Abelian statistics, which is important for realizing potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.
3. The possibility of hosting MFs in exotic solid-state systems has focused on topological superconductors, and various realistic platforms have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect.
4. These platforms include topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains. Although various schemes have been presented, observing the unique Majorana signatures experimentally is still a challenging task.
5. MFs are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs). The theoretical predictions of ZBPs have been observed experimentally in semiconductor nanowires, interpreted as the signatures of MFs.
6. However, ZBPs can also appear due to other mechanisms, such as the zero-bias anomaly caused by the Kondo resonance and disorder or band bending in the semiconductor nanowire.
7. Additionally, Andreev bound states in a magnetic field can also exhibit a zero-energy crossing as a function of exchange interaction or Zeeman energy, giving rise to similar conductance features.
8. Most experimental evidence for Majorana bound states relies on measurements of the tunneling conductance, and the observation of Majorana signatures based on electrical methods remains a subject of debate.
9. To obtain definitive signatures of MFs, alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFs are necessary. Here, an alternative all-optical scheme to detect MFs is proposed, utilizing a coupled hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system with an optical pump-probe scheme.",0

119,"1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by their spectra, which exhibit no hydrogen lines but strong silicon lines at maximum brightness. They are useful as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies due to their uniform light curves and high luminosity. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from a companion star and explodes once it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit.
2. The accreting WD model has made significant progress, particularly with the introduction of a stellar wind from the WD during accretion. This model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. However, the evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia has not been confirmed by observations, and identifying the companion star near the explosion site is crucial for confirmation. A G2IV star, Tycho G, has been suggested as the companion to Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), but its association with the SNR is not yet conclusive. A new method to prove the companion star's location inside the SN ejecta is proposed, focusing on absorption lines in the visible range, specifically Fe I transitions from the ground state. Calculations show that the companion star of Tycho's SNR is likely to exhibit unique Fe I absorption features, making it a potential candidate for identification.",0
120,"1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource that can be manipulated and characterized independently of its physical realization, and obeys a set of conservation laws. It is useful in making quantitative predictions and is regarded as a physical resource. When one has complete information about a bipartite system, the state of the system is pure and there exists a well-established measure of entanglement, the entropy of entanglement.
2. However, when quantum systems interact with their environment, the states of practical concern become mixed, making the quantification of entanglement less clear. Given an ensemble of pure states with probabilities, a natural generalization of the entropy of entanglement is its weighted average. But, a difficulty arises when considering that a given density operator may be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for this average entanglement.
3. To circumvent this problem, various measures have been proposed, such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation. These measures give the value zero for certain states, which might be thought counterintuitive, but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state. The entanglement of an open system and its environment is a tripartite entanglement problem, and to characterize it more completely, the inherent uncertainty of the mixed state description must be removed.
4. Nha and Carmichael recently introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based on quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics. This approach considers the way in which information about the system is read from the environment, and the entanglement measure is contextual, depending on the kind of measurements made. By following the evolution of the system conditioned on the measurement record, the entanglement measure can be characterized in an unambiguous fashion.",0
121,"1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are classified as Type 1 or Type 2 based on the presence or absence of broad emission lines, which is attributed to orientation-dependent circumnuclear obscuration.
2. The obscuring medium, known as the ""dust torus,"" absorbs and re-emits incident UV/optical radiation as infrared (IR) emission, with Type 1 AGN showing stronger near-IR emission than Type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity.
3. High-spatial resolution observations or using high-luminosity objects can help mitigate host galaxy contributions to the IR emission in AGN samples.
4. The authors aim to quantify the wavelength dependence of AGN emission anisotropy using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars.
5. After applying host-galaxy subtraction and using clumpy torus models, the authors find that the average SEDs of obscured (Type 2) and unobscured (Type 1) AGN show distinct differences.
6. The anisotropy in AGN emission is attributed to a combination of extinction and anisotropic re-emission from the dust torus, with the authors testing a single absorber/emitter scenario for the radio galaxy/quasar anisotropy.
7. The clumpy torus models reproduce the observed anisotropy well, suggesting that the anisotropy is a measure of the intrinsic anisotropy of luminous Type 1 and Type 2 AGN.",0
122,"1. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has advanced in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, with practical systems achieving secure communication over tens of kilometers.
2. The security of these systems has been confirmed through analysis of equivalent entanglement-based schemes, but traditional analysis does not consider the local oscillator (LO), leaving security loopholes.
3. Fluctuations in LO intensity can compromise secret keys if not properly addressed, and monitoring LO intensity is crucial for confirming the security of practical CVQKD systems.
4. In the paper, the authors analyze the effect of LO intensity fluctuations on the secret key rate and propose an attacking scheme exploiting this fluctuation.
5. They find that fluctuation of LO could severely compromise secret keys if not properly scaled in measurements, and discuss accurate monitoring of LO intensity for secure implementation.
6. The analysis is based on a practical CVQKD system with homodyne protocol, and the effects of LO intensity attack on the secret key rate are demonstrated.
7. The paper emphasizes the importance of monitoring LO intensity fluctuations and scaling measurements accordingly to ensure the unconditional security of CVQKD systems.",0

The code in question is designed to calculate adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models, with a focus on accuracy and the ability to determine all frequencies of a given model within a specified range of degree and frequency. It offers flexibility in the choice of integration method and is based on a set of dimensionless variables inspired by previous work.
2. The equilibrium model is defined in terms of these dimensionless variables, as well as the mass and radius of the model, and is used to calculate various characteristic frequencies related to adiabatic oscillations. The code also includes options for handling models with vanishing surface pressure and for considering truncated models in the Cowling approximation.
3. The code uses two main techniques to solve the equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations: a shooting method and a relaxation technique. The shooting method involves integrating solutions separately from the inner and outer boundary and matching them at a suitable inner fitting point, while the relaxation technique involves solving the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions using a relaxation technique.
4. The code includes options for redistributing the mesh in a way that takes into account the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions, as well as techniques for improving the precision of the computed frequencies. It also calculates the normalized inertia of a mode, which provides a powerful measure of its characteristics. The code has been used in a number of studies and has been improved and revised over time.",0
124,"1. The distribution of neutral hydrogen gas (HI) in galaxies often shows loop-like or circular structures called supershells, which can extend across several kiloparsecs. These features have been observed in both internal starburst models and external models, such as infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane.
2. The internal starburst model proposes that supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars create the supershells, but this model faces difficulties in explaining the required input energies for the largest shells. External models suggest that infalling gas clouds or gamma-ray bursts could be responsible for the supershells.
3. A new explanation for HI supershells proposes that they are formed by radio jets plowing through the interstellar medium, accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles.

Despite its morphology and lack of detectable hydrogen (HI), it has the youngest stellar population among them, with a larger fraction of intermediate-age and young population compared to other dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The star formation seems to have proceeded until almost the present time, without intense, distinct bursts of star formation.
2. Important questions about Leo I remain, such as the existence or not of a very old stellar population, variations of star formation across the galaxy, and whether the horizontal branch (HB) is missing in the outer parts of Leo I. Answering these questions is important for understanding the formation and evolution of Leo I and the epoch of galaxy formation and the evolution of galaxies of different morphological types. The determination of the strength of the star formation in Leo I at different epochs is also crucial for assessing whether it is possible that during intervals of high star formation activity, Leo I would have been as bright as the faint blue galaxies observed at intermediate redshift.",0

- The document discusses the use of the Green function in the context of the fractional Laplacian, which is the generator of the isotropic α-stable Lévy process on ℝⁿ. The Green function is used to define the Green operator, which is the inverse of the fractional Laplacian with zero exterior conditions.
- The paper establishes estimates for the Green function and the transition density of the Lévy process, and uses these estimates to prove the compactness of the Green operator and the semigroup generated by the fractional Laplacian. The authors also consider the operator corresponding to a vector field and show that it is a semigroup of contractions.",0

Phase transitions, often involving symmetry breaking, are characterized by drastic changes in macroscopic properties. The theory of phase transitions was developed by Landau and later refined using the renormalization group. Order parameters are used to identify phases, and while they can often be determined by symmetry considerations, there are systems where this is not possible, such as topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin Hall states, or quantum spin liquids.
2. Machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, have shown promise in identifying order parameters for complex systems. These methods can approximate any function under mild assumptions and have been successful in tasks like image classification, speech recognition, natural language understanding, and predicting from high-dimensional data. Physicists have started employing machine learning techniques, primarily supervised learning algorithms and reinforcement learning, to tackle various tasks.
3. Unsupervised learning algorithms, which can find structure in unlabeled data and classify it into clusters, have also been used to reproduce Monte Carlo-sampled states of the Ising model and identify phase transitions. A first nonlinear extension is kernel principal component analysis, and autoencoders have been used for dimensional reduction of data before feeding it to a machine learning algorithm. Variational autoencoders, a more successful unsupervised learning algorithm, impose restrictions on the distribution of latent variables and have shown promising results in encoding and reconstructing data in the field of computer vision.
4. In this work, unsupervised learning is used to determine phase transitions without any information about the microscopic theory or the order parameter. The authors transition from principal component analysis to variational autoencoders and test how the latter handles different physical models. Their algorithms are able to find a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system, which coincides with the correct order parameter, and the decoder network reconstructs the encoded configuration from its latent representation. The reconstruction is more accurate in the ordered phase, suggesting the use of the reconstruction error as a universal identifier for phase transitions.",0

2. Some authors have proposed models with a large component of baryonic dark matter, including the possibility of cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds. These clouds could have various forms, such as isolated, clustered, or fractal, and would be made of dense gas with high column density.
3. A major prediction of a model with dense gas clouds is the gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray interactions within the clouds. This process could yield a diffuse flux in the galactic plane comparable to the flux from known sources for photon energies around 1 GeV.
4. Most previous investigations of this problem have neglected self-shielding and cascade phenomena, which can be important at high column densities and alter the emergent gamma-ray spectrum. These effects could be relevant to the observed excess galactic flux above 1 GeV.
5. The authors present detailed calculations of the gamma-ray spectra arising from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds, using a Monte Carlo simulation code called Geant4. They find that the predicted spectra differ substantially between high and low column-density clouds.
6. The calculations are undertaken for cold, dense molecular gas in clouds of radius 1 cm, similar to those proposed to explain extreme scattering events. However, the results depend primarily on the column density of the individual clouds and their fractional contribution to the galaxy's dark matter halo.",0

2. \* These crystals have a well-defined thermodynamic temperature, allowing them to be viewed as mesoscopic ""model atoms"" for studying condensed matter physics.
3. \* Recent advances have demonstrated tunable colors through control of lattice spacing with an external field, and the ability to tune colloid-colloid interactions has led to the observation of a variety of structures.

6. \* The introduction of a rotating ac field opens up even more possibilities, as dipolar interactions lead to an attraction in the plane of rotation and repulsions above and below.

2. Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (CCM) derived a mean extinction law that depends on one parameter, which they called @xmath0. This law allows for the determination of extinction in one spectral region based on the extinction in a different spectral region.
3. The @xmath0 parameter ranges from about 2.0 to about 5.5, with a typical value of 3.1, and characterizes the dust properties in the region that produces the extinction.
4. Many authors have used the CCM law to study extinction, including searching for a relation between @xmath0 and other parameters that characterize the extinction curves, studying the role of @xmath0 as the main regulatory agent of the penetration of radiation inside dark clouds, and discussing different methods to deredden the data.
5. The interstellar dust grains span a wide range of sizes and reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam by absorption and scattering.

2. The text defines the partial euler koszul characteristic of a weakly toric module and states the main result that the partial euler koszul characteristics of ranking toric modules are determined by the combinatorics of the ranking lattices of the module at a fixed parameter.

Qubits can be encoded using electron charge or spin, with spin qubits having longer decoherence times but requiring a magnetic field to prepare.
2. A proposal by Divincenzo et al. suggests building qubits in a system of three coherently coupled quantum dots (TQD), with qubit states encoded in a decoherence-free subspace and controlled by exchange interactions. This system allows for purely electrical control of the exchange interactions and full unitary rotation of the qubit states.
3. Recent experimental efforts have shown coherent spin manipulations in a linear TQD system, and a new detection method for qubit states has been proposed, based on a doublet blockade effect that manifests in currents for a specific configuration of local potential gates. This method is fully compatible with electrical manipulations of the qubit and can be used for qubits encoded in both triangular and linear TQD systems.",0
137,"1. Z Andromedae (Z And) is a symbiotic system composed of a white dwarf (WD), a red giant (RG) star, and circumbinary nebulae. The system emits radiation across a wide frequency range, from radio to X-rays.
2. Z And has experienced multiple outbursts, including a double-peaked event in 1984-1986. These outbursts are attributed to variations in the WD radiation flux, ejection of shells of material, and collisions between stellar winds.
3. The 1984-1986 outburst is notable for its double-peaked structure and low brightness. The burst's double structure is explained by red giant pulsation and the collision of the WD wind with two ejected shells.
4. The minimum between the two peaks is due to the sudden increase in distance between the WD and the downstream nebula, which prevents the WD blackbody flux from reaching the nebula.
5. The outburst did not reach its maximum luminosity because the collision of the wind network was distorted by the onset of the next shell.
6. Broad wings and collimated bipolar jets have been observed in other symbiotic systems, but were not present during the 1984-1986 outburst of Z And.
7. The absence of broad lines and jets during the 1984-1986 outburst suggests that the outburst was not caused by a WD explosion or the presence of an accretion disk.",0

2. SWCNT networks can be seen as a system of one-dimensional rods with large length-to-diameter ratios, leading to interesting behavior due to the high resistance at nanotube-nanotube junctions.
3. The overall resistance of a sub-monolayer network shows percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence, while for thicker networks, the conductance through metallic tubes dominates, leading to metallic behavior.
4. Frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity have been studied for individual SWCNTs and some types of SWCNT networks.
5. Burke and co-workers measured the microwave conductivity of individual SWCNTs and investigated their operation as a transistor at 2.6 GHz.
6. For SWCNT networks with 30 nm thickness, the AC conductivity is frequency-independent up to an onset frequency of about 10 GHz, beyond which it increases with an approximate power law behavior.
7. For thicker films with thickness in the range of tens of micrometers, conductivities at DC and 10 GHz are almost the same.
8. The nonlinearity of the electric-field-dependent conductivity of relatively thick nanotube networks has been observed, and the charge carriers can be localized by disorder in the SWCNTs with an approximate length scale of 1.65 nm.
9. A comprehensive understanding of the electrical transport properties of SWCNT networks requires investigation of their frequency and electric-field-dependent conductivity for systematic variation of network densities and correlation studies between the onset frequency and the length scale determined from nonlinear transport.",0

Grover's algorithm can search an unsorted database with a quadratic advantage over classical methods. It has been implemented in various physical systems, including superconducting qubits.
2. The proposed implementation of the three-qubit Grover search algorithm using four-level superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) in a cavity-QED system aims to simplify the process and reduce errors. This scheme uses a three-qubit phase gate, which requires fewer quantum gates and reduces the probability of errors compared to conventional gate decomposition methods. The implementation also considers the effects of spontaneous decay and cavity decay on the system's performance.
3. The proposed implementation of the three-qubit Grover search algorithm using SQUIDs in a cavity-QED system offers several advantages. It eliminates the need for adjusting level spacing during operation, slowly changing rabi frequencies, and second-order detuning. This results in a faster implementation time of the order of nanoseconds and accommodates non-uniform device parameters. The scheme also takes into account imperfections, such as the decay of the cavity field and unwanted off-resonant interaction during gate implementation.",0

5. * The XPS line shapes in graphene are characterized using several parameters introduced by Doniach and Sunji, which are still broadly used by experimentalists in the fitting procedure for XPS spectra.
6. * In doped graphene, the chemical potential is inside an energy band, leading to tailing and collective excitations that contribute to the tail, making any quantitative interpretation of graphene core-hole spectra not feasible.

2. The thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness.
3. The standard equation of motion for the orientation field in polycrystalline solidification is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
4. The inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is challenging, and the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
5. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been enhanced in the last decade, but controlling physical effects due to the diffuseness of the interface is crucial.
6. The thin-interface limit is used to guarantee precise simulations by analyzing the equations under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale.
7. The phase-field model for the solidification of a pure substance has a temperature jump due to trapping, which can lead to errors in simulations if the interface thickness is increased.
8. The trapping effect and the kapitza resistance are two independent thin-interface effects that cannot be eliminated simultaneously, and their impact depends on the specific case of solidification.

	* Spectroscopic methods, especially for measuring metallicity, are of key importance, with high-resolution spectroscopy used to correct low-resolution results.
2. Atmospheric parameters can be estimated consistently and efficiently from a spectrum using information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and local thermodynamic equilibrium.
	* This method avoids the problem of reddening inherent in photometry, as spectroscopic parameters are not sensitive to reddening.
	* Spectroscopic parameters can then be used alone or in combination with photometric information to fit individual stars to theoretical isochrones or evolutionary tracks, determining stellar mass, age, and distance.
3. Recent studies have shown that systematic biases are present in analyses using the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), particularly at low metallicity and surface gravity.

It manifests as angular correlations between these sources and foreground mass inhomogeneities, or as a coherent shear effect in the case of galaxies.
2. Another way to detect weak lensing is by using fluxes of standard candles. If observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen as brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess, while fainter ones have mass deficits in their foregrounds.
3. The best example of a cosmological standard candle is Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which have been extensively observed to determine the global geometry of the universe. Nuisance effects like evolution, variations in individual SNe, and gray dust extinction have been studied and corrected for or shown to be small.
4. Weak lensing, another nuisance effect, has been addressed theoretically and found to be unimportant given current uncertainties. However, it is predicted to be non-negligible for higher redshift sources.
5. The largest homogeneous compilation of SNe Ia contains 74 SNe, and the authors use four different light curve fitting methods to estimate distances to SNe. The final quoted distance is the median of the estimates of the four individual methods, and the uncertainty is the median of the error of the contributing methods.
6. The analysis presented in the paper yields values of global cosmological parameters, which are used in all the analysis of the present paper. As tracers of foreground mass density, APM galaxies are used, which provide near full coverage of the sky in the northern and southern hemispheres.
7. The authors explore the dependence of the results on the factor used to avoid the problem of source/lens redshift overlap and find that the significance of the correlation is high. The distribution of SNe points in the figure depends on specific choices made for certain parameters, and the results are consistent with weak gravitational lensing.

The LMA is a many-body approach that provides a description of dynamical and transport properties of paramagnetic HF, including single-particle dynamics, DC transport, and optical conductivities. The LMA is a non-perturbative method that introduces the notion of local moments and leads to a ""two-self-energy"" description that captures correlated spin-flip dynamics.
2. The LMA has been successful in describing the transport and optical properties of kondo insulators, particularly in the particle-hole symmetric limit. It has also been extended to handle the generic asymmetric PAM, which is relevant for HF metals. The LMA has been used to study single-particle dynamics at finite temperatures, enabling access to DC transport and optics. The approach is based on the skeleton expansion for the current-current correlation function, which allows for a formal result for the conductivity bubble to be obtained.
3. The LMA satisfies certain desiderata for handling non-perturbatively the full range of interaction strengths and respecting the asymptotic dictates of fermi liquid behavior on the lowest energy scales. It is based on an underlying two-self-energy description, which follows from a mean-field approach and leads to the conventional single self-energy and the concept of symmetry restoration. The LMA has been used to study the weight of the Drude peak in the conductivity and to derive an exact result for it. The LMA also provides a natural framework for understanding the thermal evolution of single-particle dynamics and scattering rates, which are important for understanding transport and optics in HF materials.",0

* Hairpin loop formation is the elementary step in protein folding and structure formation in RNA folding.
* A cell is crowded with various subcellular structures, and DNA is constantly interacting with them, making it subject to temporally fluctuating forces due to its dynamic environment.
2. Recent studies have shown that the power spectrum of the fluctuating force exerted on the cytoskeleton is an order of magnitude larger than expected from thermal equilibrium conditions.
* This indicates that the cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium.
* Single molecule experiment techniques have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation.
* Finzi and Gelles observed Laci-mediated DNA loop formation and dissociation by monitoring nanoscale Brownian motion of a micron-sized particle attached to one end of the DNA.

Tidal interactions in binary systems, such as star-star or star-planet configurations, can lead to various phenomena, including synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, disruption, and the fall of an object onto a star. This paper investigates the tidal interaction of two bodies: a star and a point source, which can be a star or a planet. The evolution of the star must be taken into account over long timescales due to the strong dependence of eccentricity or semimajor axis evolution on the orbital period.
* The study focuses on dynamical tides and considers three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses. The stars are modeled without rotation or magnetic field effects, and the stellar physics is discussed only briefly as needed. The one-solar-mass star closely resembles the Sun with a radiative core and convective envelope during its main-sequence phase. The other two stars have a convective core and radiative envelope during their main-sequence phase.
* The tidal evolution problem is reduced to determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star-planet system. The low-frequency g-modes of stellar oscillations play a crucial role in the theory of dynamical tides. These interactions are intense at small periastron distances, affecting orbital evolution. The paper's results can be directly applied to some exoplanetary systems, such as the ybp1194 system, which hosts a solar twin and a short-period planet.
* The tidal quality factor (Q) and overlap integrals are calculated for each stellar model at various stages of stellar evolution. The overlap integrals are directly related to the tidal resonance coefficients and serve as a measure of the intensity of tidal forces. The change in orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity with time is determined using energy and angular momentum conservation laws. The time scales of orbital parameter changes are also calculated, taking into account the stellar evolution.
* The eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of stellar oscillations are required to calculate the overlap integral. There are three types of eigenfrequencies for a nonrotating star: p-modes, f-modes, and g-modes. The paper focuses on low-frequency g-modes, which are determined by the Brunt",0

Early work was focused on near-field optical microscopy, but recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have pushed the resolution of far-field imaging down to the nanometer range. These methods rely on the accurate localization of individual fluorescent markers, which are isolated based on one or more distinguishing optical characteristics or by selective or random activation of a bright and a dark state.
2. A key issue affecting subwavelength imaging methods is the optical transparency of the media surrounding the light emitters. Fluorescence microscopy provides noninvasive imaging of the interior of cells and allows the detection of specific cellular constituents through fluorescence tagging. However, certain biological tissues or soft-matter systems can look turbid due to intense scattering of photons, which gives rise to a chaotic intensity distribution known as a speckle pattern.
3. Techniques to measure the distance between individual nano-objects without imaging their position exist, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET relies on the near-field energy transfer between two fluorophores emitting at different wavelengths, and the FRET signal depends on the donor-acceptor distance in the range of 0-10 nm. However, determining distances between two emitters in the range of 10 to 500 nm in a scattering medium remains an open research question.
4. The paper proposes a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment, based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light. The method is based on the measurement of intensity fluctuations and permits monitoring the relative distance between the sources in the range of 10-500 nm, with a precision that is not limited by diffraction but by the microstructure of the scattering medium. The method could simplify green function retrieval techniques based on the correlations of the isotropic ambient noise measured at two receivers.",0

The WLC model assumes that the polymer is a flexible rod with a bending stiffness that resists bending.

2. The text also discusses the use of the glassy wormlike chain (GWL) model, which is a phenomenological extension of the WLC model, to describe the mechanics of living cells. The GWL model can describe a wide range of rheological data for polymer solutions and living cells over many decades in time with a minimum of parameters. However, recent studies have shown that the mechanical response of living cells is more complex than the viscoelastic behavior described by the GWL model, and also exhibits glassy, fragile, and inelastic characteristics.

2. All known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements, but it has been proposed that ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons can generate effective spin-orbit couplings.
3. An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can generate an effective spin-orbit interaction through spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI).
4. However, realizing the proposed TMI phase in real materials or theoretical models has been challenging due to competing orders and quantum fluctuations.
5. The stability of the TMI and the critical value of interaction on the honeycomb lattice have been studied using mean-field calculations, but these methods cannot treat correlation effects satisfactorily.
6. A reliable limit for TMI stability is found for infinitesimally small relevant Coulomb repulsions, where the quadratic band crossing with vanishing fermi velocities causes the leading instability.
7. In a study of an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, a long-period charge density wave (CDW) is found to be more stable than the TMI phase, taking over the TMI on the honeycomb lattice.

3. The AB-BA tilt boundary hosts gapless modes of topological origin, forming the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states.
4. The quantum valley Hall effect and its corresponding edge states have been proposed for gapped multi-layer graphene, but there has been no experimental detection so far. The idea of classifying topological insulators based on symmetries has played a key role in the field, leading to the discovery of three-dimensional topological crystalline insulators.",0
152,"1. Ionizable polymers in water can be classified as polyelectrolytes or polyampholytes, depending on the charge of their monomers.
2. Polyelectrolytes have monomers with the same charge, while polyampholytes have monomers with both positive and negative charges.
3. The behavior of polyampholytes depends on the sequence of charged monomers, even with the same ratio of positive and negative charges.
4. Charged polymers can form brushes when grafted onto a surface, with additional length scales introduced by electrostatic interactions.
5. Polyelectrolyte brushes can have a repulsion of electrostatic origin between chains, leading to a brush regime.
6. Polyampholyte brushes have most counterions outside the brush, with the average thickness and equilibrium properties determined by chain properties.
7. Brushes of flexible, semiflexible, and rodlike diblock polyampholytes have been studied using MD simulations, with a linear dependence of the brush thickness on the grafting density observed for all cases.",0
153,"1. The nature of light flavor scalar mesons is not well understood and they do not fit into the naive quark model. They are proposed to be glueballs, molecular states, or tetraquark states.
* The $f_{0}(500)$, $f_{0}(980)$, $a_{0}(980)$, and $K_{0}^{\*}(800)$ are good candidates for molecular states, but their ""cousins"" lie too high above the corresponding thresholds to be identified as molecular states.
* The two criteria of QCD sum rules, pole dominance and convergence of the operator product expansion, cannot be satisfied for light flavor multiquark states, making it difficult to study them with QCD sum rules.
* The article attempts to overcome this difficulty by taking colored diquarks as point particles and describing them as basic scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor fields. The color singlet tetraquark currents are then constructed with the scalar diquark fields and the nonperturbative effects are parameterized with new vacuum condensates.
2. The strong attraction of one-gluon exchange favors the formation of diquarks in color antitriplet, flavor antitriplet, and spin singlet configurations.
* Lattice QCD studies indicate that the strong attraction in the scalar diquark channels favors the formation of good diquarks, while the weaker attraction in the axial-vector diquark channels may form bad diquarks.
* The studies based on the random instanton liquid model indicate that the instanton induced quark-quark interactions are weakly repulsive in the vector and axial-vector channels, strongly repulsive in the pseudoscalar channel, and strongly attractive in the scalar and tensor channels.
* Therefore, it is sensible to use the scalar diquark fields to construct the tetraquark currents.
3. The two-point correlation functions can be written in terms of the currents for the nonet scalar mesons, and the hadronic representation can be obtained by inserting a complete set of intermediate hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators.
* The ground state contributions can be isolated from the pole terms of the nonet scalar mesons, and the results can be expressed in terms of the ground state masses",0
154,"1. * Time-domain simulation of power system dynamics can be expensive due to the large number of differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) involved and the different time scales.
   * Intense efforts have been made to accelerate the simulation, including using larger time steps or implementing the quasi steady-state (QSS) model.
2. * The QSS model can suffer from numerical difficulties and may not provide consistent approximations of the long-term stability model.
   * This paper aims to improve the QSS model by applying pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) method in power system long-term stability analysis.
3. * PTC is a numerical method that can accelerate simulation speed and overcome possible numerical difficulties in the QSS model due to its good stability property.
   * The paper presents three numerical examples to demonstrate the feasibility of the method.
4. * The long-term stability model for calculating system dynamic response relative to a disturbance can be described as a set of algebraic equations and differential equations with different time constants.
   * The proposed algorithm for implementing PTC in the long-term stability model involves switching to implicit integration method whenever discrete variables jump and setting the step length to be small.
5. * The qss model can be represented as a set of DAEs, and the discrete equation will violate the initial condition of PTC whenever it works.
   * To overcome this, the original PTC method needs to be modified for its implementation in the qss model.
6. * The proposed algorithm for implementing PTC in the qss model involves running the long-term stability model up to a certain time, setting the value at that time as the initial condition of the qss model, and starting to run the qss model.
   * If the qss model has a numerical difficulty, the algorithm goes back to the long-term stability model and solves the newton step.
7. * The paper presents three examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in providing correct approximations and overcoming numerical difficulties.
   * The simulations were done in psat-2.1.6, and the results show that the proposed algorithms can successfully provide correct stability assessment and good accuracy for the intermediate trajectories.",0

	* Recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps has made it possible to realize these phenomena.
	* The research of 2D quantum effects in condensed matter physics, such as superfluid films, high-temperature superconductivity, 2D materials like graphene, and topological quantum computation, has a long history.
	* Unique opportunities for modeling these 2D effects in a highly controlled environment have emerged with the development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2D Bose and Fermi ultracold gases.
2. The anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction require special consideration in the theory of elementary quantum two-body systems and processes in the plane.
	* Usual partial-wave analysis becomes inefficient for describing the dipole-dipole scattering due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial waves in the asymptotic region.
	* Recent progress has been made in the analysis of 2D and quasi-2D scattering of dipoles, including the threshold and semiclassical regimes with the dipole polarization directed orthogonally to the scattering plane.
	* An arbitrary angle of polarization has also been considered in the study of 2D quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer.
3. The quantum scattering on an anisotropic potential in the plane is described by the 2D Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates with the scattering boundary conditions in the asymptotic region and the Hamiltonian of the system.
	* The interaction potential can be anisotropic, leading to a more complex problem that requires solving for all possible orientations of the scatterer and fixed energy with the scattering boundary conditions.
	* The scattering amplitude can be used to calculate the differential scattering cross section and the total cross section by averaging over all possible orientations of the scatterer and integrating over the scattering angle.
	* The method suggested in [xcite] is used to solve the few-dimensional scattering problem, which involves choosing the eigenfunctions of the operator as a Fourier basis for the angular-grid representation of the searched wave function",0
156,"1. G65.2+5.7, also known as G65.3+5.7, was identified as a supernova remnant (SNR) and the subject of several observational papers, but was later ignored until recently. It is now interesting because it helps explain an unusual class of SNRs called thermal composite SNRs or mixed morphology SNRs. These remnants have a shell-like radio continuum morphology and a centrally bright X-ray morphology due to thermal, rather than synchrotron, processes.

   - Thermal composite SNRs have more mysterious origins than shell-type and plerionic SNRs.
   - They lack X-ray shells because they have evolved into the radiative phase or because thermal conduction, entropy mixing, or cloudlet evaporation has enhanced the central densities.
   - Ejecta enrichment or dust destruction could increase metallicities in the centers, also enhancing the X-ray emission.
   - A thermal composite morphology may be due to collisions with molecular clouds.

2. G65.2+5.7 is a thermal composite SNR because it meets the three requirements: it has a shell-like radio continuum morphology, emits thermal X-rays, and has a centrally filled X-ray morphology.

   - The remnant's true extent was unknown until an optical emission line survey of the galactic plane revealed filaments circumscribing a 4.5 x 3.3 ellipse.
   - Optical emission line measurements indicate that the filaments are dense shell fragments behind moderate velocity shocks.
   - The [O/H] ratios and shock models suggest that the photons were emitted by thick postshock cooling regions behind the shock.
   - The cooling zone along one pointing direction appears to be well developed, but incomplete, while other regions have nearly complete cooling.

3. The remnant's size and distance have been estimated using various techniques, resulting in different values.

* A peculiar dynamical phenomenon known as chimera states was discovered in populations of identical phase oscillators, characterized by the coexistence of coherent and incoherent oscillators under nonlocal symmetric coupling.
* The study of chimera states has been extensively researched in various models, including Kuramoto phase oscillators, periodic and chaotic maps, Stuart-Landau oscillators, and FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators.
* Experimental evidence of chimera states has been found in populations of coupled chemical oscillators and optical coupled-map lattices, as well as in a mechanical experiment involving two subpopulations of identical metronomes.
* In the context of neuroscience, chimera states have been suggested to explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in many birds and dolphins, where one hemisphere of the brain is synchronous while the other is asynchronous.
* In this paper, the authors identify various single and multi-chimera states in networks of non-locally coupled neurons represented by Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators.
* The authors also discover chimera-like patterns in the more natural setting where only the membrane potential variables are coupled, and they observe only states of complete synchronization and mixed oscillatory states (MOS) in the more realistic 3d-HR model.

159,"1. Kauffman networks are disordered dynamical systems used to model genetic regulatory systems, which underwent a dynamical phase transition studied through mean field theory. In this paper, the authors focus on the structural properties of the networks that determine their attractors.
	* They introduce the notion of ""relevant elements,"" which was suggested by Flyvbjerg and studied in terms of their probability distribution.
	* The relevant elements are then subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules, which was already suggested by Kauffman for analytical studies of attractors in @xmath4 networks.
2. The paper aims to describe the phase transition in random Boolean networks in terms of the scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size or as a percolation transition in the set of relevant elements.
	* This approach allows for drawing direct consequences about the statistical properties of the attractors.
	* The authors computed the properties of the attractors in the framework of the annealed approximation, introduced by Derrida and Pomeau, but observed that the approximation is reliable only when the system is chaotic enough.
	* They propose a new approximation scheme that works better in the frozen phase and on the critical line, which is the most interesting region in parameter space, as it reproduces some features of real cells and is the least understood.
3. The authors define the Kauffman model, which consists of a set of elements, each associated with a binary variable representing its state of activation.
	* Each element is controlled by other elements, and its state is determined by the states of its control genes and a response function that specifies how the element responds to the signals coming from its control variables.

160,"1. Turbulence in quantum fluids (QT) is a phenomenon where many quantized vortices with quantized circulation are nucleated, forming tangles, which is different from classical turbulence (CT) in classical fluids. QT is believed to be useful for understanding CT. A new trend in turbulence study in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is turbulence in multi-component BECs, which have various characteristic features, including the realization of multicomponent BECs and the presence of a (quasi) spin field. This system is expected to exhibit novel turbulence, where both the velocity and spin fields are disturbed, and various topological excitations are generated.
2. The paper studies turbulence in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, which is a typical multicomponent BEC. The spin field is disturbed in this turbulence, which is called spin turbulence (ST). The paper focuses on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC and finds a Kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields. The Kolmogorov spectrum is considered to be related to the vortex dynamics, so it is significant to confirm it for understanding the turbulence addressed in the paper.
3. The paper discusses the possibility of a Kolmogorov spectrum in spin-superflow turbulence (SST) with hydrodynamic equations obtained from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The hydrodynamic equations are composed of the equations of the total density, the superfluid velocity, the spin vector, and the nematic tensor. The paper applies three approximations to these hydrodynamic equations, leading to the equations of motion for the spin and velocity fields. The paper then performs a Kolmogorov-type dimensional scaling analysis, obtaining the Kolmogorov spectrum for the velocity field and the power law for the spin field.
4. The paper considers the assumptions used in the derivation of the Kolmogorov and power laws and notes that it is difficult to theoretically confirm their validity. The paper then shows numerical results to confirm these theoretical considerations. The numerical calculation introduces a phenomenological small-scale energy dissipation term into the Gross-Pitaevsk",0

3. The inverted spectra are not caused by resolution effect, but intrinsic properties of the cores, as there is little diffuse contamination in the NMA measurements from dust, free-free, and extended nonthermal emissions for LLAGNs showing inverted spectra.
4. The study finds an inverse correlation between the high-frequency radio spectrum and the low-frequency radio core power, suggesting that flux ratios between the jet showing steep spectrum and the ADAF disc showing inverted spectrum are different from LLAGN to LLAGN.

Studies of these processes have provided insight into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains.
2. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and this dependence can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law. The ratio of total to selective extinction is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.
3. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, and significant deviations from the canonical R0 value are known to exist for a variety of interstellar dust clouds. These variations appear to be generally correlated with environment, and can be tied to variations in the size distribution of dust grains and chemical composition.",0

* The Kondo scale marks the screening of local magnetic moments, while the coherence temperature is believed to track this scale and corresponds to the emergence of a paramagnetic heavy fermion liquid.
* The RKKY interaction, which couples local moments via the magnetic polarization of conduction electrons, competes with Kondo screening and can lead to quantum phase transitions between paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states.
* Two scenarios have been proposed to describe this quantum phase transition: the Herzt-Millis picture, in which the quasi-particles of the heavy fermion liquid remain intact and undergo a spin-density wave transition, and alternative scenarios in which the quantum critical point is linked to the breakdown of the quasi-particle state and a topological reorganization of the Fermi surface.
2. The Kondo lattice model (KLM) describes an array of localized magnetic moments that are coupled antiferromagnetically to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons.
* The KLM excludes charge fluctuations on the localized orbitals, leading to a strict constraint of one electron per localized orbital.
* The KLM is solved using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the Kondo effect but neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size.
* The DCA relies on the coarse-graining of momentum space and momentum conservation holds only between momentum space patches, allowing for the restoration of momentum-dependency in the self-energy.
3. The DCA implementation of the KLM approximates the Fourier space of a lattice with two-point basis by patching, leading to real-space clusters of size 4, each encompassing 4 f- and d-orbitals.

This discovery may also affect the field of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
2. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature could make the Higgs responsible for inflation and suppress the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields. Recent LHC experiments have discussed upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons, and bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity can be obtained by considering strong-gravity astrophysical objects.
3. The presence of strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, affecting the mass of fundamental particles like the electron. Molecular transitions, primarily influenced by nuclei, would be minimally affected. Peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions, while molecular transitions remain largely unchanged.
4. White dwarfs can be used to study the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant by examining spectroscopic observations. By focusing on the Swan bands of a carbon-rich white dwarf, BPM 27606, researchers can search for the putative Higgs shift and compare it with laboratory spectra or spectra gathered from weak-gravity astrophysical sources.",0
165,"1. White dwarf (WD) stars, specifically the spectral class DA, represent the end points of stellar evolution for most low-mass stars and are the fate of over 97% of all stars in our galaxy.
2. When DA WDs cool to foster a hydrogen partial ionization zone, they begin pulsating as they pass through the ZZ Ceti (or DAV) instability strip, where their fundamental parameters can be determined using asteroseismology.
3. The ZZ Ceti instability strip is believed to be pure, with all DA WDs passing through it and pulsating at some point.
4. Much work has been devoted to mapping the ZZ Ceti instability strip, which runs in temperature from roughly 11,000 K for standard log(g)=8.0 WDs.
5. The discovery of pulsating extremely low-mass (ELM) WDs provides a new opportunity to explore the nature of WD pulsations at cooler temperatures and much lower masses.
6. ELM WDs are likely the product of binary evolution and are expected to harbor helium cores, contrasting with the carbon-oxygen cores of more massive WDs.
7. The pulsating ELM WDs will be useful in constraining the interior composition, hydrogen-layer mass, overall mass, rotation rate, and the behavior of convection in these low-mass WDs.

2. The link between star formation and molecular gas is probably not causal, but the molecular gas is an indispensable tracer of star forming regions in the local and distant universe. Understanding the links between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution requires identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas is able to develop.
3. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores that develop in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Tracking molecular chemistry is crucial to accurately represent small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations of star-forming clouds.
4. Young, massive stars are the main source of far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons that permeate the ISM and readily photodissociate interstellar molecules. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity.
5. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, called photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively both numerically and theoretically. The outer, unshielded layers of a PDR are composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon, while deeper layers are dominated by the presence of deep penetrating cosmic rays and the freeze out of molecules onto dust grains.
6. Simulating the ISM is computationally challenging due to the enormous range of spatial scales involved and the non-trivial implementation of various energetic stellar feedback mechanisms. Three-dimensional simulations of finite, but representative, portions of galactic disks have had some success in replicating a multiphase ISM and demonstrating the regulation of the star formation rate by stellar feedback. However, studies on the atomic-to-molecular transition within large-scale, three-dimensional simulations have received less attention.",0

2. The overdensity, labeled as VRC, has been found to have a redder color than the primary red clump and is located at a distance of about 2 kpc.
3. The VRC has been suggested to be responsible for a significant fraction of the microlensing signal towards the LMC, which is generally attributed to microlensing by compact objects in the halo of the Milky Way.
4. However, this interpretation has been challenged on several grounds, including the lack of evidence for a foreground population in the MACHO team's photometric database.
5. The MACHO team has found an overdensity of stars in their color-magnitude diagram, but they argue that it is unlikely to be the VRC and is instead another stage of stellar evolution.
6. Gould has argued that any luminous foreground population would have to meet certain criteria, such as not extending more than 5 degrees from the LMC center or having a stellar mass-to-light ratio 10 times that of known populations.
7. Johnston has analyzed the proposition that an ad hoc tidal streamer could explain the microlensing optical depth towards the LMC and concluded that it would cause unobserved overdensities or require precise alignment with the LMC.
8. Bennett has argued that a recently-determined stellar mass function combined with the assumption that the putative foreground population has a star formation history similar to the LMC results in an implied microlensing optical depth that is only a small fraction of that determined by microlensing observations.
9. The authors argue that the VRC feature originates in the LMC itself and is due to stellar evolution, not an intervening population.
10. The authors use BVR CCD photometry of several fields at different locations in the LMC to confirm the presence of substructure in the red clump morphology corresponding to the VRC and demonstrate that it corresponds precisely in magnitude and color to the so-called ""blue loops"" experienced by aging intermediate-mass core helium-burning stars.",0

2. Two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations are now considered essential for a proper description of data, leading to a growing interest in incorporating 2p-2h models into Monte Carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations.
3. The only 2p-2h model currently implemented in some Monte Carlo neutrino event generators is the IFIC Valencia model, while other phenomenological approaches like the Effective Transverse Enhancement Model are used in generators like NuWro.
4. A major challenge in implementing 2p-2h models is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved in evaluating the inclusive hadronic tensor.
5. Approximations such as using an average momentum for nucleons in the local Fermi gas, neglecting exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations can be made to speed up calculations.
6. This work presents a fast and efficient method for calculating inclusive 2p-2h responses in the Relativistic Fermi Gas Model (RFGM) using the Frozen Nucleon Approximation, which reduces the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1.

2. The mass of the SMBH in AGNs is correlated with the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the host galaxy.
3. The reverberation mapping technique is an independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole using the time lag between continuum and broad emission line variations.
4. The size of the broad line region (BLR) is obtained from the time lag, and the mass of the black hole is estimated using the velocity dispersion of the broad component of the emission lines and assuming virial equilibrium.
5. The reverberation mapping technique has been used to estimate SMBH masses over a large range of redshift, but it is observationally taxing and demands an enormous amount of telescope time.
6. A correlation between the BLR size and the optical continuum luminosity at 5100 Å has been found, which can be used to estimate SMBH masses from single-epoch spectra and calibrate other surrogate relations.
7. The extrapolation of the known BLR-luminosity relation to low luminosities suggests that the time lag between the variations of the broad line and the continuum will be of the order of hours to days.
8. The paper presents optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of a new low luminosity AGN, the X-ray source and Seyfert 1.5 galaxy H 0507 + 164, and estimates the mass of the SMBH using the reverberation mapping technique.

2. Experiments have partially achieved the simultaneous condensation of two different hyperfine spin states of the same atom, but the condensates do not completely interpenetrate in the stationary state.
3. Two-component Bose systems have a richer physics than one-component systems due to the spontaneous breaking of two global U(1) symmetries related to the separate conservation of the number of atoms of each species.
4. In systems of atoms of the same isotope in different spin states, a driving electromagnetic field can couple two condensates, allowing for the conversion of atoms between the two spin states and the lifting of the degeneracy of the ground state with respect to the relative phase.
5. A sufficiently small violation of the U(1) symmetry corresponding to the relative phase leads to the existence of a nontrivial static configuration, a domain wall inside which the relative phase changes, which is a local minimum of the energy but not topologically stable.
6. The rate of spontaneous decay of the domain wall is exponentially suppressed due to the energy barrier that must be overcome for the system to unwind the domain wall.",0
175,"1. Quantum field theory can have anomalies, which are violations of classical symmetries in the quantized version.
2. External symmetry breakdown is not dangerous, but internal symmetry (gauge symmetry) breakdown leads to issues with renormalizability and unitarity.
3. Gravitation, when regarded as a gauge theory, also suffers from anomalies, including Einstein, Lorentz, and Weyl anomalies.
4. Anomalies have been calculated using various methods, including perturbation theory, heat kernel method, Fujikawa's path integral approach, and mathematical techniques such as differential geometry and cohomology.
5. Schwinger terms, which are additional terms in the canonical algebra of equal time commutators, are deeply related to anomalies.
6. In gravitation, Schwinger terms occur in the equal time commutators of energy-momentum tensors and are related to gravitational anomalies.

2. * Experiments in 1970 at Platteville, Colorado, and Arecibo, Puerto Rico, demonstrated ionospheric modifications and the triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities.
3. * In the 1980s, it was observed that strong, structured, wide-band secondary HF radiation escapes from the interaction region in similar experiments.

178,"1. The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid-Mott insulator transitions in various systems, and its recent experimental observation in cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice has triggered renewed interest in the model.
2. The interplay of repulsive interaction and kinetic energy drives the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition, and the ratio of onsite energy to bandwidth is the key parameter, which can be easily controlled in optical lattices.
3. The Gutzwiller approach, which is a mean-field approximation, fails to describe the correct behavior of short-range correlations between different lattice sites, which are important for experimentally measurable observables such as expansion patterns.
4. To improve the Gutzwiller approximation, the authors derive perturbative corrections to the mean-field result to get a satisfactory description of the short-range correlations.
5. The authors use Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory to calculate the corrections to observables up to second order and find important modifications to single-site observables and correlation functions.
6. The perturbative results reproduce the non-vanishing part of number fluctuations in the Mott insulator regime and agree well with exact diagonalization results for a one-dimensional system.",0
179,"1. Scalar fields arise naturally in higher-dimensional theories such as string or m-theory, and can lead to accelerating cosmologies. A recent paper discusses the compactification of a time-dependent volume modulus on a compact hyperbolic manifold, which results in a flat expanding universe with a transient period of accelerating expansion. This behavior is typical for compactifications involving compact hyperbolic spaces or non-vanishing flux.
2. The positive scalar field potential produced by hyperbolic and flux compactifications leads to a simple understanding of transient acceleration. The target space of scalar fields can be visualized in a phase-plane parametrized by the first time-derivatives of the dilaton and the scale factor. In some cases, all possible cosmological trajectories can be found explicitly.
3. The paper aims to generalize this analysis to the multi-scalar case and determine the model-independent behavior of cosmologies with more general scalar potentials. A new method of visualizing cosmological solutions is developed, which applies to any potential. Exponential potentials serve as reference potentials in determining the late-time behavior of cosmologies arising in a large class of models with other potentials.
4. The analysis is based on the observation that flat cosmological solutions of gravity coupled to scalar fields with potential can be viewed as null geodesics in an augmented target space. Trajectories in this space corresponding to non-flat cosmologies are neither null nor geodesic. The extension of these results to higher-dimensional cosmologies is straightforward.
5. The paper also introduces the notion of the acceleration cone, which provides a simple analysis of acceleration. Cosmologies arising in exponential-potential models fit into the new framework, and other potentials of current interest are also considered.",0

181,"• The text discusses the MAVANs scenario, a cosmological model where relic neutrinos form a negative pressure fluid and cause cosmic acceleration through an unknown scalar field called the ""acceleron."" The neutrino mass is given by the acceleron and depends on its number density, changing with the evolution of the universe. The equation of state parameter and dark energy density also evolve with the neutrino mass.

• The text also discusses the impact of supersymmetry in the MAVANs scenario. A chiral superfield is introduced in the dark sector, which is assumed to be a singlet under the gauge group of the standard model. The superfield couples to both the left-handed lepton doublet superfield and the right-handed neutrino superfield. The scalar component of the superfield is assumed to be the acceleron, which causes the present cosmic acceleration, and the spinor component is a sterile neutrino. The lepton number conservation in the dark sector is violated in this scenario, leading to a variable neutrino mass matrix.",0
182,"1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a state of matter in which quarks and gluons are liberated from hadrons, and its phase transition structure is a major focus of research in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
2. Experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron in the 1980s and 1990s and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider since 2005 have provided evidence for the formation of the QGP.
3. The QGP can also be created in the initial stage of a ""little big bang"" through relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions in heavy ion accelerators.
4. The critical temperature and baryon density for the transition to the QGP have been calculated for non-interacting, massless up and down quarks and gluons.
5. A calculation of the QGP thermodynamic properties with non-zero interaction for the region where both temperature and baryon density are non-zero has not been presented in the literature.
6. This work generalizes previous calculations for the region with finite temperature and baryon density by considering weakly interacting quarks in the framework of the one gluon exchange scheme.",0
183,"1. In 1919, H. Weyl proposed a conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies, which retains its form under a conformally-flat metrical field.
	* This model describes confinement of quarks and gluons through the introduction of two scalar fields that break the symmetry down to subgroups.
	* A symmetric second-order tensor field serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.
	* Quarks and gluons are confined to an AdS universe with a finite radius in the flat space-time.
2. The model of ref. [xcite] comprises one real scalar field and one complex scalar field.
	* Their dynamical equations were solved for the case that the respective vacuum expectation values satisfy a specific relation.
	* A solution of particular interest leads to AdS confinement via the associated conformally flat metric.
	* Under the condition of relation ([slvacua]), one obtains a light scalar field associated with confinement and a very heavy complex field associated with electromagnetism.
3. Weak interactions were not contemplated in ref. [xcite], but the model can be interpreted as electroweak for electromagnetism.
	* The conformally symmetric model does not easily allow for interactions between hadrons, as each hadron is described by a closed universe.
	* To compare the properties of this model with actual measurements, the model has been further simplified to retain only its main property, namely its flavor-independent oscillations.
	* This way, the full AdS spectrum is coupled to the channels of two or more hadronic decay products for which scattering amplitudes can be measured.
4. The AdS spectrum reveals itself through the structures observed in hadronic mass distributions.
	* However, there is no simple relation between enhancements in experimental cross sections and the AdS spectrum.
	* An AdS oscillation frequency of 190 MeV agrees well with observed results for meson-meson scattering and meson-pair production in various flavor sectors.
	* The coupling of quark-antiquark components to real and virtual two-meson decay channels via quark-pair creation gives a clue about the size of the mass of the scalar field.

184,"1. Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon where the addition of noise to a system can improve the transmission of a signal, and it has been observed in various fields such as physics, biology, and engineering. It is usually measured using statistical quantities such as the Shannon mutual information or the Kullback divergence, but recently the Fisher information quantity has also been proposed.
2. In the context of estimation and hypotheses testing, stochastic resonance can occur in a model with a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal, where a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process is added in continuous time. The paper proposes two schemes of observations: observing the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold, and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.
3. The paper also notes the presence of stochastic resonance in the context of hypotheses testing, where the overall probability of error is nonmonotonicly dependent on the noise level. This is shown through an example where the phenomenon of stochastic resonance is observed in both cases of the proposed observation schemes.",0
185,"1. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have been found to have mainly d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant d-gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature. This symmetry has been confirmed through try-crystal phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements. However, deviations from the expected angular pattern have been attributed to the effect of pinning of vortices.
2. The variation of the thermal conductivity as a function of angle depends mainly on the heat transport by quasiparticles, their interaction with the supercurrents (vortices), and the symmetry of the order parameter. The nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity at low temperatures, where the quasiparticle momentum is close to the nodal directions of the gap.
3. The paper aims to clarify the temperature range at which the nodal characteristics of the gap are observable and whether the thermal activation of quasiparticles can explain the experimental results in the whole temperature range. The authors calculate numerically the thermal conductivity at different angles and temperatures, assuming an Andreev reflection model for the scattering of quasiparticles by supercurrents.
4. The experimental results show that the overall results agree with the theoretical model and confirm the predominance of the d-gap up to the superconducting critical temperature. The measurements provide new results that improve the knowledge of the thermal transport at temperatures at which the nodal properties of the gap are not directly observable. The authors also discuss the influence of pinning of vortices and the distribution of the oxygen vacancies in the sample on the measurements.",0
186,"• The paper studies purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere, showing that for most knots, distinct slopes result in non-homeomorphic oriented manifolds. 
• The authors prove this by introducing a surgery formula by Lescop and showing that it is equal to a knot invariant that satisfies a crossing change formula, and is a finite type invariant of order 5. They then use this reformulation to prove the nonexistence of purely cosmetic surgery on certain families of two-bridge knots and whitehead doubles.",0
187,"1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties such as calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms and renormalization group invariant soft terms, but they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters leading to tachyonic states. A solution to this problem is to add a universal scalar mass to the AMSB soft supersymmetry breaking terms.
2. Hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB) is a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB, with supersymmetry breaking localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region and anomaly mediation becoming the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector. The bino mass can be the only soft supersymmetry breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation, and it can lead to a small or large perturbation to the spectrum of anomaly mediation.
3. The minimal AMSB model predicts a negative mass squared for the sleptons and relatively heavy squarks, while pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms and relatively heavy sleptons. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.
4. The hcamsb ssb contribution is parametrized using a dimensionless quantity that governs the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms relative to the AMSB contribution. The ssb terms and superpotential term are given by the scalar potential minimization conditions which emerge from requiring an appropriate breakdown of electroweak symmetry.
5. The hcamsb model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if the gluino is not too large, due to the presence of gluino cascade decay events in hcamsb models. The mass ordering difference between the two models gives rise to a crucial distinction in LHC supersymmetry cascade decay events, which may serve to distinguish the two models.",0
188,"1. The zero range potential (ZRP) approach has been developed to widen the limits of traditional scattering theory and can be represented as a boundary condition or a pseudopotential.
2. Darboux transformation (DT) can be used to construct exactly solvable potentials and modify the generalized ZRP (GZRP) boundary condition.
3. The DT technique can be used to correct the ZRP model and dress a multi-centered potential, which includes ZRPs, for use in electron scattering by structures.
4. The radial Schrödinger equation for partial wave with angular momentum l can describe the scattering of a particle with energy E.
5. The potential and wavefunctions can be expressed in terms of spherical functions, which have asymptotic behavior near zero.
6. The spectral problem for GZRP is solved for any value of the energy, and the DT leads to transformations of the potentials and wavefunctions.
7. The dressed potential is real for real function f, and the ZRP can be introduced in terms of DT.
8. The DT introduces a short-range core of centrifugal type in the potential, and the boundary conditions on the dressed wavefunctions require modification.",0
189,"1. The convection-diffusion model is a semi-linear parabolic partial differential equation used to describe various phenomena in science and engineering. It can be expressed as an initial value system of partial differential equations with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. The parameters in the model include constant convective velocities and diffusion coefficients in the x and y directions.
2. Many numerical methods have been developed to solve the convection-diffusion equation, including finite element method, lattice boltzmann method, finite-difference scheme, and higher-order compact finite difference schemes. A nine-point high-order compact implicit scheme proposed by Noye and Tan is third-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time, and has a large zone of stability.
3. The differential quadrature method (DQM) is an approximation to derivatives of a function, which is the weighted sum of the functional values at certain nodes. The weighting coefficients of the derivatives depend only on grids, which is why uniform partitions in each direction are used. The DQM can be used to transform the convection-diffusion problem into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in time, which can be solved by various time integration algorithms.
4. The paper uses the modified trigonometric cubic b-splines DQM (MTB-DQM), modified exponential cubic b-splines DQM (MEXP-DQM), and modified trigonometric cubic-b-spline DQM (MTCDQ) to solve the initial value system of the 3D convection-diffusion equation with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The resulting system of ODEs can be solved by using various time integration algorithms, such as the SSP-RK54 scheme.
5. The accuracy and adaptability of the method are illustrated by three test problems of two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations. The rest of the paper is organized into five more sections, which deal with the description of the methods, the procedure for implementation, stability analysis, numerical computation, and conclusion.",0

The text discusses the use of bolometer arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths to detect dusty objects at extreme redshifts, which may be missed in surveys at other wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavorable @xmath11 corrections. The discovery of ""scuba galaxies"" in the late 1990s led to a shift away from optocentric views of galaxy formation and evolution. However, efforts to study these galaxies at optical and infrared wavelengths were initially met with pessimism due to the lack of plausible optical counterparts.
* Recent progress in the study of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) has been made through radio imaging of survey fields, which has allowed for the detection and identification of a diverse population of SMGs. These galaxies have been found to have a wide range of properties, including some with broad lines and X-ray detections, morphologically complex galaxies, extremely red galaxies, and galaxies with obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds.
* Spectroscopic redshifts for SMGs have been difficult to determine, but accurate redshifts reported by Chapman et al. (2003, 2005) have facilitated the first systematic measurements of molecular gas mass and constraints on gas reservoir size and dynamical mass for SMGs. These data suggest that SMGs are massive systems and provide some of the strongest tests of galaxy formation models to date. However, a detailed understanding of SMGs remains a distant goal, and confusion and selection biases may have skewed our understanding of this population.",0

2. At the Tevatron, 1% of dijet events exhibit rapidity gaps, suggesting perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions.
3. However, recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations show no decrease in gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum, contradicting predictions of the two-gluon exchange model.
4. The paper argues that determining the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative and demonstrates this using a unitarized model.",0

3. * The text also cites previous works on time series analysis, appliance usage prediction, and short-term electricity prices forecasting using ANNs.

194,"1. Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole, orbits a low mass star. The secondary star transfers mass to the compact object via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk that emits X-rays.
2. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z sources and atoll sources. Z sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and have high accretion rates, while atoll sources have lower accretion rates and their X-ray color-color diagrams consist of fragmented island-like regions.
3. The main physical difference between Z sources and atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.
4. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z source and is therefore thought to be a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit.
5. Despite being X-ray luminous and having a known optical counterpart, little is known about the system parameters of LMCX-2, such as its orbital period.
6. A new technique using phase-resolved spectroscopy has been developed to detect a signature of the donor star in persistent LMXBs. This technique has been used to detect narrow emission lines in several LMXBs, leading to constraints on their system parameters.
7. The authors of this paper apply the technique of bowen fluorescence to LMCX-2 and detect a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset that they identify as the orbital period.
8. They also detect narrow emission lines in the bowen region, which they identify as coming from the irradiated side of the companion, giving the first ever constraints on the system parameters of LMCX-2.
9. The authors suggest that the observed properties of LMCX-2 could be explained by the presence of an inclined precessing, warped, accretion disk, as is also observed in Hercules X-1 and SS433.",0
195,"1. The axial anomaly, a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, has been analyzed using the renormalization procedure and the path integral formalism. An alternative approach by Dolgov and Zakharov interprets the anomaly as an infrared phenomenon, originating from a singularity in the chiral limit of the triangular diagram. This infrared interpretation complements the more familiar ultraviolet interpretation from the renormalization procedure.
2. The Dolgov and Zakharov approach has been related to specific effects in physical reactions, such as the radiative decays of particles. They calculate decay rates for polarized radiative decays, showing that the axial anomaly can be connected to polarized radiative decays. The kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem is discussed in the context of these decays, considering analogies and differences with unpolarized decay rates.
3. The paper also studies the behavior of the inner bremsstrahlung contribution to the pion decay rate in the collinear and infrared limits, and examines a more general process involving a right-handed polarized lepton. The authors argue that the manifestation of the axial anomaly is closely connected to terms of all powers in the lepton mass in the inner bremsstrahlung amplitude.",0
196,"1. Salient object detection is the process of simulating human attention to prioritize objects in a scene for high-level processing. It has various applications such as recognition, image and video compression, video summarization, media re-targeting and photo collage, image quality assessment, image segmentation, content-based image retrieval and image collection browsing, image editing and manipulating, visual tracking, object discovery, and human-robot interaction.
2. A large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past 7 years, with most models focusing on scenes with single objects. These models perform well on segmenting the object area but struggle with complex cluttered scenes with several objects due to the lack of suitable benchmark datasets and a widely-agreed objective definition of the most salient object.
3. Recent trends in salient object detection include the integration of pattern and color distinctnesses with high-level cues, the use of graphical models for fusing generic objectness and visual saliency, and the consideration of the relationship between fixations and saliency judgments. However, there is still a need for more versatile datasets and remedies for biases in salient object datasets.",0
197,"1. Heegaard Floer theory is a decorated topological quantum field theory in 2 dimensions, constructed by Ozsváth and Szabó. It associates a vector space to a closed, connected, oriented 3-manifold and a map to a connected, oriented 4-dimensional cobordism decorated with a 2-structure. These maps can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary.
2. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, which are related to the 3-manifolds and cobordisms involved via Heegaard diagrams. However, Sarkar and the third author showed that every 3-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that is nice in the sense that the curves split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles. Using such a diagram, holomorphic disks in the symmetric product can be counted combinatorially, resulting in a combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of any 3-manifold and null homologous knots and links in any 3-manifold. A similar result was obtained for all versions of the Heegaard Floer homology of knots and links in the 3-sphere.",0
198,"1. The paper extends the deformation theory of associative algebras and poset-indexed diagrams of associative algebras to arbitrary pasting diagrams of linear categories, functors, and natural transformations.
2. The author establishes that obstructions are cocycles for deformation complexes of pasting diagrams in general, and introduces the concept of deformations subject to certain restrictions, which could be useful in other settings.
3. The paper also addresses a point overlooked in previous theorems, stating that cochain maps constructed in those theorems depend on choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions in the pasting diagram, and that these cochain maps are independent of those choices up to algebraic homotopy.",0
199,"1. The aim in physics is not just to calculate observables but to understand the physical picture behind phenomena.
2. In crystals, for example, the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field, but understanding electric conductivity and heat capacity requires working with ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interactions.
3. Similarly, in QCD, the full nonquenched QCD on the lattice is hoped to give the correct nucleon and pion mass, but at the scale of 1 GeV, it becomes too complicated to determine the relevant physics for the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties.
4. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important QCD phenomenon for the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties.
5. Beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting via the exchange of Goldstone bosons, vector and scalar mesons, and confinement.
6. In the chiral limit, the sum rule for the spin-spin component of the pseudoscalar-exchange interaction indicates a strong short-range term, which is crucial for baryons.
7. The spin-orbit component associated with the vector-meson exchange interaction is big and empirically very important in the nn system, but becomes inessential in baryons.
8. The reason for this remarkable phenomenon is an explicit flavor dependence of the vector-meson-exchange ls force, which leads to a strong cancellation of the π- and ρ-meson exchange spin-orbit forces in baryons.",0

- The foil electron multiplier is a new type of electron multiplier that uses a series of thin foils to amplify electrons in a series of transmission stages.
* The foils are held in an evacuated enclosure and voltage is applied to each foil to accelerate electrons and generate secondary electrons.
* The secondary electrons are then transmitted through the next foil in the series, adding to the transmitted electrons and continuing on to the next foil.
* This process results in a higher gain per multiplication stage and an increased multiplication efficiency in the foil electron multiplier compared to other types of electron multipliers.

- The foil electron multiplier has several advantages over other types of electron multipliers.
* It is simpler and less expensive to fabricate, as the foil fabrication process is less complex than that of continuous multipliers such as MCPs.
* It can cover a larger area and is more robust, as foils can be evaporated over large surface areas and are less likely to break than MCPs.
* It also exhibits an intrinsic rejection of ion feedback at each stage, as ions generated at one foil cannot be re-transmitted back due to their low energy.

- The foil electron multiplier is well-suited for use in photomultiplier tubes and particle detectors, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates.
* It can be used for amplification of an incident electron flux or for detection of particles such as photons, ions, and electrons.
* The anode of the foil electron multiplier can be made from a scintillator material that converts electron energy to light, or it can be electrically connected to sensing electronics that measure the output charge or current deposited onto the anode.

- The gain of a foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, maximizing the transmission through the support grid, and maximizing the secondary electron emission yield.
* A preferred embodiment uses as thin of a foil as possible to minimize the required stage bias, but a trade-off exists as an extremely thin foil may require a grid for structural support, which results in a reduced gain.

- The foil electron multiplier can handle incident particles with different charges, including negatively",0

* The 3-D Phenomenoscope is a system that allows for the viewing of 3-dimensional effects in motion pictures using ordinary film or digital technology.
* The system utilizes glasses with individually controllable lenses, a digital photo sensor, a computer processor, and a means to provide individual control for the darkening of the right and left hand lenses based on identified synchronization events.
* The control for the viewing glasses is not a wired, wireless, or infrared signal, but information calculated in real-time from successive frames of the motion picture.
* The lenses of the viewing goggles may take 3 different states: clear-clear, clear-darkened, and darkened-clear.
* The viewing glasses look like ordinary lightweight glasses with an attached digital sensor that ‘sees’ and quantifies the digital snapshot captured by the digital sensor.
* The system works regardless of the viewing media, such as TV, film, DVD, computer monitor, liquid crystal display, plasma display, etc.
* The system overcomes problems of providing 3-dimensional illusions in motion pictures and allows for older motion pictures to be viewed with a 3-dimensional effect.
* The system does not require any special equipment for the filming or projection of the motion picture.
* The battery-powered viewer glasses are controlled in real-time by an intelligent processor packaged with the glasses, so 3-dimensional viewing works equally well whether the movie is viewed on a TV, DVD player, PC, or in a movie house.

• The invention relates to networks, specifically home networks with power management systems.
• Power management is important in home networks because network appliances can consume several hundred watts per hour, whether or not they are performing non-network functions.
• Currently, a network master node must perform network administrative functions even when not performing its own functions, leading to high energy consumption.

The successful development of advanced technologies, such as composite materials, avionics, propulsion systems, and software, is critical to achieving these capabilities. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals to realize significantly lower operating and support costs and achieve a wartime operational availability of 6 hours per day.
2. In 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program due to budgetary constraints, reducing funding from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. This restructure extended the development phase by 3 years, called for two flyable prototypes, and deferred the production decision. The Army proposed a restructure to acquire six additional aircraft within the Secretary's funding constraint, which was approved. However, this restructure continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft can perform as required and higher program costs.
3. Under the Army's restructured program, operational testing will not begin until after the low-rate initial production decision is made, continuing the risks associated with the highly concurrent Comanche program. The Army plans to fund six ""early operational capability"" aircraft, estimated to cost over $300 million, by deferring additional developmental efforts to fiscal years 2002 and beyond. These aircraft will be used to better evaluate the Comanche's mission capability, but they are not considered prototype or low-rate initial production aircraft.

Ginnie Mae does not buy or sell loans or issue mortgage-backed securities, but instead provides guarantees backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government that investors will receive timely payments of principal and interest on securities supported by pools of government-backed loans.
3. Ginnie Mae has several different products, including Ginnie Mae I, Ginnie Mae II, and Multiclass Securities Program, which include Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMIC) and Ginnie Mae Platinum Securities.
4. Ginnie Mae MBS face prepayment risk, but not credit risk, because the underlying mortgages are federally insured or guaranteed. Issuers are responsible for delinquent loans in pools and Ginnie Mae charges issuers a guarantee fee for providing its guarantee of timely payment.
5. Ginnie Mae securities finance the great majority of FHA and VA loans, but the agency faces potential competition from other secondary market entities and has seen a decline in its share of the total MBS market over the last 20 years.
6. Ginnie Mae has consistently captured 90 percent or more of the market for FHA and VA loans due to the difficulty of competing with the government guarantee of timely payment.
7. The Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, state and local government agencies, and private label issuers have had limited or no involvement in Ginnie Mae’s market and do not appear to have plans to encroach on Ginnie Mae’s market to any substantial degree.

However, due to DOD's accounting accuracy problems, additional reviews are needed to correct the reversed transactions, and the exact amount that remains to be corrected is unknown.
• Of the remaining $23 million in adjustments, $8 million have been deemed proper, but $15 million are still considered unnecessary or unsupported by DOD. These adjustments involved 45 contracts, 30 of which required reversals that identified additional accounting errors.
• DFAS officials estimate that it will take over 21,000 hours to correct the accounting for the 30 contracts. For example, in one case, $210 million of closed account adjustments were made due to an inability to pay a $685,000 invoice, but the initial disbursement was recorded correctly. The reversal of these adjustments created new errors that must now be corrected.
• DOD has not yet completed the necessary reaudits to correct the fiscal year 2000 illegal and otherwise improper adjustments, and the implementation of effective system controls to prevent illegal adjustments is still not complete. Of the $1.9 billion in closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2001, $172 million were illegal or otherwise improper.
• To address these issues, the GAO recommends that DOD's top management demonstrate a commitment to adhering to the account closing law and eliminate abuses of appropriations law.

3. IRS uses a workpaper standard to ensure that workpapers meet certain requirements, and the primary tool for controlling quality is the review of ongoing audit work by first-line supervisors, called group managers.
4. Our observations about the adequacy of audit workpapers and supervisory review are based on a random sample of individual tax returns audited in 1994-1995, and we found several cases where workpapers did not meet IRS' workpaper standard.
5. We held discussions with IRS officials about workpaper and supervisory review requirements, and agreed to check for documentation of group manager involvement in nine sample audits from the Northern California District Office.
6. IRS' workpaper standard includes five key elements: fully disclosing the audit trail, being clear and organized, ensuring tax adjustments agree with forms, documenting audit activity records, and protecting taxpayers' rights.
7. We found problems with IRS audit workpapers, such as tax adjustments not agreeing in workpapers, summaries, and reports, required documents or summaries not being in the workpaper bundle, and workpapers not being legible or complete.
8. IRS has historically found problems with the quality of its workpapers, with IRS auditors meeting all key elements of the workpaper standard in no more than 72% of audits in the past six years.

2. Federal law requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes and to provide services to families and children with the goal of reuniting them. If reunification is not possible, the state must find permanent placement for the child outside the family home.
3. To expedite the permanency planning process, 26 states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing, often requiring the hearing to be held within 12 months.

According to GSA, its Federal Technology Service, in conjunction with the IMC, is responsible for ensuring that federal agencies have access to the telecommunications services and solutions needed to meet mission requirements. Its current program to provide long-distance telecommunications services—FTS2001—has two goals: to ensure the best service and price for the government, and to maximize competition for services. In implementing this program strategy, GSA awarded two contracts for long-distance services—one to Sprint in December 1998 and one to MCI WorldCom in January 1999. Under the terms of these contracts, each firm was guaranteed minimum revenues of $750 million over the life of the contracts, which run for four base years and have four 1-year-extension options. If all contract options are exercised, those contracts will expire in December 2006 and January 2007, respectively. According to GSA, federal agencies spent approximately $614 million on FTS2001 services during fiscal year 2003 alone. Related governmentwide telecommunications services are provided by other GSA contracts: the Federal Wireless Telecommunications Service contract and the FTS Satellite Service contracts. The wireless contract was awarded in 1996 to provide wireless telecommunications products and services to all federal agencies, authorized federal contractors, and other users. The satellite services contracts are a series of contracts for a variety of commercial off-the-shelf satellite communications products and services, including mobile, fixed, and broadcast services.

452,"1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two disability programs: Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs use the same definition of disability, but have different purposes and requirements. DI is an insurance program for individuals who have worked a certain amount and paid Social Security taxes, while SSI is a needs-based program for individuals with limited income and resources.
2. DI benefits are based on the worker's earnings history and are paid for by payroll taxes. After receiving DI benefits for 24 months, individuals are typically eligible for Medicare. SSI benefits, on the other hand, are paid for by general revenues and are a standard minimum level of income. In most states, entitlement to SSI means automatic entitlement to Medicaid.
3. To be considered disabled under either program, an individual must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that has lasted or is expected to last at least one year or result in death, and that prevents the individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity.
4. Both programs have work incentive provisions to encourage beneficiaries to return to work. However, the provisions differ in terms of the level of safeguards for continuing eligibility, income, and medical coverage. For example, earnings do not affect a DI beneficiary's cash benefit for a trial work period, but will eventually stop benefits if earnings exceed a certain level. In contrast, earnings can affect an SSI beneficiary's cash benefit immediately, but the reduction in benefits is gradual.
5. Approximately 1.2 million individuals receive benefits from both DI and SSI, known as concurrent beneficiaries. These individuals are more likely to have mental impairments and be female, with an average age of 45. About 11 percent of concurrent beneficiaries work, with a median earned income of about $250 a month.
6. SSA field offices use employees who specialize in either the Social Security programs, including the DI program, or the SSI program. However, there is little coordination between the two programs, making it difficult for specialists to determine the effect of work on benefits in the other program. This can lead to overpayments and a lack of understanding about the work incentive provisions.

473,"• The Single Audit Act of 1984 was enacted to address concerns about the lack of adequate oversight and accountability for federal assistance provided to state and local governments. The act aimed to replace multiple grant audits with a single audit of an entity as a whole, promote sound financial management, establish uniform requirements for audits, reduce burdens on state and local governments, and ensure that federal departments and agencies rely on audit work done pursuant to the act.

• The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the Single Audit Act of 1984, established uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients, and required the Director of OMB to designate a Federal Audit Clearinghouse as the single audit repository. The criteria for determining which entities are required to have a single audit are based on the total amount of federal awards expended by the entity, with the dollar threshold criteria targeted toward achieving audit coverage for 95 percent of direct federal assistance to local governments. OMB increased the dollar threshold for requirement of a single audit to $500,000 in 2003 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003.

474,"1. Medicare, a federal health insurance program, currently uses health insurers to process and pay claims, but the number of such companies willing to serve as Medicare contractors has declined.
• This has led to concerns about the program's reliance on a shrinking pool of contractors and the need to broaden the pool of entities allowed to be contractors.
• Subsequent regulations and practices have further limited how the program contracts for claims administration services.
2. Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms, such as directly choosing contractors on a competitive basis, allowing contractors to specialize in specific functions, and paying contractors based on performance.
• These reforms could lead to efficiency and performance improvements, greater efficiency, better program management, and a more competitive and diverse pool of contractors.
• However, implementing such reforms would not be without challenges, and careful consideration and planning would be needed to ensure a smooth transition.
3. The program's use of health insurers for claims administration may have made sense when Medicare was created, but the explosion in information technology has increased the potential for using new types of business entities.
• The agency has repeatedly submitted legislative proposals to repeal the provider nomination authority and make explicit its authority to contract for claims administration with entities other than health insurers.
• Allowing Medicare to have separate contractors for specific claims administration activities, also called functional contracting, could further improve program management.
4. Current regulations stipulate that, to qualify as an intermediary or carrier, the contracting organization must perform all of the Medicare claims administration functions.
• This has led to concerns about coordination difficulties and the need for effective coordination between different contractors, providers, and CMS staff.
• CMS has had some experience with functional contracting under authority granted in 1996 to hire entities other than health insurers to focus on program safeguards.
5. Allowing Medicare to offer financial incentives to contractors for high-quality performance may have benefits, such as encouraging contractor performance and potentially leading to improved program operations and lower administrative costs.

2. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) asked the Defense Science Board (DSB) to identify activities that could be outsourced to the private sector for greater efficiency.
3. The DSB's 1996 reports on outsourcing and reducing infrastructure costs concluded that DOD could save 30-40% of logistics costs by outsourcing support services, generating $7-12 billion in annual savings by FY2002.
4. The DSB's second task force report proposed that DOD focus on warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy-making, and oversight, while outsourcing all other activities, potentially saving $30 billion annually.
5. Of these savings, $6 billion was expected to come from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities, including inventory control points, distribution depots, maintenance depots, and installation supply and repair.
6. The DSB's $14 billion estimate for CONUS logistics costs is considered conservative, with the Navy reporting $8.5 billion in maintenance programs alone in FY1996.
7. DOD has opportunities to reduce logistics costs and improve performance by changing business processes, including using highly accurate information systems, consolidating activities, streamlining processes, and outsourcing where appropriate.
8. Public-private competition studies have shown that competition leads to increased efficiency and cost savings for both sectors, and adequate competition is key to achieving significant reductions.

476,"1. In 1993, both Congress and the administration agreed to cut federal employment levels to reduce costs and control deficits. This decision led to the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 and the National Performance Review, which aimed to reduce federal staffing levels by 272,900 FTE positions by 1999.
2. The National Performance Review recommended that any reductions be accomplished through agency efforts to streamline operations, reduce management control and headquarters positions, and improve government operations through reinvention and quality management techniques. Agencies were also required to measure their performance through strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual reports on program performance.
3. Between fiscal years 1993 and 1996, the federal civilian workforce was cut by about 12 percent, with certain agencies experiencing larger reductions, such as HUD (14%), DOI (13%), GSA (22%), NASA (13%), and OPM (42%).
4. To determine which components within HUD, DOI, GSA, NASA, and OPM were downsized and to what extent, the authors examined agency FTE data for fiscal years 1993 through 1996, organized by component. They selected one component from each agency based on the percentage it downsized, as well as other factors such as public interest, safety, and privatization of agency functions.
5. The authors selected HUD's Office of Housing and GSA's PBS because they accounted for the largest portion of their parent agencies' staffing reductions. They selected DOI's BOR due to its heavy downsizing and its central role in BOR operations, and focused on the Denver Reclamation Service Center. Within NASA, they focused on the Human Space Flight Program's centers, particularly KSC, due to public concerns about shuttle safety. They selected OPM's Investigations Service because many of its functions had been privatized.
6. To maintain performance in the selected components, agencies took actions such as refocusing their missions, reengineering work processes, and building and maintaining employee skills. These actions included consolidating functions, aligning operations with private sector business practices, modernizing data processing systems, placing increased decision-making authority in field offices, and increasing reliance on contractors.

3. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists play a crucial role in the MHSS medical readiness mission by providing mental health care that helps military personnel perform their duties before, during, and after combat.
4. While both professions can diagnose mental conditions and provide psychotherapy, only psychiatrists can treat mental disorders medically with medication due to their medical training.
5. Clinical psychologists, who do not require medical training, are trained in human development and behavior and approach diagnosing and treating mental illness from a psychosocial perspective.
6. The MHSS created the PDP to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists to allow them to prescribe psychotropic medication when needed.
7. The PDP was established in response to a conference report and is designed to train military psychologists in a 2-year training model that includes coursework and clinical experience.
8. The first PDP class began in August 1991 with four participants, and subsequent classes consisted of 2 years of training, including classroom and clinical components. PDP participants are trained to take medical histories, incorporate them into treatment plans, and prescribe medication for patients with certain types of mental disorders.

 * The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) was passed in 1968 to educate students with limited English proficiency and was reauthorized in 1994 to create four bilingual education grant programs.
 
 * These four programs are the only federal programs that specifically target instructional services to children with limited English proficiency.
 
 * Other federal programs, such as Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also address the needs of these children but do not exclusively target them.
 
 * Most services for children with limited English proficiency are funded with local and state dollars, not federal dollars.

2. The NCIC system is managed cooperatively by the FBI’s CJIS division and state and local agencies that access the system. An Advisory Process, consisting of an Advisory Policy Board and working groups, is responsible for establishing policy for NCIC use by federal, state, and local agencies.
3. Local level governance of NCIC use is performed by the CSA, a criminal justice agency that has overall responsibility for the administration and usage of NCIC, including providing quality assurance and training and assuring LEA compliance with operating procedures within its jurisdiction.
4. CJIS shares with the CSAs the responsibility for monitoring compliance with NCIC policy, as shown in figure 2. CJIS policy, as approved by the Board, calls for triennial audits of each CSA to assess the CSA’s compliance with NCIC policies, including the 2-hour entry requirement for reports of missing children.
5. During its audits, CJIS assesses the extent to which the CSAs are fulfilling the requirement to audit all LEAs that enter data into NCIC under their jurisdiction. CJIS and the Board have taken a number of steps to help ensure that LEAs implement the 2-hour entry requirement.
6. However, CJIS officials acknowledged that CSA audits would be more useful if they measured LEAs’ compliance with the 2-hour criterion and reviewed a sample of missing children records to assess compliance with the entry requirement, but CJIS and the Board do not require CSAs to incorporate either of these into their audits.
7. Officials from eight of the nine LEAs we contacted identified custody disputes and coordination with child welfare agencies as potential impediments to reporting missing children to NCIC in a timely manner or investigating these cases. CJIS and OJJDP could take additional steps to better position DOJ to carry out its oversight role over NCIC, with respect to helping ensure compliance with the 2-hour requirement.",0
500,"1. Automobile crashes are a significant source of injury and death in the United States, with nearly 29,000 traffic fatalities annually. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for reducing the number of traffic crashes and their consequences.
2. The report examines the independent effects of crash type, crash severity, automobile weight and size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender on the risk of injury in an automobile crash. It focuses on both crashworthiness (protecting automobile occupants) and aggressivity (protecting other roadway users struck by automobiles).
3. The report found that one-car crashes, particularly rollovers, are more dangerous than collisions with cars and light trucks. Men drivers and young drivers are disproportionately involved in one-car crashes, while women drivers and older drivers are more likely to be involved in collisions with cars and light trucks.
4. The report also found that different types of drivers and cars have different safety concerns. For example, unbelted drivers are more likely to suffer severe injuries and are more likely to be involved in crashes. Belted drivers, on the other hand, benefit from a degree of occupant protection that is not available to unbelted drivers.
5. The report recommends that efforts be made to reduce crash involvement rates, particularly for men and younger drivers, and to improve the crash protection offered by automobiles to women and older drivers so that it approaches the level enjoyed by men and younger drivers. It is important that occupant protection for women drivers and older drivers be improved without compromising the crash protection of men drivers and younger drivers.",0

The Department of Defense's (DOD) personal property program, which manages household goods moves for military servicemembers and DOD civilians, has remained largely unchanged for nearly 40 years. The program involves a complex process of qualifying carriers, soliciting rates, distributing moves, evaluating moving companies' performance, paying invoices, and settling claims.
2. In an effort to address some of the program's challenges, DOD previously evaluated three pilot programs and submitted recommendations to Congress in 2002. These recommendations included reengineering the liability and claims process, changing the acquisition process to implement performance-based service contracts, and implementing information technology improvements.
3. To respond to these recommendations, DOD developed the Families First program, which aims to improve the quality of household goods moves for servicemembers, DOD civilian employees, and their families. The program is executed by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, an Army service component command.
4. However, DOD has determined that it is not feasible to upgrade the current legacy data management system, TOPS, to support the goals of Families First. TOPS is being phased out due to software issues, lack of support for DOD's technology standards, poor reporting and data capabilities, and incompatibility with the Business Management Modernization Program.
5. Under the current program, servicemembers are provided with basic claims coverage using depreciated value for losses or damages incurred during a move. Additional coverage options are available for the servicemember to purchase.
6. DOD has taken some initial steps to implement Families First, including the development of a new information management system called DPS. However, the implementation of DPS has been delayed and TOPS will need to be functional for a large part of the Families First rollout.
7. Despite these challenges, DOD expects all types of moves to have full replacement value by March 1, 2008. DOD continues to rely on the implementation of DPS to achieve other program goals such as improving the quality of service and claims processing.",0

• Tobacco is a high-value, pesticide-intensive crop that is grown in 16 states in the United States and over 100 countries. The United States is the third largest exporter of unmanufactured tobacco, behind Brazil and Zimbabwe. The tobacco industry in the United States both exports tobacco to Japan and Western Europe and imports tobacco in increasing amounts from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Malawi, and Thailand.

• Most of the pesticides used on tobacco are widely used on food and other crops. However, for some pesticides, such as dimethomorph, fenamiphos, flumetralin, maleic hydrazide, mefenoxam, and sulfentrazone, most of the use in 1994 through 1998 was on tobacco. During the 1990s, tobacco producers in the United States commonly used 37 of the pesticides approved by EPA for such use. The actual number and amount of pesticides used on tobacco or other crops in any given year vary depending on factors such as the weather and the specific pests that become problematic.

• EPA conducts health risk assessments under its pesticide registration program to determine whether the use of individual pesticides can reasonably be expected not to harm human health. These risk assessments are based on EPA’s evaluations of the results of numerous scientific studies and tests that the agency requires pesticide manufacturers to carry out. EPA also assesses the health risks to smokers from exposure to pesticides used on tobacco by analyzing data on their toxicity and the residue levels that remain on tobacco and in tobacco smoke.

• EPA uses a “tiered” approach to evaluate residues on tobacco. That is, for tobacco, the agency requires additional residue data after the metabolism study only if it has shown that the combined residue levels of the pesticide itself and any harmful by-products exceed 0.1 parts per million (ppm)—the agency’s “threshold of concern” for residues on tobacco. EPA generally requires plant metabolism studies for green tobacco and may require data from field trials for both green and cured (aged) tobacco, depending upon the amount of residues that are identified.

3. • Fees vary in voluntary nature, with some having reasonable alternatives and others having no close alternatives, like radio station license fees.
4. • Agencies derive fee authority from the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 or specific statutory authority, with fees based on costs or public policy.
5. • The beneficiary-pays principle guides program funding, with general revenues for programs benefiting the general public, fees for user-focused programs, and a mix for dual-benefit programs.
6. • Fees can promote economic efficiency by allocating resources to the most highly valued uses and encouraging certain behaviors, like drug development or free trade.
7. • User fees can enhance equity by assigning costs to those who use and benefit from services, but may shift burden on those less able to pay, making ability-to-pay considerations important.
8. • Transitional measures, like grandfather clauses or phasing in increases, can address abrupt fee imposition concerns, but must balance efficiency, equity, and administrative costs.
9. • Determining a program's beneficiaries and benefits is not always clear-cut, and inconsistent implementation of OMB guidance on full cost accounting can complicate fee-setting.

* The Study Group's methods for assessing studies and involving practitioners were consistent with generally accepted social science research practices and standards.
* However, 8 of the 18 experts interviewed noted that the What Works criteria created an unrealistically high standard, potentially overlooking promising programs.
* OJJDP officials approved the group's use of the criteria due to their methodological rigor and goal to identify effective programs.
2. The Study Group found that few girls' delinquency programs had been studied and that the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs.
* Of the 61 identified programs, 44 had not been studied, and none of the 17 studied programs provided conclusive evidence of effectiveness.
* The Study Group reported a need for additional, methodologically rigorous evaluations, training, technical assistance, and funding for promising programs.
* In response, OJJDP plans to provide a technical assistance workshop and issue a solicitation for funding evaluations of girls' delinquency programs.
3. The Study Group initially consisted of 12 academic researchers and 1 practitioner, which 11 of 18 experts interviewed found imbalanced in favor of researchers.
* This imbalance led the group to focus on researching theories rather than gathering actionable information for practitioners.
* OJJDP officials addressed this issue by adding a second practitioner and involving two others in study group activities.
* They also plan to more fully involve practitioners from the beginning in future study groups and include them in remaining activities.
4. OJJDP and the Study Group have disseminated findings to the research community, practitioners, and the public through various channels.

539,"1. Banks play a crucial role in the economy by connecting borrowers and savers, but they also engage in risky activities that can lead to devastating losses. Over time, a regulatory system has developed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks. Recent years have seen significant changes in banking regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III Accords. These changes have aimed to increase risk management and reduce the likelihood of bank failures, but some argue that they have also led to reduced credit availability and slower economic growth.
2. Prudential regulation, also known as safety and soundness regulations, is designed to ensure banks are safely profitable and to reduce the risk of failure. This type of regulation includes requirements related to capital ratios, such as leverage ratios and risk-weighted capital ratios, as well as restrictions on permissible activities, such as the Volcker Rule. Capital is raised through various methods, including issuing equity to shareholders or issuing special types of bonds that can be converted into equity.
3. The balance sheet of a bank is divided into assets, liabilities, and capital. Assets are largely the value of loans owed to the bank and securities owned by the bank. Liabilities are largely the value of deposits and borrowings the bank owes savers and creditors. Capital is raised through various methods, including issuing equity to shareholders or issuing special types of bonds that can be converted into equity. Capital is important because it does not require repayment of a specified amount of money, and so its value can fluctuate. Banks profit in part because many of their assets are generally riskier, longer-term, and more illiquid than their liabilities, which allows the banks to earn more interest on their assets than they pay on their liabilities.
4. Regulators use prudential regulation to reduce the likelihood and size of potential losses. To increase the ability to absorb losses, regulators can require banks to hold a minimum level of capital, liquidity, or stable funding. These levels are expressed as ratios between items on bank balance sheets and are called regulatory ratio requirements. To reduce the likelihood and size of potential losses, regulators prohibit banks from activities that could create excessive risks, implementing permissible activity restrictions.

547,"1. Milk protein concentrates (MPCs) are a dairy product derived from raw milk and used in various food products, animal feed, and industrial products. Currently, U.S. imports of MPCs have limited or no trade restrictions while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas.
• MPCs are comprised of casein and whey protein and are used in a variety of food products such as infant formula, processed cheese products, and cultured products.
• The U.S. produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates, and the federal dairy policies have encouraged the production of nonfat dry milk at the expense of milk protein concentrate or casein.
• U.S. imports of dairy products, including MPCs and casein/caseinates, were valued at $3 billion in 2008 and represented 35% of total import value.
2. In 2009, low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes renewed congressional interest in imposing new import barriers on MPCs.
• Advocates of stricter import controls on MPCs argue that it would prevent the unlimited importation of milk protein, encourage the use of domestically produced protein, and raise milk prices for dairy farmers.
• Opponents argue that it would increase costs for producers and result in higher retail food prices.
• Major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports.
3. Concerns about MPC imports have periodically surfaced since import levels rose sharply in the late 1990s.
• The U.S. price of nonfat dry milk, which competes with MPC as a protein ingredient, was above the price for milk proteins in the international market, making the U.S. market an attractive destination.
• When the world and domestic prices began to converge in 2001, MPC imports dropped off significantly and have since remained at or below peak levels reached in 2000.
• Milk is comprised mostly of water, and milk protein is of two basic types: casein and whey protein.

* HRPs also help states comply with HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions, which prohibit exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions and require coverage availability for eligible individuals moving from the group to nongroup market.
* Limited enrollment in HRPs reflects their narrow focus on individuals with preexisting health conditions who do not have access to public or group health insurance and seek coverage in the private, non-group market.
2. * The private health insurance market primarily serves individuals who receive health coverage through the group market, which provides health benefits to groups of people drawn together by an employer or other organization.
* Most Americans receive their health coverage through the workplace, while some individuals do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance due to part-time or seasonal employment status, lack of health insurance provision by the employer, or unemployment.
* Public programs also provide health coverage, but individuals and families must meet eligibility requirements to qualify for benefits.
* Individuals who cannot access ESI and are not eligible for public programs may seek health insurance in the nongroup (individual) market, where applicants undergo robust medical underwriting.
3. * Medical underwriting in the nongroup market involves an insurer considering an applicant's health conditions, family medical history, and other relevant factors to determine whether to offer an insurance policy and the terms of that policy.
* The information considered may include personal characteristics, and the insurance carrier may ask an applicant to undergo a physical exam or provide medical specimens.
* In the group market, insurers forgo traditional underwriting and instead consider the overall characteristics of the group to calculate a premium for a set of benefits charged to each person in the group.

   - The RPA prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality.""
   - It applies only to the sale of goods and not services, and only where each sale is of goods purchased for resale within the United States.
   
2. * The RPA has been enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but its enforcement has been inconsistent.
   - The FTC's actions have mainly been brought by disfavored buyers, and the act has been less than enthusiastically viewed by the Department of Justice.
   - The RPA has been criticized for having adverse effects on the economy and not being beneficial to consumers.
   - However, proponents argue that the act benefits specific sectors of the economy, such as small businesses, and promotes fair dealing in pricing.

However, the number of people living in poverty remained statistically unchanged at 45.3 million. The poverty rate tends to follow the economic cycle, with higher poverty rates during recessions and lower rates during economic growth. The most recent recession, which ended in June 2009, saw the unemployment rate increase from 4.9% to 10.0%, and poverty rates have remained above pre-recession levels despite a decline in the unemployment rate.

The non-aged poverty rate reached a high of 13.8% in 2010 and remained statistically unchanged at 13.6% in 2013. The poverty rate for children fell from 21.3% in 2012 to 19.5% in 2013, but still remains well above the pre-recession low of 16.9%. Children living in single female-headed families are especially prone to poverty, with nearly half of such children living in poverty in 2013.

The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs are campus-based programs that provide need-based financial aid to students. These programs are unique because the amount and mix of aid awarded to students are determined by institution-specific criteria, rather than non-discretionary criteria. The authorizations for these programs, along with many other provisions under the Higher Education Act of 1965, expired in FY2015. However, they have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills.
2. In FY2016, approximately $125 billion of federal aid was made available to students through programs authorized under the HEA, with 76% coming from the Direct Loan program, 21% from the Pell Grant program, and 2% from the campus-based aid programs. The campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort as aid has largely transitioned to a system that allows for portability in receipt of student aid.
3. As the 115th Congress considers reauthorization of the HEA, several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered, such as the extent to which they provide types of aid to students that are not provided via other postsecondary aid programs, whether the current formula for allocating funds to institutions is optimal, and the potential role of the campus-based aid programs in a redesigned federal aid system.

Mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees has been proposed to increase the universality of the program.
2. Implementing this change could simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who divide their careers between state and local government positions and other positions, and provide better benefit protections for workers and their families.
3. However, opponents argue that mandatory coverage would not necessarily result in better benefit protections for workers, as state and local governments could reduce some pension benefits to keep overall pension costs down. Additionally, Congress could enact changes to the Social Security contribution and benefit structure in response to the program's long-range funding shortfall.
4. The impact of mandatory coverage could also depend on a worker's wage level, as higher-wage workers receive lower replacement rates under Social Security compared to lower-wage workers.
5. Some workers and policymakers oppose mandatory coverage, citing the unpopularity and administrative difficulties of the windfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset (GPO), which affect individuals who are receiving a pension from work that was not covered by Social Security.",0

* The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides federal assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to foreign competition. The program offers funding for training and reemployment services, income support, and other benefits such as a tax credit for health insurance premiums.
* TAA was reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA) and will continue through June 30, 2021. The program is jointly administered by the federal government and the states, with the U.S. Department of Labor making group eligibility determinations and overseeing grantees.
* To be eligible for TAA, a group of workers must have become separated from their employment or have been threatened with separation due to foreign trade. The program is designed to target workers who lose their jobs due to increased international trade and imports, but may not be available to those affected by reductions in trade or declines in exports.
* Obtaining TAA benefits is a two-stage process. First, a group of workers or their representative must petition DOL to establish that their job loss was attributable to foreign trade. Once a group has been certified, individual workers covered by the group's petition apply for state-administered benefits at local American Job Centers.
* TAA benefits for individual workers include training and reemployment services, income support for workers who have exhausted their unemployment benefits and are enrolled in training, and a tax credit for a portion of the premium costs for qualified health insurance.
* TAA is a direct spending program and subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011. For FY2018, the Office of Management and Budget determined that the reduction for nonexempt, nondefense spending would be 6.6%. Sequester levels in subsequent years will be determined by OMB.

2. Before LMR was enacted in 1999, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price information on a voluntary basis. However, by the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone significant changes, and fewer animals were sold through negotiated sales.
3. Some livestock producers called for mandatory price reporting, arguing that alternative marketing arrangements made it difficult for them to determine fair market prices. Opponents of a mandate argued that it would impose costly new burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information.
4. LMR mandates price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine, and allows USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales. The law authorized appropriations as necessary and required USDA to implement regulations no later than 180 days after the law was enacted.
5. USDA issued a final rule on December 1, 2000, and although reporting for lamb was optional in the LMR statute, USDA established mandatory reporting for lamb in the final rule. The rule was implemented on April 2, 2001.
6. The implementation of mandatory reporting did not affect the continuation of the AMS voluntary price-reporting program. AMS continues to publish prices from livestock auctions, and feeder cattle and pig sales, through voluntary-based market news reports.
7. LMR authority lapsed briefly in October 2004 before Congress extended mandatory price reporting for one year to September 30, 2005. Authority for LMR lapsed again on September 30, 2005, and USDA requested that all packers who were required to report under the 1999 act continue to submit required information voluntarily.

* The FS provides technical and financial assistance to states, who then help private landowners and other eligible entities.
* Direct federal financial assistance to private forest landowners may also be possible through conservation programs.
2. * To receive funds for most programs, states must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, including a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term strategy.

598,"• The United States and Vietnam established diplomatic relations in 1995, and since then, the two countries have expanded cooperation in various sectors, including the possibility of nuclear energy.
• In 2013, a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement was initialed and signed in 2014 under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which can facilitate the transfer of nuclear energy technology. The agreement was subject to congressional review and may enter into force after 90 days of continuous session unless a joint resolution disapproving the agreement is enacted.
• During the congressional review period, several issues were prominent, including the lack of stronger nonproliferation commitments, the impact of Vietnam's human rights record, the strategic relationship between the United States and Vietnam, and the potential benefits for U.S. companies. Vietnam has nuclear cooperation agreements with several countries, and the U.S. nuclear industry contends that billions of dollars of exports could result from the Vietnam 123 agreement.
• The United States and Vietnam have a history of nuclear cooperation, with the U.S. providing a research reactor to South Vietnam in the 1960s. After the Vietnam War, the research reactor was shut down, but with U.S. assistance, Vietnam converted the Dalat research reactor from HEU to LEU fuel in 2013.
• Vietnam plans to build its first nuclear power plants in the coming decades, with nuclear power projected to provide 20%-30% of the country's electricity by 2050. The country's nuclear energy plan envisions a three-phase approach, with the first phase focusing on training technical specialists and setting up regulatory frameworks.
• The U.S. nuclear industry may have a role in the reactor projects in Vietnam, particularly in the Ninh Thuan 2 project, where Japan is offering both BWR and PWR designs. A U.S.-Vietnam 123 agreement would be helpful or even necessary for U.S. participation in Ninh Thuan 2, depending on the types of components and services involved.",0

2. * However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present over wide concentration ranges.
3. * To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at either the protein or peptide level, followed by analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS.
4. * Undersampling can occur, resulting in variable lists of identified proteins, particularly for lower-abundance proteins.
5. * Strategies for increasing proteome coverage include repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses, prefractionating based on protein physical properties, improving peptide separation, modifying the ESI interface, adding an ion mobility spectrometry interface, and improving data analysis methods.
6. * Direct comparisons of alternative analysis strategies have been conducted to identify the best approaches for specific types of samples, considering factors such as total protein required and mass spectrometry instrument time.
7. * Repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses, longer HPLC gradients, or additional fractionation usually confer some benefit in terms of depth of analysis, but the most time- and resource-effective strategies should be determined.
8. * A study compared gelc-MS/MS with repetitive LC-MS/MS analysis and additional protein prefractionation, finding that both strategies improved depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates.
9. * The study also found that the 3-d method, which included microsol IEF prior to SDS-PAGE separation, substantially improved proteome coverage compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.
10. * Additional prefractionation with microsol IEF substantially increased proteome coverage and sequence coverage compared with a gelc-MS/MS-repetitive run method, and the reproducibility of protein lists between the two methods was high.",0

2. The group has explored the synthesis of -lactams using aryl-, thioaryl-, and cyano-substituted anhydrides in one-pot four-component reactions (4CRs).
3. Computational studies suggest that cyanosuccinic anhydride reactions proceed by a Mannich-like mechanism via the enol tautomer of the anhydride.
4. Related reactions reported by Castagnoli, Cushman, and Haimova likely proceed by this mechanism as well.
5. The anhydrides used in these reactions are poorly enolizable and require forcing conditions.
6. Cushman and Haimova later reported analogous reactions with homophthalic anhydride, which is highly enolizable and reacts at lower temperatures.
7. The group explored Mannich-type reactions and related 4CRs of variously substituted anhydrides.
8. Aryl-substituted succinic anhydrides showed some variation in reactivity based on the substituents attached to the aromatic ring.

6. * The study found that the expression levels of mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 were lower in breast cancer tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues.
7. * The study also found that mir-21 and mir-10b were highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and were associated with various symptoms and factors.
8. * The study suggests that these miRNAs could be used as markers for early diagnosis of breast cancer.
9. * The study also found that certain miRNAs, such as mir-145, mir-125a, and mir-206, may be involved in the suppression of breast cancer invasion and metastasis.
10. * The study suggests that mir-125a and mir-21 could contribute to the treatment of her-2-positive breast cancer cells, while mir-145 and mir-206 could accelerate the development of treatment methods for triple-negative breast cancer.",0
604,"1. The text discusses the use of the f344 to Lewis rat strain combination as an experimental model for chronic allograft injury (CAI) in kidney transplantation. This model allows for the investigation of acute rejection episodes, which are characterized by a strong mononuclear infiltration of the allograft interstitium and numerous leukocytes in the blood vessels. After resolution of acute rejection, the number of intravascular leukocytes decreases but remains chronically elevated compared to healthy kidneys. A majority of these blood leukocytes are monocytes that display a unique state of partial activation.
2. The text also focuses on the role of tissue transglutaminase 2 (TGMT2) in the pathogenesis of CAI. TGMT2 is a protein that is widely expressed and can be attached to the surface or secreted into the extracellular space, where it can cross-link itself to extracellular proteins. In the context of acute rejection and subsequent CAI, TGMT2 might exert essential functions involved in rejection, such as antigen presentation and T cell activation via dendritic cells, activation of the NFB pathway, and enabling the expression of proinflammatory factors, leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, and leukocyte migration. During resolution of acute rejection, its role in apoptosis, phagocytosis, and release of TGF- may be of importance. Finally, during the development of CAI, TGMT2 might protect graft blood vessels as already evidenced in the context of atherosclerosis.
3. The study investigates TGMT2 mRNA and protein expression by mononuclear blood leukocytes isolated from Lewis to Lewis isografts and f344 to Lewis allografts and by respective renal tissue TGMT2 expressions compared to activated caspase-3, a protease critically involved in apoptosis. Leukocytes and grafts are studied during acute rejection on day 9 after transplantation and after resolution of acute rejection on day 42. Allograft recipients were treated with cystamine during the first month after transplantation to assess the role of early",0
605,"1. Researchers studied the removal of extracellular vesicles (EVs) using a clinical continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) filter under conditions that mimic human clinical disease.
	* Endothelial cells were stimulated to release EVs, which were then introduced into an IV bag and circulated through the CVVH filter.
	* Researchers found that the filter removed 50% of EVs within the first 30 minutes and 29% after 40 minutes, with 5.7% of the original concentration found in the dialysate after 4 hours.
2. The study supports the idea of CVVH as a therapeutic intervention for acute lung injury (ALI) due to EV clearance.
	* Researchers previously found that EVs contribute to ALI, and CVVH can achieve the same plasma level of EVs as seen in human clinical disease.
	* However, the study acknowledges limitations, such as the potential saturation of filter EV-binding and the need for convection and pressure gradient forces to sustain clearance.
3. Researchers suggest that more selective and efficient EV clearance can be achieved by conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to commercially available specialty CVVH filters.
	* This approach would provide more selective binding sites and higher affinity for circulating EVs.
	* By combining a selective filter with convection and pressure gradients, EV clearance could likely be substantially prolonged.
4. Clinical data generally support the protective role of CVVH in ALI management.
	* A clinical randomized trial and several animal trials demonstrate that negative fluid balance is associated with improved outcomes from ALI.
	* CVVH can also prevent or minimize volume overload, making it a potential tool for addressing both the molecular machinery and iatrogenic components of ALI.
5. Researchers plan to assay patients pre- and post-dialysis to observe EV concentration effects.
	* This translatable step will help determine the impact of CVVH on EV concentrations in human disease.
	* The ultimate goal is to examine the efficacy of dialysis in rodent models of EV-induced ALI and emp thresholds associated with worse injuries.

	* The improvement was dose-dependent, with the greatest increase seen in the 1.6-mg group, and was associated with a later occurrence of minimum 1.0-mm st-segment depression.
2. The study also found that sublingual nitroglycerin spray was generally well tolerated, but the incidence of treatment-related adverse events, such as headache and dizziness, increased with higher dose levels.
	* The clinical relevance of the nearly 1-minute improvement in exercise duration with sublingual nitroglycerin spray over placebo is not specifically addressed in the study.
3. The study suggests that prophylactic nitroglycerin spray might allow much greater increases in walking times during normal daily activities.
	* This outcome was not formally evaluated in the present study, but patients have often reported a marked increase in angina-free walking time and exercise duration after taking prophylactic sublingual nitroglycerin.
4. The study highlights the importance of lifestyle modifications, including supervised exercise therapy, in the success of optimal medical therapy for patients with stable angina.
	* However, patients with stable angina generally have impaired exercise tolerance and reduced daily physical activity.
5. The study notes that there have been significant changes in optimal medical therapy for stable coronary artery disease since the study was conducted.
	* These changes include the greater use of beta-blockers compared with calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates to treat angina, and the routine use of daily aspirin and a statin to reduce serious cardiovascular outcomes.
6. The study concludes that sublingual nitroglycerin spray may be beneficial for patients with stable angina who are being managed with optimal medical therapy and for those who have persistent angina post-revascularization.
	* Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term beneficial effects of using routine prophylactic nitroglycerin spray in patients with stable angina to increase exercise duration and improve quality of life and well-being.",0

2. Of the 77,047 participants, 55,021 completed follow-up surveys at year 3 and 54,790 at year 6. The study found that 871 participants newly self-reported diabetes during follow-up, with a cumulative annual incidence of 3.6/1,000 person-years. Participants who newly self-reported diabetes were significantly more likely to have reported trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours, and sleep apnea at baseline.
3. Factors associated with a higher odds of incident diabetes in models adjusted for sex and known type 2 diabetes risk factors included trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours compared with 7 hours, and sleep apnea. Several military service characteristics remained significantly related to the outcome, including no deployment, enlisted pay grade, administration/supply occupation, and having separated from the military since baseline.
4. Sleep characteristics, including reported trouble sleeping and sleep apnea, remained significantly and independently associated with higher diabetes odds in the final multivariable model. A positive screen for PTSD was significantly associated with higher diabetes odds, independent of sleep characteristics and other covariates in the model. The associations between type 2 diabetes risk and mental health conditions and sleep characteristics may involve different pathways.",0

2. The prevalence of RA in southern Europe is lower than in northern Europe, and annual incidence is also lower in southern European countries.
3. The economic burden of RA is significant for patients, families, and healthcare systems, and is expected to increase due to the aging population.
4. The cost of RA varies across countries, and is affected by methods of calculation, reimbursement policies, availability of drugs and social services, and country-specific treatment guidelines.
5. In Italy, the healthcare costs associated with age-related diseases like RA are expected to increase due to the growing proportion of older people.
6. A review of the economic impact of RA in Italy in the past two decades found that the costs of RA increased after the introduction of biological agents.
7. The review also predicted that the future costs of RA in Italy will be higher than the current costs, and will be similar to the costs in other European countries.
8. The studies on the prevalence of RA in Italy have indicated a prevalence of around 0.5%, but most of these studies have been conducted in small communities or at a regional level.

• HCC is often resistant to chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes and protein products.
• The molecular pathogenesis of HCC is complex and involves multiple dysregulated pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and insulin-like growth factor pathways.
• HGF and its transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Met, promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and are implicated in the development and progression of HCC.
2. HGF is secreted primarily by mesenchymal cells as an inactive single-chain precursor, which is converted into an active two-polypeptide chain heterodimer by extracellular proteases.
• HGF transcription is upregulated by inflammatory modulators, and its expression is increased in response to liver injury.
• The c-Met receptor is expressed predominantly on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells and is activated by HGF binding, leading to autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues and recruitment of intracellular adaptors.
• Recruited adaptor proteins and kinase substrates promote activation of multiple signaling pathways, including the ras/MAPK, p38, JNK, and nuclear factor kappa B pathways, which induce cell cycle progression, antiapoptosis, increased cell motility, angiogenesis, and survival.

	* Molecular imaging techniques, such as dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and meta-[i]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy, have improved the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD.
2. DAT SPECT imaging using [I]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) successfully visualizes the presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract.
	* DAT SPECT abnormalities can support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism.

2. HCM is caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with the major genes including MYH7, TNNT2, MYBPC3, and MYL2.
3. TNNT2 mutations are associated with a particularly severe form of HCM, with most missense mutations located in exons 8 and 16.
4. Genetic analysis and determination of genotype can be useful for risk stratification in HCM, but the phenotypic expression of these mutations varies considerably.
5. Clinical parameters such as the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, the presence or absence of a left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and electrophysiology testing have not been predictive markers of poor prognosis.
6. Late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance can be a predictive marker of ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in HCM.

3. The scientific community has joined efforts to assess the schistosoma genomic information, leading to the sequencing of the S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni genomes.
4. The S. mansoni genome sequencing data has allowed for the identification of genetic loci that determine important traits such as host specificity, virulence, and drug resistance.
5. Comparative genomics of three Schistosoma species has revealed several conserved features, supporting the evolutionary hypothesis of S. haematobium and S. mansoni as the most related species.
6. Mitochondrial genes have been used as molecular markers for species and strain identification, and the analysis of the whole mitochondrial genome of six Schistosoma species has changed the perspective of such studies.
7. Transcriptomic analyses are valuable for studies of differential regulation in gene expression and the identification of splicing variants, and have been essential in the identification of gene-coding regions during the process of genome annotation.
8. Transcriptomic studies have allowed for a temporal and quantitative analyses of gene expression, which are crucial to completely exploit different datasets and assess parasite biology at the molecular level.",0

2. Simultaneous resection of primary and liver tumors is a favorable strategy due to less mental stress and simplified perioperative treatment, but it has a higher morbidity rate due to greater surgical stress and longer operation time.
3. Staged resection is an alternative strategy to avoid excessive surgical stress, but its efficacy and the patients who could benefit from this strategy are unknown.
4. A study was conducted to determine which patients could benefit from staged resections instead of simultaneous resection by identifying predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM.
5. The study found that operation time greater than 8 hours was the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM.
6. The study suggests that staged resections should be selected to prevent anastomotic leakage or serious complications when the scheduled operation would result in considerable surgical stress.",0

2. The antimicrobial sensitivity of a target strain to a bacteriocin can be affected by various environmental factors, including salt concentration, pH, the presence of membrane disrupting molecules, and inducing cultures.
3. Gram-positive bacteriocins are classified into four classes, including class I or lantibiotics, class II, class III, and class IV. Class II is further divided into three subclasses: subclass iia, iib, and iic.
4. Many strains of Enterococcus, a genus of gram-positive bacteria, have been characterized as antagonists of a wide range of foodborne pathogens. The bacteriocins produced by Enterococcus strains have heterogeneous structures and different modes of action.
5. The bacteriocin produced by a strain of Enterococcus faecalis, named enterocin S37, was isolated from chicken feces and showed antagonism against Listeria and Campylobacter species.
6. The antibacterial activity of enterocin S37 was assessed against various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and it was found to be active against E. faecalis JH2-2, Lb. brevis F145, L. monocytogenes EGDE, and L. innocua F.
7. The stability of enterocin S37 was studied at high temperatures and different pH values, and it was found to be stable at temperatures up to 90°C and pH values ranging from 4 to 9.
8. The combination of enterocin S37 with k channel modulators, such as pinacidil and cromakalim, affected the growth of L. monocytogenes EGDE and its bacteriocin-resistant variant, suggesting an implication of enterocin S37 in a depletion of intracellular potassium levels.",0

627,"1. Clinical governance (CG) is a strategy for improving the quality of healthcare services, and it has been implemented in Iran since 2009.
* The CG model in Iran consists of seven interlocking components, including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information.
2. The main barriers to implementing CG include insufficient knowledge and attitude toward CG, lack of resources, inadequate information technology systems, resistance to change, necessity of cultural change, and professional boundaries.
* Other barriers include the speed of CG implementation, workload, earmarked funding, lack of adequate senior management support, resources, and structural and cultural issues.
3. Raising awareness of CG among managers, having a supportive culture, and providing sufficient resources can affect the success of quality improvement activities.
* State-level accountability in CG implementation can be addressed by allocating proper resources and empowering policy implementers with proper performance control systems.
4. Most senior managers accept that improving the quality of healthcare should be integral to their role and essential to safeguard patient care.
* The willingness to support and positive attitude toward CG, adequate knowledge about CG, and a positive attitude toward the necessity of the program are the main factors affecting CG implementation.
5. Appropriate culture for improving quality in the organization, teamwork, readiness toward change, and a culture of openness are the main factors that influence CG implementation.
* Clinical governance components need to be embedded in day-to-day work, and adequate organizational commitment toward CG should be created to increase the likelihood of program progress.
6. Allocating adequate staff to undertake the responsibilities required by the program, developing and disseminating national standards, and managerial commitment toward CG and their executive ability in implementing the program are crucial organizational factors.
* Managers should use appropriate incentive mechanisms to sustain staff motivation and participation in CG implementation.
7. Shortage of staff and limited dedicated resources to implement CG, fostering a sense of engagement among medical staff, and resistance from some physicians and medical staff are the main barriers in implementing CG.
* Stability in managerial and executive positions, addressing legal challenges, and providing adequate supporting systems for the staff in the way of CG implementation are necessary to mitigate",0

2. Canines such as dogs, wolves, foxes, and jackals serve as the final host, while herbivores and humans act as intermediate hosts.
3. Humans can accidentally ingest parasite eggs through contaminated water, vegetables, or direct contact with infected dogs.
* 4. The disease is prevalent in many countries, including Argentina, Peru, East Africa, Central Asia, China, and South America.
5. In endemic regions, the incidence rate can reach over 50 per 100,000 person-years, and the prevalence rate among humans can be 5%-10%.
6. Iran is a hyper-endemic area for hydatid cyst disease due to its close relationship with animals, traditional animal husbandry, and contact with infection sources.
* 7. The prevalence rate of hydatid cyst in the intermediate host in Iran ranges from 11.5% to 34.6%, and the prevalence rate of human hydatid cyst ranges from 1.1% to 13.7%.

629,"1. * Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare, congenital liver cysts, with only 103 cases reported since their first description in 1857.
	+ The majority of cases have been reported in the last 25 years due to advancements in imaging techniques.
2. * CHFCs are typically found in the left lobe of the liver, near the hepatic capsule, and range in size from less than 1 cm to 24 cm in diameter.
	+ Most patients present with abdominal symptoms around the age of 52, but nearly 40% of cases are incidental findings on imaging, autopsy, or surgery.
3. * CHFCs have four distinct layers: a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer with interspersed mucus cells, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule.
	+ The embryological origin of CHFCs is still debated, with theories suggesting a detached hepatic diverticulum or abnormal tracheobronchial bud migration.
4. * CHFCs are typically asymptomatic and superficially located in the median segments of the liver.
	+ Imaging features include anechoic or hypoechoic cysts with spotty hyperechoic areas on ultrasound and non-enhancing, rounded lesions of varying density on CT.
5. * The main differential diagnosis for CHFCs is bronchogenic cyst, which shares a common embryonic origin.
	+ Histologically, CHFCs have unique features, such as the absence of a smooth muscle layer in rare cases, which help distinguish them from other hepatic cysts.
6. * CHFCs are usually benign, but there have been reports of malignant transformation, particularly in cysts larger than 4 cm to 5 cm or in those with wall abnormalities on imaging.
	+ Serial imaging may be required for patients undergoing cyst sclerosis, and surgical excision is the definitive treatment for CHFCs.

2. The formulation process involved using sodium starch glycolate (SSG) as a disintegrant and polyvinyl acetate (PVA) as a film former, with a 3-factorial design to evaluate the influence of these polymers on the film's mechanical properties, disintegration time, and dissolution rate.
3. The optimized formulation, F6, showed rapid disintegration and faster in vitro drug release compared to other formulations, due to the negative effect of PVA and the positive effect of SSG concentration on the response variables.
4. The surface morphology of the optimized formulation depicted a smooth surface with some little pores, indicating uniform distribution of drug particles.
5. In vitro drug release comparisons showed that the optimized formulation was comparable to a marketed clobazam formulation (Frisium5).
6. In vivo studies indicated no significant difference in clobazam plasma levels between the optimized formulation and the marketed tablets.
7. The prepared formulation was stable up to 6 months at 40°C (75%rh), with no significant change observed in weight, tensile strength, and % in vitro drug release.
8. The orodispersible film formulation containing clobazam is potentially useful for treating epileptic attacks, offering improved patient compliance and convenience as an alternative to fast dissolving tablet formulations.",0

Recovery is complex and multidimensional, encompassing biological, psychological, and sociological elements.
* Engagement in self-management practices is crucial for recovery and is considered key to empowerment and improved health outcomes. Self-management interventions (SMIs) aim to enable individuals to manage their health more effectively.
* The effectiveness of SMIs is evaluated based on whether people develop the skills to manage their own health and if this results in better health. However, evaluation is complex due to variation in delivery, culture of the sponsoring healthcare organization, and anticipated goals and outcomes.
1. The UK Medical Research Council advocates establishing the theoretical basis of an intervention as a first step in estimating its possible outcomes.
* Currently, evidence suggests that the mediators of change and theoretical premises in SMIs are unclear, making it difficult to determine appropriate outcomes to monitor, maintain intervention fidelity, and evaluate SMIs.
* SMIs may be evaluated by examining the effect on health outcomes that potentially change as a consequence of better self-management using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
* PROMs capture information that is not directly observable and unmediated by healthcare professionals, but accurate measurement is contingent on the extent that the PROM is an accurate reflection of the variable in question.
1. A systematic review of outcome measures used in stroke SMIs found that the methodology adopted in reviews of outcome measures often varies, creating confusion for researchers and clinicians.
* A recent international Delphi study of 57 experts resulted in a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties, the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist.
* The COSMIN list has good inter-rater agreement and reliability and represents the first critical appraisal tool that is based on the consensus of experts in psychometric theory.
* The COSMIN checklist addresses modern psychometric theory methodology, such as item response theory, as well as classical test theory. Further information on COSMIN can be accessed via [www.cosmin.nl](http://www.cosmin.nl).",0

* Physiotherapists use both self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to monitor OA knee rehabilitation, each with their own advantages and limitations.
2. * Self-reported questionnaires, such as WOMAC, SF-36, and Koos, provide subjective information about the disease process without examiner bias.
* Performance-based tests, such as the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT), objectively measure a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL).
3. * Physical performance tests are affected by motivation but not by psychogenic factors such as beliefs, expectations, cognitive impairments, and cultural, lingual, and educational level.
* A difference between the two types of tests is that performance-based tests measure functional limitation, whereas self-reported questionnaires reveal disability, which includes the social and psychological side of functional limitation.
4. * Functional limitation is often detected sooner by performance-based tests than self-reported questionnaires.
* There is no consensus on the use of one type of test over the other, and ideally, both should be used in knee rehabilitation settings.
5. * The present study aimed to correlate the subjectively measured Koos questionnaire with the objectively measured 6-MWT, age, height, weight, and BMI in primary OA knee patients.
* The study found weak to strong correlations between Koos subscales and the 6-MWT, weight, and BMI, and no correlation between Koos subscales and height or age.
6. * The results of the present study are in agreement with previous studies and support the use of Koos in Indian OA knee patients.
* Further research is needed to establish the validity and reliability of Koos in the Indian population and to determine the most effective combination of self-reported and performance-based tests for OA knee rehabilitation.",0
633,"1. Obesity is a low-level, chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, poor eating habits, and a sedentary lifestyle. Adipose tissue, which stores energy and insulates the body, also secretes cell-signaling molecules called adipokines. These adipokines can be pro- or anti-inflammatory, and an imbalance between these can contribute to the development of obesity.

• In obesity, the presence of large concentrations of endotoxins and saturated fatty acids in the diet can activate toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
• These cytokines can interfere with the expression of other cytokines, affecting metabolic homeostasis.
• Menopause is a period of life characterized by the permanent cessation of menstruation due to the loss of ovarian function, and it is associated with adverse changes in lipoprotein profiles, glucose and insulin metabolism, distribution of body fat, clotting, and vascular endothelium.

2. The physiological actions of estrogens in the body are mediated by two distinct estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ, which are nuclear transcription factors involved in the regulation of several complex physiological processes.

• The inflammatory processes that occur following menopause result from a reduction in circulating levels of estrogens and their receptors (ERs), which have anti-inflammatory properties.
• However, the effects of estrogens on inflammation are controversial, with some studies suggesting a beneficial role for estrogen in the prevention of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.
• Estrogen exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on the vasculature through antioxidant effects, generation of nitric oxide, prevention of apoptosis in vascular cells, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, and modulation of the renin-angiotensin system.
• In vitro studies have also demonstrated that estrogen has an anti-inflammatory effect in several cell lineages.

• The study also found that BAE is useful in obtaining immediate bleeding control, and it can be used repeatedly, making it an important treatment option for patients who are poor surgical candidates.
• However, the study also found that some patients may experience recurrent hemoptysis after repeated BAE, and the long-term outcome in some patients is not good.
• The study also identified the main responsible vessels for bleeding as right bronchial arteries, left bronchial arteries, combined right and left bronchial trunk, and right intercostal arteries.",0

2. The study also found that in undiagnosed patients with histological features compatible with LG, higher counts of CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) may imply a diagnosis of CD rather than Hp gastritis. The study also suggests that immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 lymphocytes in the antrum should be included in undefined cases of CD.",0

Inhibition of angiogenesis through several drugs, including those that target VEGF, could be an important tool in cancer treatment. These treatments should have low toxicity and not interfere with normal dividing cells, as they target normal processes controlled by normal cells and not by tumor cells.
2. In breast cancer, bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human VEGF and prevents it from binding to its receptors, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2/neu-negative breast cancer. Inhibition of VEGF binding to its receptors has been shown to reduce tumor size and microvessel density, and limit the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in breast cancer xenografts. However, this treatment is associated with elevated numbers of tumor-associated neutrophils. Additionally, anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to reduce macrophage infiltration in orthotopic pancreatic and thyroid cancer models, as well as in breast cancer xenografts.",0

The study found that patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who underwent surgical treatment had higher concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol, and enhanced oxidative stress as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) compared to those treated pharmacologically. However, there was no significant decrease in lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and MDA concentrations in the surgical group after surgery.
2. The total antioxidant capacity (expressed as FRAP) and thiol group concentrations in the serum of patients on statin therapy and in those before surgery were similar. However, a decrease was observed in FRAP level 35 days after surgery, and 710 days after surgery, it was significantly lower in comparison to the values before surgery and on simvastatin therapy. Additionally, thiol group concentrations 35 days postoperatively were lower than those before surgery and 710 days after surgery and were lower than those in patients treated with simvastatin.
3. The study found that lipid peroxidation may be one mechanism through which several risk factors may promote PAD. The findings suggest that an increased MDA level in patients before surgery indicates a state of high oxidative stress, which can damage biologically important molecules and contribute to the atherosclerotic reaction in the vascular wall. The study also highlights the importance of determining lipid peroxidation products in PAD and the potential benefits of statin therapy in reducing oxidative stress and improving antioxidant status.",0

* The FIJK herbal mixture is made from a combination of 13 medicinal plants and is used to treat various ailments, including obesity, diabetes, and malaria.
* However, there are no empirical data to support the claimed medicinal benefits of FIJK, and the potential toxicity of the mixture is largely unknown.
2. A study was conducted to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to FIJK on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology.
* The study found that oral administration of FIJK caused a significant reduction in rat plasma protein levels and elevated plasma levels of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.
* Additionally, the study found that FIJK caused liver damage, as evidenced by altered levels of liver enzymes and histopathological changes in liver tissue.
3. The study also found that oral exposure to FIJK caused lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in rats.
* The increased level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, suggested the presence of oxidative stress caused by FIJK.
* The decreased level of glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic antioxidant, further supported the ensuing oxidative stress caused by FIJK.
4. The lack of regulation of herbal products in Nigeria and the widespread use of herbal remedies without scientific backing pose potential health risks to consumers.
* The study emphasizes the need for scientific data on the safety and efficacy of herbal remedies to inform consumers and healthcare providers.
* The study also highlights the importance of monitoring the health status of the cardiovascular system, as elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and atherogenic index may predispose to cardiovascular disorders.

Preconceptional carrier screening can help prospective parents understand the genetic risks to their future offspring and the reproductive options available, such as prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, using donor sperm or oocytes, seeking adoption, or refraining from having children.
* Carrier screening and carrier testing are two approaches to identifying carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders.
* Carrier screening is offered to individuals who do not have an increased risk, while carrier testing is offered to those with a higher a priori risk based on personal or family history.
* Carrier screening can be offered individually or as part of an organized screening program, and its goal is to strengthen reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making.
2. Preconceptional carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been studied extensively and has received positive attitudes from healthcare providers, patients, their relatives, and the general public.
* The National Institutes of Health, the American College of Medical Genetics, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended preconceptional CF carrier screening for couples with no family history of CF.
* However, traditional healthcare systems have been hesitant to implement carrier screening programs for the entire population of couples planning a pregnancy due to concerns such as psychological impact, risk of stigmatization/discrimination, impairment of freedom of choice, medicalization, difficulty in reaching couples before conception, and provider-related barriers.
* Recently, commercial companies have started offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers, which has created a debate about the desirability of these activities.
3. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for preconceptional carrier tests raises ethical issues such as informed consent, medical supervision and follow-up, and appropriate use of existing resources.
* The current offer of preconceptional carrier tests through online providers varies, with some companies offering individual tests and others offering panels of disorders.
* The informed consent procedure for DTC genetic testing may have implications for the provision of information, and medical supervision and follow-up are necessary to ensure appropriate use of resources.

2. * After fracture union, implants made of titanium alloys or stainless steel become foreign objects inside the patient's body, and removal is still debated due to presumed benefits like functional improvement and pain relief, as well as potential complications such as neurovascular injury and refractures.
3. * In children, routine implant removal after fracture union is still standard procedure, while in adults, it is necessary in cases of pain and discomfort, infection, and implant failure.
4. * A study of 83 patients who underwent implant removal found that the most common reasons were pain, discomfort, or prominent hardware, infected hardware, and implant failure.
5. * Of the 33 patients who had hardware pain or discomfort, the most commonly responsible implants were patella tension band wiring, olecranon tension band wiring/plates, distal humeral plates, and femoral intramedullary nails.

643,"• The study found that increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) leads to cell apoptosis and decreased number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Treatment with a compound called AAA significantly attenuated RGC apoptosis and rescued the reduced number of RGCs, demonstrating protective effects on AOH retinas.

• The study also found that AAA treatment attenuated GFAP immunoreactivity in Müller cell processes across the inner plexiform layer (ipl) and reduced retinal TNF-α levels in the rat model of AOH. These findings suggest that AAA promotes the survival of RGCs likely through the inhibition of AOH-induced Müller cell gliosis and downregulation of TNF-α protein production. The observations suggest that AAA might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.",0

2. A new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFR-L) has been developed to treat nonampullary SDNs, which was performed on 5 patients from June to September 2015, resulting in complete resection without complications.
3. LAEFR-L involves ligating the tumor using a ligation device, resecting it using a snare technique, and retrieving the specimen intraluminally, preventing exposure of the abdominal cavity to malignant cells.
4. Compared to conventional full-thickness resection (FTR) procedures, LAEFR-L has the advantages of collecting the resected specimen intraluminally and not requiring proficient experience in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). However, tumor size and location are important factors to consider when indicating LAEFR-L.",0

• In patients with 21-OHD, some precursors are shunted into the androgen synthetic pathway, causing signs and symptoms of androgen excess.
• Since the discovery of cortisone in the 1950s, CAH has been managed effectively, with typical medical treatment consisting of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration.
• The document reports four cases of patients with CAH who were managed with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, but later found to have adrenal masses.
• Recent reports reveal a high prevalence of small adrenal tumors in patients with untreated 21-OHD CAH, with most adrenal masses in children with CAH being benign.
• Two of the four cases were managed with adrenalectomy due to increasing adrenal mass size and virilization.
• The pathogenesis of adrenal tumor in patients with 21-OHD CAH is thought to be related to a consequence of ACTH hypersecretion, which results from the lack of glucocorticoid synthesis.
• Patients with 21-OHD CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumor, improve its symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorder, particularly hyponatremia.",0

Asking participants to describe their overall health on a five-point scale has gained popularity as a health-indicating tool in the US and other countries.
* Poor health has been attributed to a lack of adherence to medical recommendations, including diet and physical activity, and has been linked to poor management of chronic diseases.
* Lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases, and higher daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and physical activity have been associated with a reduction in chronic disease burden and an increase in quality of life.
2. SRH has been positively associated with fruits and vegetables intake and negatively associated with high-fat diets and eating at fast-food restaurants.
* Following dietary and physical activity recommendations has been associated with the prevention and lessening of the severity of cardiovascular diseases.
* Lack of physical activity and unhealthy dietary patterns place a burden on society due to lack of work productivity and increased healthcare costs.
* Several studies have found an association between lifestyle behaviors and self-evaluation of health, with regular physical activity being significantly associated with SRH in various populations.
3. The Living for Health Program, conducted from 2008 to 2012, collected information on health behaviors from adults in low-income minority communities in Miami-Dade County.
* A single question was used to measure fruits and vegetables intake, and physical activity was measured with a question about the frequency of physical activity in the last month.

2. Fetal MRI has become increasingly important in diagnosing prenatal anomalies, especially central nervous system pathology, due to advancements in technology and better knowledge of fetal pathology.
3. Ventriculomegaly is a common condition detected through ultrasound, and its prevalence ranges between 0.3 - 1.5. It can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the maximal diameter of the atrium of the lateral ventricles.
4. Measuring the lateral ventricle is subject to errors, and a precise definition of reference planes and anatomical landmarks is essential to avoid inaccurate measurements.
5. Ventriculomegaly can be caused by an imbalance in cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, abnormal cerebral development, or destructive disease processes.
6. Unilateral ventriculomegaly is often seen in destructive processes, while developmental anomalies are more characterized by bilateral broadening of the ventricles.
7. Fetal MRI is mainly performed on 1.5 Tesla scanners, and its major limitations include the impact of fetal motion and its relatively low spatial resolution compared to ultrasound.
8. MRI has an excellent contrast resolution, enabling easy differentiation between gray and white matter, and allows direct visualization of the cortical region and the fossa posterior.
9. An important role in the prenatal diagnostic work-up of ventriculomegaly is the detection and characterization of additional cerebral anomalies.
10. The added value of MRI is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to several factors, including an overenthusiastic attitude towards new technologies, lack of description of the ultrasound technique, and suboptimal or insufficient ultrasound images in reported studies.",0

2. Bone is a common site of metastasis in lung cancer patients, placing them at risk for skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain.
3. A study analyzing a combined population-based cancer registry and Medicare claims database found that bone metastasis and SREs significantly impact mortality in older lung cancer patients.
4. The study identified bone metastasis and SREs using Medicare claims data and found that they were associated with increased mortality in lung cancer patients.
5. The study also found that SREs were common in patients with bone metastasis, occurring in 51% of patients.
6. Radiotherapy to bone was the most common SRE, occurring in 81% of patients with SREs.
7. The study's limitations include the use of claims data to identify bone metastasis and SREs, potential confounding factors, and the lack of information on functional status.
8. The study found that having a bone metastasis, as indicated by Medicare claims, was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer.",0
650,"1. The study found that different smear layer removal methods from root canal dentin affect the bond strength of a fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin.
• The higher bond strength results were obtained for the helbo theralite laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups.
2. Some authors recommend removing the smear layer for increased antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness, while others insist on retaining it for better material adaptation to the root surface.
• Interestingly, the photodynamic diode laser group showed higher bond strength than the other groups except for the h3po4 group, without removing the smear layer.
3. Sodium hypochlorite can increase the penetration of monomers into the dentinal tubules but can also inhibit interfacial polymerization of resin bonding materials due to broken down oxygen.
• Other studies have found that naocl and nacl could not remove the smear layer, which can act as a diffusion barrier on the dentin and reduce dentin permeability for bonding agents.
4. Dual irrigation methods, such as a combination of 17% edta and 5.25% naocl, are effective in removing the smear layer but can result in sporadic erosion and dissolution of the dentin.
• In the present study, only the diode laser group showed post-cement failure, while the other groups showed mixed failures.
5. The study suggests that it may be more effective to modify the smear layer when a self-adhesive system is used, and lower irradiation power should be used for diode-laser treatment to avoid temperature rise.
• The results also indicate that naocl (5.25%) and naci (0.9%) were not effective in removing the smear layer when used as a final irrigation.",0

The human microbiome project in the USA and the metagenomics of the human intestinal tract (MetaHIT) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives that aim to characterize the microbial communities in various sites of the human body and look for correlations between changes in the microbiome and prevalence of diseases. Collaborations have also been initiated to identify a common core of bacterial species shared among all or the majority of human beings.
	* The human gut flora mainly belongs to two phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Archaea, mostly represented by the methanogenic Methanobrevibacter smithii, have also been discovered in the human gut.
	* The composition of the bacterial flora seems to strongly depend on the environment and the maternal input during delivery and upon breastfeeding. Members of the same family were shown to have bacterial communities that were more similar to each other than to unrelated individuals, suggesting that the environment and maternal flora, rather than genetic factors alone, have greater impact on establishing bacterial communities in a new individual.
2. Recent high-throughput studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities. One major study aimed at assessing whether a common bacterial core shared by all or at least a majority of humans could be determined. Fecal material collected from a large cohort of individuals in different countries was subjected to metagenomic analysis. The bacterial groups that were present in the samples in vast numbers were Bacteroidetes and Dorea/Eubacterium/Ruminococcus. Only 18 species were present in all individuals examined, while 57 species were seen in more than 90% of samples and around 50% shared 75 species.
	* To obtain a better picture of the role or function of the bacterial communities, efforts have been made to first identify genes that are encoded by intestinal microbiota and to place their relevance within the context of gut function. More than 3 million open reading frames (ORF) of bacterial genes have been identified, potentially coding for as many genes. However, the majority of these genes could only be found in very few samples, again confirming the huge variability between individuals.

A study was conducted to investigate the effect of tazarotene on distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis in an open preliminary study of immunocompetent patients and its fungistatic activity in vitro. The study found that tazarotene was effective in reducing hyperkeratinization in fungus-infected nails and had a direct fungistatic activity.
2. The study reported an observational open clinical trial in 15 patients affected by onychomycosis of the toenail treated with topical tazarotene 0.1% gel for 12 weeks. The results showed that mycological cure in target nails was observed in 40% of patients at the first follow-up visit and complete cure with complete clinical healing in all patients at the end point.
3. The study also found that tazarotene can exert a protective action on the microvascular bed against fungal infection and induce the blocking of fungal keratinolytic proteases through its immunomodulatory activity.
4. The study suggests that tazarotene could be useful in those patients with treatment-resistant forms of onychomycosis or in those with evident enhanced nail thickening. However, further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy in terms of relapse and reinfection.",0

2. Most attention has been focused on patient selection for CRT, but inadequate delivery of CRT therapy is also a concern.
3. The study aimed to assess the acute haemodynamic response (AHR) of the implanted system and alternative left ventricular endocardial pacing sites in patients not responding to CRT.
4. Twenty-four non-consecutive patients with heart failure class III or IV despite at least 6 months of CRT and adequate medical therapy underwent an acute haemodynamic study.
5. The results showed that in 5 out of 24 patients, LVdp/dtmax with the implanted coronary sinus system increased by 15% after optimization.
6. Endocardial pacing increased the AHR in one of the two remaining patients with an apical position of the coronary sinus lead.
7. The study also found that lead location is important, with a posterolateral position of the lead improving clinical response compared to the original apical or anterolateral lead location.
8. However, none of the patients with a coronary sinus lead in a posterolateral position improved sufficiently with endocardial pacing.
9. The study suggests that epicardial pacing opposite the optimal endocardial sites may be a good alternative to avoid the uncertainty of thromboembolic complications with LV endocardial pacing.",0
654,"1. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity. The disease may not show symptoms until the third or fourth decade of life, and only about half of the patients will progress to renal failure. In young patients, there is no way to predict whether or when renal failure will develop. Several risk factors, such as hypertension, renal hemorrhage, multiple pregnancies, male gender, and PKD1 disease genotype, have been associated with a more rapid course.
* Complications associated with pregnant subjects with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis include maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, infected renal and hepatic cysts, pyelonephritis, and rupture of cerebral artery aneurysm during labor with subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, with careful and effective perioperative monitoring, spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis.
2. An 80 kg 35-year-old full-term primigravida with oligohydramnios was scheduled for an emergency lower segment cesarean section (LSCS). She was diagnosed with ADPKD in the seventh month of pregnancy when she complained of flank pain, generalized swelling, and decreased urine output. She was hospitalized and hemodialyzed thrice a week for the next two months to maintain blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and potassium values within acceptable limits.
* Clinical parameters were heart rate of 102/min regular, systemic blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg in the supine position, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 1-2 cm H2O. Preoperative investigations showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.2 gm%, normal leucocyte count, and mild proteinuria and pus cells in urine. Her biochemical profile revealed BUN of 30 mg/dl, serum creatinine 3.7 mg%, serum sodium 140 mm",0

* The data was collected over 12 years and the cows were grouped as mastitis (suffering from clinical mastitis) and non-mastitis (normal cows).
* The ftdmy was less in the first fortnight and increased gradually to attain a peak in the third and fourth fortnights in both normal and mastitis cows.
* The cows exhibited a steady decline in milk yield with advancement in lactation and the ftdmy was maximum in the fourth parity in both normal and mastitis cows.
2. The study used a gamma type function to fit the lactation curve and predict the milk yield with minimum error.
* The gamma type function was used to derive the constants a, b, and c, where a is the initial milk yield after calving, b is the ascending slope parameter up to the peak yield, and c is the descending slope parameter.
* The ftdmy showed an increasing trend from the first to the fourth fortnight and then decreased gradually in both normal and mastitis cows.
* The peak milk yield was attained in the third fortnight in mastitis cows and was maintained only for this period, while in normal cows, the peak milk yield was attained in the third and fourth fortnights.
3. The study found that the cows in the first parity took more time to attain peak yield in comparison to subsequent parity.
* The peak yield was minimum in the first parity and maximum in the fourth parity in both normal and mastitis cows.
* The lactation curve parameter of ascending slope parameter up to peak yield (b) was similar in both the groups in the first parity, declined in the second parity, and increased in the subsequent parities.
* The descending slope parameter (c) was lower in the first parity and higher in the fourth parity in normal cows, but in mastitis cows, it was minimum in the first parity and maximum in the fifth and above parity.

2. * NDGA consumption in mice, even at doses below its therapeutic dose, was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis.
3. * NDGA extended the lifespan of drosophila, suggesting that its target(s) and mechanism(s) of action may be phylogenetically conserved.
4. * However, aspects of the response in flies were unlike those in mice, with no effect on energy uptake or utilization.
5. * The doses of NDGA which extend murine lifespan appear to overlap the dosages which produce serious pathologies.
6. * The development of less toxic derivatives of NDGA, such as tetra-o-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid, are underway for potential use as cancer therapeutics.

* Genetic variation contributes to disease susceptibility and treatment response, with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enabling the discovery of genetic variants and pharmacogenetic markers.
* Personalized medicine involves more than just identifying the optimal drug and dosage; it also includes withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.
* Biomarkers are diverse and can be defined as any substance or biological structure that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain, or predict the incidence or outcome of disease.
* DNA biomarkers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), short tandem repeats (STRs), deletions, insertions, or other variation on the DNA sequence level, are stable over an individual's lifetime and can be used in both prospective and retrospective studies.
* DNA tumor biomarkers, specific to cancerous tumors, can generally not serve as surrogate markers, and their measurement can show greater variation depending on how they are measured.
* Current applications of biomarkers in personalized medicine include diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction, with examples including the use of EGFR mutation tests in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to determine whether first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is indicated.

* Genetic variation contributes to both disease susceptibility and treatment response. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled rapid discovery of genetic variants contributing to the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases and detection of many pharmacogenetic markers.
* Personalized medicine applications are far more broad than just identification of the optimal drug and the optimal dosage for a subgroup of patients. They might include situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.
* Biomarkers are diversely defined in the literature. A biomarker is any substance or biological structure that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain or predict the incidence or outcome of disease. However, it is a matter of debate whether the qualification that biomarkers must be measured in the human body is a reasonable limitation.

658,"1. Myosin VA (MyoVA) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. Its movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by lever arms to result in 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. Calcium is required for its ATPase activity, but high calcium concentrations reduce motor processivity and may cause one or more calmodulins to dissociate from the lever arm, reducing the efficiency of the lever arm displacement amplification and strain-dependent gating between the two heads.
2. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVA motors and their subdomains. MyoVA must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search, allowing it to switch actin tracks even at angles of up to ~150°. The structural domains critical to MyoVA's maneuverability have yet to be determined, but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction. The flexural stiffness of MyoVA subdomains was defined by TPM, and the motion of the MyoVA-s1 construct relative to actin was measured to estimate the lever arm stiffness. The addition of calcium led to a 40% reduction in lever arm flexural stiffness, likely due to the disassociation of calmodulins from the lever arm. This decrease in stiffness is expected to negatively impact the interhead communication and gating necessary for force production and processivity.",0
659,"1. * A study was conducted to determine if clinical outcomes after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
* Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 genes were genotyped in a cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
2. * Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the tested polymorphisms and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with EAC or ESCC.
* However, in multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type T/T genotype.
3. * Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) GA/GA genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type G/G genotype.
* These data suggest that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC.
4. * Many therapeutic options are used to treat esophageal cancer, but surgery is used most frequently to obtain loco-regional control and long-term survival.
* Despite attempts to improve the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer, prognosis remains poor with a 5-year overall survival of 20-30%.
5. * SNPs in the germ-line are the most common type of host genetic variations, and gene-related functional SNPs can potentially lead to differences in protein expression and/or function.
* Altered expression of the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 proteins has been correlated to disease progression and clinical outcome in patients with esophageal cancer.

It primarily spreads through the lymphatic system to locoregional lymph nodes, making the status of these lymph nodes important for staging and determining prognosis.
2. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the first draining nodes from a primary tumor and are most likely the first site of lymphatic metastasis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with the combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla.
3. The combined technique is performed by injecting a radioactive tracer (TC nanocolloid) and blue dye interstitially, either peritumorally or periareolarly. The tracers are then detected within the SLNs by the surgeon using a handheld scintillation counter (gamma probe) and/or visually.
4. The gamma probe is first used to transcutaneously localize the SLNs and determine the optimal incision site. Post-incision, both the blue dye and gamma probe guide the surgeon to the SLNs. After identification, the SLNs are removed and sent for histopathological examination.
5. With an identification rate of 96% and a false-negative rate of 5%10%, it is an effective procedure with low morbidity. However, the currently used technique has drawbacks, such as the use of radioisotopes being subject to stringent regulations on training of staff and handling and disposal of radioactive material.
6. Many hospitals worldwide do not have access to radioisotopes, resulting in only approximately 60% of patients in the western world and negligible numbers in the rest of the world having access to SLNB. This has led to the search for other techniques not reliant on the use of radioisotopes.

The study found that serum vaspin levels were not significantly different between patients with and without renal insufficiency (RI), regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, serum vaspin was lower in patients with T2DM compared to those without T2DM. Additionally, serum vaspin was related to creatinine clearance (CrCL), total cholesterol (TC), and HbA1c in all subjects.
* Multiple regression analyses showed that HbA1c was independently and significantly associated with vaspin concentration in all subjects. However, no significant correlations were detected between serum vaspin and any parameter in subjects with or without T2DM.
* The study also found that serum adiponectin levels were related to age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), hsCRP, CrCL, and creatinine (Cr) in subjects without T2DM. In patients with T2DM, serum adiponectin levels were related to fasting blood glucose (FBG) and LDL-C. In all subjects, serum adiponectin levels were related to age, SBP, CrCL, Cr, BUN, and HbA1c.
2. Multiple regression analyses showed that CrCL was independently and significantly associated with adiponectin concentration in all subjects. However, no significant correlations were detected between serum adiponectin and any parameter in subjects with or without T2DM.
* The study also found that serum vaspin and adiponectin levels were both higher in women than in men, whether in total subjects or in patients with T2DM.
* Adipose tissue is a highly active endocrine organ that secretes bioactive molecules called adipokines, such as vaspin and adiponectin. Vaspin is a member of the serine protease inhibitor family and has been shown to play an important role in the occurrence and development of the metabolic syndrome.

2. The trials involved patients with Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs larger than 1 cm, randomized to receive intralesional injections of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (RHEGF) or a placebo.
3. Surrogate markers for complete healing included percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT).
4. The EOT data were used as the comparison points for the 4-week area change, and ulcer areas and percent granulation were measured using a validated portable wound measurement device.
5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination.
6. Cutoff points were generated to maximize both sensitivity and specificity, and the association between surrogate variables and the final outcome (complete ulcer closure) was assessed.
7. The product coefficient (PC) was used to quantify the contribution of the surrogate on ulcer closure, and binary logistic regression was used to estimate the association between some baseline influencing factors and healing.
8. The granulation variable percent of granulation tissue covering the ulcer area (>75% or not) was confirmed as a surrogate marker, and the best cutoff points for variables based on area change at the EOT were selected.

2. The new tumor was found to be estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative, and HER2 positive, which is different from the initial tumor which was ER and PR positive and HER2 negative. This suggests that the new tumor is a new primary tumor (NPT) and not a true local recurrence (TR) of the previous tumor.
3. NPT and TR have different natural histories, prognosis, and implications for therapeutic management. NPT is more common in younger patients at initial diagnosis, and it is important to distinguish between the two for appropriate treatment and follow-up. The standard treatment for NPT is similar to that for de novo breast carcinoma, while TR may benefit from more aggressive adjuvant treatment.",0

• MS is characterized by network vascular inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage, leading to severe cognitive and physical impairments.
• White matter lesion can affect the cognition of MS patients, and it is difficult to differentiate primary progressive MS (PPMS) from relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) in the early phases.
2. Researchers have investigated the potential of using MRS as a diagnostic tool for MS, and have found that it can be used to diagnose both PPMS and RRMS.
• The most common clinical form of MS is relapsing-remitting, found in approximately 85% to 90% of cases.
• MS is a chronic disease that causes significant cognitive and physical impairments, making it a major focus of extensive studies worldwide.

6. Traditional endometrial sampling methods for histologic analysis include D&C and hysteroscopy, which are reliable for evaluating endometrial conditions.
7. A study was conducted to compare the adequacy of specimens obtained using the SAP-1 device with those obtained by D&C or hysteroscopic biopsy.
8. The study found that liquid-based SurePath preparation for endometrial cytology tests (ECT) can maintain the three-dimensional structure of the endometrium.
9. Histology is the gold standard for evaluating the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value (NPV) of ECT.
10. The study concluded that the sap-1 sampler combined with SurePath preparation may become a reliable method for screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor, especially in postmenopausal and asymptomatic women.",0

- * Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with high incidence rates in Europe and North America.
- * Mammography, both screen-film and digital, is the most commonly used procedure for breast cancer detection, with digital mammography becoming more prevalent due to its benefits over screen-film mammography.
- * Digital mammography (DM) has slightly higher sensitivity than screen-film mammography (SFM) and is less likely to be damaged, but it has limitations in detecting breast cancers in women with dense breast tissue.
- * Tomosynthesis, a 3-D mammography procedure, may help solve the problem of overlapping tissue in 2-D mammography, and the use of intravascular contrast material with DM may enhance tumor detection.
- * Newer prospective population-screening trials from Oslo, Italy, and Australia have provided more definitive results on the use of tomosynthesis in clinical settings.
- * Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been found to reduce radiation exposure by 40%-60% compared to SFM, and a specific digital system using slot scanning with a photon-counting detector has shown the lowest mean glandular dose in clinical screening settings in Europe.
- * The addition of DBT to standard mammography has been shown to increase mammogram accuracy, decrease recall rates, and increase cancer detection, but it doubles the radiation dose in screening.
- * Synthetically reconstructed 2-D images can be made from DBT data, eliminating the need for double exposures and reducing the radiation dose to that of conventional mammography.

2. The diphenhydramine-containing formulation was more effective in suppressing cough than dextromethorphan, another common antitussive.
3. The timing of the cough challenge may not have allowed for the maximal antitussive effect of dextromethorphan to be demonstrated.
4. The diphenhydramine-containing syrup also contains phenylephrine and natural cocoa flavoring, which may contribute to its overall efficacy.
5. The study provides initial evidence for the ability of diphenhydramine to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in acute pathological cough, but further clinical trials are needed.",0
673,"1. The global population is aging, and this trend is expected to continue, with aging being a major cardiovascular risk factor.
2. The endothelium, which forms the inner lining of blood vessels, plays a crucial role in vascular function and is vulnerable to aging due to hemodynamic stresses and oxidative radicals.
3. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by reduced vasodilator substance output and increased endothelium-derived contracting factors, can lead to atherosclerosis.
4. Regular aerobic exercise can slow down age-related losses in endothelial function by restoring NO availability and preventing ROS production.
5. Exercise training upregulates antioxidant defense mechanisms, and a critical role has been described for the transcription factor Nrf2 against oxidative stress.
6. Exercise-induced upregulation of vascular eNOS expression is closely related to the frequency and intensity of physical forces within the vasculature, especially shear stress.
7. Exercise produces a short-term proinflammatory response followed by a long-term anti-inflammatory adaptive response, which could contribute to the natural protective effects of physical activity.",0

	* Phosphatases can transfer a phosphate moiety from a high-energy inorganic di/tri/polyphosphate onto various hydroxylated compounds.
	* The authors evaluated several phosphatases as potential candidates for synthetic applications, including nonspecific acid phosphatase PhoNSE from Salmonella typhimurium and acid phosphatase PhoNSF from Shigella flexneri.
	* The authors found that phosphatases can phosphorylate various primary and secondary alcohols and sugars, and can be used in cascade reactions involving intermediates such as glucose6phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
2. The authors also discuss the challenges of using phosphatases for synthetic applications, including the reversibility of phosphate transfer and the competition between hydrolysis and transphosphorylation in aqueous medium.
	* To achieve high product titers, high substrate loads are required, and kinetic control is crucial to keep the phosphorylation/hydrolysis ratio as high as possible.
	* The authors found that phytase, which is commonly used as an animal feedstock additive, showed no transphosphorylation activity under their assay conditions.
	* The authors also found that aphast, which uses aspartic acid as a catalytic residue, contains Mg2+, whose activity is affected by inorganic polyphosphates by metal chelation.
3. The authors found that PhoNSF, PhoNSE, and Piacp were efficient catalysts in the phosphorylation of various alcohols.
	* Phosphorylation of primary diols proceeded to various degrees depending on the chain length.
	* The authors found that the presence of a negatively charged phosphate group in the proximity of the reacting hydroxy moiety determines whether a diol undergoes bisphosphorylation.
	* The authors also found that haloalcohol was converted by PhoNSE, which tolerated higher substrate concentrations than PhoNSF and Piacp.

676,"1. Biological invasions have been a problem for centuries, with non-native species such as the phylloxera and chestnut blight causing significant damage.
2. While Charles Elton's book on invasions in the mid-20th century did not spark widespread interest, an international project in the 1980s led to increased research and recognition of invasions as a major global environmental issue.
3. Research has shown that non-native species can impact ecosystems at the population, community, and ecosystem levels, affecting nutrient cycles and other processes.
4. Molecular genetic research has revealed that hybridization and introgression between native and non-native species is more common than previously thought.
5. Introgression can cause substantial evolution of native species and even lead to the creation of new, more invasive species.
6. Molecular genetic techniques are also used to trace sources and routes of invasions, and introduced populations often combine genes from multiple sources.
7. The ""invasional meltdown"" phenomenon occurs when multiple non-native species facilitate each other's establishment and impact on native species.
8. Lag effects, in which the full impact of an introduced species is not immediately evident, are also common.
9. Critics of invasion biology argue that the problem is overblown, that non-native species can increase native biodiversity, and that the antipathy towards non-native species is xenophobic. However, research shows that the impacts of non-native species are often significant and can lead to species extinctions and functional changes in ecosystems.",0

The researchers found that the addition of an intermediate screw decreased the range of motion (ROM) of the l2l4 segments in both the mps and pps groups, indicating enhanced stability. The mpsi and ppsi groups had significantly increased stiffness compared to the intact spine when using the intermediate screw in injured spines.
2. The study also found that there was a significant difference between mps and pps in flexion and extension. The short-segment construct in the pps group had significantly greater ROM in flexion and extension when compared with the mps group. The addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation, irrespective of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used. However, this increase was more significant for the mpsi construct.
3. The study has some limitations, such as the data being relevant only to results immediately after surgery and not taking into account early bone resorption or the cyclical loading effect. The flexibility of the construct was tested on a burst fracture model created in a controlled and reproducible manner, but the pattern and nature of a spinal burst fracture in the clinic are more variable and unpredictable. The study used an animal model, which has its advantages and disadvantages, and the number of cases in each group was less than what some might consider necessary to reach a meaningful conclusion. Nevertheless, the study provides a biomechanical rationale for using an intermediate screw at the level of fractured vertebrae with posterior short-segment fixation, especially when using monoaxial screws for fixing unstable burst fractures of the lumbar region.",0

The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for obtaining photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering that is typically needed for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, allowing for the use of conductive plastic substrates.
2. The ESA method has been demonstrated to significantly impact the crystal growth and crystallographic orientation of ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes. The addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to the ZnO surface results in the formation of vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO, with the space between the nanowires filled with aggregates of dye molecules.
3. The solid dye can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline solution, resulting in porous crystal ZnO thin films with a large surface area for adsorption of photosensitizer dye and high crystallinity for efficient transport of electrons. This can achieve high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of around 90%. The recent progress with the photocathodic DSSC presents a new opportunity to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized cathode systems that can eventually be combined with existing sensitized anodes for realization of a tandem solar cell to achieve high efficiencies in very simple structures.",0
680,"1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, and is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx.
	* A Tornwaldt's cyst can develop if the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, while crusts adhering to the orifice without obstruction will form the crust type.
	* The orifice of the bursa is not obstructed in the crust type, and the crust sheds periodically from the nasopharynx, causing an offensive smell and unpleasant taste.
2. The cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is more common and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal abscesses and cysts.
	* Although most patients are symptom-free, some will develop bursitis, a cyst, or an abscess.
	* The symptoms are of either a space-occupying lesion or rhinitis, and can include nasal obstruction, eustachian tube obstruction, dysphagia, cranial nerve paralysis, choanal discharge, halitosis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, gastritis, and occipital pain.
	* The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, but it can appear at any age, with a peak incidence between 15 and 30 years, and no gender predilection.
3. A clinicoanatomical audit was conducted to identify the incidence of nasopharyngeal bursa disease, its different types, and its clinical presentation over two years in a single rhinology practice.
	* Six patients were diagnosed with nasopharyngeal bursitis, with an incidence of less than 1% of all rhinitis patients seen during the study period.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the number of people with diabetes will rise to 552 million by 2030 if no action is taken.
2. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC-1) and estrogen-related receptor-alpha (ESRRA) are genes that have been associated with T2D. PGC-1 is involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis and -oxidation of fatty acids, while ESRRA is a vital regulator involved in a wide variety of cell functions such as mitochondrial biogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism.
3. A study found that ESRRα protein binding PGC-1 protein could regulate the expression of the mitofusin-2 (MFN2) gene, which maps to chromosome 1p36.22 and serves as a mitochondrial fusion protein. Tissues with high energetic requirements, such as skeletal muscle and heart, show high expression of the MFN2 gene.
4. The study found that the c allele of rs2878677 of the MFN2 gene in the diabetic group was lower than in the control group, indicating a borderline association between genotype distributions of rs873458 of the MFN2 gene and T2D. Additionally, analyses in the combined populations showed that the allele frequencies and genotype distributions of rs873458 and rs2878677 of the MFN2 gene had more significant effects on T2D susceptibility.
5. The study also found that haplotypes of the MFN2 gene, specifically a-c-g-t-c and g-t-c-t-c, were significantly associated with T2D. However, the frequencies of haplotypes in the ESRRA gene did not significantly differ in case-control subjects.
6. The study suggests that there are interactions between genetic variants in the MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1 gene, indicating that these genes may serve as partial",0

* High on-treatment platelet reactivity during clopidogrel therapy and low platelet inhibition are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, particularly stent thrombosis.
* Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (cyp2c19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and an increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting.
* Recent advances suggest that clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation, with the inactive prodrug undergoing oxidation to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic cyp450 enzymes and then being converted to the thiol metabolite.
2. * A recent study using sophisticated metabolomic methods suggested that a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (pon1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the second step of clopidogrel biotransformation.
* A common polymorphism of pon1 (q192r) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the qq (aa) haplotype, and this genotype has been associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis in two cohorts of patients with coronary stenting.
* In a group of patients with a history of prior stent thrombosis but who were not receiving current therapy with clopidogrel, reduced plasma activity of pon1 and the pon1 (qq192) genotype were associated with reduced active thiol metabolite exposure and reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.

2. In 1992, the NIH held a consensus development conference to discuss cholelithiasis treatment and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, concluding that it offered substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no increase in morbidity or mortality.
3. The panel found that laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduced pain and disability, leading to equal or slightly lower treatment costs and substantial savings for patients and society due to the shortened disability period.
4. Although charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often exceed those of open cholecystectomy, this is surprising because open cholecystectomy requires a longer hospital stay, more nursing support, and increased equipment costs.
5. Surgeons at Maricopa Medical Center identified excessive length of stay (LOS) and charges by comparing the cholecystectomy DRG (195) with 16 other hospitals in the region.
6. After eliminating confounding variables, the only reason for increased charges was the laparoscopy charge, providing a straightforward statistical comparison to determine laparoscopy charges.
7. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients from a 4-year database of 633 patients was conducted, comparing 35 converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies with 35 open cholecystectomies.
8. The average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922 (SD=$7,134), and for open cholecystectomies, $13,042 (SD=$9,715), with a $6,880 difference attributed to laparoscopy.
9. Decision tree analysis showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective, but if charges could be reduced to certain levels, depending on the conversion rate, laparoscopic cholecystectomy would become cost-effective.

Exogenous insulin administration helps restore glucose homeostasis and some patients experience a reduction in daily insulin requirements during a period called partial remission (PR) or honeymoon period.
2. PR is variable in intensity and duration, and its underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. However, it is believed that restoration of residual beta-cell mass activity in an insulin-sensitive environment is responsible for the condition. PR has driven interest as a crucial target period for interventions aiming at preserving residual beta-cell mass.
3. PR is defined as IDAA1c < 9, according to the definition by Mortensen et al. The study included 242 children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and followed up from diagnosis to adulthood. PR occurred in 56.2% of patients without any case of complete remission.
4. The proportion of girls and boys was comparable among remitters and nonremitters. Mean age at diagnosis was similar between subgroups, and height and BMI z-scores were also similar between subgroups and to the distribution of healthy Belgian children.
5. Most patients had no DKA at diagnosis, and the absence of DKA was significantly higher in PR than in no PR patients. This effect was more pronounced in boys, who had a higher PR frequency when no DKA occurred at diagnosis.
6. Mean PR duration was 9.2 months with no differences between gender and age subgroups. In 71.6% of patients, PR duration was shorter than 1 year, and PR mostly occurred during the first 6 months.
7. PR duration or a1c+2y levels did not correlate with occurrence of severe hypoglycemia or diabetes-related complications during follow-up until adulthood. The overall occurrence of PR was 56.2%, and mean PR duration was 9.2 months, which was comparable to other studies.",0

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder, often caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, that is associated with an increased risk of developing a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. The prevalence of SCH varies and can be influenced by factors such as age, sex, race, and iodine intake. Despite the high prevalence of SCH, the clinical significance and optimal treatment of this disorder remain controversial.
* The treatment of SCH is typically only considered for pregnant women, infertile individuals, those with symptoms, or those at high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. The TRUST study, a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial, is currently underway to assess the potential benefits and risks of thyroid hormone replacement in older adults with SCH.
2. SCH is characterized by an isolated elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with a normal free thyroxine (FT4) level. Higher levels of TSH are associated with an increased body mass index (BMI), worsening blood pressure (BP), and altered lipid levels. SCH is also associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.
* Thyroid hormone replacement therapy in SCH patients has been shown to improve systolic and diastolic heart function, endothelial function, and carotid intima-media thickness. However, the benefits of thyroid hormone replacement therapy on serum lipid levels and clinical outcomes in SCH patients remain controversial.

4. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation c. 1628_1629delct in the patient and her two affected daughters.
5. The syndrome is characterized by the progressive development of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, with clinical manifestations starting since puberty and a higher incidence in females.
6. BSS has been associated with an increased risk of salivary gland neoplasms and other tumors, with cylindromas often forming the ""turban tumor"" and spiradenomas appearing in the extremities, trunk, and less frequently in the scalp.
7. The loss of deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis, and germ-line mutations predispose to the disease.
8. The case highlights the importance of a correct diagnosis, periodic follow-up, and genetic counseling for BSS patients and their family members.",0
696,"1. Biological scaffold materials derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa have been used in soft tissue repair applications such as hernia repair, breast reconstruction, and orthopedic applications.
2. Biological scaffolds are particularly useful in contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria.
3. Absorbable polymer scaffolds, such as Dexon and Vicryl, have been developed and are degraded in vivo through hydrolysis.
4. Dexon is comprised of polyglycolic acid and is fully resorbed in approximately 60-90 days, while Vicryl is a copolymer of glycolide and lactide and loses 77% of its strength in the first 14 days.
5. Both Dexon and Vicryl scaffolds lose mechanical strength and are resorbed fairly quickly, making them less than ideal for hernia repair applications.
6. Newer absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly.
7. Gore Bio-A has been evaluated in clinical applications with promising outcomes, but larger clinical trials are needed to fully understand its long-term capabilities.
8. Tigr Matrix has been evaluated in a long-term animal model and clinical trial, showing a typical long-term inflammatory response and gradual resorption.
9. Phasix Mesh, a fully resorbable polymer monofilament, has been evaluated in a porcine model for hernia repair applications, demonstrating similar mechanical properties and resorption profile compared to native abdominal wall.",0
697,"1. * Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, mediated by van genes with vanA and vanB being the most prevalent, has become a significant issue in hospitals in recent years.
* Denmark has seen a dramatic increase in vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium due to multiclonal outbreaks since 2012.
2. * Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers.
* A culture-based method using overnight enrichment and subsequent plating on chromogenic agar has been used in the laboratory to screen for VRE, but a fully automated system integrating DNA extraction and real-time PCR was implemented in 2014 to improve detection.
3. * The Xpert VANA/VANB assay performed directly on rectal swabs provides results within an hour and was used to guide rapid implementation of infection control measures.
* The assay had a sensitivity of 87.1% and a specificity of 99.7% for vanA PCR, but the specificity and positive predictive value of the vanB part of the assay were low.
4. * The assay had a considerable impact on infection control decision making, saving 141 isolation days and 292 transmission risk days as a result of 1110 pcr analyses.
* However, detailed health economics calculations are necessary to determine the isolated value of the pcr assay, considering the assay's official price and estimated additional costs per isolation day.",0
698,"1. The study found that a local tissue RAAS (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System) plays a significant role in the pathology of cardiovascular diseases.
2. Aldosterone/Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) activation in the nondiabetic heart can cause structural and electrical remodeling, fibrosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and arrhythmias.
3. MR antagonists, such as eplerenone, have shown beneficial effects in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial infarction.
4. The beneficial effects of MR blockade in pathological states such as diabetes are unclear.
5. Inhibitors of the RAAS, such as ACEIs (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) and ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers), protect against hypertension and/or diabetes-induced end-organ damage.
6. ACEIs and/or ARBs do not completely block end-organ damage in diabetes and/or hypertension, and clinical trials of ACEIs and ARBs in combination have generally shown that they do not offer added benefits.
7. The study aimed to characterize and compare the effects of Ru28318 (Ru), Captopril (Capt), and Losartan (Los), alone or in double and triple therapy combinations, administered either before or after ischemia on ischemia/reperfusion- (I/R-) induced cardiac dysfunction in isolated hearts obtained from normal and diabetic rats.
8. The results showed that Ru, Ru + Los, and triple therapy similarly gave the most rapid recovery within 10 minutes of reperfusion for LVEDP when given before ischemia in diabetic hearts.
9. The study concluded that the optimal treatment strategy of RAAS blockade to prevent or treat ischemia-reperfusion injury in normal and diabetic hearts needs further investigation.
10. The study also suggested that optimal usage of drug(s) alone or in combination may require their selection based on several criteria, including their relative benefit in the normal versus pathological state, whether being considered for prevention or treatment strategy, on the specific cardiac parameter that might need to be improved, and on the optimal rate of card",0
699,"1. Modern nasal surgery aims to improve both the cosmetic appearance and natural functions of the nose, while objective measurement of airway patency is essential in modern respiratory medicine.
	* Acoustic rhinometry (AR) is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry, demonstrating a close correlation between cross-sectional area measured by AR and rhinomanometry.
	* Several significant associations between nasal cavity dimensions and nasal airflow have been reported, with the most important benefit of AR being its ease of performance and minimal subject cooperation required.
	* However, nose geometry can be influenced by various factors, including race, age, sex, height, weight, and smoking habit.
2. The study evaluates changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers who underwent cosmetic rhinoplasty using AR and comparing differences in length, minimal cross-sectional area (MCA), and volume of each nasal cavity before and after surgery.
	* The cases were all healthy, without any prior history of nose surgery, fracture, allergy or asthma, and sinus disorders, and had no complaint about nasal obstruction.
	* All cases were Iranian, aged at least 18, who were visited in the ENT clinic of Rassul-e-Akram Teaching Hospital between 2006 and 2008.
	* The surgeries were open rhinoplasty with or without septoplasty, with variations dependent on the surgeons' preference.
3. The device used in the measurements consisted of a sound source and a microphone for acquisition, with a sound pulse generated and all measurements performed in a relatively quiet room at normal temperature.
	* The measurements were performed during a breathing pause while patients were in a sitting position, with a nosepiece used to ensure a tight connection between the nosepiece and tip of the nose.
	* Care was taken not to obstruct the nasal vestibule with gel or deform the nose during testing.
	* The angle of the incident acoustic impulse was about 45 degrees with respect to a line joining the base of the piriform aperture of the nose to the tragus.
4. Measurements were performed in either of two conditions, without a decongestant and with a decongestant, before and after surgery.

700,"1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in many developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths, and its incidence is still increasing. Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of CVD risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
2. The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been proven in several observational and experimental studies. The lipid-lowering action of n-3 PUFAs was detected at the beginning, and they were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders. Their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects were observed later.
3. Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease characterized by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop throughout the disease progression.
4. Endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins, maintaining a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts, leading to an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 1, 2, and 6 (IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-).
5. These pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce oxidative stress by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by monocytes, macrophages, and leukocytes. PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response.
6. Unsaturated fatty acids are referred to as PUFAs when two or more double bonds are present. There are two PUFA families, omega-3 (n-3) and omega-",0
701,"1. The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is based on the work of three pioneering pathologists.
   - Rudolf Virchow proposed that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation.
2. Numerous examples of inflammation-induced cancers are now appreciated, including gastric cancers associated with chronic atrophic gastritis.
   - Pelayo Correa, a pathologist from Colombia, devoted his career to understanding the etiology of gastric cancer and proposed a model for its development.
3. Correa's model hypothesized that the development of intestinal subtype gastric cancer results from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over 30-50 years.
   - Initially, Correa thought that environmental factors, such as a diet high in salt and n-nitroso-compounds, were responsible for promoting this slow progression.
4. In 1988, Correa briefly discussed a possible role for Campylobacter pylori in the initiation of gastric cancer.
   - Warren and Marshall discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, leading to their Nobel Prize win in 2005.
5. H. pylori infection is a definite carcinogen and significantly increases the risk of developing noncardia gastric cancer.
   - Caga-positive H. pylori strains increase the risk of gastric cancer to a greater extent than do infections by the more rare caga-negative strains.
6. H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer.
   - A prolonged observational study showed that h pylori-infected patients had a much higher rate of progression to gastric cancer than patients without initial evidence of h pylori.
7. Recent intervention studies have prompted renewed interest in screening for h pylori and eradicating the organism as a potentially cost-effective strategy.
   - A pilot study of mass population screening and eradication started in Taiwan in 2004, and the initial results are very promising",0
702,"• The study compares the functional and anatomical outcomes of bevacizumab and ranibizumab therapies in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Turkey.
• Both groups showed significant improvement in mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) compared to baseline at every time point.
• There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in regards to change in BCVA and CRT, injection numbers, and complications.
• The study's findings align with previous clinical studies that found similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes for both drugs.
• The CATT study, a multicenter noninferiority trial, reported no significant difference between the two drugs in visual acuity and anatomical outcomes at 1 and 2 years, but the rate of serious adverse events was found to be greater in the bevacizumab groups than the ranibizumab groups.",0
703,"1. Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, affecting 25% of pregnancies. Traditionally, proteinuria has been used to diagnose PE, but recent studies have shown that it is not a significant predictor of adverse outcomes.
* In China, the incidence of PE has increased due to the two-child policy, but there is no indicator for severe PE. Severe PE is often combined with hypoalbuminemia, which may serve as an indicator of severity.
* Hypoalbuminemia is caused by systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged vascular endothelial cells, leading to intravascular dehydration and a loss of plasma proteins.
* This intravascular dehydration may accelerate the appearance of intravascular lesions, which are thought to be a predisposing factor for HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
2. A retrospective cohort study of 299 women with PE was conducted to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes according to albumin levels.
* Women with severe hypoproteinemia (SHP) were delivered almost 1.5 weeks earlier than those with mild hypoproteinemia (MHP), and the percentage of cesarean sections (CS) was higher in the SHP group.
* Severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta were more frequent in the SHP group.
* Neonatal outcomes were worse in the SHP group, with a significantly lighter average birth weight and a higher rate of fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries.
3. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that SHP was a significant risk factor for CS, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes in PE women.
* The pathophysiologic mechanisms of PE are unclear, but it is believed that gestational hypertension and PE are isolate disease processes with different mechanisms.
* PE patients often have multiple organ hypoperfusion, and the reduction of hepatic blood flow due to the production of albumin is decreased, leading to the gradual development of",0
704,"1. The use of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as Avastin (bevacizumab) and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors has shown the potential of targeting the VEGF-A signaling pathway in cancer treatment. However, the recent withdrawal of Avastin for treating breast cancer in the US highlights the need for careful cost-benefit analysis and the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments.
2. Alternative ligands for the angiogenic receptor VEGFR-2, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families, like Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), are potential candidates for promoting resistance to Avastin. Other mechanisms, such as vascular mimicry, the involvement of endothelial precursor cells, or altered tumor metabolism, may also contribute to the development of resistance.
3. PIGF, a ligand for VEGFR-1, has been reported to play a dual role in cancer, acting as a stimulator of angiogenesis and as an autocrine or paracrine factor promoting tumor cell proliferation. Its role in driving tumor angiogenesis and growth appears to be context-dependent, influenced by the presence of other VEGF family members and the diverse expression of VEGFRs on various cell types.
4. VEGFR-3 is expressed on lymphatic endothelium and can promote lymphangiogenesis, making it a potential target for anti-cancer therapy. VEGF-C and VEGF-D, closely related subfamily members within the VEGF family, have been associated with poor patient outcomes in some tumor types and promote tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and metastatic spread.
5. Targeting the VEGF-D signaling pathway in cancer could inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, restricting solid tumor growth and metastatic spread. Various agents specifically targeting VEGF family members and their receptors are in development, with mAbs to VEGF-B, VEGF-C,",0
705,"1. Malaria is a significant public health concern in many countries, including Iran, with a substantial reduction in incidence in recent years due to control measures.
	* In Iran, Plasmodium vivax is the primary cause of malaria, accounting for 85-90% of cases.
	* The country has implemented a pre-elimination program since 2009, focusing on preventing strategies, active case detection, and timely treatment of patients in endemic areas.
2. Early recognition of all parasite carriers with varying disease symptoms and parasite rates is crucial for achieving malaria elimination.
	* Active surveillance by precise laboratory methods in endemic areas is an appropriate tool for detecting all kinds of infections, particularly asymptomatic ones with low parasite densities.
	* Formerly, asymptomatic malaria infections were described in hyper-endemic regions, with a fluctuation in prevalence among various endemic regions.
3. The importance of regional acquisition of symptomless infection and accurate detection methods cannot be overstated in asymptomatic malaria investigation.
	* Light microscopy remains the standard laboratory method for malaria diagnosis, but its reliance is limited due to associated restrictions.
	* Chromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and molecular methods, such as nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are used as complementary and highly sensitive means of malaria detection.
4. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Bagh-e-Malek, a low transmission region in Hormozgan Province, Southern Iran, to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections using microscopy, RDT, and nested-PCR.
	* Hormozgan Province is an endemic area with approximately 10.8% of all Iranian malaria patients in 2011, with Plasmodium vivax being the predominant species.
	* The study aimed to help further case surveillance strategies in the region and across all endemic settings in Iran, contributing to achieving malaria elimination nationwide.
5. The study involved 200 healthy volunteers from Bagh-e-Malek, with no malaria symptoms, anti-malarial drug use in three weeks, or travel history to other malaria-endemic areas in the past three months.

An in vivo study was conducted using a 4-year-old merino ewe, where an actuator device made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and silver electrodes was implanted in the left hind limb, and a control device was implanted in the right hind limb.
• The actuator device was programmed to apply a 5 V square wave of 1 Hz and 3 Hz for 15 minutes at each frequency, once every 24 hours.
• The results suggest that piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect may be used to effectively stimulate bone growth at the bone implant interface, eliciting an early response.
2. The study also examines the effect of the actuator device on bone formation and mineral apposition rate. The results show that total bone area around the actuators is significantly higher compared to static controls, and the increment of bone occupied area is due to new bone formation.
• The mineral apposition rate is significantly higher around actuated devices (4.44 1.67 m/day) than around static devices (2.70 0.95 m/day).
• However, there is no significant difference in fibrous capsule thickness surrounding the devices, suggesting that the electric insulation remained satisfactory.
3. The study highlights the potential advantages of using piezoelectric materials in clinical applications. They enable a wide range of deformation/displacement, frequencies, and regimens, making them excellent candidate components of actuators for clinical purposes.
• However, new materials with better biocompatibility should be developed to ensure accurate evaluation of the bone-material interface and minimize potential risks associated with coating damage and electrical current.
• Further studies are needed to enlarge the animal study, study response with longer implantation times, and evaluate new materials with better biocompatibility.",0

2. Serum L-fucose levels progressively increased with the stages of oral cancer, with stage IV showing the highest level.
3. There was no significant correlation between serum L-fucose levels and histopathological grading between genders and ages.
4. L-fucose is a monosaccharide that plays an important role in cell-to-cell communication and signaling pathways.
5. Changes in glycosylation of cell surface proteins, including increased fucosylation, are essential in tumor progression and metastasis.
6. Estimation of serum L-fucose levels has been suggested as a promising approach for the early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of various cancer types.
7. The study found a negative correlation between serum fucose levels and histopathological tumor differentiation in oral cancer patients.

   * Half of the rats were suspended by the tail to prevent weight-bearing on the hindlimbs (non-weight-bearing or NWB group), while the other half were allowed to move freely in their cages (weight-bearing or WB group).
2. * The results showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ONFH between the WB and NWB groups for either the femoral or humeral heads.
   * However, the histopathological appearance of the femoral head showed empty lacunae and decreased hematopoietic cells in both groups, while the humeral head showed normal trabeculae and increased hematopoietic cells in the NWB group.
3. * The study also found that mega-dose corticosteroid therapy for trauma does not induce ONFH, while the administration of LPS and methylprednisolone in rats can encourage the development of non-traumatic ONFH.
   * However, the rat model may not be useful for observing the mechanism of femoral head collapse due to differences in weight-bearing between quadruped and bipedal animals.
4. * The study concluded that weight-bearing is not related to the development of non-traumatic ONFH in the rat model, but the aetiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of non-traumatic ONFH remain unclear.",0

There is a growing recognition of the importance of nurses' involvement in national health policy processes due to their significant role in healthcare delivery and their unique insights into service delivery and health systems strengthening. However, historically, nurses have had limited involvement in policy formulation and modification.
* This underengagement has been attributed to various factors, including lack of awareness of policy-related issues and processes, inadequate knowledge and skills on how to contribute to policies, and limited opportunities to participate in policy decisions.
* Gender differences in the healthcare system have also contributed to this issue, with nursing being predominantly viewed as a woman's occupation and men being more likely to be in positions of power and decision-making.
* In Kenya, nurses' underengagement has also been attributed to an inadequate policy focus in undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, and several strategies have been proposed to enhance nurses' engagement in policy processes, including assuming formal leadership positions and engaging in lobbying and advocacy through professional organizations.
2. Studies have shown that nurses can engage in policy processes directly by assuming formal leadership positions in the healthcare system and indirectly through lobbying and advocacy with policy-makers via professional organizations.
* Nurse leaders can identify issues strategically, work with decision-makers, and understand who holds the power in healthcare organizations and who controls resources to influence them.
* Building nurses' understanding of and competencies in policy and politics by integrating pertinent courses in nursing training and fellowship programs can also enhance their engagement in policy processes.
* However, there is a need to strengthen LMIC nurses' research abilities to enhance their ability to understand, generate, and utilize research knowledge that is useful for policy change.
* Few empirical studies have examined the extent of nurses' involvement in policy development processes in the African context, and there is a need for more research in this area.
3. A survey of nurse leaders' involvement in health policy processes in East Africa found that nurse leaders' participation in all stages of policy development was limited and inconsistent.
* A study on nurses' involvement in HIV/AIDS policy in four LMICs, including Kenya and Uganda, revealed nurses' lack of involvement in policy processes, poor communication of policies from the national level, and a lack of resources for nurses to implement the policies.
* Studies have rarely compared the perspectives of nurses and other decision-makers regarding nurses' engagement in policy development and implementation processes",0
712,"1. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in infants and young children, but the frequency, symptoms, and causative organisms can vary based on sex, age, and gender.
2. Neonates with UTIs typically present with non-specific symptoms and require a complete sepsis workup followed by a 7-14 day course of antibiotic therapy.
3. Recent reports show emerging patterns of resistance toward empirical antibiotics, especially ampicillin, making the early choice of antibiotics more challenging.
4. The criticalness of this issue lies in the fact that those diagnosed earlier and treated accordingly are less likely to bear long-term consequences, reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
5. UTIs in neonates often present with non-specific systemic symptoms such as fever, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, growth failure, abnormal urination, and jaundice.
6. The non-specific presentations can make UTIs hard to diagnose, and the reported prevalence ranges from 4-25% in very low weight infants to 0.1-1% in term infants.
7. UTIs in newborns could lead to urosepsis or neonatal sepsis, which is why they are often managed as a case of sepsis.
8. Most UTIs in infants are caused by gram-negative bacilli, with E. coli being the most prevalent organism causing UTIs in all ages, including the neonatal period.",0
713,"1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders that cause a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of all affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
2. The deficiency of 21-hydroxylase leads to decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in hyperplasia of the adrenal gland and increased virilization due to the diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens. There are different clinical forms of CAH associated with 21-OHD, including classical CAH (salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms) and the non-classical form, which may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of postnatal or even adult onset hyperandrogenism.
3. The study found that 42.3% of patients with CAH due to 21-OHD showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, moderate right temporal lobe atrophy, globular hippocampus with unidentified internal structures, partially empty sella, and cortico-subcortical atrophy associated with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. These abnormalities were more frequent in patients with poor hormonal control due to non-compliance with medication.
4. The study suggests that hormonal imbalance during brain development and corticosteroid treatment could contribute to the brain MRI abnormalities in CAH patients. Chronic hyperandrogenism due to non-compliance with treatment and aldosterone deficiency could also be involved in the genesis of brain MRI abnormalities. The study also highlights the need for more extensive studies to define better the relationships between brain involvement and different CAH phenotypes and treatment regimens.",0
714,"1. The human genome draft sequence, delivered by both publicly funded and corporate projects, is expected to bring significant biomedical advances this century. However, navigating the vast genomic DNA data can be challenging due to the uniform appearance of the genomic landscape.
	* Different communities of biologists have distinct dialects, especially when it comes to the term 'function'. They might focus on designing active-site inhibitors, studying gene pathways, or relating genotype to phenotype.
	* To make the genome accessible to all scientific communities, universal vocabularies are necessary for annotating (assigning names and functions to) genes.
2. There are two common ways to annotate genes: experimental characterization and predicted evolutionary relationships.
	* Websites like LocusLink, GeneCards, EuGenes, and Ensembl integrate information from diverse sources, providing sequence, molecular and cellular function, and human disease insights.
	* Annotation is currently limited to characterized human genes, but evolutionary relationships can help predict functions for the remaining genes.
3. Homologous genes have similar tertiary structures and functions, making it possible to infer clues from experimentally gleaned homologs.
	* Homology is based on evolution, not function, so homologs may not share molecular mechanisms or may overlap in function with non-homologs.
	* Assigning homology provides an approximate direction for empirical determination of function, like laying down a compass bearing.
4. Gene annotation by homology has its pitfalls, as homologs may not share similarities in molecular mechanism or function.
	* The first completely sequenced genomes, like Haemophilus influenzae, were annotated using sequence database searches, assuming that genes are either homologous or not.
	* A major problem arises when homologous portions of genes are embedded in otherwise dissimilar, non-homologous contexts, demonstrating that evolution has constantly fused and divided genes.
5. Domains are compact units of structure that represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution.
	* Pfam, SMART, Prosite, Celera (Panther), and TIGR predict domains using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments.

* Recent technical developments have focused on real-time monitoring, and several systems are available on the market, including Polar Team Pro, Acentas Team Monitoring System, Suunto Pro Team Pack, and Activio Sport System.
* These systems allow direct and real-time monitoring of several individuals at the same time, and data are transmitted wirelessly to a receiver connected with a standard laptop with relevant software.
* However, a direct comparison of these systems and the validity of recorded data are missing in the literature, and the main purpose of this study was to compare all systems in a field test against each other.
2. The study tested the operating distance and validity against a commercially available ECG and evaluated the installation and use of software and hardware of the above-mentioned systems.
* A total of 12 active people participated in the study, and ten men of an amateur soccer team conducted an online field test during a real football match.
* The study used four commercially available systems for all tests: Polar Team Pro, Acentas Team Monitoring System, Suunto Pro Team Pack, and Activio Sport System.
* The rating system was set in favor of the measurement, which was represented by 200 scores of maximal 500, and the remaining 300 were equally divided on quality of the hardware and the usability of the software.
3. Subcategories were weighted subjectively by the authors in consideration of heart rate monitoring of team sports, including the monitoring of 10 or more subjects in parallel.
* The main field test was the measurement of failure ratio during the half-time of a real soccer match.
* All players apart from the goalkeeper were equipped with chest belts of the relevant system and measured during the first half (= 45 min) of a league soccer game during four home matches in summer 2009.

* These characteristics support the hierarchical theory of cell propagation and growth, first proposed by Virchow in the mid-19th century.
* To classify a cell as a stem cell, it must be isolated and its behaviors induced in vitro.
2. Stem cells in the lung have been identified by their role in the response to injury.
* The lung epithelia have a low proliferative fraction, making identification of stem cells more difficult than in tissues with higher turnover rates.
* Populations of stem cells have been identified throughout the lung, and they exhibit the functional tenets of stem cell behavior: self-renewal, proliferation, and multipotency.
3. In proximal airways, tracheal basal cells expressing keratin-5 (k5) have been identified as pluripotent and capable of giving rise to multiple phenotypes in response to airway injury.
* Squamous cell carcinoma, which frequently arises in the more proximal tracheobronchial airways, has been associated with elevated levels of k5 basal cells.
* This stem cell niche may provide a direction for targeted research and a unique biomarker for targeting the cell of origin in these tumors.
4. In middle airways, mature rat clara cells can proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny after injury.

2. The prototype showed similar mean bond strength values to the tensile test, and was not influenced by the way it was held, indicating that it may be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo.
3. The bracket debonding performed with the prototype and the universal testing machine showed no significant difference in bond strength, suggesting that the prototype might be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo.
4. The study also found that debonding with the prototype was a safe method for preserving the enamel surface, as the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding.",0

* TV infection is associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes such as pelvic inflammatory disease, low infant birth weight, and premature delivery.
* TV infection also increases the transmission and acquisition of other STIs, including HIV infection.
2. The prevalence of TV infection is not monitored in most countries, and control programs do not exist.
* In Peru, TV diagnostic testing is not included in STI guidelines, and the syndromic management of suspected vaginal trichomoniasis is the standard for clinical care.
* A better understanding of the epidemiology of TV infection in women is needed to foster disease control programs in populations at risk for reproductive health complications.
3. A cross-sectional analysis of behavioral and biological data from a cohort of women in coastal Peru was conducted from 2003 to 2005.
* Participants were recruited from low-income neighborhoods in three coastal Peruvian cities and were socially marginalized women who contradicted Peruvian social norms.
* Eligible women were recruited from venues such as volleyball fields, hair salons, parks, bars, and street corners.
4. Participants underwent pretest counseling for STIs, including HIV infection, and were tested for TV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, HIV-1, herpes virus simplex type 2 antibodies, and syphilis.

Rubella infection during early pregnancy can result in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the fetus, but vaccination of susceptible individuals can prevent the disease and its complications. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent CRS, which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.

• The most commonly used rubella vaccine is derived from the Ra27/3 virus strain and makes more immunity compared to other vaccines.
• In Iran, the rubella and mumps vaccines were added to the national vaccination plan in 2003, resulting in the vaccination of 98% of the 5 to 25 age group.
• A study in Kermanshah, Iran, found that mass rubella vaccination caused a highly significant decrease in the rate of negative antibody from 20.42% to 0.7%.

2. The spread of rubella has been decreased among children due to extensive vaccination, and the disease is usually rare in infants born from IgG positive mothers due to antibody transfer.

• The disease is spread globally, and before the vaccination era, the maximum of its attacks had been between February and April in countries without effective vaccination policies.
• Rubella is endemic and causes outbreaks in winter and early spring in closed populations such as military camps or prisons.
• In Australia, the rubella vaccination was established for schoolgirls in 1971, resulting in a significant decrease in CRS.
• In Denmark, the vaccination policy was optional for schoolgirls from 1974, but in 1987, it was replaced by extensive vaccination with two doses of MMR.

3. A seroepidemiological study in Chahar Mahal-va-Bakhtiari province, western Iran, using the hemoagglutination inhibition (HI) method, indicated 90.5% immunity against rubella.

Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a technique used to visualize gene expression patterns in embryos, and has been improved with the use of nonradioactive probes and fluorescent methods. However, there are still limitations in detecting multiple transcripts simultaneously and achieving single-cell resolution.
2. Quantum dots (QDs) are a new type of inorganic fluorophore that have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between the excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching. These properties make QDs a promising candidate for detecting multiple mRNAs in WISH protocols.
3. Previous efforts to use QDs for RNA detection in whole embryos have been met with aggregation issues and difficulties in using QDs for fish experiments. However, new methods of creating hydrophilic QDs and the availability of hydrophilic QD conjugates have made it possible to use QDs for RNA detection in whole embryos.
4. The use of QDs for nonamplified fluorescent WISH in xenopus embryos, which are highly autofluorescent and demanding vertebrate developmental organisms, suggests that QD WISH will find successful applications in most developmental models. The high fluorescence intensity and ideal optical properties of QDs make them an attractive alternative to traditional fluorophores for WISH.
5. Future work is needed to closely examine the resolution of QD WISH in model systems and to determine the feasibility of using QDs to detect two or more transcripts simultaneously. The use of QDs for WISH has the potential to simultaneously give macroscopic and intracellular data regarding the distribution of mRNAs in vertebrate embryos, and to create three-dimensional maps of expression at a previously unattainable resolution.",0

2. Two new Cox regression models have been developed to estimate survival for patients with resectable and unresectable PDAC, using variables such as age, gender, race, tumor stage, tumor site, tumor grade, and radiotherapy. An interactive online clinical calculator has been created based on these models to estimate personalized survival probability.
3. A web-based real-time prognostic tool has been developed using SEER data and Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for various covariates, to estimate survival and conditional survival probabilities for patients with PDAC. This tool has been proven to be reliable and generalizable, allowing for its use in different geographical areas.",0

2. The diagnosis and management of CLI were based on the Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) or its revised consensus (TASC II).
3. PTA was the first-choice procedure for revascularization, except for heavily calcified or diffusely occluded lesions.
4. Major amputation was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control their foot lesions.
5. The study analyzed the impact of preoperative variables, such as sex, age, activities of daily living (ADLs), Fontaine stage, infection, diabetic condition, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level, on limb salvage and survival.
6. Diabetic patients had a higher prevalence of Fontaine stage IV and hemodialysis than those without diabetes.
7. The follow-up period was 1.7±1.4 years, and 48 patients underwent major amputations and 89 died.
8. The leading cause of death was cardiac and vascular disease, followed by infection and unspecified causes.

• CE in humans often presents with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other organs, and diagnosis is usually established through radiology and serology.
• Postsurgical follow-up of CE patients is necessary to detect newly growing or relapsing cysts, and a posttreatment follow-up method should include markers for tracking previously undetected but still viable cysts.
• Serology has been used for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies makes it difficult to diagnose relapse by serology.
2. A study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of CE and determined the diagnostic performance of Western blot.
• Blood samples were obtained from 50 patients with clinically/radiologically diagnosed CE, 40 non-CE patients with different parasitic infections and malignancy, and 20 sex and age-matched healthy controls.
• Hydatid cyst fluid antigen (HCF) was prepared from fertile hydatid cysts obtained from livers of naturally infected sheep, and HCF was subjected to discontinuous SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
• The membranes were cut into strips and blocked with skimmed milk in washing buffer, then incubated with test sera and horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgG.
3. IgG immunoreactivity from patients with CE revealed multiple immunoreactive bands ranging from 18-239 kDa.
• The major immunoreactive bands were 24, 39, 46, 52, 57, 60-61, and 63 kDa.

The study included 66 patients with a mean age of 55.8±11.6 years, consisting of 40 women and 26 men. Patients were divided into three groups based on their obesity level.
2. The study calculated various body mass-related indices, such as BMI, WHR, WHtR, VAI, and BAI, and lipid metabolism indices, such as TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C ratios. The results showed that there were negative significant correlations between BMI, WC, and HDL-C, and positive significant correlations between WC, WHR, and TG/HDL-C.
3. The study found that lipid disorders were the most frequent concomitant disorders in the study population. The group of patients with class III obesity had lower mean serum levels of TC and LDL-C compared with patients from the other two groups.
4. The study suggests that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C. The VAI index demonstrated the strongest correlation with TG and HDL-C levels and with the lipid indices TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C.
5. The study highlights the importance of new obesity indices, such as VAI, WHtR, and BAI, in assessing the risk of metabolic complications and cardiovascular events in obese patients. However, there is little data about the associations between other newer obesity indices and lipid profile in obese patients. Therefore, the study aimed to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.",0

2. The study also found that addicts had poor mental, physical, and social health scores, as well as high anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression scores. Moderate users and possible addicts used the internet mostly for social networking, academic purposes, chatting, emailing, gaming, and downloading media files and pornography.
3. The study suggests that further research is needed to understand the extent of internet addiction among college students in India and to formulate interventions like setting boundaries and detecting early warning signs of underlying psychopathology. The study also notes that it is unclear whether depression precedes the development of internet addiction or is a consequence, and suggests that assessment of depression is imperative in suspected cases of internet addiction.",0
730,"1. The frequency response of resonators was measured using a downmixing method, which involves electrostatically actuating the device and applying a driving voltage to a side-gate parallel to the resonator.
	* The drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency to reduce parasitic signals, resulting in the resonator's motion being proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.
	* A bias voltage was used to down-mix the resistance change occurring at the actuation frequency, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier.
2. Measurements were taken in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and room temperature, with typical bias voltage measurement values of 1.5 V at a frequency of 500 khz.
	* Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same setup, but with the drive electrode disconnected.
	* The allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration, and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
3. The phase of the measured signal was monitored for a certain amount of time and transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.
	* Close to the resonance frequency, this phase response was linear, and using the complete phase response of the resonator instead of this linearization does not significantly alter the allan deviation.
	* Harmonics appearing at the frequency of the electricity supply were filtered out of data during post-processing.
4. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within the resonator's bandwidth.
	* The measurement setup was based on the one described in supplementary section 3, but here each signal was doubled, using two drive signals at different frequencies, two bias signals, and two measurement signals.
	* Particular care was taken when choosing the drive signal amplitudes so that the resonator remained in the linear regime.
5. The phase traces were converted to frequency traces corresponding to the different integration times.
	* The complete phase response of the resonator was used rather than the linear approximation, as the frequencies for phase samples can be quite different from the resonance frequency.
	* With this method, two frequency sample arrays with an integration time 0 were obtained.

However, many studies on aspirin use for CVD prevention may not accurately reflect physician recommendations due to self-initiation of aspirin use and varying methods for determining CVD risk.
2. A study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that among primary prevention patients, only 31.5% reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and of those told to take aspirin, the vast majority complied. The study also found that education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention.
3. Among high-risk individuals, age, health insurance, and being of Asian/other descent were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention. However, only 40.9% of patients at high risk reported having been told by their physician to take aspirin, and patient reports of recommendations for aspirin use among secondary prevention patients were suboptimal.
4. The study suggests that decisions for treatment recommendations may be based on criteria other than objectively calculated future CVD risk and that improved clinical decision support, such as tools in electronic health records, could aid in making accurate decisions. The analysis also indicated a persistent problem with access to care and receipt of recommendations for aspirin use, particularly among uninsured individuals and certain racial/ethnic groups.",0

	* MROS generation is required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia.
2. Increased mitochondrial and oxidant content appears to correlate with stem cell differentiation, while low mitochondrial mass and oxidant content correlates with stem cell maintenance.
	* A recent study suggests that mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, such as UCP2, may play a role in regulating differentiation-dependent metabolism.
3. MROS production is required for activation of notch and -catenin transcriptional programs which promote epidermal differentiation and hair development respectively.
	* Mitochondrial metabolism may also promote keratinocyte differentiation by providing substrates for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone demethylases (such as JMJD3).
4. Cellular differentiation may depend on availability of acetyl-CoA to carry out acetylation reactions.
	* In mammalian cells, most cytosolic acetyl-CoA is produced through the cleavage of TCA-cycle-derived citrate by the enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACL).
	* Inhibition of ACL expression prevents global increases in histone acetylation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.",0

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a CS rate of 10-15% for the lowest maternal and neonatal mortality. However, many countries have higher CS rates than recommended.
2. In Iran, the CS rate has increased six-fold in the past three decades. The impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is still debated.
3. A prospective study of pregnant women in Iran found that women who had a vaginal delivery (VD) had better physical HRQOL at 2 and 4 months postpartum compared to CS. The CS group had higher total physical health scores at 4 months postpartum.
4. In comparing subscales, the VD group showed more improvements in total mental HRQOL from time 1 to time 2 assessment. The mean score differences in VD and CS groups were significant for social functioning and emotional well-being.
5. General characteristics of patients showed that nearly 80% of VD was performed with episiotomy or laceration. A study found that the median time to restart intercourse in the normal VD with episiotomy was 40 days, and in the CS group, it was 10 days postpartum.
6. Sexual health is perceived as an integral part of general health and can affect postpartum depression. A cross-sectional study in rural China found no significant difference in women's postpartum QOL between normal delivery and CS.
7. A cohort study in Iran showed that the QOL parameters in planned CS women were generally higher than VD. There were significant differences for two physical health domains and all mental health domains.
8. A prospective study found that women who requested CS experienced their health as less good and were more often planning for one child only. They more often reported anxiety for lack of support during labor, for loss of control, and concern for fetal injury or death.
9. The findings suggest that VD leads to better physical health at 2 months after delivery and physical and mental health at 4 months after delivery. Future studies should include both general and specific questionnaires in assessing postpartum QOL among women with VD, elective",0

2. Physiological needs are the basic requirements for individual and species survival, such as food and sex. Safety needs, which emerge when physiological needs are relatively satisfied, include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being.
3. Safety needs can be more fundamental than physiological needs, as they can block the satisfaction of physiological needs. For example, a deer cannot eat when it is being chased by wolves.
4. The brain processes threatening information faster and more sensitively than rewarding information, indicating that safety needs are faster and more fundamental than hedonic needs.
5. The amygdala is the neural basis for fear and stress elicited fear and anxiety. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala promotes autonomous reactions and stress-like behavioral responses, while amygdala ablation reduces fear and increases tameness.
6. The amygdala is one of the most important limbic structures that link to fear, and it is involved in the fast-acting thalamus-amygdala circuit that bypasses the cortex and rapidly recognizes dangers to help with survival.
7. The ne/lc system is important for directing behaviors of the animal to cope with the dangerous environment, and it is involved in inducing fight or flight behaviors.
8. Safety needs are the most fundamental needs for the human kind, and they include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being. Safety is the major reason for mental disorders, such as anxiety, phobia, depression, and PTSD.

• Mild hypothermia therapy has been proposed to protect the brain during CPR and has been shown to increase survival and improve neurological function in animal studies.
• The 2010 American Heart Association guidelines recommend comatose patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest be cooled to 32-34°C for 12 or 24 hours.
• A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mild hypothermia in patients with cardiac arrest.
• Six studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving a total of 531 adult patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated.
• The meta-analysis found that hypothermia does improve the survival rate (risk ratio (RR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-1.49, p = 0.01) and neurological function (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.13-1.66, p = 0.001) of patients with cardiac arrest.

Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a common surgical treatment for localized prostate cancer, with numerous studies demonstrating excellent tumor control, good functional results, and low morbidity. However, the major long-term morbidity is erectile dysfunction, which is caused by injury to the cavernosal nerves.
• Prior to studies by Walsh and Donker, the cause of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy was not well understood.
• Walsh and Donker proposed and demonstrated that erectile dysfunction occurred secondary to the injury of cavernosal nerves, which are mainly concentrated laterally to the prostate and are referred to as neurovascular bundles.
2. Nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, with studies reporting a 16 to 76% recovery of erectile function in men whose bilateral neurovascular bundles were preserved and 0 to 56% in those with unilateral neurovascular bundle preservation.
• However, there is still variability in potency rates due to the fact that there is no definite and exact anatomy of periprostatic nerve fibers, especially the cavernosal nerves.
• A recent study described periprostatic nerve distribution and constructed a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution in order to better understand the anatomy of these nerves.
3. The study found that the average number of nerve fibers located in the ventral part of the prostate was significantly fewer than in the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts of the prostate capsule.
• There was no difference in the average distances from the prostatic capsule to nerve fibers when comparing the four different parts or among the base, mid-part, and apex levels.
• The average thicknesses of nerve fibers in the ventral and dorsal parts were significantly different, with the ventral part having substantially fewer and thinner nerve fibers.
4. The three-dimensional model of the periprostatic nerve fibers revealed an almost even distribution and nearly similar thickness of periprostatic nerve fibers on dorsal and both lateral parts.

* Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein that increases dramatically during inflammation and is also relevant in cholesterol metabolism.
* SAA may play a pathogenic role in the proinflammatory cascade in RA and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
- A study of 140 RA patients found that most were positive for RF-IgM and ACPA and had erosive form of RA.
* Remission of RA was observed in only 8 patients, and extra-articular symptoms were noted in 41.4% of patients.
* Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were used in 96.4% of patients, and biological DMARDs were used in 25.7% of patients.
- The study found that serum SAA concentration was high above normal in the vast majority of RA patients.
* Elevated SAA levels were found not only in patients with high disease activity but also in those with low or moderate disease activity.
* Women treated with biological DMARDs had significantly lower SAA concentration than women treated only with synthetic DMARDs.

	* In evaporites, polyhalite is associated with other minerals such as halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.
	* The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, and later confirmed. It can be synthesized in laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C.
	* The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C and goes up to a maximum of 343°C. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements significantly changes dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures.
2. Polyhalite most commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact with the precursor rock.
	* It is stable between room temperature (0-25°C) and 255-343°C or 285°C and is found in the Haselgebirge sulphates in the Northern Calcareous Alps (NCA) in Austria and southern Germany.

However, the effects of high doses of propofol on the lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant indices in rodents have not been determined.
* This study found that propofol at 2 and 4 mg/kg significantly increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, while significantly decreasing the levels of serum HDL cholesterol in rats.
* The increased cholesterol level during propofol administration may be linked to an increase in alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, which is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
2. Propofol at 2 and 4 mg/kg significantly increased the levels of hepatic glutathione (GSH) and the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase.

	* The genome is organized hierarchically into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), which are stable across different species, cell types, and conditions.
	* TADs, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size, exhibit higher frequencies of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions.
	* The boundaries of TADs are enriched for certain features, such as CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, specific histone marks, and the timing of replication domains.
2. A recent study found that the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, Brg1 (also known as Smarca4), contributes to TAD boundary strength.
	* Brg1 is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions and for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions.
	* The study found that Brg1 knockdown in human mammary epithelial MCF-10a cells resulted in reduced TAD boundary strength and increased inter-TAD genomic interactions.
	* The strength of TAD boundaries that were bound by Brg1 was stronger than the boundaries that lacked Brg1 localization.
3. The study also found that Brg1 loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and preclude the binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries.
	* Analysis of a publicly available MNase-seq data set from wildtype and Brg1 knockdown mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells showed decreased nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions in Brg1 knockdown cells.
	* The study suggests that Brg1 plays a role at TAD boundaries by regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization.

* Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO). The SPIO's superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated enable MPI to provide high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios.
* Possible application scenarios for MPI include cardiovascular imaging and intervention guidance. However, the development of suitable MPI scanners and appropriate tracer material is necessary. The tracer material should ideally have long circulation times, sufficient signal strength, and a relatively high hydrodynamic diameter with a shorter half-life in blood. Resovist, an approved T2* contrast agent for MRI, is currently the most important benchmark material for MPI, but its hydrodynamic diameter is greater than 50 nm, limiting its in vivo distribution.

2. The initial inflammatory response to Leishmania infection is driven by activation of the complement cascade, coagulation pathway, and acute phase response, along with rapid changes in the cytokine and chemokine environment.
3. These inflammatory stimuli can have profound effects on phagocyte function, making it challenging to identify responses directly reflecting intracellular infection.
4. To address this challenge, researchers hypothesized that the transcriptomic response of uninfected cells exposed to inflammation could serve as a baseline or normal in vivo response to insult.
5. In a study of Leishmania infection, researchers discovered that the expression of an RXRA-centered transcriptomic pathway was aberrantly maintained in infected Kupffer cells (KCs), the resident tissue macrophages lining the hepatic sinusoids.
6. Pharmacological manipulation of RXR activity in infected KCs led to enhanced leishmanicidal activity, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in parasite survival.
7. KCs in the livers of uninfected mice can be identified by their large size, membrane GFP expression, and intimate contact with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.
8. Four-dimensional intravital two-photon imaging allows for the observation of KC membrane fluctuation and lamellipodia dynamics in exceptional detail.
9. Shape factor and velocity measurements indicate that KCs do not actively migrate along the sinusoids but do exhibit membrane activity, which is reduced in response to Leishmania infection.",0

• Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract.
• These models aim to explain the regulation of appetite and body weight through the identification of specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to the hypothalamus.
2. An alternative approach to appetite control is through the study of energy balance, specifically the interrelationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI).
• Edholm's experimental studies revealed no correlation between EE and EI in a single day, but there was a good correlation over two weeks.
• Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of total daily EE and is quite uniform across the day and between days, making it a potential tonic signal of energy demand that could act as a driver of daily EI.
3. Exercise can raise resting values of EE several fold, and its effects on various body systems mean that it will have numerous physiological effects in addition to an increase in EE.
• A single acute bout of exercise would have different effects from continued daily sessions of exercise that would exert an increasing cumulative challenge to energy balance.
• A comprehensive picture requires a comparison between various intensities of exercise over varying periods of time with measurement of all variables in the energy budget.
4. Acute bouts of exercise do not lead to a consistent increase in food intake in the immediate post-exercise period or in the following 24 hours.
• However, there is considerable variability associated with appetite variables, and as exercise sessions are repeated over periods varying from 9 to 16 days, a partial compensatory response begins to appear.
• When exercise was performed daily over a period of 16 days and total EE was measured using the doubly labelled water method, it was calculated that exercise raised average daily EE by 3.5 mj and generated a 30% compensation in EI.",0

2. Chemically activated resins, although less frequently used, have lower polymerization shrinkage and higher dimensional accuracy compared to heat-activated resins, but they have inferior color stability due to oxidation of the amine accelerator.
3. The injection molding technique has advantages over compression molding, including reduced processing time, lower cost, and lower skin sensitivity to evaporated monomer. The type of processing can affect the mechanical properties of the resins, such as the bond strength between the denture teeth and the denture base resins.

5. Surface treatments, such as grinding the glossy ground surface, painting the ground surface of the teeth with monomer, and cutting mechanical retention features in the ground surface of the teeth, can increase the bond strength between acrylic resin teeth and denture base resins.

The UVR emitted during GMAW performed with a digital inverter-type pulsed arc welding machine was measured and its acute health effects were assessed in accordance with the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines.
3. The effective irradiance of UVR emitted during GMAW of mild steel is strongly influenced by the pulsed current and the type of shielding gas. The effective irradiance of UVR emitted during pulsed 80% ar + 20% co2 welding is 3.0 - 6.7 times larger compared with that emitted during non-pulsed 80% ar + 20% co2 welding at each welding current.

This is due to the hydrostatic pressure resulting from the blockage, which causes renal injuries characterized by tubular dilatation or atrophy, inflammatory infiltration of leucocytes, fibroblast activation, proliferation, increase in matrix proteins, and progressive interstitial fibrosis with the loss of renal parenchyma.
2. Taurine, an organic acid and a major component of the bile, has been shown to have beneficial effects on renal fibrosis that occurs after cisplatin-induced injuries, diabetic nephropathy, and age-related renal changes. It plays an important role in ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, renal vascular endothelial function, and antioxidant properties in the kidney. Taurine has also been shown to play a major role in the renal cell cycle and in apoptosis, and functions as an osmolyte during the stress response.

In a study, rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), an experimental rat model of renal injury, were treated with taurine or taxol to determine their effects on tubulointerstitial fibrosis and renal histology. The results showed that both taurine and taxol were effective in reducing the volume of necrotic and fibrotic tissue in the kidneys of UUO rats.

2. * Autophagy is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response, with macrophages lacking certain autophagy-related proteins producing high amounts of inflammatory cytokines in response to certain stimuli.
	+ The enhanced production of IL-1 in autophagy-deficient macrophages is induced by TRIF-dependent generation of ROS and is blocked by ROS scavengers.
3. * Autophagy plays an indispensable role in antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells, with MHC class II molecules localized on autophagosomes and the autophagic machinery promoting the presentation of viral and self-antigens by MHC class II molecules to antigen-specific CD4 T cells.
	+ Autophagy also controls the MHC class I-dependent presentation of viral antigens to CD8 T cells.
4. * Recent studies have shown that autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) are important for innate immune responses provoked by the engagement of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) with microbial components.
	+ Genome-wide association studies have identified ATG16L1 as a candidate gene responsible for susceptibility to the inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's disease.

2. * Betel quid chewing is associated with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a precancerous condition, and oral cancer, with a higher incidence in young adults resulting from increased gutkha chewing.
3. * The rampant use of betel nut, betel quid, gutkha, and pan masala chewing in India is attributed to their carcinogenic properties and cultural acceptance.
4. * A retrospective study of 63 oral cancer patients showed a direct relation between oral cancer and duration of betel quid, gutkha, and panmasala chewing.
5. * Betel nut, a cholinergic agonist, is obtained from areca catechu and is the fourth most common addictive substance after tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine.
6. * Prolonged use of betel nut can lead to peculiar facial and systemic features, staining of teeth, attrition of teeth, and higher incidence of periodontitis.
7. * Betel nut psychosis has been reported in heavy users following sudden cessation of the habit, and it is associated with heart attacks, arrhythmia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes.
8. * India is the greatest producer of betel nut, with nearly half of global production, and most of it is consumed within India due to limited export potential.

767,"1. Patient blood management is becoming more important due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which also carry risks such as infections, high costs, and shortage of blood bank products. Postoperative severe bleeding is common following cardiac surgery and can be caused by surgical factors and impaired haemostasis.
2. Several studies have reported higher long-term mortality after blood transfusion in cardiac surgery patients, although the evidence is mainly from designated types of surgery or single-center studies. The correlation between blood flow, oxygen delivery, and consumption is determined by cardiac output, haemoglobin level, and oxygenation. Oxygen consumption is usually provided by an increased cardiac output during exercise, but low cardiac output, low haemoglobin concentration, or low haemoglobin O2 saturation can result in inadequate delivery of oxygen.
3. Patients with coexisting cardiac diseases, including coronary artery disease, may tolerate moderate anaemia, and a restrictive transfusion regimen has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. The first priority of perioperative fluid therapy in surgical patients is to achieve optimal filling of the heart with crystalloids and colloids to optimize cardiovascular function, decrease postoperative morbidity, and shorten the length of hospitalization. In cardiac surgery patients, optimizing arterial saturation only adds little to oxygen delivery, leaving increasing cardiac output or haemoglobin as possible means to increase oxygen delivery.",0

2. * However, recent research has shown that neuronal regeneration can occur in specific tissues, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium.
3. * The olfactory epithelium, in particular, has the ability to regenerate and recover even after significant damage.
4. * Researchers have been searching for an ideal cell with the properties of absolute totipotency and regenerability for use in neural regeneration.
5. * A complex of cells, including olfactory ensheathing cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and olfactory epithelial multipotent stem and progenitor cells, has been found to be effective in promoting more complete recovery of injured spinal cord.
6. * The olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with neuropotency: globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs).
7. * Recent studies have identified stem-like characteristics in GBCs, which are small, round cells located in the basal compartment of the olfactory epithelium.
8. * GBCs are capable of giving rise to neurons and all cell types of the epithelium, and may be totipotent stem cells of the epithelium.
9. * GBCs can be isolated and grown in culture, and have been shown to differentiate into neural and non-neural cells when transplanted into the nasal cavity of rats.
10. * The use of olfactory epithelial stem cells for clinical research and therapy is promising due to their accessibility, ability to regenerate, and shared environmental niche with the central nervous system.",0

2. * These cells are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and enter the brain during different developmental stages.
3. * The glymphatic system, an interstitial fluid (ISF)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exchange system, enables communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes and facilitates immune surveillance of brain ISF.
4. * In the postnatal brain, microglia are multifunctional and involved in immune surveillance, inflammatory response, phagocytosis, and synaptic refinement.

Transposable elements (TEs) were once considered junk DNA, but they have been shown to serve as a genomic reservoir for new regulatory and coding sequences, allowing genetic innovation and organismal evolution. They can form new cellular protein-coding genes through molecular domestication.
* TE-encoded proteins have properties that can be of interest for host cellular pathways, such as binding, copying, cutting, processing, and recombining nucleic acids, as well as modifying and interacting with host proteins.
* There are many cases of TE-derived genes fulfilling important functions in plants, fungi, and animals, including vertebrates. For example, several multigenic families have been formed from different events of molecular domestication of the gag gene of Ty3/gypsy elements, a super family of LTR retrotransposons active in fish and amphibians but extinct in mammals.
2. Molecular domestication of TEs has led to the formation of new cellular protein-coding genes in mammals, such as the ma or pnma gene family, which is constituted of DNA binding proteins with an N-terminus region called the scan domain, derived from the gag protein of a gmr1-like gypsy/ty3 retrotransposon.
* The scan family is vertebrate-specific, with approximately 70 and 40 members in human and mouse, respectively. Several scan proteins have been shown to be transcription factors regulating diverse biological processes such as hematopoiesis, stem cell properties, or cell proliferation and apoptosis.
* During mammalian evolution, retroviral envelope genes have been domesticated several times independently to generate genes involved in placenta development. Syncytins mediate the fusion of trophoblast cells to form the syncytiotrophoblast layer, a continuous structure with microvillar surfaces forming the outermost fetal component of the placenta.
* Two syncytin genes of independent origins encoding placenta-specific fusogenic proteins are present in human and other simians (syncytin-1 and -2) as well as in rodents (syncytin-a and syncytin-b). Independent syncytin genes are also found in rabbit, guinea pig, and carn",0
771,"1. Progressive diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, affect millions of people worldwide and are caused by the misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins.
	* These diseases can spread from cell to cell, amplifying and accumulating within the central nervous system, leading to a self-sustaining, exponential vicious circle that results in a loss of life expectancy and quality of life.
	* Molecular chaperones play a central role in preventing protein misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation, and help maintain normal cellular proteostasis.
2. Under cellular stress, the heat shock response is triggered, leading to partial correction of misfolding and incorrect processing, but sustained activation can be detrimental and result in the aggregation of misfolded proteins.
	* These misfolded proteins can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function, leading to the formation of intra- or extracellular protein deposits.
	* The ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy are responsible for degrading misfolded proteins, but when autophagy fails, protein aggregates accumulate and can cause deleterious consequences.
3. Misfolded protein aggregation is associated with ageing and can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function.
	* The spread and transmission of disease via misfolded protein aggregates was previously thought to be restricted to the prion protein, but recent evidence suggests that other protein aggregates spread in a prion-like manner.
	* The propagation and amplification of misfolded protein aggregates appears to be a widespread phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases.
4. The propagation of misfolded protein aggregates has been observed in the brain, with protein aggregates initiating in circumscribed areas and progressing in a topographically predictable manner.
	* The first evidence for the transmission of misfolded protein aggregates not involving prp in man came from the observation that Lewy bodies in PD brains contaminate grafted fetal mesencephalic progenitor neurons decades after transplantation.

	* More specific information is needed to understand liver disease progression in AA, especially after achieving viral clearance, to identify optimal treatment strategies.
2. Studies have shown that patients who achieve sustained virus response (SVR) after interferon (IFN)-based therapies have better outcomes with respect to cirrhosis, development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and all-cause mortality.
	* However, patients who received IFN-based therapies but failed to clear HCV may be at increased risk for developing cirrhosis compared to untreated patients.
3. A study using electronic medical records from a Department of Veterans Affairs clinical registry found that AA were at lower risk than Caucasians for all liver events after achieving SVR.
	* A prospective study aimed to evaluate the effect of IFN-based therapies on outcomes in AA patients, as they are underserved and under-investigated.
4. The study identified 346 AA patients with HCV genotype 1 who were followed for an average of 8 years.
	* The study found that patients who achieved SVR had a significant improvement in fibrosis scores relative to other groups, and did not develop new cirrhosis or HCC in the follow-up period.
5. Multivariate analysis found that stage of fibrosis was the only independent predictor of HCC in AA patients.
	* Surveillance in patients with significant fibrosis, rather than just cirrhosis, is warranted to predict the development of HCC in AA patients.",0

2. Genetic influences, particularly polygenic factors, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.
3. Beta-adrenergic receptors (βAR) are members of the G-protein coupled receptors family and are involved in atherogenesis.
4. Two major non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of βAR have been identified at nucleotides 46 (A>G) and 79 (C>G), causing changes in amino acid residues at positions 16 (Arg>Gly) and 27 (Gln>Glu) of the amino terminus and the fourth intracellular loop.
5. An enhanced agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation for the Gly16 variant of βAR and a resistance to down-regulation for the Glu27 variant of βAR have been observed.
6. A meta-analysis of three studies involving 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls found a significant association between Gln27Glu polymorphism of βAR and ischemic stroke.
7. The meta-analysis also showed a significant allelic association between Gln27Glu polymorphism of βAR and ischemic stroke.

Specifically, patients in methadone maintenance programs exhibit impaired cognitive abilities such as psychomotor performance, information processing, attention, problem solving, memory, decision making, reaction time, and emotional facial expression recognition.
* These cognitive impairments may be due to changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt), which is involved in controlling various cellular and physiological processes including neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and gene transcription.
* However, excessive increases in [Ca]cyt can lead to delayed calcium deregulation (DCD), which is the irreversible end point of a sequence involving mitochondrial calcium overloading and can contribute to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) formation and ultimately lead to cell death.
2. SH-SY5Y cells, a suitable model for investigating opioid-mediated responses in neurons, have been shown to die through a necrotic-like cell death mechanism when exposed to high concentrations of methadone and may induce changes in the [Ca]cyt.
* The underlying mechanisms causing alterations of the [Ca]cyt in SH-SY5Y cells in the presence of methadone are unknown, and a clear understanding of these factors may help to resolve the mechanisms that promote neuronal cell death during methadone-induced cognitive damage.
* A pharmacological survey was performed to study the possible contribution of different calcium-related mechanisms to the response to methadone, and it was found that a 5-minute pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with different conditions and drugs affected the methadone-induced [Ca]cyt response.
3. Specifically, it was found that in the absence of extracellular calcium or in the presence of nifedipine, a specific isopropyl l-type calcium channel blocker, methadone did not modify the effects on the [Ca]cyt in SH-SY5Y cells, ruling out the involvement of voltage-dependent channel family in methadone-induced [Ca]cyt variations.

2. * A fixed-effects meta-analysis of 10 published reports found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.
3. * The meta-analysis included studies published between 1999 and 2007, and the summary risk reduction estimates should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies.
4. * However, data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO.
5. * Eight studies estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were treated with RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment.
6. * Three nonoverlapping studies, which included 5703 participants, estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who received RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive the procedure, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.49 (95% CI = 0.37 to 0.65).

	* The lymphocytic infiltrate consists predominantly of T cells, and the etiology of OLP remains unclear, but accumulating evidence supports a role of immune dysregulation in its pathogenesis.
	* Proinflammatory molecules, such as IL-23 and IL-17, are aberrantly synthesized and secreted by both infiltrated T cells and altered keratinocytes in the lesions of OLP, contributing to the onset and persistence of the inflammatory responses.
2. The IL-23/IL-17 axis is a newly discovered proinflammatory signaling pathway, in which IL-23 and IL-17 are two pivotal cytokines.
	* IL-23 is a heterodimeric proinflammatory cytokine composed of a unique p19 subunit and a common p40 subunit shared with IL-12.
	* IL-23 serves an essential role in induction and maintenance of a novel subset of CD4+T cells, namely, Th17, and induces Th17 to produce its distinctive cytokine IL-17.
3. The IL-23/IL-17 axis is extensively involved in the processes of chronic inflammation within various pathological states.
	* The IL-23/IL-17 axis has been described to play a major role in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and periodontitis.

3. * Microfluidic cell separation devices offer several advantages over conventional techniques.
* These devices are compact, portable, and can be integrated with analytical techniques, and many are derived from the semiconductor industry.
4. * Cell separation techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: size and density-based techniques, and affinity-based techniques (chemical, electrical, or magnetic).
* Microfluidic devices are often used in these techniques due to the micron size of cells and their handling in suspensions.
5. * Size-based separation processes are being employed in micro- and nanoscale devices.
* These devices force a heterogeneous particle population through channels or obstacles of varied size, and can be used to isolate stem cells and other rare cells without the need for cell-specific markers.
6. * A technique described by Huang et al. (2004) allows for separation of micron-sized particles with high resolution.
* The technique uses an array of obstacles to sort particles based on their size, and has been used to sort fluorescent polystyrene spheres and circular plasmid DNA.

A study was conducted to compare the diagnostic performance of three imaging signs (caudate-to-right lobe ratio or C/RL, right posterior hepatic notch or RPN, and expanded gallbladder fossa or EGF) in diagnosing cirrhosis. The study found that there was no significant difference between C/RL and RPN in diagnosing cirrhosis, but there were significant differences between C/RL and EGF and between RPN and EGF. The study also found that C/RL and RPN have similar sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies, while EGF has a lower sensitivity but high specificity.
2. The study also found that the use of C/RL and RPN may be more useful in diagnosing early or compensated cirrhosis, while EGF may be more useful in evaluating cirrhosis in conjunction with other morphological findings. However, the study did not evaluate the diagnosis performance of combined C/RL, RPN, and EGF, and further studies are needed to determine if these signs might help to differentiate the cirrhosis induced by different causes.

In a study of 96 patients with bladder cancer, 36% had cotinine levels indicating active smoking, and 4% had levels equivalent to passive smoking. Of the 18 patients who admitted to smoking, 36% were confirmed by cotinine levels. The study also found that not all patients follow recommendations to quit smoking.

• The study highlights the importance of using objective measures, such as cotinine levels, to assess smoking history and exposure. This is because the credibility of smoking questionnaires is limited, and patients may not accurately disclose their smoking status.

787,"1. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a significant cause of respiratory tract infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, with symptoms ranging from influenza-like illness to severe lower respiratory tract infection. Genome sequencing and comparative analysis can help understand the pathogenicity, evolution history, and cell-host interaction of HMPV. The HMPV genome is approximately 13 kb in length, with a gene composition of n-p-m-f-m2-1/m2-2-sh-g-l. Its genomic organization is similar to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), lacking two nonstructural genes, ns1 and ns2. HMPV has two main genetic lineages, subtype A and B, which further divide into subgroups a1/a2 and b1/b2, with the a2 sublineage exhibiting the greatest diversity.
2. Synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV can provide insights into its evolution profile, gene expression, and virus-host interaction. The preferred codons in HMPV genomes are ended with a/u, suggesting a strong synonymous codon usage bias influenced by the high abundance of a/u nucleotides. The g+c content of the HMPV genome is 36.91%, and over 68.57% of codons are ended with a/u. The enc values among HMPV genomes show a range from 45.127 to 48.28, with an average value of 45.785 and a standard deviation of 0.8458, indicating conserved genomic compositions. Mutation pressure and natural selection are key factors influencing codon usage patterns in organisms, and in HMPV, mutation pressure appears to be the determinative factor for codon usage mutation.
3. The nucleotide constraint might play an important role in influencing synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV. The first principle axis (f1) has a significantly negative correlation with u3% and gc3%, suggesting that nucleotide u3% and gc3% are major factors influencing the synonymous codon usage pattern in the HMPV genome.

793,"1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, including a higher prevalence of diabetes, compared to the general population. Factors such as lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications may contribute to this increased rate.
• The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has led to the creation of health home programs to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions.
• A behavioral health home (BHH) was established within the Division of Community Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine to provide services to individuals with SMI and improve early recognition of developing problems and access to preventative somatic care.
2. The BHH, which serves 2000 individuals annually, focuses on population-based care and identifies abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels to permit enhanced, individualized interventions for individuals with SMI.
• Of the 120 patients enrolled in the BHH, 45% were not having their HbA1c levels drawn per the clinic's recommended guideline of every 6 months for those prescribed antipsychotic medications.
• Thirty-three patients had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and another 39 patients were identified as having prediabetes.
3. The BHH was able to identify individuals who did not have their HbA1c levels checked according to the program's recommended guidelines and allowed for the delivery of preventative and individualized proactive care.
• Of the 33 patients with type 2 diabetes, 12% improved to be within the recommended guidelines for HbA1c levels, while 21% showed improvements but remained above the target goal.
• However, 6% of individuals who were originally considered to be in the prediabetes range moved within the diabetic range, and another 12% had higher HbA1c levels in comparison to when they started receiving services.
4. The BHH has led to the start of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) diabetes prevention program group within the mental health clinic and closer monitoring of clinician practice with regard to monitoring and referral to specific services.
• The current report is limited by the fact that not all patients received equal amounts of BHH services",0
794,"1. Valerie Oppenheimer's theory on how men's socioeconomic position influences marriage formation emphasizes the role of men's economic position in demographic change.
2. Oppenheimer's theory challenged the popular idea in the late 1980s and early 1990s that the decline in marriage rates and increase in divorce were due to the growing economic role of women or value change.
3. Oppenheimer criticized both economic and cultural explanations for failing to consider the lack of a so-called independence effect and the continued desire for marriage among both single men and women.
4. She presented an alternative theory focusing on men's economic position, particularly the poor and uncertain economic prospects of young men, as a potential explanation for the decline in marriage.
5. Oppenheimer's theory has been applied to the European context, with evidence suggesting that school enrollment, unemployment, and temporary contracts negatively affect the entry into marriage.
6. The theory has also been used to explain the rise in cohabitation, with men's failure to provide economically being less of a problem during the cohabiting stage than for long-term commitments to marriage.
7. Recent research supports the view that poor economic prospects for men are associated with a delay in marriage, and this effect is less pronounced for cohabitation in the United States.",0
795,"1. Osteoporosis is a condition of impaired bone strength that leads to an increased risk of fracture, and is caused by a combination of bone mass and bone quality.
2. Bone quality is dependent on macro- and microarchitecture, as well as the intrinsic properties of the materials that make up bone, such as matrix mineralization, microdamage accumulation, and collagen quality.
3. Bone is continually adapting to changes in its mechanical and hormonal environment through the process of bone remodeling, which maintains bone structure and mechanical competence by removing damaged bone and replacing it with new bone.
4. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease that affects the myelin sheath covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, leading to functional impairments such as visual impairment, poor balance, and muscle weakness.
5. Impaired mobility or lack of weight-bearing physical activity in MS patients can reduce mechanical stress on bone, causing a marked imbalance in bone remodeling and disrupting the osteocytes network.
6. Management of MS requires long-term disease-modifying therapy, such as glucocorticoids (GCS), which have a further negative effect on bone remodeling and bone strength, potentially leading to secondary osteoporosis and low-trauma fractures.
7. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in MS patients are likely due to progressive immobilization, long-term GCS treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and possibly the presence of various cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of MS.
8. The degree of motor disability in MS patients is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of secondary osteoporosis, with site-specific effects on bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip and lumbar spine.
9. Clinical evaluation of MS patients should include the assessment of clinical risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures, such as hereditary disposition, previous low trauma fractures, smoking or alcohol habits, level of disability, long-term GCS treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and increased risk of falling.
10. BMD measurement should be performed in all MS patients who are receiving 5 mg of pred",0
796,"• The text describes the symptoms and treatment of malaria, which is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium and transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The most prevalent species are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae, with P. vivax being the most common in tropical areas such as Latin America, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa.

• The text also discusses the side effects of antimalarial drugs used to treat malaria, such as chloroquine and primaquine. Chloroquine has few adverse effects in usual doses, but prolonged treatment or use of high-level doses may cause retinal toxicity. Primaquine has hemolytic effects, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which can result in discoloration of urine and faeces and is dose-related. The study found that the frequency of choluria increased significantly from 6% to 56% in malaria patients after primaquine was started, which could be due to hemolytic anemia caused by primaquine in G6PD deficient patients.",0

2. * In elderly men, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), erectile dysfunction (ED), and decreased libido often occur together.
3. * Studies have shown a strong correlation between sexual dysfunction, increasing age, and the severity of LUTS.
4. * The coexistence of sexual problems with LUTS and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) further affects quality of life.
5. * The correlation between LUTS and ED may be due to overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.
6. * A preliminary study found that age, IPSS, nocturia, and uroflow rate correlated significantly with the IIEF-5 in men with LUTS/BPH.

798,"1. Certain miRNAs are expressed in a cell-type specific manner, at specific developmental stages, and in disease states including cancer.
2. During cancer initiation and progression, miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, with some being overexpressed and others lost in cancers.
3. The miR-200 family, which includes miR-200c, is involved in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and can repress EMT-promoting transcription factors such as ZEB1.
4. ZEB1 can also repress the miR-200 family, creating a double negative feedback loop that allows for plasticity between the epithelial and mesenchymal states.
5. In breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, loss of mir-200c is a marker for chemoresistance and aggressiveness.
6. The effects of mir-200c on invasion and migration appear to be independent of e-cadherin status, and restoration of mir-200c can decrease invasion and migration in cancer cells.",0
799,"1. The transobturator approach for treating stress urinary incontinence in women involves placing a midurethral sling (MUS) using either a retropubic, outside-in, or inside-out approach.
2. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the three most commonly used surgical approaches, including the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures.
3. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective, but have not focused on the relationship between the MUS and the urethra.
4. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT-scan image analysis.
5. The study found that the out-in MUS had a mean full inner angle of 144 (95%CI: 131-151) compared to 122 (95%CI: 107-136) for the in-out MUS (p = 0.02).
6. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning provided a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory.
7. The findings suggest that the in-out approach angulates around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the out-in approach, which follows a more horizontal, flatter trajectory.
8. The study also highlights the need for strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique and the importance of understanding the spatial configuration of the tapes in relation to the bony pelvis and the urethra.",0
