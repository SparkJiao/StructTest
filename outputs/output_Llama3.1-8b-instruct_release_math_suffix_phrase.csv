0,"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and then multiply that by the price per egg.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Janet lays per day: 16 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Janet eats and bakes: 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and bakes from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells the remainder at the farmers' market, she sells 9 eggs per day.

Finally, let's multiply the number of eggs Janet sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

2,"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the increase in value, we multiply the original value by 150% (or 1.5). 

Increase in value = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

Now, we add the increase in value to the original value to find the new value of the house.

New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

Since Josh bought the house for $80,000 and sold it for $200,000, we can find the profit by subtracting the original price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Original price
Profit = $200,000 - $80,000
Profit = $120,000

4,"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed she gives to her chickens in a day. 

Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 cups of feed per meal and she gives them 3 meals a day, the total number of cups of feed per chicken per day is 3 * 3 = 9 cups.

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give to her chickens in a day is 9 * 20 = 180 cups.

Now, we know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives to her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed she needs to give in a day. 

So, 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

5,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the regular glasses and the discounted glasses separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the number of regular glasses and discounted glasses. Since every second glass is discounted, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of discounted glasses.

Number of regular glasses = 16 / 2 = 8
Number of discounted glasses = 16 / 2 = 8

Now, let's calculate the cost of the regular glasses and the discounted glasses.

Cost of regular glasses = Number of regular glasses * Price of regular glass
= 8 * $5
= $40

Cost of discounted glasses = Number of discounted glasses * Price of discounted glass
= 8 * (60% of $5)
= 8 * $3
= $24

Now, let's add the cost of the regular glasses and the discounted glasses to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of regular glasses + Cost of discounted glasses

6,"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston. 

First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we multiply 20 by 4 to find the number of sheep in Charleston:
20 * 4 = 80

Now, we know that Charleston has 80 sheep. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we multiply 80 by 2 to find the number of sheep in Toulouse:
80 * 2 = 160

Now that we have the number of sheep in each city, we can add them together to find the total number of sheep:

7,"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to download the file before the restart and the time it takes to download the file after the restart.

First, let's find the time it takes to download 40% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we need to find 40% of 200 GB. 

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

The time it takes to download 80 GB is:
Time = Amount / Rate = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, let's find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file after the restart. The remaining amount is:
200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

The time it takes to download 120 GB is:
Time = Amount / Rate = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it takes to restart Windows. 

Total time = Time before restart + Time after restart + Time for restart
Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes

1. The first segment is when John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

2. The second segment is when John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move during this time. 
Distance covered in this segment = 0 miles.

3. The third segment is when John drives at a speed of 30 mph for half an hour (0.5 hours).
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

4. The fourth segment is when John drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining time of the 4 hours. Since he spent 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph, the remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for all segments to find the total distance John drives:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

However, since John turned around, the distance he drives to get home is the same as the distance he drove to get away from home. Therefore, he is 315 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. First month: 60 downloads
2. Second month: The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. 
   So, second month downloads = 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
3. Third month: The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3: 180 * 0.3 = 54

12,"To find out how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total earnings and total costs for each year.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. 

The total earnings from selling lemons each year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

The total cost each year is $3 (water and feed) + $90 (initial cost) = $93. However, the initial cost of $90 should only be counted once, so the total cost each year is $3.

However, since the initial cost of $90 is only counted once, we should subtract it from the total cost for the first year. So, the total cost for the first year is $3, and for the subsequent years, it's just $3.

The total earnings for the first year is $10.5, and the total cost is $3. So, the profit for the first year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

For the subsequent years, the profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Since the initial cost of $90 is not included in the profit for the first year, we need to find the number of years it takes to cover this cost.

The profit for the first year is $7.5, and the profit for the subsequent years is $7.5. 

To find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost of $90, we can divide the initial cost by the profit for the first year: $90 / $7.5 = 12.

However, this is not the correct answer because we are not considering the profit for the subsequent years. We are considering the profit for the first year and the subsequent years separately.

Since the profit for the first year is $7.5, and the profit for the subsequent years is $7.5, we can see that the profit for the first year is not enough to cover the initial cost of $90.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. 
   This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house. 
   So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3.

2. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. 
   Now, the number of vacuum cleaners left is 2x/3 - 2.

3. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. 
   Half of what was left is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.
   So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 
So, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

15,"To determine which purchase plan will result in the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each item after the market fluctuations.

For the jewelry worth $5,000, a 2.5% increase would result in a value of:
$5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, a 1.2% increase would result in a value of:
$8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the electronic gadgets are expected to increase in value by more ($96 vs $125), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the potential value:
Profit = Potential Value - Initial Cost
Profit = $8,096 - $8,000

Let's denote the distance covered by each train in the two days as 'd'. Since both trains travel the same distance, we can consider one train's journey.

On the first day, the train travels 80 miles westward. On the second day, it travels 150 miles northward. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance 'd' covered by the train in the two days:

d² = 80² + 150²
d² = 6400 + 22500
d² = 28900
d = √28900
d = 170

First, let's calculate her total earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her total earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

We also know that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. To find the total time she needs to spend walking the entire trail, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time needed = 12 / 4 = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. To find the speed she needs to walk this remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Water in orange drink = 2/3 * 10 liters = 20/3 liters

Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we can calculate it as follows:

Water in pineapple drink = 3/5 * 15 liters = 9 liters

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract this from the total amount of orange drink:

Remaining orange drink = 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters

Now, let's find the amount of water in the remaining orange drink:

First, let's find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip: 
60 miles (total trip) - 15 miles (distance from the second stop to the end) = 45 miles

Now, let's find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting the distance from the first stop from the total trip distance and then subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip:

Since one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, we can calculate the cost of the second pair of heels by multiplying the cost of the first pair by 2.

Cost of the second pair of heels = 2 * $33 = $66

Now, we know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Cost of the first pair of heels + Cost of the second pair of heels = Cost of the boots - $5

Substituting the known values, we get:

2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

So, on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2.

7 * 2 = 14

So, on Wednesday, Meredith wrote 14 articles.

Now, we add up the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

46,"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee at work. This means she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

First, let's find out how many Post-it notes Candice used in total. We can do this by subtracting the remaining Post-it notes from the initial number of Post-it notes:

80 (initial Post-it notes) - 23 (remaining Post-it notes) = 57 Post-it notes used

Since Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work, and she used a total of 57 Post-it notes, we can find out how many Post-it notes she purchased by subtracting the initial Post-it notes from the total used Post-it notes at work:

220 (used at work) - 57 (used in total) = 163 Post-it notes purchased

Therefore, Candice purchased 163 Post-it notes in the package.

47,"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to calculate the total amount spent on blue ties and then determine the amount spent on red ties.

Given that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means each red tie costs $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Amount spent on blue ties + Amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys need to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue on Thursday and Friday.
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

First, let's find the value of the pension after 30 years. Since Marcy gets $50,000 per year for 10 years, we can calculate the total value of the pension as follows:

Value of pension after 30 years = $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000

Now, we need to find the 5% increase for the remaining 10 years. This increase is 5% of the value of the pension after 30 years, which is $500,000. 

5% of $500,000 = 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000

1. First, we need to find out how many liters of water the two girls got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we multiply 24 by 1/6. 

   24 * (1/6) = 24 / 6 = 4 liters

   So, the two girls got 4 liters each, which is a total of 8 liters.

2. Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters.

   24 - 8 = 16 liters

3. Then, we subtract the 6 liters the boy got from the remaining 16 liters.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years of service, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary. 
10% of $600 is $60, so her salary after 5 years is $600 + $60 = $660.

After 6 years of service, her salary is increased by 10% of the salary after 5 years. 
10% of $660 is $66, so her salary after 6 years is $660 + $66 = $726.

After 7 years of service, her salary is increased by 10% of the salary after 6 years. 
10% of $726 is $72.60, so her salary after 7 years is $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

After 8 years of service, her salary is increased by 10% of the salary after 7 years. 
10% of $798.60 is $79.86, so her salary after 8 years is $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

After 9 years of service, her salary is increased by 10% of the salary after 8 years. 
10% of $878.46 is $87.85, so her salary after 9 years is $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31.

Let's denote Gerald's original time as G. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's original time is G - 2.

We know that Lee's current time is 38 seconds, which is 10% faster than his original time. We can set up the equation:

So, Gerald's original time was 36.55 seconds.

Since Gerald's improved time is 10% faster than his original time, we can find his improved time by multiplying his original time by 1.1:

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding them up.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats

111,"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total amount of water taken on per second and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find out how much water the boat takes on per second. We know that for every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Since 20 feet is 2 times 10 feet, the boat took on 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water in 16 seconds.

Now, let's find out how much water the boat takes on per second. We can divide the amount of water taken on (4 liters) by the time taken (16 seconds) to get the rate of water intake per second.

4 liters / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters per second

Now, we know that it took Julia 64 seconds to reach the shore. We can multiply the rate of water intake per second (0.25 liters) by the total time (64 seconds) to find out the total amount of water taken on.

0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters

Step 1: Find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up an equation:

6x = 1800
where x is the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

x = 1800 / 6
x = 300

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Step 2: Find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up an equation:

50x = 300
where x is the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

115,"To find the profit Sasha makes, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total selling price of the lumber she sells.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices for lumber have gone up 50%, the new price of each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
The new price of each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7x, where x is a multiplier. Since the total number of parts in the ratio is 20, the total amount of sugar and water used is 20x.

We are given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, so we can set up the equation:

20x = 120

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 120 / 20
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 7 by x:

119,"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago, then find Adrien's salary four years later, and finally add both salaries to get the total.

Step 1: Find Lylah's salary four years ago.
Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write the equation as:
Adrien's salary = x + 0.3x = 1.3x
We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:
1.3x = 40000
To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:
x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary four years later was 40% higher than what he was making four years ago. We can write the equation as:
Adrien's salary four years later = 40000 + 0.4(40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

So, Adrien's salary four years later was $56000.

Step 3: Find Lylah's salary four years later.
Since both salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase in Lylah's salary is the same as Adrien's. We can write the equation as:
Lylah's salary four years later = 30769.23 + 0.4(30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

So, Lylah's salary four years later was approximately $43076.92.

Step 4: Find the total salary four years later.
To find the total salary four years later, we can add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries:
Total salary four years later = 56000 + 43076.92

Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as x.

We know that Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

After stamping these letters, the total number of already-stamped letters is the sum of the initial number of already-stamped letters (x) and the number of letters she just stamped (20). We are given that this total is 30.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 30.

To find the initial number of already-stamped letters (x), we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

x + 20 - 20 = 30 - 20
x = 10

125,"To find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we need to subtract the total number of spoons used and added later from the total number of spoons Julia had at the end.

First, let's calculate the total number of spoons added to Julia's collection. Julia bought a package of spoons, and her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So, the total number of spoons added is the sum of these two quantities.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. Then, the total number of spoons added is x + 5.

Next, we need to subtract the total number of spoons used from the total number of spoons added. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, the total number of spoons used is 3.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. The total number of spoons Julia had at the end is 12. This is equal to the total number of spoons added minus the total number of spoons used.

12 = (x + 5) - 3

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation. First, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:

12 + 3 = x + 5

This simplifies to:

15 = x + 5

Next, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

15 - 5 = x

This simplifies to:

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:
200 hours per day * $150 per hour = $30,000 per day

Let's denote the number of worker bees as W. We can write the equation as:
W + 2Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms:
W + 3Q = 700

We are also given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. This means:
W = 2(2Q)
W = 4Q

Now, substitute W = 4Q into the equation W + 3Q = 700:
4Q + 3Q = 700

Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
2Q = 2(100)
2Q = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 4Q
W = 4(100)
W = 400

142,"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

143,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add the tax to the non-food items.

Food items: 
- Milk for 2 dollars
- Eggs for 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs for 3 dollars
- Cups for 3 dollars
- Roach traps for 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars.
10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items.
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to find the total cost.

144,"It seems there's been a mix-up with the names. The person starting the housekeeping business is named Kim, not Lucas.

To calculate Kim's profit, we first need to determine his total income and total expenses.

Kim has 8 clients in total (3 existing clients + 5 potential clients). Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 

The total number of bottles of bleach needed per week is 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.
The total number of packs of cloths needed per week is 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.

The cost of bleach per week is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32.
The cost of cloths per week is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.

Total expenses per week are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income per week is given as $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

First, let's find out the total number of pineapples per hectare. 
There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Next, we need to find out the total number of hectares John has. 
John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field.

Now, let's multiply the total number of pineapples per hectare by the total number of hectares to find out the total number of pineapples John has.
Total pineapples = 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares
Total pineapples = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are there in a year. 
There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 3 to find out the number of 3-month periods.
12 months / 3 months = 4 periods

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of 3-month periods to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year.
Total pineapples harvested in a year = 1000 pineapples * 4 periods
Total pineapples harvested in a year = 4000 pineapples

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many bees return to the hive. 
   So, the number of bees that return in the next 6 hours is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 bees leave the hive. 
   So, the number of bees that leave in the next 6 hours is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. Now, we need to find out how many bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours. 
   We know that every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. 
   So, we need to find out how many bees left in the first 12 hours and hadn't returned yet.

   In the first 12 hours, 30 bees left and 15 bees returned. 
   So, the number of bees that left in the first 12 hours and hadn't returned yet is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.

To find Dorothy's friends, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race.

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9.

The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. There was 1 unicycle, and it has 1 tire.

The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

We know that there were 5 french fries left after the ants carried off 1 and the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. 

Let's call the number of fries the raccoon stole 'x'. Since the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, the number of fries left after the raccoon stole 'x' is 1/3 of the remaining fries. We know that 1/3 of the remaining fries is 5 + 1 = 6. 

So, 1/3 of the remaining fries is 6. To find the total number of remaining fries, we multiply 6 by 3. 

6 * 3 = 18

Now, we know that 18 fries were left after the pigeons ate 3 fries each. Since there were 3 pigeons, the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is 3 * 3 = 9. 

So, the total number of fries left after the pigeons ate is 18 + 9 = 27.

Next, we know that the seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. 

The total number of fries eaten by the seagull and Dave is 14 + 7 = 21. 

So, the total number of fries left after the seagull ate is 27 + 21 = 48.

Finally, we know that the seagull stole the pack of fries from Dave, which means the seagull stole the entire pack. 

Let's call the initial number of fries 'x'. Since the seagull stole the entire pack, the number of fries eaten by the seagull is 'x'. 

We know that the seagull ate 7 fries, but the seagull also stole the entire pack, which means the seagull ate 'x' fries. However, we also know that the seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which is 7 fries.

For Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours per day for these days is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

For Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours per day for these days is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours per week for these days is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week for Kimo is the sum of the hours for the two types of days: 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we have two equations:

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes. It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to peel one potato by 60:

1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes. It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to cut one potato by 60:

5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds

Now, we need to convert the time it takes to cut all the potatoes from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total seconds by 60:

300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel all the potatoes (90 minutes) to the time it takes to cut all the potatoes (5 minutes):

175,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons and sugar, and then use the profit to find the total cost of making the lemonade.

First, let's find the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2, so the total cost of making one gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Next, let's find out how much they made from selling one gallon of lemonade. They get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, so they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 from one gallon.

Now, let's find out how much profit they made from one gallon of lemonade. The profit is the amount they made from selling the lemonade minus the cost of making it. So, the profit from one gallon is $10 - $5 = $5.

Since they made a total profit of $25, and each gallon of lemonade makes a profit of $5, we can find out how many gallons they made by dividing the total profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find out how much they spent on lemons. The cost of lemons for one gallon is $3, so the cost of lemons for 5 gallons is 5 x $3 = $15.

2. Now, we subtract the rent from his salary to find the remaining amount.
   Remaining amount = 6000$ - 1500$ = 4500$.

3. Zaid spends 1/3 of his remaining salary on car fuel.
   1/3 of 4500$ is 4500$ * 1/3 = 4500$ * 0.33 = 1485$.

4. Now, we subtract the car fuel from the remaining amount.
   Remaining amount = 4500$ - 1485$ = 3015$.

5. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

3. Slices used for macaroni and cheese:
Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add the slices used for each dish together:

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then, she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag of blue pens had 9 pens, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54 pens. Each bag of red pens had 6 pens, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12 pens.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the initial number of pens: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

However, we also need to consider the green and yellow pens she already had. We only added the blue and red pens to the initial total. So, the correct total is 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Since there are six tests, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests: 
93 * 6 = 558

This is the total score Brinley needs for the six tests. 

Now, let's find the total score of the first five tests. We add the scores of the first five tests:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

We subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests to find the new total score:
338 - 71 = 267

Now, we add the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to the new total score to find the total score for the six tests:
267 + x = 558

We solve for x by subtracting 267 from both sides:
x = 558 - 267
x = 291

So, Brinley needs a score of 291 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and each chocolate bar weighs 40g. 

Weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars * Weight of each chocolate bar
Weight of chocolate bars = 25 * 40g
Weight of chocolate bars = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g. 

Weight of each candied apple = Weight of each chocolate bar / 2

Weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples * Weight of each candied apple
Weight of candied apples = 80 * 20g
Weight of candied apples = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of half a dozen plates: $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 20 dozen cups cost $34800, we need to find the cost of one cup. 

There are 12 cups in a dozen, so 20 dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

Sara already has $10 saved, and she will earn $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting. So, the total amount she already has or will earn from babysitting is $10 + $20 = $30.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Sara needs to earn from mowing the lawn. This is $70 (total cost) - $30 (amount already has or will earn from babysitting) = $40.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4) to find out how many times she must mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can write another equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Now we can substitute the expression for w from the first equation into the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers on the second day and the customers on the third day. Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as y.

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 50) + y = 500

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 + y = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x + y = 450

We know that the total number of customers on the first day and the second day is 100 + 50 = 150. Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - 150 = 350.

However, we need to find the number of customers on the third day using the equation 2x + y = 450. We can rewrite the equation as y = 450 - 2x.

Since we know that the total number of customers on the first day and the second day is 150, we can write the equation as x + (x + 50) = 150.

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 150

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2: x = 50

Now that we know x, we can find y: y = 450 - 2x = 450 - 2(50) = 450 - 100 = 350.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool will lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, let's consider the current situation. The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

We know that the small pool lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago (x) minus the amount lost (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the small pool (y). This can be expressed as:

x - 16 = y

Similarly, the big pool lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago (2x) minus the amount lost (16) is equal to the current amount of water in the big pool (4y). This can be expressed as:

2x - 16 = 4y

Now we have two equations:

x - 16 = y
2x - 16 = 4y

We can simplify the first equation by adding 16 to both sides:

x = y + 16

Now, substitute x in the second equation:

2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expand the equation:

2y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

2y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 2y from both sides:

16 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

8 = y

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is 8 gallons.

Next, let's find out how many penguins went inside the cave. Again, one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Now, we need to add the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave to find the total number of penguins that left the snow. 12 penguins + 12 penguins = 24 penguins.

Since 24 penguins left the snow, we need to subtract this number from the total number of penguins to find out how many penguins are left sunbathing. 36 penguins - 24 penguins = 12 penguins.

236,"To find the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the ink of the empty pens.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

When the ink runs low, he uses the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen.

So, from the 25 pens, the number of empty pens will be a multiple of 5. Since 25 is a multiple of 5 (25 = 5 * 5), all 25 pens will be empty when the ink runs low.

Now, Ram can use the ink from these 25 empty pens to make new pens. Since 25 empty pens can make 5 new pens (25 / 5 = 5), Ram gets 5 new pens.

Initially, Ram had 25 pens. After using the ink from the empty pens, he gets 5 new pens. So, the total number of pens he gets to have is 25 + 5 = 30.

We are given that Jessa is 20 years old. 

Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we can subtract 2 from Joan's age:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:

To find R, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:
R = 54 / 2
R = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies.

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, James has:

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

1. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

2. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

3. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

4. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 27, where x is the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

5. Simplifying the equation, we get 9 + x - 2 = 27, which becomes 7 + x = 27.

1. Total hours worked: 
Since it takes 6 hours to do each day and Jean needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks, we multiply the hours per day by the number of days per week and then by the number of weeks.
6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Total sections = 20

Now, we know that termites ate 30% of the wood, but we don't know the total weight of the wood yet. However, we can calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the wood.

Since termites ate 30% of the wood, they ate 30% of the total weight of the wood. Let's call the total weight of the wood 'x'. Then, the weight of the wood that termites ate is 0.3x.

The weight of the wood that termites didn't eat is 70% of the total weight of the wood, which is 0.7x.

Total weight = 20 * 400 pounds
Total weight = 8000 pounds

Now, we can set up an equation to find the total weight of the wood:

265,"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $350,000. 
5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $350,000.
12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price.
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of the selling price
Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of the selling price
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees paid:
Total fees paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
Total fees paid = $12,000 + $20,000
Total fees paid = $32,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds from selling the house:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees paid
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000
Net proceeds = $368,000

First, let's find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Now, let's find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Finally, let's add the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken. 28 minutes (heating) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 51 minutes.

296,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household in a day and then divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by this daily consumption.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed by each person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members of the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed by the household per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg):
42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

297,"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he was open for 5 days (Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend). 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend. 
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. 
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. 
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Since Sam was open for 5 days, we can assume that he would have been open for 7 days if he wasn't closed on Monday and Friday. 

In a normal week, he would have sold 120 crates / 7 days = 17.14 crates per day (approximately).

Total crates he would have sold in 5 days = 17.14 crates/day * 5 days
Total crates he would have sold in 5 days = 85.7 crates

However, we can also calculate the total crates he would have sold in 5 days by subtracting the crates he sold on the two closed days from his target for the week.

Target for the week = 120 crates
Crates sold on Monday and Friday = 17.14 crates/day * 2 days
Crates sold on Monday and Friday = 34.28 crates

Total crates he would have sold in 5 days = Target for the week - Crates sold on Monday and Friday
Total crates he would have sold in 5 days = 120 crates - 34.28 crates
Total crates he would have sold in 5 days = 85.72 crates

Now, let's compare the total crates he actually sold with the total crates he would have sold in 5 days.

Total crates he actually sold = 65 crates
Total crates he would have sold in 5 days = 85.72 crates

Difference = Total crates he would have sold in 5 days - Total crates he actually sold
Difference = 85.72 crates - 65 crates
Difference = 20.72 crates

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we can round the difference to the nearest whole number.

Difference ≈ 21 crates

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the total number of bids made by the other 3 people is 3. After each of their bids, Carmen also bids, so the total number of bids made by Carmen is 3 (her initial bid) + 3 (her bids after the other 3 people) = 6.

The bids rise by $50 each time, so the total amount paid by Carmen can be calculated as follows:

- The first bid is $200.
- The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
- The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
- The fourth bid is $300 + $50 = $350.
- The fifth bid is $350 + $50 = $400.
- The sixth bid is $400 + $50 = $450.

To find the total amount paid by Carmen, we add up the amounts of all 6 bids:

1. Total miles driven:
Since John goes to work and back each day, the total distance is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles per day.
He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

2. Total cost of driving:
John gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year.

3. Monthly bonus:
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

4. Total cost:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
   To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60.
   Two-thirds of 60 can be calculated as (2/3) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40.
   So, 40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week. 

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight lost by the weight lost per week. 

Number of weeks = Total weight lost / Weight lost per week

Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago. 

Let's denote Noah's age six years ago as N. 
Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can write the equation: 
N = (1/2) * (Cera's age six years ago)
We know that Cera's age now is 46, so her age six years ago was 46 - 6 = 40.
Now we can substitute this value into the equation:
N = (1/2) * 40
N = 20

Now that we know Noah's age six years ago, we can calculate his current age. 
Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6
Noah's current age = 20 + 6
Noah's current age = 26

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people who left is x/4. We also know that the number of men who left is 3. Since the total number of men is 25, the number of men who stayed is 22. So, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the total number of people. The number of men who left is 3, and the total number of people who left is x/4. Since the number of men who left is 3, we can set up the equation:

3 = (x/4) - (number of women who left)

However, we don't know the number of women who left. We can find the total number of people who left by using the fact that 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, the total number of people who left is x/4.

We also know that the total number of people initially is 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

322,"To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we need to add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 26 pencils (3 boxes + 2 loose pencils). 
Meg has 46 pencils.

Total number of pencils = 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold the same number of pencils, we need to find out how many pencils are in each box. We know Jam has 3 boxes and 26 pencils. 

Let's assume each box can hold 'x' pencils. 
Since Jam has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. 
We know Jam has 26 pencils in total, so we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 = 26 (2 loose pencils are added to the 3 boxes)

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 
3x = 26 - 2 
3x = 24 
x = 24 / 3 
x = 8 

So, each box can hold 8 pencils.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. 
We can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 
Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils per box 
= 72 / 8 
= 9

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker

Now, let's add the weakening effect of the cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

Total weakening effect = 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream)
Total weakening effect = 75 milliliters

324,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

We know that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records between them. This means that the total number of new records is 7.

Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, for every 1 new record, there are 2 old records. So, for 7 new records, the total number of old records would be 7 * 2 = 14.

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find out how many old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records by the number of people.

So, the total number of old records is 14, and the number of people is 5. 

14 / 5 = 2.8

Since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 2.8 is actually 2 and 4/5, which means that 2 people brought in 5 records each and 3 people brought in 4 records each.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
325,"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. We are given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since the number of junior programmers is 40, the number of senior programmers will be the remaining employees. 

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

We are given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. 

Salary of junior programmers = $2000
Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers

At the second bus stop, 8 more people got in, so the number of people before the second bus stop was 27 - 8 = 19 people. 

However, we know that at the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people before the first bus stop was 19 - 5 = 14 people. 

Since these 14 people were the ones who got on the bus at the terminal, we can conclude that the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

Now, we know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the total time it takes to charge 40 percentage points, we can multiply the number of percentage points left to charge by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage point.

40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

Since we want to find the time in hours, we can convert the minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the two equal groups have 'x' students each, and the last group has 'x - 10' students, we can set up the following equation:

353,"To find the time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on all activities.

John spent 6 hours boating. He spent half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the total time he spent, and he also spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Let's denote the total time as 't'. We can set up the following equation:

30% of t + 40% of t = 15 hours

To simplify the equation, we can convert the percentages to decimals:

0.3t + 0.4t = 15

Combine like terms:

0.7t = 15

Now, divide both sides by 0.7:

t = 15 / 0.7
t = 21.43 hours

Now that we have the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 21.43
Time spent sightseeing = 8.57 hours

20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate the amount of money Annabelle earned from her second job. She worked for 15 hours at $5 per hour, so she earned:

357,"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to have at her party.

The cost of one round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round, the total cost for mini-golf will be $5 * (number of friends + 1).

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of riding the go-karts twice is $10 * 2 = $20. Since she wants to make sure she and her friends all get to ride the go-karts twice, the total cost for go-karts will be $20 * (number of friends + 1).

The total cost of the activities will be the sum of the cost of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.

Let's denote the number of friends as 'x'. Then the total cost can be represented as:

Total Cost = 5 * (x + 1) + 5 + 20 * (x + 1)

Simplifying the equation:

Total Cost = 5x + 5 + 5 + 20x + 20

Combine like terms:

Total Cost = 25x + 30

We know that Morgan has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation:

25x + 30 = 90

Subtract 30 from both sides:

25x = 60

Divide both sides by 25:

x = 2.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can invite 2 friends and still have some money left over.

358,"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total change she gets from buying lollipops for 5 days.

First, let's find out how much change she gets from buying lollipops in one day. 
The cost of 4 lollipops is 4 x 25 cents = 100 cents.
Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money, we need to convert it to cents. 
1 dollar = 100 cents, so $5 = 5 x 100 cents = 500 cents.
Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her pocket money to find the change.
Change in one day = 500 cents - 100 cents = 400 cents.

Now, let's multiply the change in one day by 5 to find the total change she gets in 5 days.
Total change = 400 cents x 5 = 2000 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100.
Total change in dollars = 2000 cents / 100 = 20 dollars.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy got after buying the candy. 
   Billy started with $10 and spent $1.5 per pound on candy. Let's assume he bought x pounds of candy. 
   The total cost of the candy would be 1.5x dollars. 
   So, the change he got would be 10 - 1.5x dollars.

2. Next, we know that Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. 
   Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs would be 40 * 0.05 = $2. 
   This means half of his change is $2. 
   So, the change he got would be 2 * 2 = $4. 
   We can set up an equation: 10 - 1.5x = 4.

3. Now, let's solve the equation for x. 
   10 - 1.5x = 4 
   Subtract 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -6 
   Divide both sides by -1.5: x = 4 

4. Since x represents the pounds of candy Billy bought, we have found our answer.

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

382,"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200 gold pesos.

Now, we add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos together to find the total number of pesos they have: 150 (silver pesos) + 200 (gold pesos) = 350 pesos.

383,"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to first find out how much profit she makes in total and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, she will make 36 * $1 = $36 from selling all the lemonade.

Now, let's find out how much profit she makes. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so her profit will be $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. To do this, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups she sells per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can find out her profit per hour by dividing her total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

384,"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the fraction of the land he had left after selling 3/5 of it. Since he had 12.8 hectares left, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he had 2/5 of his land left. We can write the equation as:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we need to isolate x by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2.

(5/2) * (2/5 * x) = (5/2) * 12.8

This simplifies to:

x = (5/2) * 12.8

x = 5 * 6.4

x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

   Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
   Number of girls = 26

2. Next, we need to find the number of female members who can perform. Since half of the people performing can't make it to the show, the other half can perform.

   Number of female members performing = Number of girls * 0.5
   Number of female members performing = 26 * 0.5
   Number of female members performing = 13

3. Finally, we need to add the number of teachers who decide to sing with the female members.

   Total number of people singing = Number of female members performing + Number of teachers

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus individually is $10 per month each. However, when bundled together, Tim saves 20%. To find the bundled cost, we need to calculate 20% of the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus, and then subtract that amount from the total cost.

20% of $10 + $10 = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

Since Tim saves $60 per month by cancelling his cable package, we need to compare this to the cost of the streaming services.

The difference between the cost of the cable package and the cost of the streaming services is $60 - $26 = $34.

413,"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of two sets: the set of candles that smell like wet dog and the set of candles that explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the candles have this defect, so we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of 50,000
= 0.05 * 50,000
= 2,500

Next, let's find the number of candles that explode. We know that 1% of the candles are more dangerous and have a chance to explode, but we don't know the exact percentage of candles that explode. However, we do know that 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This means that 95% of the more dangerous candles do not smell like wet dog. 

Let's assume that x is the number of candles that explode. Then, 0.95x is the number of candles that explode but do not smell like wet dog. We know that 1% of the total candles are more dangerous, so we can set up the following equation:

0.95x + 2,500 = 0.01 * 50,000

Solving for x, we get:

0.95x = 0.01 * 50,000 - 2,500
0.95x = 500 - 2,500
0.95x = -2,000
x = -2,000 / 0.95
x = -2,105.26 (This is not possible since we can't have a negative number of candles)

However, we can see that the equation is not solvable because the number of candles that explode is less than the number of candles that smell like wet dog. This is because the set of candles that explode is a subset of the set of more dangerous candles, and the set of more dangerous candles is a subset of the set of candles that smell like wet dog.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}
414,"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3).

Discount amount per blouse = Regular price * Discount percentage
= $20 * 0.3
= $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the discounted price per blouse.

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by 4 to find the total cost.

Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples, and her sister gathered twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.

From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half the amount she gathered from the tallest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

However, this is the combined total of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since Joanne gathered x apples from the average trees, her sister gathered 350 - x apples from the average trees. But we know that her sister didn't take any from the average trees, so 350 - x = 0.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. 

We know that the total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps (humps) is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

C + D = 180
2C + D = 304

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to find D:

1. In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. 
   So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

2. Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.
   So, the total distance traveled in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all.
   So, the distance traveled on this day is 0 kilometers.

4. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day.
   Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each period:
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers

1. The first 6 months are $8 a month. 
   Since 6 months is half a year, we multiply 6 months by 2 to get the total months in a year, which is 12 months. 
   Then we multiply 12 months by 8 dollars to get the cost for the first year, which is 96 dollars. 
   Since we are only interested in 2 years, we multiply 96 dollars by 2 to get the cost for the first 2 years at the introductory rate, which is 192 dollars.

2. The next 8 months are $12 a month. 
   Since 8 months is 2/3 of a year, we multiply 8 months by 12/10 to get the cost for 2/3 of a year, which is 9.6 dollars. 
   Then we multiply 9.6 dollars by 2 to get the cost for 4/3 of a year, which is 19.2 dollars.

3. The remaining months are $14 a month. 
   Since 2 years is 24 months, we subtract the months already counted (6 + 8 = 14 months) from 24 months to get the remaining months, which is 10 months. 
   Then we multiply 10 months by 14 dollars to get the cost for the remaining months, which is 140 dollars.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:

x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $22.

Now, let's find the total savings from both jeans. We know that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, we can set up an equation:

(1/3)(savings from jogger jeans) + (2/3)(savings from tattered jeans) = 6

We know that the jogger jeans cost $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is $22 - $22 = $0 (since he didn't save anything from the jogger jeans). However, this is not possible because he saved $6 in total. This means that the jogger jeans must have been on sale for $22, but the original price must have been more than $22.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as y. Since the jogger jeans were on sale for $22, we can write an equation:

y - 22 = 6 (since he saved $6 from the jogger jeans)

y = 28

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $28.

Now, let's compare the original cost of the jogger jeans to the cost of the tattered jeans. The jogger jeans originally cost $28, while the tattered jeans cost $28. This means that the jogger jeans originally cost the same as the tattered jeans.

1. First, let's calculate how much money Kenny made from selling his cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his cards.

2. Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can find out how many cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made ($50) by the price of each card ($1.5).

   Number of cards sold = Total money made / Price per card
   Number of cards sold = $50 / $1.5
   Number of cards sold = 33.33

   Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, we need to remember that this is the number of cards he sold, not the total number of cards he started with.

3. We know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 * x.

4. We already know that the number of cards he sold is 33.33 (rounded down to 33). So, we can set up the equation:

   2/3 * x = 33

5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

   x = 33 * 3/2
   x = 49.5

   Again, since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll round up to the nearest whole number because we're looking for the total number of cards he started with, and he must have had at least 49.5 cards to have 33 cards left after selling 2/3 of them.

   x = 50

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

3 yards = 3 * 3 feet = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. So, the total temperature change due to baking is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature will be:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window being open. Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house will cool down:

3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Jon's total time = Swim time + Bike time + Run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = 170 minutes + 10 minutes
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we know that James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
10% of Jon's swim time = 0.1 * 40 minutes
10% of Jon's swim time = 4 minutes
So, James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 10% of Jon's swim time
James' swim time = 40 minutes - 4 minutes
James' swim time = 36 minutes

We also know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim time and bike time from his total time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

First, let's find out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can find the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 32MPH * 0.5 hours

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and it runs 16 miles, the total hay it eats is:

Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
= 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 * $5

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per glass, and then divide the result by the number of glasses per tray.

First, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per glass: 50 / 5 = 10.

Then, we divide the result by the number of glasses per tray: 10 / 5 = 2.

459,"To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the weight capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity to find the number of trips:
Number of trips = Total weight / Weight capacity
= 3400 pounds / 2250 pounds
= 1.511 (round up to 2 since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

However, we can also calculate the number of trips by finding the remainder when the total weight is divided by the weight capacity. If the remainder is 0, then the number of trips is the quotient. If the remainder is not 0, then the number of trips is the quotient plus 1.

Let's calculate the remainder:
Remainder = Total weight % Weight capacity
= 3400 % 2250
= 150

Since the remainder is not 0, the number of trips is the quotient plus 1:
Number of trips = Quotient + 1
= 1 + 1
= 2

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans:
Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. 
The value of each aluminum can is 2 cents.
So, the total earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.
Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the total earnings from aluminum cans in the month is 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles:
Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week.
The value of each plastic bottle is 3 cents.
So, the total earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.
Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the total earnings from plastic bottles in the month is 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings:
Total earnings = earnings from aluminum cans + earnings from plastic bottles

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. So, the cost of 2 packs with the sale applied is:
$8.00 (regular price) - $4.00 (one pack) = $4.00

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost:
$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since Heather buys 2 packs of razors, which contain 8 razors (4 razors per pack), we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor:

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost for the first venue is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 for each guest. So, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

The cost for the second venue is $25 per guest, with no additional cost for food. So, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the equation:
L + D + B = 43

We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can write the equation:
L = D + 7

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write the equation:
D = B/2

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
Combine like terms:
2D + 7 + B = 43

Now we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(B/2) + 7 + B = 43
Simplify the equation:
B + 7 + B = 43
Combine like terms:
2B + 7 = 43

Now we can solve for B:
2B = 43 - 7
2B = 36
B = 36/2
B = 18

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2
D = 18/2

Chairs = 20 + 2
Chairs = 22

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since the total number of days in April is 30, the number of days in the second half of the month will be 30 - x.

We know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he saves in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half will be 2y.

We also know that the total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the following equation:

xy + 2y(30 - x) = 1125

Simplifying the equation, we get:

xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125

Combine like terms:

-xy + 60y = 1125

Factor out y:

y(-x + 60) = 1125

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact value of y. However, we can express y in terms of x.

y = 1125 / (-x + 60)

Now, we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

2y = 2 * (1125 / (-x + 60))

Since we want to find the amount Elvis needs to save for each day in the second half of the month, we need to divide 2y by the number of days in the second half, which is 30 - x.

Amount per day in the second half = (2 * 1125) / ((-x + 60) * (30 - x))

However, we still don't know the value of x. To find the amount Elvis needs to save for each day in the second half, we need to find the value of x.

Since the total number of days in April is 30, we can try different values of x to find the one that satisfies the condition.

Let's try x = 15. Then, the number of days in the second half is 30 - 15 = 15.

We know that the amount Elvis saves in the first half is y, and the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

We can set up the following equation:

15y + 2y(15) = 1125

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15y + 30y = 1125

Combine like terms:

45y = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

y = 1125 / 45

y = 25

Now that we know the value of y, we can find the amount Elvis needs to save for each day in the second half.

Amount per day in the second half = 2y / 15

Amount per day in the second half = (2 * 25) / 15

Amount per day in the second half = 50 / 15

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim 1 mile on a cold day, we can multiply this time by 3 to get the time for 3 miles:

16 minutes * 3 = 48 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a hot day. It takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes, so 2 minutes more than that is:

32 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

Now, we can find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day by multiplying the time for 1 mile by 3:

568,"To find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored, we need to use the information given about Richie's goals.

We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that he scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can set up an equation to find Mark's goals:

Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20

To find Mark's goals, we need to subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up another equation to find Anna's goals:

Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45

To find Anna's goals, we need to subtract 45 from both sides of the equation:

Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals each teenager scored, we can add them up to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals

First, let's calculate how much money Peter has left after buying wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. 

He spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday), so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
$5 * 4 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount spent from the total amount Peter had:
$70 - $20 = $50

Since Peter has $50 left, and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), we need to divide the remaining amount by 4:
$50 / 4 = $12.50

Now, let's calculate how many plastic action figures Peter can buy each day:
$12.50 / $2 = 6.25

Since Peter can't buy a fraction of an action figure, we'll round down to 6 plastic action figures per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter can buy from Thursday through Saturday:
6 * 3 = 18

Now, let's add the number of wooden action figures Peter bought from Sunday through Wednesday to the number of plastic action figures he bought from Thursday through Saturday:

Total Revenue:
The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Total Cost:
The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is:

Since each box contains 90 contacts and will last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the total number of contacts Pete will buy by multiplying the number of contacts per box by the number of boxes he buys. 

However, we are given that Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts. But we are also given that each box will last 45 days. Therefore, 2 boxes will last 2 * 45 = 90 days. 

Since 90 contacts will last 90 days, we can calculate the number of contacts per day by dividing the total number of contacts by the total number of days. 

Number of contacts per day = 90 contacts / 90 days = 1 contact per day.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, the total number of contacts he buys is 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Now, we need to find the total cost of the contacts. Each box costs $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 101% of x, which can be expressed as 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since the largest angle is 90 degrees, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

602,"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Distance traveled = 1200 miles
Time taken = 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Additional distance = 2000 miles

First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the amount he makes in one hour.

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Now, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can multiply 120 by 3/4 to get Marissa's hourly production.

Marissa's hourly production = (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour.

Now that we know how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make in one hour, we can multiply that by the number of hours they worked (12 hours) to get their total production.

Ruiz's total production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production = 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is the sum of their individual productions.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire undergoes in a month. Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to find out how many 2-mile intervals are in 400 miles.

400 miles / 2 miles = 200 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of rotations per interval:

200 intervals * 725 rotations/interval = 145,000 rotations/month

Since the tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations it undergoes in a month:

10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months

To find out how many years this is, we divide the number of months by 12:

First, let's calculate the total cost of the outfit before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:

$25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3):

$60 * 0.3 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost:

$60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. Joe will pay $42 for the outfit.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times longer than expected, it took 5 * 10 = 50 months in total.

The first 5 months cost $100,000, so we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months.

Each month after the first 5 took 50% more funding, so the cost for each of these months is 1.5 times the initial funding.

1. First, we need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright on the wave. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders by 0.25.

   Total number of riders = 100
   Number of riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

2. Next, we need to find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the number of riders who can stay upright by 0.6.

   Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

3. Finally, we need to find the number of men who can stay upright. Since the total number of riders who can stay upright is 25 and the number of women who can stay upright is 15, the number of men who can stay upright is the difference between these two numbers.

   Number of men who can stay upright = 25 - 15 = 10

Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, we can find the price of the gold Jewell. The price of the gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of the diamond Jewell. 

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * Price of diamond Jewell
Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold Jewell = $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
Price of silver Jewell = $1600 - $400
Price of silver Jewell = $1200

Now that we have the prices of all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together.

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200

Since Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and they are both driving, we can consider the relative speed between them. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative Speed

In this case, the distance is 75 miles, and the relative speed is 15 mph.

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

First, let's find the total cost of 10 classes at $10 per class:
10 classes * $10 per class = $100

Since Manny signed up for classes for $60, we need to find out how many classes he can attend at $10 per class without exceeding the total cost of $100:
$100 (total cost) - $60 (initial cost) = $40

Now, let's divide the remaining cost by the cost per class:
$40 / $10 per class = 4 classes

This means Manny can attend 4 classes at $10 per class without exceeding the total cost of $100. Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss:

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour

Step 1: Calculate the total sales from green hats in the first month.
Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats would be 'x/2'. We are given that the sales from red hats were $400. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Step 2: Calculate the total sales in the first month.
The total sales in the first month would be the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

Step 3: Calculate the sales in the second month.
We are given that the sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, we can calculate the sales in the second month as follows:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

Step 4: Calculate the total sales in two months.
To find the total sales in two months, we add the sales in the first month and the sales in the second month:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900

Now, we can subtract this new equation from equation (1) to eliminate 'g':
(4s - 2s) + (2g - 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Now, we can solve for 's' by dividing both sides by 2:
s = 30 / 2
s = 15

661,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's find the cost of the coffee. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. 

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. However, his favorite brand was sold out, so he had to buy the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's find the cost of the donut. The donut costs $2.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the coffee plus the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4:
Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * $120
Kassidy's amount = $90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy:
Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + $60

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, we multiply the initial height in feet by 12 to get the height in inches.

Initial height in inches = 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and its current height is 240 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches.

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height to find out how much more it needs to grow.

Additional growth needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 

1. When James buys toys for the 8 more dogs, he needs 8 more toys. Now, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.

2. After buying the toys, he finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. Since he already had 12 dogs, the total number of dogs is now 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. James needs 28 toys for these dogs. Since he already has 12 toys, he needs 28 - 12 = 16 more toys.

3. When James comes back yet again, 3 dogs are gone. This means he no longer needs 3 toys. However, he still needs to keep the 28 toys for the remaining 25 dogs. Since he already has 12 toys, he needs 28 - 12 = 16 toys for the remaining dogs. But he also needs to account for the 3 toys he no longer needs.

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can set up the equation:

However, we don't know the heartworm check cost yet. We know it's 60% of the total bill, but we also know that the heartworm check is 40% of the total bill that is not the vaccine cost. So, the heartworm check is 40% of the total bill minus the vaccine cost.

This is still not correct. Let's try again. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, the heartworm check is 0.6x. We also know that the heartworm check is 40% of the total bill minus the vaccine cost. So, the heartworm check is 0.4x - $40.

However, we also know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, the heartworm check is 0.6x. We can set up the equation:

Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying the number of high chairs by 5.

Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Now, we know that there are 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs. In total, the restaurant has 8 + 40 = 48 chairs.

Since 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function, we need to find out how many chairs are required for them. Each adult and baby will need a chair, so the total number of chairs required is 42 + 15 = 57.

To find out how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs they already have from the number of chairs required.

3. Find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from the percentage used by the city.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's total water, and 20% of that is used for non-industrial purposes, we can multiply the percentage used by the city by the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 friends in total, this group consists of 3 friends. Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices eaten by this group is:

3 friends * 2/3 * 12 slices = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 5 friends in total, this group consists of 2 friends. Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices eaten by this group is:

2 friends * 3/4 * 12 slices = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of pizzas ordered is:

42 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3.5 pizzas

However, since you can't order half a pizza, we know that 4 pizzas were ordered in total.

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices in 4 pizzas to find the number of slices left:

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Substituting the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches) into the equation, we get:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate the length of Bobby's shoe:

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with four windows each. Since Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find a quarter of 64. 

A quarter of 64 is calculated as 64 * (1/4) = 64 * 0.25 = 16. 

Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with two windows each. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 32.

3/4ths of 32 is calculated as 32 * (3/4) = 32 * 0.75 = 24.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can start by finding her father's age. It is mentioned that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We can write the equation as F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find Dora's mother's age. It is mentioned that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We can write the equation as M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F = 38 into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there are 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes candidate A received by multiplying 20% by 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Now, we know that candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find out how many votes candidate B received, we need to calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes.

50% of 20 votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes

Now, we add 10 votes to candidate A's votes to find out how many votes candidate B received.

20 votes + 10 votes = 30 votes

Since candidate B received 30 votes, we can now find out how many votes candidate C received. We know that candidate A and candidate B received a total of 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 

To find out how many votes candidate C received, we subtract the total votes received by candidate A and candidate B from the total number of voters.

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, let's find out how many apples Beck has after Boris gives her 10 apples.

Beck's final apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's final apples = 77 + 10
Beck's final apples = 87

Now, let's find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now. To do this, we need to find out how many apples Boris has after giving Beck 10 apples.

1. Calculate the total amount of water used for giant cubes:
   Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each cube uses 4 ounces of water. 
   Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces

2. Calculate the total amount of water used for medium cubes:
   Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each cube uses 2 ounces of water. 
   Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces

3. Calculate the total amount of water used for small cubes:
   Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water. 
   Since 1/2 an ounce is the same as 0.5 ounces, 
   Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces

4. Calculate the total amount of water used for all cubes:

First, let's find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2

However, we are asked to find the number of students who like to play video games. Since the number of students who like to play video games or play music is 25, and 10 like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is 25 - 10 = 15.

Let's assume the number of students in each class is x. Then, the number of girls in one class is 40% of x, which is 0.4x. Since there are two classes, the total number of girls is 2 * 0.4x = 0.8x.

We know that the total number of students in both classes is 80. So, the total number of students in one class is 80 / 2 = 40.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of boys in one class. The number of boys in one class is the total number of students in one class minus the number of girls in one class. 

Number of boys in one class = Total number of students in one class - Number of girls in one class
= 40 - 0.8x

However, we know that the total number of students in one class is 40. So, we can set up an equation using the fact that the total number of students in one class is 40.

754,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 
90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading small stickers.
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, and each large button is worth three small buttons, we need to find out how many small buttons Lorraine gets from trading 27 small stickers. However, since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can directly calculate the number of large buttons she gets from trading 27 small stickers. But first, we need to find out how many small buttons she gets from trading 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons. Since each large button is worth three small buttons, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Step 3: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers.
Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. 
50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

Step 4: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers.
Since each large button is worth three small stickers, and each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, we can directly calculate the number of small buttons she gets from trading 20 large stickers. Since each large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. However, we also need to consider the small buttons she started with. She started with 30 small stickers and traded 27 of them, so she has 30 - 27 = 3 small buttons left. Therefore, the total number of buttons she has is 9 + 20 + 60 + 3 = 92 buttons.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, and this is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. So, we can set up the equation:

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians in total.

We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as J. Since two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score will be x + 3. 
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score will be (x - 4) * -30 (because she has 4 seconds less left on the timer).

Since we don't know the values of y, w, and z, we can't directly compare Ava's and Emma's scores. However, we can express the difference between their scores as a function of x, y, w, and z.

The difference between their scores = Ava's score - Emma's score

When Bob added the fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means that the total number of orange fish (3 + z) is twice the total number of white fish (4 + x). We can write this as an equation: 3 + z = 2(4 + x).

Now, let's simplify the equation: 3 + z = 8 + 2x.

We can also express z in terms of y: z = 17 - y.

Substituting z in the previous equation, we get: 3 + (17 - y) = 8 + 2x.

Simplifying this equation, we get: 20 - y = 8 + 2x.

Now, let's express y in terms of x: y = 17 - z. Since z = 17 - y, we can substitute z in the previous equation: y = 17 - (17 - y), which simplifies to y = y.

However, we can also express y in terms of x using the fact that the total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x + y. Since the total number of white fish before adding the new fish is 4, we can write: 4 + x + y = 4 + x + (17 - z).

Since z = 17 - y, we can substitute z in the previous equation: 4 + x + (17 - (17 - y)) = 4 + x + y.

Simplifying this equation, we get: 4 + x + y = 4 + x + y.

However, we can also express y in terms of x using the fact that the total number of white fish after adding the new fish is 4 + x + y. Since the total number of white fish before adding the new fish is 4, we can write: 4 + x + y = 2(3 + z).

Since z = 17 - y, we can substitute z in the previous equation: 4 + x + y = 2(3 + (17 - y)).

Simplifying this equation, we get: 4 + x + y = 2(20 - y).

Expanding the right-hand side, we get: 4 + x + y = 40 - 2y.

784,"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency of his car and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, he makes a round trip (to and from work) 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

In a week, he makes 5 round trips, so the total distance he travels in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate how much fuel Andy's car consumes in a week. The fuel efficiency of his car is 10 miles per gallon, so to travel 50 miles, he needs 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas per week.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so the total cost of gas per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find the number of twenties she spent, we can multiply the total number of twenties by 3/5:

10 twenties * 3/5 = 10 * 3 / 5 = 6 twenties

Since each twenty is worth $20, we can multiply the number of twenties she spent by the value of each twenty to find the total amount spent from the twenties:

6 twenties * $20/twenty = $120

Now, let's add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch:

   Since we don't know the exact number of hours he worked in 2 months, let's assume he worked 80 hours (20 hours/week * 4 weeks/month * 2 months). 
   So, his earnings for the first 2 months would be 80 * $10 = $800.

2. After the raise of $0.50 per hour, Billy's new rate would be $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
   Let's assume he worked 12 months after the first raise. 
   So, his earnings for the next 12 months would be 20 * 12 * $10.50 = $2520.

3. After the second raise of $1.00 per hour, Billy's new rate would be $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.
   Since we want to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally after working 20 hours, we can calculate his earnings for the last 20 hours at the new rate.
   So, his earnings for the last 20 hours would be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings:
$800 + $2520 + $230 = $3550.

Next, let's calculate Sally's total earnings:
Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. 
So, Sally's starting salary would be $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
Since we want to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally after working 20 hours, we can calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours at the rate of $10.50 per hour.
So, Sally's earnings for 20 hours would be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

Now, let's calculate how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
$3550 - $210 = $3340.

Now, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she should buy so that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals. 

Let's assume the number of stuffed goats she should buy is 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. 

So, we can set up the equation:

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction: 

x * 100 = 30 * (14 + x)

Now, let's simplify the equation: 

100x = 420 + 30x

Subtract 30x from both sides:

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks will have 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour is 0.5 hours. So, in 14 days, Kris plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there is 1 week, Kris plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

In total, Kris has played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Distance = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 2 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

828,"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. First, we add the money Mulan initially had ($40) to the money her father gave her ($100). 
   $40 + $100 = $140

2. Next, we calculate the total cost of the two pairs of jeans. 
   2 pairs of jeans * $30 each = 2 * $30 = $60

3. Then, we add the cost of the bag to the total cost of the jeans.

829,"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate his production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.

Now, let's analyze the pattern: 
- Week 1: 8,000 bars
- Week 2: 4,000 bars (half of Week 1)
- Week 3: 24,000 bars (three times Week 1)

The pattern is not a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence, but it seems that the production is alternating between being half and three times the previous week's production. However, to find the production for the fourth week, we can look at the pattern in a different way.

If we consider the production of the first and third weeks (8,000 and 24,000), we can see that the production of the second week (4,000) is half of the first week, and the production of the third week (24,000) is three times the first week. This suggests that the production is alternating between being half and three times the previous week's production.

To find the production for the fourth week, we can look at the production of the second week (4,000) and apply the same pattern. Since the production of the third week (24,000) is three times the production of the first week (8,000), we can expect the production of the fourth week to be half of the production of the second week (4,000).

So, the production for the fourth week would be 4,000 / 2 = 2,000 bars of chocolate.

830,"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos:
- She records 18 4-minute videos each week. 
- So, the total time spent on recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time Britany spends writing amateur songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs. 
- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent on writing amateur songs is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends doing her makeup:
- She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. 
- Since there are 7 days in a week, she spends 15 * 6 = 90 minutes doing her makeup in a week.

Now, let's add up the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:
- Time spent on recording videos: 72 minutes
- Time spent on writing amateur songs: 120 minutes
- Time spent on doing makeup: 90 minutes
- Total time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on TikTok in a week to hours:
- 282 minutes / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the total time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month:
- 4.7 hours * 4 = 18.8 hours

The answer is 18.8 hours.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
831,"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items that Angela has.

The additional items that Angela has are:
- 2 mirrors (since she has 6 and the initial installation includes 4)
- 1 chandelier (since she has 2 and the initial installation includes 1)
- 10 pictures (since she has 20 and the initial installation includes 10)

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00
Total cost of additional items = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items to find the total cost:
Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.40 (which is 40% as a decimal). This gives us $30.00 * 0.40 = $12.00.
4. Now, we add the 40% more that Roy saved to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings. So, $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

835,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, as well as the time it takes for them to travel across the highway.

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as K and the speed of a turtle as T. We are given that the speed of a turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, so we can write:

T = 0.5K

We are also given that it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across the highway. Since they are traveling at the same speed, we can say that the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is equal to the distance traveled by 1 kangaroo in 18 hours. Let's denote the distance as D. We can write:

3K \* 18 = D

Now, we want to find out how many hours it will take for 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the time it takes for them to travel the same distance will be twice as long as the time it takes for a kangaroo to travel the same distance. Let's denote the time it takes for the turtles as t. We can write:

4T \* t = D

Substituting the expression for T in terms of K, we get:

4(0.5K) \* t = D

Simplifying, we get:

2K \* t = D

Now, we can equate the two expressions for D:

3K \* 18 = 2K \* t

Dividing both sides by 2K, we get:

9 = t

So, it will take 9 hours for 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway.

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk produced by each cow (5 liters):
25 liters / 5 liters/cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to reach 5 cows:
5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already have) = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

840,"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 1/6 of the original length is unused. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, we can calculate the unused portion as follows:

Unused portion of the first glue stick = (1/6) * 12 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 2/3 of the original length is unused. We can calculate the unused portion as follows:

Unused portion of the second glue stick = (2/3) * 12 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 of the original length is unused. We can calculate the unused portion as follows:

Unused portion of the third glue stick = (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions of all three glue sticks together to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:

Total unused length = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

We know that the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both math and English. Since 8 students are good at English only, we can write the equation:

T = M_only + English_only + B
20 = 5 + 8 + x
20 = 13 + x

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 20 - 13
x = 7

So, the number of students good at both math and English is 7.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students good at math only and those good at both math and English:

1. You are three years younger than your brother. 
   Let's denote your brother's age as B. Then, your age is B - 3.

2. You are 2 years older than your sister. 
   Let's denote your sister's age as S. Then, your age is S + 2.

3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. 
   So, your mom's age is 3B - 1.

4. When you add all your ages, you get 87. 
   The equation becomes: (B - 3) + (S + 2) + (3B - 1) + S = 87

Combine like terms: 
   4B + S - 2 = 87

Now, let's express your age in terms of B and S. We already have two expressions for your age: B - 3 and S + 2. Since both expressions represent your age, we can set them equal to each other:
   B - 3 = S + 2

Now, let's solve for S in terms of B:
   S = B - 5

Now, substitute S = B - 5 into the equation 4B + S - 2 = 87:
   4B + (B - 5) - 2 = 87

Combine like terms:
   5B - 7 = 87

Add 7 to both sides:
   5B = 94

Divide by 5:

Initially, there are 10 people infected. Each day, each infected person infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections each day is 10 times 6, which is 60.

After the first day, the total number of infected people is 10 (initially infected) + 60 (newly infected) = 70.

After the second day, the number of newly infected people is 70 times 6, which is 420. So, the total number of infected people is 70 (already infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490.

After the third day, the number of newly infected people is 490 times 6, which is 2940. So, the total number of infected people is 490 (already infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430.

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, it means that 80% of the microphones were arranged in pairs. 

We can find 80% of 50 by multiplying 50 by 0.8 (which is the decimal form of 80%). 

50 * 0.8 = 40

So, 40 microphones were arranged in pairs.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 birds.

Next, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting in the bushes are flying overhead, we can multiply the number of birds nesting in the bushes by 2/3.

2/3 * 6 = 4

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we can multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group.

3 * 8 = 24

So, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group together to find the total number of birds Jerry counted.

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of a thingamabob = Speed of a whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of a thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of a thingamabob = 11 meters per second

The cost of the salad is $6. 
The cost of the yogurt is half of $6, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. We also know that she eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. 

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. 

The total cost of Ellen's goods can be represented as: 
2x (cost of two carrots) + $6 (cost of the salad) + $3 (cost of the yogurt) = $11 (total cost)

Now, let's simplify the equation: 
2x + $6 + $3 = $11
Combine the constants: 
2x + $9 = $11

Now, let's isolate 'x' by subtracting $9 from both sides of the equation: 
2x = $11 - $9

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we don't know the exact number of times she mowed his lawn, we can assume that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is directly proportional to the number of times she mowed each lawn. 

However, we do know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales). 

We also know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is equal to the sum of the amounts she made from mowing each lawn, which is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

Since the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales), we can set up the equation:

54x = 80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales)

We also know that the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is $6, which is 6x. 

Since we don't know the exact value of x, we can use the fact that the amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn, and the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn.

We can set up the equation:

6x + 18x + 30x = 80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales)

Combine like terms:

54x = 80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales)

Since we know that the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is $6, which is 6x, we can set up the equation:

6x = 6

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 1

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the amount she made from mowing each lawn:

The amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is 6x = 6 * 1 = $6
The amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 18x = 18 * 1 = $18
The amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 30x = 30 * 1 = $30

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

Now that we know the total amount she made from mowing lawns, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales:

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the total revenue from one student is 10 * $0.8 = $8. Since there are 30 students, the total revenue is 30 * $8 = $240.

Next, let's calculate the total cost. The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, the total cost for one student is 10 * $0.5 = $5. Since there are 30 students, the total cost is 30 * $5 = $150.

Now, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

1. Larry has 3 cats.

2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. 
   So, the number of dogs = 3 * number of cats = 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. 
   So, the number of rabbits = number of dogs - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. 
   So, the number of fish = 3 * number of rabbits = 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. 
   So, the number of gerbils = 1/3 * number of fish = 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j.

We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. However, there is no information about Jean's age. Since we are asked to find Peter's age, we can assume that Jean's age is not relevant to the problem. Therefore, we will ignore Jean's age for now.

2. Paul is 10 years older than John. This can be written as p = j + 10.

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. This can be written as P = p + j.

Now, let's substitute the expression for p from step 2 into the equation in step 3:

P = (j + 10) + j
P = 2j + 10

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. Since we are ignoring Jean's age, we can write the equation as:

P + p + j = 100

Substituting the expression for p from step 2 and the expression for P from step 4 into the equation in step 5:

(2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100

Combine like terms:

4j + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4j = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

j = 20

Now that we have found John's age, we can find Paul's age using the equation p = j + 10:

p = 20 + 10
p = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the equation P = p + j:

Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is 4 * 2 = 8. 

Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself. 

So, the initial total number of balloons is 8 (given to friends) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9.

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (4 friends and Maria), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial total number of balloons (9) to the additional balloons (15) to get the final total.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the total number of seeds spat. Zoey spat 40 seeds and Sydney spat 35 seeds. So, the total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

However, since the question asks for the average total distance spat, we should consider the average distance per seed for each person and then find the average of those two averages.

Zoey's average distance per seed is 10 feet, and Sydney's average distance per seed is 12 feet. The average of these two is (10 + 12) / 2 = 11.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. Since Cameron stays for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning), this option is not applicable to him.

Option 2: 12-hour stay with additional hours
Cameron stays for 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours, he pays 70 pesos per hour. So, the cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare the two options. If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, he would have paid 1600 pesos. However, since he chose the 12-hour stay with additional hours, he pays 1350 pesos. 

To find out how much he saves, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay with additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. 

There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. 
So, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. 
So, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep.

Step 1: Calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance.
First, we need to find 60% of the total distance, which is 20 miles.
60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time he took to swim 12 miles is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the time James rested on the island.
Since James rested for half as long as the swimming time, the time he rested is:
Time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim.
The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

Step 4: Calculate the time James took to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
The time he took to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Step 5: Calculate the total time James took to get across the lake.
The total time is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance:
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo) 
We also know that B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar) 

Since the total points scored by the team is 45, we can write the equation: A + B + D = 45 

Substituting B = A + 20 and B = D + 10 into the equation, we get: 
A + (A + 20) + (D + 10) = 45 

Combine like terms: 
2A + D + 30 = 45 

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2A + D = 15 

Now, we need to find the relationship between A and D. Since B = D + 10, we can substitute B = A + 20 into this equation: 
A + 20 = D + 10 

Subtract 10 from both sides: 
A + 10 = D 

Now we have two equations: 
2A + D = 15 
A + 10 = D 

Substitute D = A + 10 into the first equation: 
2A + (A + 10) = 15 

Combine like terms: 
3A + 10 = 15 

Subtract 10 from both sides: 
3A = 5 

Divide both sides by 3: 
A = 5/3 

However, since A must be a whole number (you can't score a fraction of a point), we need to re-examine our equations. 

Let's go back to the equation A + 10 = D. Since D must be a whole number, A must be a whole number that is 10 less than D. 

Let's try A = 5. Then D = A + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15. 

Now we can find B: B = D + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25. 

However, we know that B = A + 20. If A = 5, then B = 5 + 20 = 25, which is correct. 

Now we can find A: A + B + D = 45 
5 + 25 + 15 = 45

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2 holes. So, the net number of holes added on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day. We know that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. 

Let's denote the total number of holes at the end of the first day as 'x'. Then, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4x.

We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the sum of the holes dug on the first three days and the holes dug on the fourth day. 

The total number of holes at the end of the first three days is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as 'y'. Then, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 29 + y.

Since the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4x, we can set up the equation: 29 + y = 4x.

We also know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 times the total number of holes at the end of the first day. So, we can set up another equation: 29 + y = 4(10).

Now, let's solve the equation 29 + y = 4(10). 

4(10) = 40

So, the equation becomes: 29 + y = 40.

Now, let's solve for 'y'. 

y = 40 - 29
y = 11

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X.

From the given information, we know that:

1. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write an equation: X = S + 5
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write another equation: S = 4A - 13
3. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon, so the total number of Pokémon caught is the sum of the Pokémon caught by each of them: A + S + X = 339

Now, let's substitute the first equation (X = S + 5) into the third equation (A + S + X = 339) to get: A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms: A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, let's substitute the second equation (S = 4A - 13) into the equation above: A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339

Expand the equation: A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, let's find out how many Pokémon Stan has caught. We can substitute A = 40 into the second equation (S = 4A - 13): S = 4(40) - 13

Simplify the equation: S = 160 - 13

S = 147

First, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird traveled in the northerly direction for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird traveled in the northerly direction, we need to subtract this distance from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. However, the bird also traveled in the southerly direction for the last 5 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Now, we add the distance traveled in the first 10 hours and the last 5 hours:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles
Total southerly distance = 410 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Total distance = Total southerly distance - Northerly distance
Total distance = 410 miles - 36 miles

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 10 + 15 = 25 boxes.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 11 + 15 = 26 boxes.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to add this space to the total length of the flower bed. However, we also need to account for the space taken up by the plants themselves. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. Then, the total space taken up by the plants is 'n' * 12 inches. The total space taken up by the gaps between the plants is (n - 1) * 18 inches (since there are 'n - 1' gaps). 

The total length of the flower bed is the sum of the space taken up by the plants and the gaps between them. We can set up an equation:

991,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet and then use that information to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can say that x = 30.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means Bill was 3x years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years. This means that the age difference between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

3x - x = 75

Combine like terms:

2x = 75

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 37.5

However, we already know that x = 30, which is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. This means that the equation 2x = 75 is not correct. The correct equation should be:

3x - x = 75 + 75

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 150 years. This means that the age difference between Bill's two sightings is 150 years.

3x - x = 150

Combine like terms:

2x = 150

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 75

However, we already know that x = 30, which is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. This means that the equation 2x = 150 is not correct. The correct equation should be:

3x - x = 75 + 75 + 75

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 225 years. This means that the age difference between Bill's two sightings is 225 years.

3x - x = 225

Combine like terms:

2x = 225

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 112.5

However, we already know that x = 30, which is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. This means that the equation 2x = 225 is not correct. The correct equation should be:

3x - x = 75 + 75 + 75 + 75 + 75

2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 225

However, we already know that x = 30, which is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. This means that the equation 2x = 450 is not correct. The correct equation should be:

1. Electric bill: Buford writes a check once per month, so in a year (12 months), he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.

2. Gas bill: Buford also writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so in a year (12 months), he writes 12 checks for the gas bill.

3. Church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year (12 months), he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.

4. Pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can write an equation:

44 = x / 2

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 44 * 2
x = 88

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Now, let's find out how many flights the first plane makes to Greece. Since it goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, we can write:

Flights to Greece = (3/4) * x
Flights to Greece = (3/4) * 88
Flights to Greece = 66

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, we can find the number of flights to France by subtracting the flights to Greece from the total flights and then dividing by 2:

Flights to France = (x - Flights to Greece) / 2
Flights to France = (88 - 66) / 2
Flights to France = 22 / 2

We know that the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, we can write the equation for the total age of the group: 
3 + 4 + w + Helene's age = 20 

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as 'a'. 

So, Helene's age = 2a 

Now, we can write the equation for the average age of the group: 
(3 + 4 + w + Helene's age) / 4 = a 

Substituting Helene's age = 2a into the equation, we get: 
(3 + 4 + w + 2a) / 4 = a 

Multiplying both sides by 4, we get: 
7 + w + 2a = 4a 

Subtracting 2a from both sides, we get: 
7 + w = 2a 

Now, we can substitute this expression for 2a into the equation for the total age of the group: 
3 + 4 + w + (7 + w) / 2 = 20 

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 
2(3 + 4 + w) + (7 + w) = 40 

Expanding the equation, we get: 
6 + 8 + 2w + 7 + w = 40 

Combining like terms, we get:

Let's assume the total number of slices is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

We can represent the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'.

First, let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we know that Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time required from the serving time.

Serving time: 5:00 pm
Total time required: 3 hours

Latest start time = Serving time - Total time required

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold a total of 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes

1003,"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student. 
The dance studio has 10 students.

Cost of renting the studio per session: $25
Cost of students per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. 
There are 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12.

Total cost per session: $40
Number of sessions in a month: 12
Total cost in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, not the cost. Since the dance studio charges its students for the sessions, we need to calculate the total revenue.

The dance studio charges $1.50 per student per session. 
The dance studio has 10 students. 
The number of sessions in a month is 12.

Revenue per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
Number of sessions in a month: 12

However, the dance studio also charges its students for renting the studio. 
The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The number of sessions in a month is 12.

Revenue from renting the studio per session: $25

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50
= 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 4 times the number of female porcupines.

Total babies born in a month = 4 * 30
= 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 12 times the number of babies born in a month.

Total babies born in a year = 12 * 120
= 1440

The initial population of porcupines is 50, and 1440 babies are born in a year. Therefore, the total population after a year is the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born.

Total population after a year = 50 + 1440

1006,"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth

Given the dimensions of the pool:

Width (W) = 14 feet
Depth (D) = 4 feet

We can plug these values into the formula:

Volume = L x W x D

= 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 7.48 (not 5.9) to get the volume in gallons (1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons), we do this calculation:

Volume in gallons = 1400 x 7.48

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

After that, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, after 3 more hours, the charge remaining is (x - 45) - 3 * 7 = (x - 45) - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

Her wage per hour is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is:
$10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week

Her tip per hour is $15, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly tips are:

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120. We can set up an equation based on the earnings:

Price of small stuffed animals * Number of small stuffed animals + Price of large stuffed animals * Number of large stuffed animals = Total earnings

20l = 120

To find the number of large stuffed animals, we can divide both sides by 20:

Scenario 1: Substitute teacher comes in (50% chance). In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in, but the whole class gets an extension (40% chance). In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

Scenario 3: Normal teacher comes in, but Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

However, there's a scenario where Marcus actually has to turn in his homework:

Scenario 4: Normal teacher comes in and the whole class doesn't get an extension, and Marcus can't convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment (100% - 50% - 40% - 20% = 10% chance). In this case, Marcus has to turn in his homework.

To find the total percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we multiply the chance of each scenario where he has to turn it in by the chance of that scenario happening, and then add them up.

Chance of Scenario 4: 10% * 0.4 (chance of normal teacher coming in) = 4%
Chance of Scenario 4: 10% * 0.6 (chance of normal teacher coming in and the whole class not getting an extension) = 6%

Total chance of having to turn in homework: 4% + 6% = 10%

1031,"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to calculate the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total available seats for guests = Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Total available seats for guests = 6000 - 950 - 300
Total available seats for guests = 5750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the total available seats for guests by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Tickets per graduate = Total available seats for guests / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 6.053 (approximately)

Since we can't give a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number to ensure each graduate has an equal number of tickets to give to their friends and family.

Medium-sized beans = 2 * 75 = 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, we can calculate the number of small beans he can eat by multiplying the number of medium-sized beans by 3.

1038,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in school. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans. Since he got $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, the total amount of money he lost due to loans is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to not working while in school. Before college, he had a $25,000/year job. Since he was not working for 4 years, the total amount of money he lost due to not working is:

$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in school:

$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (not working) = $300,000

After graduating, Jim's income tripled, so his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

To calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Amount / Annual Income

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = $300,000 / $75,000/year

Time = 4 years

However, this is the time it would take Jim to pay off the loans, but we also need to consider the time it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the money lost due to not working while in school. Since he earns $75,000/year, it would take him:

Time = $100,000 / $75,000/year

Time = 1.33 years

Since he already spent 4 years in college, we need to add the time it would take him to pay off the loans and the time it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the money lost due to not working while in school:

Total Time = 4 years + 1.33 years

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the new dimensions of each piece of fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet (for the first piece) and 8 + 2 = 10 feet (for the second piece)
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet (for the first piece) and 6 + 2 = 8 feet (for the second piece)

However, since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to calculate the total area of fabric required. 

For the first piece of fabric, the area is: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet
For the second piece of fabric, the area is: 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet

One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85.

So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

   - Twice the amount he previously lost is 2 * $5 = $10.

   - Since he won, this amount is added to the total, but we'll consider it as a positive value for now.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:
- Total amount lost: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50
- Total amount won: $11 (second race)

Since we're calculating the average loss, we'll consider the total amount lost and ignore the total amount won. The average loss is the total amount lost divided by the number of races.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

Let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:

Price in 2008 = Price in 2007 - (21% of Price in 2007)

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to convert the king size set to twin sets. Since 1 king size set is equivalent to 2 twin sets, we can consider it as 2 twin sets. So, the total number of twin sets he needs to wash is 4 (twin) + 2 (king) = 6 twin sets.

3 cats * 2 times/day * 60 grams/time = 360 grams/day

Now, we need to divide the total amount of cat food available (720 grams) by the amount of cat food eaten per day (360 grams):

720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days

1060,"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to determine how many slices each person ate.

Given that Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake did, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total.

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying Jake's slices by 2.

Silvia's slices = Jake's slices * 2
Silvia's slices = 7 * 2
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we know how many slices each person ate. To find the total number of slices eaten, we add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia.

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

We know that the total time it took to make the meal is 98 minutes. Since Donovan and Betsy worked together, their individual times add up to the total time. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
1062,"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add them together.

1. Cost of the cast: $200
2. Cost of the 30-minute visit: The doctor charges $300/hour, so for 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the cost would be 0.5 * $300 = $150.
3. Cost of the painkillers: Hannah needs 30 painkillers, and each pill costs $4, so the total cost would be 30 * $4 = $120.
4. Cost of parking: The doctor charges $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the total cost for parking would be 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club:
20 pizzas (ordered) * 70% (eaten) = 20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team:
The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.

Now, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team:
40 pizzas (ordered) * 80% (eaten) = 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, let's add up the number of pizzas eaten by both teams:
14 pizzas (glee club) + 32 pizzas (football team) = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

Finally, let's subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered:

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and there are 700 small coupons. So, the total cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and there are 1400 big coupons. So, the total cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together to find the total amount spent on postage. 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 24500 cents is equal to 245 dollars.

   Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
   So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 meatball sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

However, the grocery store promotion allows him to buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, he will pay the full price of one pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds (6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets). 

For the first set, he will pay the full price of 2 pounds, which is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. 

For the second and third sets, he will pay half the price of 1 pound, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00. 

So, for the second and third sets, he will pay 1 * $2.00 = $2.00 each.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey. 

Total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys = 10 + 14 = 24 bananas

Now, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is also 315.

1079,"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

First, let's find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of its original price, we can calculate it as follows:

Original price = $2000
Discount = 25% (100% - 75%)
Price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch = Original price - (Discount * Original price)
= $2000 - (0.25 * $2000)
= $2000 - $500
= $1500

Now, let's find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. Since he sold it at 120% of the price at which he bought it, we can calculate it as follows:

Price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch = $1500
Selling price = Price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch + (20% of Price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch)
= $1500 + (0.20 * $1500)
= $1500 + $300
= $1800

Now, let's find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price. We can calculate it as follows:

Original price = $2000
Selling price = $1800
Discount = Original price - Selling price
= $2000 - $1800
= $200
Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100

First, let's find out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

In 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds. 

Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs will create in 14400 seconds. To do this, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds by 5.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. Since she bought 10 bunches with an average of 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is:
10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost is:
40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so the total cost is:
10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

We know that the total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, and they will split it between themselves. So, the sum of the fence Sam gets and the fence Harry gets should be equal to 100 feet.

We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

This means Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to subtract the amount of fence Sam gets from the total amount of fence:

100 - 20 = 80

First, let's find out how many Trekking bikes were sold. We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. 

Half of 300 is 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find out how many BMX bikes were sold. We know that 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.

15% of 300 is (15/100) * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find out how many MTB bikes were sold. We know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. 

Total bikes sold = 300
Trekking bikes = 150
BMX bikes = 45
MTB bikes = Total bikes sold - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes)
MTB bikes = 300 - (150 + 45)
MTB bikes = 300 - 195
MTB bikes = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike.

Price of one MTB = $500
Number of MTB bikes sold = 105
Earnings from MTB bikes = Price of one MTB * Number of MTB bikes sold
Earnings from MTB bikes = $500 * 105
Earnings from MTB bikes = $52,500

Price of one BMX = $500 / 2 = $250
Number of BMX bikes sold = 45
Earnings from BMX bikes = Price of one BMX * Number of BMX bikes sold
Earnings from BMX bikes = $250 * 45

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class each week. He has 6 periods in a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class each day is 6 * 40 = 240 minutes. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class each week is 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the total minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each day. Since he spends 1200 minutes in class each week, his total weekly minutes are 1200 * 7 = 8400 minutes (assuming a 7-day week). 1/16 of 8400 minutes is 525 minutes. Since he spends this amount on both Saturday and Sunday, the total minutes he spends on these days is 525 * 2 = 1050 minutes.

Now, let's add the total minutes John spends in class and the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1200 + 1050 = 2250 minutes.

Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged was twice the amount left after the Allosaurus ate, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left. 

So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was twice the amount left after the velociraptors scavenged.

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was twice the amount left after the T-Rex ate.

1101,"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. We know that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5
Micah's miles = 28

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three.

Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 36

Now, we subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

1102,"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making the new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this amount from the initial charge:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new purchases:

1. Frying pan: It was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20):

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

So, the discount is $4.00. To find the sale price, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

2. Set of towels: It was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10):

$30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00

So, the discount is $3.00. To find the sale price, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the new purchases to the balance after the return:

$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large. This means that 1/5 of the total number of jellyfish are large.

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color.

3. Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 'x'. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

4. The number of large jellyfish that change color is 1/3 of x/5, which is (1/3) * (x/5) = x/15.

5. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. This includes both the large jellyfish that change color and the small jellyfish that are always blue. Since all small jellyfish are blue, the 6 jellyfish that changed color are only the large jellyfish that change color.

6. Therefore, x/15 = 6.

7. To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to solve for 'x'. Multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get x = 6 * 15 = 90.

1105,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to save that amount.

First, let's calculate Lauren's current annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her current annual salary, we can calculate her annual savings as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.20 * $100,000
= $20,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. Since she plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary, her retirement expenses will be:

Retirement expenses = 40% of $100,000
= 0.40 * $100,000
= $40,000 per year

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total amount needed = Retirement expenses * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, let's calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save this amount. We can use the following formula:

Number of years = Total amount needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to save the amount, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. Therefore, the number of years Lauren needs to work is:

Number of years = Total number of years - Number of years in retirement
= 40 - 20
= 20 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the amount, but we need to consider that she is saving 20% of her salary each year. So, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save the amount if she saves 20% of her salary each year.

Since her salary is $100,000, and she saves 20% of it, we can calculate the total amount she saves each year as $20,000. However, her salary will increase over time, and she will save more each year. To calculate the total amount she saves over 20 years, we can use the following formula:

Total amount saved = (Annual savings / (1 - (1 + inflation rate)^(-number of years)))

However, we don't have the inflation rate, so we will assume it is 0% for simplicity. Therefore, the total amount she saves over 20 years is:

Total amount saved = (Annual savings / (1 - (1 + 0)^(-number of years)))
= $20,000 * 20
= $400,000

However, this is the total amount she saves over 20 years, but we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save $800,000. We can use the following formula:

Number of years = Total amount needed / Total amount saved per year

However, we don't have the total amount saved per year, so we will calculate it as follows:

Total amount saved per year = (Annual savings / (1 - (1 + inflation rate)^(-number of years)))

Total male fishes = 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = 7
Total female fishes = 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12

Tate buys:

First, let's calculate the distance for one round trip. Since it takes 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, the distance can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2:

Total distance for one round trip = 140 miles * 2
Total distance for one round trip = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total number of round trips per month is 2. To find the total miles driven per month, we multiply the total distance for one round trip by the number of round trips per month:

Total miles driven per month = Total distance for one round trip * Number of round trips per month
Total miles driven per month = 280 miles * 2

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour. 
In a 10-hour shift, they produce 12 * 10 = 120 toys.

Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour. 
In a 10-hour shift, they produce 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in a 10-hour shift is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in a 10-hour shift is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in a 10-hour shift by 10. 
Since the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in a 10-hour shift is 220, and 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys in a 10-hour shift.

1. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as A. Since they painted the same number of eggs, we can say that Madeline also painted A eggs.

2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

3. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30

4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30

5. Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get: 2S = 18

6. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: S = 9

7. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

8. We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a total of A + A = 2A eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, we can say that A + A = 2A = 2 * (number of eggs Madeline painted).

9. We also know that the total number of eggs painted by all four people is 56. So, we can write the equation: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56

10. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2A + 30 = 56

11. Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get: 2A = 26

First, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is:
200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes. Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, so he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces. So, the total weight of the boxes is:
25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, let's add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes together:
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can set up an equation to find her brother's salary:

Valerie's salary = 1/2 * Brother's salary
$5000 = 1/2 * Brother's salary
Brother's salary = $5000 * 2
Brother's salary = $10,000

Now that we know Valerie's brother earns $10,000 per month, we can find their combined salary:

Combined salary = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary
Combined salary = $5000 + $10,000
Combined salary = $15,000

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 40 minutes are spent on the beach. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find her speed on the beach.

Time spent on the beach = 40 minutes
Distance walked on the beach = 2 miles
Speed on the beach = x miles per minute

We can rearrange the formula to solve for speed: speed = distance / time
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, let's calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. 
Distance walked on the sidewalk = 1 mile
Speed on the sidewalk = 1/10 miles per minute

Time spent on the sidewalk = distance / speed
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time spent on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as 'x' degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the mug decreases. Since the volume of the mug doesn't change, the temperature of the remaining water in the mug will be lower than 33 degrees. 

The temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug can be calculated using the formula for specific heat capacity:

Temperature change = (mass * specific heat capacity * change in temperature) / mass

However, since we don't know the mass of the water, we can use the ratio of the temperatures to find the temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug.

Let's assume the mass of the water in the 33-degree mug is 'm'. The temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug will be (33 - (4/m) * (33 - x)) degrees.

However, we can simplify this problem by using the fact that the temperature of the water in the bottle will be the average of the temperatures of the two mugs after pouring. 

The average temperature of the two mugs after pouring is ((33 - (4/m)) + (x - 1)) / 2.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the average temperature of the two mugs after pouring must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality:

((33 - (4/m)) + (x - 1)) / 2 >= 40

To simplify the inequality, we can multiply both sides by 2:

(33 - (4/m)) + (x - 1) >= 80

Now, let's simplify the inequality by combining like terms:

x + 32 - (4/m) - 1 >= 80

Combine the constants:

x + 31 - (4/m) >= 80

Now, let's isolate x by subtracting 31 from both sides:

x - (4/m) >= 49

Now, let's add (4/m) to both sides:

x >= 49 + (4/m)

Since we don't know the mass of the water, we can't find the exact value of x. However, we can find the minimum value of x by assuming the mass of the water is very large (i.e., m is very large).

In this case, the term (4/m) approaches 0, and the inequality becomes:

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can find out how many sunflowers were sold per day through bouquets by multiplying the number of bouquets sold per day by the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.

Sunflowers sold per day through bouquets = Bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers in each bouquet
Sunflowers sold per day through bouquets = 7 * 12
Sunflowers sold per day through bouquets = 84

Now, we can find out the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold through individual sales and bouquet sales.

Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers sold per day + Sunflowers sold per day through bouquets
Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84
Total sunflowers sold per day = 97

Finally, we can find out the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days by multiplying the total sunflowers sold per day by 3.

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 * 3
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 291

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can divide $100 by $5 to get the total number of rocks:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:

Total cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Total cost = 20 * 5
Total cost = 100

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:

Let's start by finding out how many seashells Carrey collected. We know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. If we let x be the number of seashells Carrey collected, then Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can set up the equation:

27 = 2x + 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:

22 = 2x

Next, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now that we know Carrey collected 11 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so:

Carlos collected 2x = 2(11) = 22 seashells.

We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide the total number of seashells (27 + 22 + 11 = 60) equally among the three people. To do this, we can divide 60 by 3:

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of the daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 times more juices for each person.

So, for 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 times more energy than what 2300 people can get from the juices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

Since each person needs 5 times more juices, and Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many times 4200 can be multiplied by 5 to get the total number of bottles needed.

Step 2: We know that half the mural is yellow, which means the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used, which is 12 pints. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Step 3: The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, which is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation: 3x + 6 = 12.

Step 4: To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 12 - 6, which simplifies to 3x = 6.

Step 5: Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x: x = 6 / 3, which simplifies to x = 2.

After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he has 20 bills worth $60 each, which is a total of 20 * 60 = $1200.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money ($1200) by the value of each 5 dollar bill ($5). 

1200 / 5 = 240

1175,"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

Initially, the teacher had a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used up 45% of the chalk. 

First, let's find out how much chalk was used on Monday:
45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Now, let's find out how much chalk is left after Monday:
5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days he can use the chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. Let's find out how much chalk is used each day:
20% of 5 inches = 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch

Now, let's find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches:
(2.75 inches - 2 inches) / 1 inch = 0.75 days

However, since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because even if the chalk is 2 inches or smaller at the end of the day, the teacher will still use some of it.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Since there are 12 boys, one-fourth of them would be 12 / 4 = 3 boys on varsity.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24 students.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

First, let's simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Now, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)

Expanding the left-hand side of the equation:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, let's move all the terms with C to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:

75 - 35 = 5C - 3C

Simplifying the equation:

40 = 2C

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for C:

We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500.

$27000 / $500 = 54

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with $27000. 

Now, to find out the total number of books, we multiply the number of sets by the number of books in each set.

54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 4 sets of 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he builds 20 / 4 = 5 snowballs.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net change in the number of snowballs every 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing 60 by 3 (the net change every 15 minutes).

60 / 3 = 20

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 15 to get the total time.

Let's assume the age of Jim at that time is 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, John's age at that time would be '2x'.

We know that John is 28 now, and 20 years have passed since Digimon was first released. So, 20 years ago, John's age would be 28 - 20 = 8.

Since John's age 20 years ago was 8, and John's age at that time was '2x', we can set up the equation:

2x = 8

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was first released.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which means they had 2 * 50 = 100 bandages from the new packs. Adding this to the 103 bandages they already had, they had a total of 103 + 100 = 203 bandages before ordering the new packs.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They must have had 203 bandages before using these bandages, so they had 203 + 28 = 231 bandages at the end of the second day.

On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of bandages, which means they had 50 bandages from the new pack. They used 38 bandages, so they must have had 50 + 38 = 88 bandages at the end of the first day.

Since the two-story house is 420 inches high, and the first floor's floor to ceiling height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor from the ground would be 180 inches. 

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the two-story house: 
420 - 180 = 240 inches

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
1204,"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the total shells, we multiply 700 by 0.4.
   700 * 0.4 = 280 shells found by team Alphas.

2. Now, we need to find out how many shells are remaining after team Alphas found their share. We subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total shells.
   700 - 280 = 420 shells remaining.

3. Next, we find out how many shells team The finders found. Since they found 60% of the remaining shells, we multiply 420 by 0.6.
   420 * 0.6 = 252 shells found by team The finders.

4. Now, we need to find out how many shells are remaining after team The finders found their share. We subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells.
   420 - 252 = 168 shells remaining.

5. Since team Gogetters found the remaining shells, we can say that team Gogetters found 168 shells.

1205,"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then subtract that from the average miles walked by all four dogs.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

The average miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs, the total average miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total average miles walked by all four dogs.

Miles walked by the last dog = Total average miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
= 12 - 8
= 4 miles.

First, let's add up the weights of the three tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The last tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Now, let's multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram of tuna:

1208,"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 
Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 
So, the selling price is 11/8 * $72.

To find 11/8 of $72, we multiply $72 by 11 and then divide by 8.

First, multiply $72 by 11:
$72 * 11 = $792

Then, divide by 8:
$792 / 8 = $99

So, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $99 - $72
Profit = $27

1209,"To find the total amount of water removed from the air, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is:
1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters/day. Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is:
2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters/day. Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is:
4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting to find the total amount of water removed:

Capacity of Ali's class = 120 students
Capacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) * 120
Capacity of one of John's classes = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes. The interest rate is 2% of the money he borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300
= 0.02 * $300
= $6

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will pay in the first 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months.

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11
= $275

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount, including the interest, that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

Remaining amount = Total interest + Total amount paid in 11 months
= $6 + $275
= $281

However, we also need to consider the remaining principal amount that Stephen still owes after paying $25 per month for 11 months. 

Remaining principal = Principal - Total amount paid in 11 months
= $300 - $275
= $25

Now, let's calculate the interest on the remaining principal amount for 1 month.

Interest on remaining principal = 2% of $25
= 0.02 * $25
= $0.50

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

Total amount in twelfth month = Remaining principal + Interest on remaining principal
= $25 + $0.50
= $25.50

However, we also need to consider the remaining amount that Stephen still owes after paying $25 per month for 11 months.

1215,"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to find the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. 

In this case, the volume of the jar is V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have a volume of 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the volume of the jar by the volume of a single jelly bean. However, we need to account for the packing efficiency.

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume of the jar for packing jelly beans is 0.8 * 540 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

1216,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people on the bus after each stop and then find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became:
20 (initial people) + 40 (new people) = 60

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is:
(3/4) * 40 = 30

So, the total number of people on the bus became:
60 (previous people) + 30 (new people) = 90

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became:
90 (previous people) * 2 = 180

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are:
200 (capacity) - 180 (current people) = 20

Therefore, 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + ($2 * 150/100) = $2 + $3 = $5. Since Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year, the new cost per year is $5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is $15 * 3 = $45.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, and this includes both strawberry and blueberry cubes. We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Let's denote the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. 

We can write the equation for the total number of ice cubes as:
s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write the equation for the number of blueberry cubes as:
b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 's':
s + (5s - 4) = 116
Combine like terms:
6s - 4 = 116
Add 4 to both sides:
6s = 120
Divide both sides by 6:
s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting 's' into the equation for 'b':
b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

So Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight. So, the number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

In total, there are 16 small candles and 20 medium candles. Since we want to know the total number of candles, we add them together: 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 40.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice that long, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

However, we need to consider that once you get the 5th side, you have all 6 sides. So, the time for the 5th and 6th sides is actually the same as the time for the 4th and 5th sides. We should add the time for the first 4 sides and then add the time for the 5th and 6th sides which is the same as the 4th and 5th sides.

So, the correct calculation is:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes
Since the 6th side takes the same time as the 5th side, we don't need to add any extra time.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We are given that the main phone plan costs $20, which includes the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. Since there are 4 additional phones, the total cost of the additional phones is 4x.

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones, which is 2x + 4x = 6x.

We are given that the main phone plan costs $20, so we can set up the equation 6x = 20 to find the value of x.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles. This means Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron's speed is A = 2V, we can find Aaron's speed by dividing the distance he ran by the time it took him to run that distance. 

Aaron's speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed by dividing Aaron's speed by 2, since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.

Vanessa's speed = Aaron's speed / 2 = (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by dividing the distance she ran by her speed.

Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16) miles per minute = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
1311,"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. 

Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock (200 feet) by the amount of line needed per foot of dock (3 feet).

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

This means the caretaker needs a total of 600 feet of line for the 200 feet of dock. However, he already has 6 feet of new line. 

To find out how many feet of line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount of line he already has (6 feet) from the total amount of line required (600 feet).

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

1312,"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Number of meals per reservation: 2
- Cost of each meal: $5
- Number of bottles of wine per reservation: 1
- Cost of each bottle of wine: $5

Daily revenue from meals: 6 reservations * 2 meals * $5 = 6 * 2 * 5 = $60
Daily revenue from wine: 6 reservations * $5 = 6 * 5 = $30
Total daily revenue: $60 + $30 = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:

Weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180

1313,"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost price of all the watermelons. 

The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Now, we need to find the cost price of each watermelon. 

Cost price of each watermelon = Total cost price / Number of watermelons
Cost price of each watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of each watermelon = $1.6

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. 

The profit percentage is 25%. 

Profit = Cost price * Profit percentage
Profit = $1.6 * 25%
Profit = $1.6 * 0.25
Profit = $0.4

Selling price of each watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of each watermelon = $1.6 + $0.4
Selling price of each watermelon = $2

1314,"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we know that James is 18 years old and he was born when John was 19. To find John's current age, we need to add the age difference between John and James. John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

Next, we need to find the current age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the current age of John's youngest son, we need to subtract the age difference between John and his youngest son from John's current age. The age difference is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

So, John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.

Finally, to find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to add 3 to his current age. The age of John's youngest son in 3 years will be 5 + 3 = 8.

Ana peels one orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels one orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane has peeled from the number of oranges Ana has peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

1316,"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. 

80% off means he pays 20% of the original price. 
20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic takes 3 hours to install the radiator at $50 an hour.

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, let's add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find out how much Mark paid in total.

Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
= $80 + $150

1317,"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the total number of animals and the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' the same in both equations:

2c + 2w = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
