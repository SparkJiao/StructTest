This symmetry has been determined through try-crystal phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements. The fourfold oscillation in the thermal conductivity when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO planes can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles.\n\n\u2022 The effect of pinning of vortices plays an important role in determining the correct angle pattern in this kind of measurement. When the angle of the magnetic field is changed, a non-uniform vortex distribution due to pinning forces may appear, leading to hysteresis in the angular patterns of the thermal conductivity. To rule out the influence of this effect, a field-cooled procedure must be used.\n\n\u2022 The angular patterns of the longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures for the twinned and untwinned crystals show a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity as the field is rotated from one direction to another. The phononic contribution to the total thermal conductivity seems to be constant under variations of the magnetic field orientations. The electronic contribution is entirely responsible for the magnetic field dependence, revealed in both thermal conductivity and microwave measurements, indicating against any large phonon-electron scattering.\n\n\u2022 The variation of the thermal conductivity can be explained with a model involving a Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles along with an accurate inclusion of the impurity scattering and/or assuming Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices. The ds affects both the carrier density and the scattering rate of quasiparticles, and the as picture gives rise to a fourfold oscillation in the thermal conductivity as the magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO planes. However, neither as nor ds alone can explain the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation amplitude in the whole field range.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 16, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

However, AMSB models have a well-known problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, leading to tachyonic states. A solution to this problem is to add a universal scalar mass to the AMSB Soft SUSY Breaking (SSB) terms, resulting in the \"minimal\" AMSB model (mAMSB) with a parameter space of m0, m3/2, and sign(\u03bc).\n\n\u2022 An alternative setup for AMSB is Hypercharged Anomaly Mediation (HCAMSB), a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB. In HCAMSB, SUSY breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, and the warping suppresses contributions due to tree-level gravity mediation, allowing anomaly mediation to become the dominant source of SUSY breaking in the visible sector. The bino mass can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation, leading to a small or large perturbation to the spectrum of anomaly mediation.\n\n\u2022 The minimal AMSB model predicts a negative mass squared for sleptons, while pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions, with the hCAMSB SSB contribution parametrized using a dimensionless quantity @xmath2.\n\n\u2022 The hCAMSB model assumes electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively by the large top-quark yukawa coupling, and the SSB terms and superpotential terms are given by the scalar potential minimization conditions. The wino and gluino masses receive a contribution from the bino mass at the two-loop level, and the scalar masses vary with @xmath2 due to the renormalization group equations.\n\n\u2022 The hCAMSB model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if m6 is not too large, due to the presence of charg", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 20, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The invention aims to improve the prior art by providing a simpler and more secure fixing mechanism. The main components of the fixing mechanism include a tool, a tool frame, a bushing-like tool holder, and clamps.\n\nIn the first embodiment, the connecting element in the tool frame is a cylindrical shape with a first connecting surface and a first contact surface. The curvilinear connecting surface is a spherical second connecting surface in the tool holder, which forms part of the outer surface of the tool holder and extends from the second contact surface perpendicular to the mounting direction. The tool frame is arranged to surround the second connecting surface, with the first and second contact surfaces placed against each other in the operational position.\n\nThe invention provides a formula to determine the radius of curvature of the curvilinear surface, which ensures the fixing mechanism functions correctly. The diameter of the inlay of the connecting element in the tool frame should be substantially equal to twice the radius of curvature, with a fit used depending on the tool's purpose. The cross-sectional forms of the tool holder and connecting element are circular.\n\nThe mounting process involves moving the tool frame in an inclined position in relation to the mounting direction, with the clamps fixed in connection with the frame drawing the tool frame towards the tool holder. The tool frame can then be revolved along the connecting surface to the position where the first contact surface and the second contact surface are in contact with and against each other, ready to receive forces in the mounting direction.\n\nThe invention can also be arranged so that a curvilinear surface is formed on the outer surface of the", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 6, "symbol": "*"}}
