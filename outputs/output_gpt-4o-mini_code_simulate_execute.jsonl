Next, `Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each sorted tuple. The counts are:\n   - `(1, 3)` occurs 2 times\n   - `(2, 5)` occurs 2 times\n   - `(3, 6)` occurs 1 time\n\n5.

We call `combinations_with_replacement([\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"], 2)`.\n\nNow, let's compute the combinations:\n\n- The possible combinations of length `2` from the colors are:\n  - (\"Red\", \"Red\")\n  - (\"Red\", \"Green\")\n  - (\"Red\", \"Blue\")\n  - (\"Green\", \"Red\")\n  - (\"Green\", \"Green\")\n  - (\"Green\", \"Blue\")\n  - (\"Blue\", \"Red\")\n  - (\"Blue\", \"Green\")\n  - (\"Blue\", \"Blue\")\n\n6. The result of `combinations_with_replacement` will be a list of these combinations.\n\nSo the final result is:\n<ans>\n[('Red', 'Red'), ('Red', 'Green'), ('Red', 'Blue'), ('Green', 'Red'), ('Green', 'Green'), ('Green', 'Blue'), ('Blue', 'Red'), ('Blue', 'Green'), ('Blue', 'Blue')]\n</ans>", "format_properties": {}}
