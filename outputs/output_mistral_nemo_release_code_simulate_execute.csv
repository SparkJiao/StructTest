     - `eulerian_num(0, 1)` is 1 (base case).
     - `eulerian_num(1, 2)` is 0 (since `m >= n` or `n == 0` is True).

9. After the loop finishes, the function returns the sum of the `amicables` set.

Here's the step-by-step calculation for the first few numbers:

- For `num = 2`, `sum_fact = 1` and `sum_fact2 = 1`. Since `num != sum_fact2`, it's not an amicable number.
- For `num = 3`, `sum_fact = 1` and `sum_fact2 = 1`. Since `num != sum_fact2`, it's not an amicable number.
- For `num = 4`, `sum_fact = 3` and `sum_fact2 = 1`. Since `num != sum_fact2`, it's not an amicable number.
- For `num = 6`, `sum_fact = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6` and `sum_fact2 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. Since `num == sum_fact2` and `num != sum_fact`, it's an amicable number. So, `6` and `6` are added to the `amicables` set.
- For `num = 8`, `sum_fact = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7` and `sum_fact2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. Since `num == sum_fact2` and `num != sum_fact`, it's an amicable number. So, `8` and `7` are added to the `amicables` set.

126_0,"Let's simulate the execution step by step:

1. We are given `a = 10` and `b = 15`.
2. Initialize `sum` to 0.
3. Iterate over the range `1` to `min(a, b)` (which is `10` in this case):
   - For `i = 1`, check if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `1`. They are, so add `1` to `sum`. Now `sum = 1`.
   - For `i = 2`, check if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `2`. They are, so add `2` to `sum`. Now `sum = 3`.
   - For `i = 3`, check if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `3`. They are, so add `3` to `sum`. Now `sum = 6`.
   - For `i = 4`, check if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `4`. They are not, so move to the next iteration.
   - For `i = 5`, check if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `5`. They are not, so move to the next iteration.

   - For `i = 10`, check if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `10`. They are not, so move to the next iteration.
4. The loop ends here as `i` has reached `10`, which is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
5. Return `sum`. So, the final result is `21`.

   - `str_to_list(string)` converts a string to a list of characters.
   - `lst_to_string(List)` converts a list of characters to a string.
   - `get_char_count_array(string)` creates an array of size 256 to store the count of each character in the input string.
   - `remove_dirty_chars(string, second_string)` removes characters from the first string that are present in the second string.

5. Iterate through the list of characters:
   - `ip_ind = 0`, `temp = 'p'`, `count[ord('p')] == 1` (True), so add 'p' to the result list and increment `res_ind`.

The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). This can be written as: c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

   - Calculate the square of `w`: `w*w`
   - Calculate the square of `h`: `h*h`
   - Add these two values together: `w*w + h*h`
   - Take the square root of the result to get the length of the hypotenuse: `math.sqrt(w*w + h*h)`
4. We are given the inputs `w = 7` and `h = 15`. So, we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse as follows:
   - Calculate the square of `w`: `7*7 = 49`
   - Calculate the square of `h`: `15*15 = 225`
   - Add these two values together: `49 + 225 = 274`
   - Take the square root of the result to get the length of the hypotenuse: `math.sqrt(274) ≈ 16.55`

1. Initialize `result_list` as an empty list.
2. Check if `list1` is empty. If it is, return `result_list` (which is empty).

4. While `stack` is not empty:

5. Reverse `result_list`.
6. Return `result_list`.

  - Pop the last element from `[10, 20]`: `20`.
  - `10` is not a list, so append it to `result_list`.
  - `[10, 20]` is not empty, so append it back to `stack`.
- Pop the last element from `stack`: `[40]`.
  - Pop the last element from `[40]`: `40`.
  - `40` is not a list, so append it to `result_list`.
  - `[40]` is empty, so don't append it back to `stack`.
- Pop the last element from `stack`: `[30, 56, 25]`.
  - Pop the last element from `[30, 56, 25]`: `25`.
  - `25` is not a list, so append it to `result_list`.

  - Pop the last element from `[33]`: `33`.
  - `33` is not a list, so append it to `result_list`.
  - `[33]` is empty, so don't append it back to `stack`.
- Pop the last element from `stack`: `[40]`.
  - Pop the last element from `[40]`: `40`.
  - `40` is not a list, so append it to `result_list`.

   - It's not empty, so we proceed.
   - We map `dict_depth` to its values, which are `{'d': {}}`. So we get `[dict_depth({'d': {}})]`.
   - We find the maximum depth of the sub-dictionary. For `{'d': {}}`, it's a dictionary, not empty, and its values are empty, so the depth is `1`.
7. So the maximum depth of the sub-dictionaries is `1`.

3. `d.values()` returns `[{3: {4:'Mon'}}]`. We apply `dict_depth` to each element in this list using `map(dict_depth, d.values())`.
4. For the inner dictionary `{3: {4:'Mon'}}`, we follow the same steps as above:
   - It's a dictionary, so `isinstance(d, dict)` returns `True`.
   - We calculate `max(map(dict_depth, d.values()))` where `d.values()` returns `{[4:'Mon']}`.
   - For the innermost dictionary `{4:'Mon'}`, it's also a dictionary, so `isinstance(d, dict)` returns `True`.
   - Since it's a dictionary with no nested dictionaries, `max(map(dict_depth, d.values()))` returns `0`.
   - So, `dict_depth({3: {4:'Mon'}})` returns `1 + 0 = 1`.
5. Now, we're back to the original call `dict_depth({1: 'Sun', 2: {3: {4:'Mon'}}}})`. We have `max(map(dict_depth, d.values()))` as `1`.

1. The function `remove_uppercase` takes a string `str1` as input.
2. It uses the `re` module's `sub` function to replace all uppercase letters in `str1` with an empty string.
3. The pattern `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter.
4. The function returns the modified string.

Now, let's apply this to the given input `'VoicESeaRchAndreComMendaTionS'`.

1. The input string is `'VoicESeaRchAndreComMendaTionS'`.

   - While `arr[j-1] <= arr[j]`, multiply `current_prod` by `arr[j]` and update `mpis[j]` if `current_prod` is greater than `mpis[j]`. Then increment `j` by 1.
     - In the first iteration of the while loop, we have `arr[j-1] = 4` and `arr[j] = 42`. So, `current_prod = 4 * 42 = 168` and `mpis[j] = 168`.

   - `gaps = len(nums) = 5`
   - `swapped = True`
   - `i = 0`

2. While loop condition: `gaps > 1 or swapped`
   - First iteration: `gaps = int(float(gaps) / shrink_fact) = int(float(5) / 1.3) = 3`
   - `swapped = False`
   - `i = 0`

3. While loop condition: `gaps + i < len(nums)`
   - First iteration: `nums[i] = 41`, `nums[i+gaps] = 32`
   - Since `41 > 32`, swap them: `nums = [32, 41, 15, 19, 22]`
   - `swapped = True`

4. Second iteration of the inner while loop:

   - Since `41 > 15`, swap them: `nums = [32, 15, 41, 19, 22]`
   - `swapped = True`

6. Fourth iteration of the inner while loop:

1. The function `divisor` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It initializes a variable `x` to 0.
3. It then iterates over the range of `n` (i.e., from 0 to `n-1`).
4. In each iteration, it calculates the number of divisors of the current number `i` by checking if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`.
5. It does this by creating a list comprehension that generates a list of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) that are not divisible by `i`.
6. The length of this list is then assigned to `x`.
7. After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `x`.

Now, let's execute this with the given input `9`:

1. Initialize `x` to 0.
2. Iterate over the range of `9` (i.e., from 0 to 8):
   - For `i = 0`, the list comprehension `[i for i in range(1,9+1) if not 9 % i]` generates an empty list, so `x` remains 0.
   - For `i = 1`, the list comprehension generates the list `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, so `x` becomes 8.
   - For `i = 2`, the list comprehension generates the list `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, so `x` becomes 7.
   - For `i = 3`, the list comprehension generates the list `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, so `x` becomes 6.
   - For `i = 4`, the list comprehension generates the list `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, so `x` becomes 5.
   - For `i = 5`, the list comprehension generates the list `[6, 7, 8, 9]`, so `x` becomes 4.
   - For `i = 6`, the list comprehension generates the list `[7, 8, 9]`, so `x` becomes 3.
   - For `i = 7`, the list comprehension generates the list `[8, 9]`, so `x` becomes 2.
   - For `i = 8`, the list comprehension generates the list `[9]`, so `x` becomes 1.
3. After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `x`, which is 1.
