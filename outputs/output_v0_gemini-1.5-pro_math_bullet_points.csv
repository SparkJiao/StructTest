So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - 12 - 4 = 4.


**Step 2** Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100%.
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100%
Percentage = (4 / 20) * 100%

Let 'x' be the number of fries remaining after the seagull ate.  We don't know this number yet, but we know what happened next. The raccoon stole two-thirds of these fries, and one fry was left for the ants, with five remaining after that.  This means 1 + 5 = 6 fries represents one-third of 'x'.

Brinley needs an average of 93 after dropping one test score. This means she needs a total of 93 * 5 = 465 points across the five highest scores.


**Step 2** Consider the case where the last test is the lowest score.**

If Brinley scores lower than 71 on the last test, her lowest score will still be 71.  Her current total is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.  She would need 465 - 367 = 98 points on the last test to reach an average of 93. Since 98 > 71, this scenario is not possible.


**Step 3** Consider the case where the last test is not the lowest score.**

If Brinley scores higher than 71, her lowest score will be 71.  To get an average of 93, the sum of her five best scores must be 93 * 5 = 465.  The sum of her current four best scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.  Therefore, she needs 465 - 367 = 98 on the last test.


**Step 4** Verify the result.**

If Brinley scores 98 on the last test, her scores will be 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, and 98.  Dropping the lowest score (71), the remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, 86, and 98.  The sum of these scores is 465.  The average is 465 / 5 = 93.

279,"# Solving Age Problem

1. Define variables:

Let 'r' be Ruby's current age and 's' be Sam's current age.


2. Set up the first equation:

Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so  r = 6s


3. Set up the second equation:

In 9 years, Ruby will be r + 9 years old and Sam will be s + 9 years old. At that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.  So, r + 9 = 3(s + 9)


4. Simplify the second equation:

Expand the second equation: r + 9 = 3s + 27


5. Substitute the first equation into the simplified second equation:

Substitute r = 6s into r + 9 = 3s + 27:  6s + 9 = 3s + 27


6. Solve for s:

Subtract 3s from both sides: 3s + 9 = 27
Subtract 9 from both sides: 3s = 18
Divide both sides by 3: s = 6


7. Find Ruby's current age:

Substitute s = 6 into r = 6s: r = 6 * 6 = 36


8. Check the solution:

Currently, Ruby is 36 and Sam is 6 (36 = 6 * 6).
In 9 years, Ruby will be 36 + 9 = 45 and Sam will be 6 + 9 = 15 (45 = 3 * 15).

The horse runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance covered is: (32 miles/hour) * (0.5 hour) = 16 miles


**Step 2** Calculate the amount of hay consumed.

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.  Since the horse runs 16 miles, the total hay consumed is: 16 miles * (0.5 bail/mile) = 8 bails


**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3.  The horse consumed 8 bails, so the total cost is: 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Hannah burns 600 calories/hour running and does it for 1 hour. So, she burns 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.


**Step 3** Calculate total calories burned.

Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.


**Step 4** Calculate the amount of water needed.

Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.  She burned 1600 calories.  Therefore, she needs (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
Let 'r' represent the number of red jelly beans.
Let 'g' represent the number of green jelly beans.


### 2. Express r and g in terms of b

The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans: r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b
The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans: g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b


### 3. Set up an equation

The total number of jelly beans is 4500: r + b + g = 4500


### 4. Substitute and solve for b

Substitute the expressions for r and g from step 2 into the equation from step 3:
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
3b = 4500
b = 1500


### 5. Calculate r and g

r = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
g = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515


### 6. Find the difference between g and r

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is: g - r = 1515 - 1485 = 30

Pork took 20 minutes longer to cook than rice, and rice took 30 minutes.  Therefore, pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.


**Step 2** Calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.


**Step 3** Calculate the time it took to cook beans.

Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, which is 80/2 = 40 minutes.


**Step 4** Calculate the total cooking time for all the food.

The total cooking time is the sum of the time it took to cook each food item: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

Let 's' be the number of sheep and 'g' be the number of geese.


2. Set up equations based on the given information:
Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we have the equation: 4s + 2g = 70.
Each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20, so we have the equation: s + g = 20.


3. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:
From the second equation, we can express g in terms of s: g = 20 - s.


4. Substitute the expression for 'g' into the first equation:
Substitute g = 20 - s into the equation 4s + 2g = 70:  4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.


5. Simplify and solve for 's':
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15


6. Find the number of geese:
Substitute s = 15 back into the equation g = 20 - s: g = 20 - 15 = 5.


7. Check the solution:
15 sheep have 15 * 4 = 60 legs.
5 geese have 5 * 2 = 10 legs.
Total legs: 60 + 10 = 70.
Total heads: 15 + 5 = 20.

* First, we need to convert Topher's shoe length to inches.
* There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 8 feet is equal to $8 \times 12 = 96$ inches.
* Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is $96 + 4 = 100$ inches.

<br/>
<br/>

### 2
* Let $b$ be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.
* We are given that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
* We can write this as an equation: $100 = 9b + 10$.

<br/>
<br/>

### 3
* Now we solve for $b$:
* Subtract 10 from both sides: $100 - 10 = 9b + 10 - 10$, which simplifies to $90 = 9b$.
* Divide both sides by 9: $\frac{90}{9} = \frac{9b}{9}$, which simplifies to $10 = b$.

<br/>
<br/>

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

1. Calculate the number of students who like to play music:
The number of students who like music is twice the number who like basketball.  There are 5 students who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = 10 students like music.


2. Calculate the number of students who like either baking, basketball, or music:
10 students like baking + 5 students like basketball + 10 students like music = 25 students.


3. Calculate the number of students who like either video games or music:
The total number of students is 50.  25 students like baking, basketball, or music. Therefore, 50 - 25 = 25 students like either video games or music.


4. Since all the remaining students like either video games or music, and we know how many like music, we can find the number who like video games:
25 students like either video games or music, and 10 students like music.  Therefore, 25 - 10 = 15 students like video games.

* There are 12 months in a year.
* Therefore, Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges in a year.


**Step 2** Calculate the number of badges Amber earns in a year.

* Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge.
* This means Amber earns half as many badges as Claire in the same time frame.
* So, Amber earns 12 badges / 2 = 6 badges in a year.


**Step 3** Calculate the number of badges Wendy earns in a year.

* Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire.
* So, Wendy earns 12 badges * 3 = 36 badges in a year.


**Step 4** Calculate the difference in badges earned between Wendy and Amber.

* Wendy earns 36 badges and Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
* The difference is 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges.

We know the total points scored is 45. Bahati scored the most, followed by Dinar, and then Azibo.  We also know the relationships between Bahati's score and the others.


2. Define variables

Let 'b' represent Bahati's score, 'a' represent Azibo's score, and 'd' represent Dinar's score.


3. Set up equations

We can write the given information as equations:

* b + a + d = 45  (Total points)
* b = a + 20   (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* b = d + 10   (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)


4. Express 'd' in terms of 'a'

From the second and third equations, we can express 'd' in terms of 'a':
Since b = a + 20 and b = d + 10, then a + 20 = d + 10.  Therefore, d = a + 10.


5. Substitute into the total points equation

Substitute the expressions for 'b' and 'd' (in terms of 'a') into the first equation:
(a + 20) + a + (a + 10) = 45


6. Simplify and solve for 'a'

Combine like terms: 3a + 30 = 45
Subtract 30 from both sides: 3a = 15
Divide both sides by 3: a = 5

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Vince spent 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes stapling reports.

Vince spent 900 minutes stapling, and each interval is 15 minutes long.  So there are 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since the comet appears every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet again 75 years after he first saw it at age 30.  Therefore, he was 30 + 75 = 105 years old when he saw the comet the second time.


**Step 2** Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time.

Bill saw the comet the second time when he was three times the age his dad was when he first saw the comet. Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.


**Step 3** Calculate the time elapsed between Bill's first viewing and second viewing of the comet.

Since Bill saw the comet the second time at age 90 and his dad saw it the second time at age 105, this means Bill was born 105 - 90 = 15 years after his dad first saw the comet. Since the comet appears every 75 years, this means Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 - 15 = 60 years after his dad first saw it.

### 2. Set up the equation

* The total amount is $1920, which is the sum of the shares of all three people.  Therefore, the equation is: x + (x + $80) + 2 * (x + $80) = $1920

*   The recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
*   Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
*   Therefore, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice (4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon).
*   Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he needs 24 lemons for the 4 gallons (4 cups * 6 lemons/cup).


**Step 2** Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon.**

*   Allen wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart.
*   This means the extra gallon needs twice the amount of lemon juice.
*   A regular gallon uses 1 cup of juice, so the extra gallon needs 2 cups of juice.
*   Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he needs 12 lemons for the extra gallon (2 cups * 6 lemons/cup).


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of lemons.**

*   Tim needs 24 lemons for the initial 4 gallons.
*   He needs an additional 12 lemons for the extra gallon.
