**Step 2** After selling at the green house, she had 2/3 of x left
(because she sold 1/3 at the green house)


**Step 3** After selling 2 more at the red house, she had (2/3x - 2) left


**Step 4** At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so now she has:
(2/3x - 2) / 2 = 1/3x - 1


**Step 5** We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up an equation:
1/3x - 1 = 5

1/3x = 6
x = 18

- Number of dogs: 60
- Ratio of cats to dogs: 2:1
- Number of rabbits: 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats


### 2. Calculate the number of cats

- Since there are two cats for every dog, and we have 60 dogs
- Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
- Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

- Jennie starts with 60 letters needing stamps
- She stamps one-third of these letters
- After stamping, there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile


### 2. Calculate how many letters Jennie stamped

- One-third of 60 letters is 60 ÷ 3 = 20 letters
- Jennie stamped 20 letters


### 3. Determine the number of originally stamped letters

- After stamping, there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile
- Jennie added 20 newly stamped letters to this pile
- To find the original number, subtract the newly stamped letters from the total

* Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 25%
* The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%


### 4. Calculate the percentage difference

* To express how much more likely it is as a percentage, we use:
  (Difference in probabilities / Probability of less likely event) * 100
* (25% / 25%) * 100 = 100%

# 1. Define variables

• Let x be Sam's current age
• Ruby's current age is 6x


# 2. Set up the equation

• In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam
• This can be written as: (6x + 9) = 3(x + 9)


# 3. Solve the equation

• Expand the right side: (6x + 9) = 3x + 27
• Subtract 3x from both sides: 3x + 9 = 27
• Subtract 9 from both sides: 3x = 18
• Divide both sides by 3: x = 6


# 4. Check the solution

• Sam's current age: 6 years
• Ruby's current age: 6 × 6 = 36 years
• In 9 years, Sam will be 15 and Ruby will be 45
• 45 is indeed 3 times 15, confirming our solution

### 1. Understand the initial quantities

- Allan has 40 cannolis initially
- There is twice as much corn as cannolis at the beginning


### 2. Calculate the initial amount of corn

- Initial corn = 2 × Initial cannolis
- Initial corn = 2 × 40 = 80 corns


### 3. Account for the additional cannolis bought

- Allan bought 60 more cannolis
- New total of cannolis = 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis


### 4. Calculate the number of corns after the purchase

- Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis
- Corns bought = 100 - 40 = 60 corns


### 5. Calculate the final amount of corn

- Final corn = Initial corn + Corns bought
- Final corn = 80 + 60 = 140 corns


### 6. Sum up the total of corns and cannolis

- Total = Final corn + New total of cannolis

- Chips cost 40 cents each
- Candy bars cost 75 cents each
- George spent $5 in total
- He bought 3 bags of chips
- He had 1% of his money left


### 2. Calculate the cost of the chips

- Cost of chips = 3 × $0.40
- Cost of chips = $1.20


### 3. Calculate the remaining money after buying chips

- Remaining money = $5.00 - $1.20

- Matt's dad allows him to have cookies based on carrot sticks eaten
- The cookie allowance is half the number of carrot sticks, plus two extra
- Matt wants to eat five cookies in total


### 2. Set up the equation

- Let x be the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat
- Cookie allowance = (x ÷ 2) + 2
- We want this to equal 5 cookies


### 3. Solve the equation

- 5 = (x ÷ 2) + 2
- 3 = x ÷ 2 (subtract 2 from both sides)
- 6 = x (multiply both sides by 2)

### 1. Determine Jame's current age

- Jame will be 27 in 5 years
- So, his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old


### 2. Calculate Jame's age in 8 years

- Jame is currently 22 years old
- In 8 years, he will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old


### 3. Determine the cousin's age in 8 years

- The cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years
- Twice Jame's age in 8 years: 30 * 2 = 60
- Cousin's age: 60 - 5 = 55 years old

- Items purchased: 1 computer, 2 monitors, 1 printer
- Printer cost: $400 less than the computer
- Computer cost: $1,100


**Step 2** Calculate the cost of the printer

- Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
- Printer cost = $1,100 - $400 = $700


**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of known items

- Known items: Computer and printer

**Step 1** Calculate the total reading time for the first week

- Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights
- Total reading time for the first week = 15 minutes × 7 = 105 minutes


**Step 2** Convert reading speed to pages per minute

- Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes
- Pages per minute = 2 ÷ 1.5 = 1.33 pages/minute


**Step 3** Calculate the number of pages read in the first week

### 1. Understand the given information

- Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe length
- Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches


### 2. Convert Topher's shoe length to inches

- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches
- Total length = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches


### 3. Set up an equation

- Let x be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches
- Topher's shoe length = 9x + 10
- 100 = 9x + 10


### 4. Solve the equation

- Subtract 10 from both sides: 90 = 9x
- Divide both sides by 9: 10 = x


### 5. Check the result

- Topher's shoe length = 9 × 10 + 10 = 100 inches

- The remaining amounts are 1/6, 2/3, and 1/2 respectively


**Step 2** Calculate the remaining length of the first glue stick

- Original length: 12 mm
- Remaining fraction: 1/6
- Remaining length: 12 mm × 1/6 = 2 mm


**Step 3** Calculate the remaining length of the second glue stick

- Original length: 12 mm
- Remaining fraction: 2/3
- Remaining length: 12 mm × 2/3 = 8 mm


**Step 4** Calculate the remaining length of the third glue stick

- Original length: 12 mm
- Remaining fraction: 1/2
- Remaining length: 12 mm × 1/2 = 6 mm


**Step 5** Sum up the total remaining length

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half of the first plane's trips. So, the first plane makes 88 trips per day.

2. Three-quarters of the first plane's flights go to Greece: 88 × 3/4 = 66 flights to Greece.

3. The remaining flights for France and Germany: 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

4. These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each country gets 11 flights.

5. Verification: 66 (Greece) + 11 (France) + 11 (Germany) = 88 total flights for the first plane.

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined


**Step 2** Calculate Chikote's howl duration

- Chikote's howl = 2 × Tobias's howl
- Chikote's howl = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds


**Step 3** Calculate Igneous's howl duration

- Igneous's howl = Tobias's howl + Chikote's howl
- Igneous's howl = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds


**Step 4** Sum up the total howling time in seconds

- Total howling time = Tobias's howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous's howl
- Total howling time = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds


**Step 5** Convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes

- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- Total howling time in minutes = 120 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes

**Step 2** Express the first given relationship mathematically

• Wendy's age is five times Colin's age in 7 years
• y = 5(x + 7)


**Step 3** Express the second given relationship mathematically

• In 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's current age
• x + 25 = y / 3


**Step 4** Substitute the expression for y from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3

• x + 25 = [5(x + 7)] / 3


**Step 5** Solve the equation for x

• 3(x + 25) = 5(x + 7)
• 3x + 75 = 5x + 35
• 75 - 35 = 5x - 3x
• 40 = 2x
• x = 20

• Bob spends $27000 in total
• 100 books cost $500
• To find the total number of books, we need to divide the total amount by the cost per 100 books and multiply by 100

Total books = ($27000 / $500) × 100 = 5400 books


### 2. Determine the number of books per school

• Bob distributes the books equally among 3 schools
• To find the number of books per school, divide the total number of books by 3

Books per school = 5400 / 3 = 1800 books

### 1. Understand the problem
- We need to find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge
- We're given that eight more than four times this number equals 40


### 2. Set up the equation
- Let x be the number of coffee mugs
- The equation is: 4x + 8 = 40


### 3. Solve the equation
- Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
- Divide both sides by 4: x = 8


### 4. Check the solution
- Plug 8 back into the original equation: 4(8) + 8 = 40
- 32 + 8 = 40
- 40 = 40, so our solution is correct

**Step 1** Calculate how many apples Walter ate

- Walter bought 60 apples
- He ate 2/5 of them
- 2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples


**Step 2** Determine how many apples remained after Walter ate some

- Total apples - Eaten apples = Remaining apples
- 60 - 24 = 36 apples remained


**Step 3** Calculate how many apples Walter gave to his sister

- Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples
- 25% of 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples


**Step 4** Determine how many apples Walter had left to sell

- Remaining apples - Apples given to sister = Apples to sell
- 36 - 9 = 27 apples to sell


**Step 5** Calculate how much money Walter received from selling the apples

- Walter sold each apple for $3
- Money received = Number of apples sold * Price per apple
- 27 * $3 = $81
