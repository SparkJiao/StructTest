	• Banking is an inherently risky activity involving extending credit and taking on liabilities.
	• Banking can generate tremendous societal and economic benefits, but banking panics and failures can create devastating losses.
• Over time, a regulatory system designed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks has developed, and both banks and regulation have coevolved as market conditions have changed and different risks have emerged.
	• Congress often considers policies related to the banking industry.

	• The 2008-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy.
	• Many assert only huge and unprecedented government interventions staved off this collapse.
• Others argue that government interventions were unnecessary or potentially exacerbated the crisis.
	• Many argue the crisis revealed that the financial system was excessively risky and the regulatory system had serious weaknesses.

	• Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203; Dodd-Frank Act) in 2010 with the intention of strengthening regulation and addressing risks.
• In addition, U.S. and international bank regulators agreed to the Basel III Accords—an international framework for bank regulation—which called for making certain bank regulations more stringent.
	• In the ensuing years, some observers have raised concerns that the potential benefits of the regulatory changes (better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, etc.) are outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, and slower economic growth).

    • U.S. imports of MPCs have limited trade restrictions, while advocates of stricter controls argue it would benefit domestic producers and raise milk prices.
    • Opponents fear increased costs and higher retail food prices, with major foreign suppliers likely seeking compensation under WTO rules.

• Milk is mostly water, with the remaining 12.6% consisting of milk solids split into fat, protein, lactose, and minerals.
    • Milk protein is primarily casein and whey protein, with MPCs containing both and identified by their protein content.
    • MPCs have wide-ranging applications in the food industry, with different protein levels used in various products.
    • Some food manufacturers prefer MPCs over nonfat dry milk due to better functionality and composition control.

• The U.S. produces minimal casein or milk protein concentrates, with federal dairy policies favoring nonfat dry milk production.

• Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve atrophy.
	• Factors related to glaucoma include high intraocular pressure and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
		• Mller cells, the major type of glial cells in the retina, play a role in supporting retinal neurons and maintaining retinal function.
		• Reactive Mller cells can exacerbate retinal damage by releasing cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
• In a rat model of acute ocular hypertension mimicking glaucoma, treatment with -aminoadipic acid (AAA) inhibited Mller cell gliosis and protected against retinal abnormalities induced by increased intraocular pressure.
	• AAA treatment reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells, rescued the reduced number of ganglion cells, and attenuated Mller cell gliosis and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in the retina.
		• These findings suggest that AAA may be a potential therapeutic target for neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
		• AAA treatment showed protective effects on the retina by promoting survival of retinal ganglion cells through inhibiting Mller cell gliosis and downregulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha production.

	• Factors contributing to the increased prevalence of diabetes in this population include lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications.
	• The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has promoted new avenues of health care delivery, such as health home programs, to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions.
• A behavioral health home (BHH) program was implemented to provide population-based care for individuals with SMI, focusing on identifying abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and providing individualized interventions.
	• The BHH program was embedded in a division of community psychiatry and targeted individuals with SMI enrolled in intensive mental health services.
	• The BHH program identified gaps in care, improved somatic care quality, and led to the diagnosis and management of diabetes and prediabetes in the population.
• Preliminary data from the BHH program showed improvements in HbA1c levels for some patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as the identification of individuals not compliant with recommended guidelines for diabetes monitoring.
	• The program also revealed the need for patient-centered primary care within mental health settings to address the high rates of mortality and morbidity in individuals with SMI.

* Anatomical studies confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective.
	* Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow for studying the tape's configuration in relation to the urethra.
* A cadaveric study compared the relationship between the tape and urethra in inside-out and outside-in approaches using CT scan image analysis.
	* The in-out approach had a more acute angle around the urethra compared to the flatter trajectory of the out-in approach.
* Radiographic visualization showed the tapes lying posterior/dorsal to the urethra and a safe distance from the obturator canal for both techniques.
	* The in-out approach buried the tape deeper inside the internal adductor muscles, while the out-in approach stayed closer to the ischiopubic ramus.
* Clinical implications include the need for careful rotation around the ischiopubic ramus in the in-out passage and full thickness vaginal epithelial layer dissection in the out-in passage.
