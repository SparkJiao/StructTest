1. Import the `sys` module.
2. Define the function `next_smallest_palindrome(num)` that takes an integer `num` as input.
3. Convert the integer `num` to a string `numstr`.
4. Iterate over the range starting from `num+1` to `sys.maxsize`:
    - In the first iteration, check if the current number is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If it is a palindrome, return the number.
5. If no palindrome number is found, the function will keep iterating until it reaches the maximum integer value.

Substitute these values back into the equations:

- `find_lucas(2)` = 1 + 2 = 3

- `find_lucas(4)` = 4 + 3 = 7
