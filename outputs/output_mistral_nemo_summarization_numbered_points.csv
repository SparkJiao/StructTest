1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood.
2. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experiences directed transport, similar to biological systems.
3. Both chaotic and Hamiltonian ratchets have been studied, with chaotic systems being sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes.
4. Mateos proposed a conjecture that current reversals in a chaotic ratchet are correlated with bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior.
5. Barbi and Salerno argued against Mateos' conjecture, showing current reversals without bifurcations and proposing an alternative origin related to stability properties of periodic orbits.
6. The authors of the given document investigate the impact of different ensembles of particles on the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, finding significant dependence on ensemble details.
7. They also show that it is important to discard transients when quantifying the current and discuss the connection between bifurcations and current reversal.
8. The authors find evidence for a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture, where bifurcations are associated with abrupt changes in the current, which may or may not lead to current reversal.

1. The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousands.
2. The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the Z-pole.
3. Taking these achievements into account, the physics of the Higgs boson will again play the central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Higgs factory comes true with the generated Higgs events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP.
4. This factory can be realized in the Gigaz option of the International Linear Collider (ILC) at the energy of 250 GeV.
5. The ILC is a proposed electron-positron collider with tunable energy ranging from 91.2 GeV to 350 GeV and polarized beams in its first phase, and the Gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of the Z boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
6. Given the high luminosity of the Gigaz, about 10^34 Higgs events can be generated in an operational year of 10^7, which implies that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of Higgs decays can be improved from 10^-5 at the LEP to 10^-9 at the Gigaz.
7. In light of this, the Higgs boson properties, especially its exotic or rare decays which are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics, should be investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential in probing new physics.
8. Among the rare Higgs decays, the flavor changing (FC) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics, and it was found that although these processes are severely suppressed in the SM, their branching ratios in new physics models can be greatly enhanced to 10^-5 for lepton flavor violation decays and 10^-4 for quark flavor violation decays.
9. Besides the FC processes, the Higgs decay into light Higgs bosons is another type of rare process that was widely studied, e.g. the decay H→hh (h→bb) with the particle h denoting a light Higgs boson was studied in the 2HDM, the decay H→hh (h→ττ)",1,{'n_points': 9}

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a popular extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale.
2. SUSY predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles, which should have masses below the TeV range and can be discovered at the Tevatron or LHC.
3. The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector is an important problem in SUSY phenomenology.
4. The no-scale type Kähler potential is a scenario where the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings (a-terms) vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes.
5. The minimal scenario, where universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, is severely constrained by direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint.
6. The other two scenarios, where universal gaugino masses are given above the GUT scale or non-universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, are less constrained and can be explored at the Tevatron or LHC.

1. Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with three main types: Bell-nonlocality, EPR steerability, and non-separability.
2. Bell-nonlocality occurs when a state has no local hidden variable (LHV) model, allowing for secure key distribution without trusting devices.
3. EPR steerability is demonstrated when correlations cannot be described by a hybrid LHV local hidden state (LHS) model, enabling the use of untrusted devices in quantum key distribution.
4. Non-separability occurs when a state cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states, with the product states comprising a local hidden state (LHS) model for any measurements undertaken by Alice and Bob.
5. The set of separable states is strictly smaller than the set of non-steerable states, and both are subsets of the set of non-Bell-local states.
6. EPR steerability is a special case of the phenomenon of steering, which occurs when the reduced state of one observer depends on the choice of measurement made by another.
7. The paper investigates the EPR steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals (T-states) when Alice can make arbitrary projective measurements on her qubit.
8. The paper constructs an LHV LHS model that describes measurable quantum correlations for all separable and a large portion of non-separable T-states, with the model coinciding with the optimal LHV LHS model for the case of Werner states.

1. The idea of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information was first mentioned by Richard Feynman in casual conversations around 1985, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates were not proposed until the mid-1990s.
2. Encoding information in spin has potential advantages, including lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and potentially faster operation.
3. In 1994, a scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field was proposed.
4. The system consists of three conduction band electrons, each confined in a semiconductor quantum dot, with exchange interaction allowed only between nearest neighbors.
5. The spin orientation in each quantum dot is a binary variable, either parallel or anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field.
6. The ground state of the array has a specific spin configuration, and the encoding of logic 1 in the upspin state and logic 0 in the downspin state allows for the realization of a NAND gate.
7. However, these spintronic logic gates have a severe shortcoming that precludes their use in pipelined architectures, as the exchange interaction is bidirectional and does not ensure unidirectional flow of logic signals.
8. A solution to this problem is to use a three-phase clock to propagate the input state through a linear array of cells, but this approach has practical challenges, including the need for gate pads between every two cells and significant energy dissipation.
9. Despite these challenges, spin-based devices present interesting physics and have potential applications in quantum computing, where spin coherence times are much larger than charge coherence times, and optical readout techniques have been developed.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary, with the secondary filling its Roche lobe and transferring mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
2. The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors are the lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and the sharp cut-off of the distribution at around 77 minutes.
3. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
4. Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum reach a minimum period at around 65 minutes, but the observed distribution shows no such spike.
5. The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star, while thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius.
6. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate, and in particular by the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum (AM) losses. The paper investigates ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population.

1. The mid-infrared spectral mapping of Stephan's Quintet using the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed a large-scale distribution of warm molecular hydrogen (H2) emission, with a lower limit luminosity of 1.2 x 10^42 erg s^-1 spread over 30 kpc, dominating the mid-infrared emission of the system.
2. In addition to the main shock, there is evidence for another shock-excited feature, the ""H2 bridge,"" which is likely a remnant of past tidal interactions within the group.
3. The spatial variation in the distribution of the H2 0-0 line ratios implies differences in temperature and excitation in the shocked system, which will be explored further in a follow-up paper.
4. The global L(H2)/L(X-ray) ratio in the main shock is ~92, and ~62.5 in the new ""bridge"" feature, indicating that mid-infrared H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-ray emission over the shock structures.
5. This modifies the traditional view that X-ray emission always dominates cooling in the later stages of evolution in compact groups of galaxies.

1. The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, specifically in calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in primitive chondritic meteorites.
2. This suggests that SLRI may have been injected into the presolar cloud or the solar nebula by a supernova or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star shock wave, as a single event that was spatially heterogeneous.
3. Initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGUI) disk through large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles.
4. Other elements and their isotopes suggest a well-mixed solar nebula, but stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous during early planet formation.
5. UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula is the leading explanation for generating oxygen anomalies, with self-shielding leading to isotopic fractionation between gas and solid-phase oxygen atoms.
6. Refractory particles in comet 81P/Wild 2 imply large-scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula, which can be achieved through MGU disks.
7. MGU disk models show that a phase of MGU in disks and stars with a variety of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains.
8. A MGU disk phase driving a FU Orionis outburst is likely to have occurred for the protosun, explaining the relative homogeneity of @xmath4al/@xmath42al ratios and the range of @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios.

3. The Hα profile in Population A is best fit by a single Lorentzian function, while Population B requires two Gaussians (one unshifted and one redshifted).

2. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the ALADIN group, showing a wide plateau at around 5 MeV temperature lasting from 3 to 10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy, which was associated with a possible liquid-gas phase transition.
3. Later experiments by EOS and INDRA obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region absent in most cases, due to factors such as experimental precision and finite-size effects of the caloric curve.
4. Recent reevaluations of the ALADIN group's kinetic energies of emitted neutrons brought corrections of about 10%, and it was proven that the energies of the spectator parts grow by approximately 30% in the bombarding energy interval of 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon.

1. The production of hadrons at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions is traditionally described by a two-step process: a hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.
2. The first step is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second step uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
3. Recent findings show that fragmentation is inadequate for producing particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions, and recombination of partons is more appropriate, especially when soft partons are involved.
4. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
5. The shower parton distributions (SPDs) are determined by solving integral equations that relate them to the known fragmentation functions.
6. The recombination functions (RFs) used in the equations depend on the square of the wave functions of the mesons, which are quantified in the valon model.
7. The SPDs obtained are useful in problems where the knowledge of fragmentation functions alone is not sufficient, such as the interaction between a jet and its surrounding medium or between particles within a jet, which are relevant in nuclear collisions at high energies.
8. The basic hadronization process is recombination, even for fragmentation in vacuum, and the shower parton distributions obtained are model-dependent but useful for studying hadrons produced at intermediate transverse momentum.

4. The formal aspects of Adams' proposal have been thoroughly studied, but the text aims to apply it to the Dirac-Kähler formulation.
5. The Dirac-Kähler formulation is regarded as providing the continuum limit for the staggered fermion formulation used in lattice QCD, and a discrete Dirac-Kähler formulation could offer insights into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice.
6. The text shows how the two lattices of Adams' proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Kähler formulation.
7. The idea of using more than one lattice is extended to describe an exact flavor projection, which necessitates the introduction of two new structures of lattice and a new operator.

1. The @xmath0-invariance of Maxwell's equations was discovered a century ago, but gauge fixing is necessary for quantization, typically using the Lorenz gauge, which breaks @xmath0 invariance.
2. The paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of maintaining @xmath0 invariance during the quantization of the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS).
3. A free field in a CFS can behave like in flat space, and the corresponding Wightman two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts.
4. The work confirms this assertion in the special case of the Maxwell field in de Sitter space, where a new and simple two-point Wightman function was found, having the same physical content as the Allen and Jacobson two-point function.
5. The paper extends the results to general CFS and clarifies the quantum structure of the formalism developed in the previous work.
6. The paper uses Dirac's six-cone formalism, introduces auxiliary fields, and employs the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field.

1. The parallel chip-firing game is a periodic automaton on graphs where vertices, each containing some non-negative number of chips, fire exactly one chip to each of their neighbors if possible.
2. The game has a period, which is the minimal positive integer such that after a certain number of steps, the position repeats, and a transient length, which is the minimal number of steps before the period begins.
3. Bitar and Goles showed that the period of any position on a tree graph is 1 or 2, and Kominers and Kominers showed that all connected graphs satisfying a certain condition have a period of 1.
4. The parallel chip-firing game can simulate a pile of particles that falls whenever there are too many particles stacked at any point, an important problem in statistical physics known as the deterministic fixed-energy sandpile.

1. The text discusses a method for solving the Anderson impurity model in a general multiorbital case using a rational interpolative formula for the self-energy.
2. The method uses a set of linear equations for the coefficients in the interpolative formula, which are determined by forcing the self-energy to obey several limits and constraints.
3. The constraints include the hartree-fock value, the mean number of particles, the zero-frequency value, the quasiparticle mass renormalization, and the positions of the hubbard bands.
4. The method uses the slave boson mean-field (SBMF) approach and the hubbard I approximation to determine the functional dependence of the coefficients upon doping, degeneracy, and the strength of the interaction.
5. The SBFM method is found to predict the parameters of interpolation accurately, while the hubbard I method fails in certain regimes.
6. The interpolative method is compared with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, and the results show a very satisfactory accuracy.
7. The method can be extended by imposing more constraints and using more refined impurity solvers to achieve increased accuracy.
8. The paper concludes that the proposed interpolative approach is a promising method for solving the Anderson impurity model in a general multiorbital case.

1. The study focuses on the phase transitions observed in the surface reaction model proposed by Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad (ZGB), which describes the oxidation of CO over a catalytic surface. The model is modified to include a random distribution of inert sites on the surface.
2. The authors perform mean-field (site and pair approximations) calculations and Monte Carlo simulations for different concentrations of inert sites to determine the phase diagram, spinodal and transition lines, and the critical concentration at which the first-order transition changes into a continuous one.
3. The results show that the presence of inert sites reduces the production of CO2 molecules and shifts the maximum production rate towards the reactive window. The transition between the reactive and CO-poisoned phase is always of first-order in the site and pair approximations, but Monte Carlo simulations give a critical point where the transition changes nature.

1. The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is a crucial measure for understanding their growth and evolution, and unregulated SFR can lead to an overabundance of high-mass galaxies. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of galaxies are thought to play a role in regulating SFR through feedback processes, such as heating or removing gas from the interstellar medium (ISM).
2. The authors present a large sample of 313 nearby Seyfert galaxies selected using ultra-hard X-ray observations with the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and imaged with Herschel/Spire. They find that the global far-infrared (FIR) properties of these galaxies are independent of the orientation of the Seyfert type (Type 1 or Type 2), and the SMBH is unlikely to be strongly affecting the FIR emission at 250, 350, or 500 µm.
3. The authors also find anomalous colors for a subset of galaxies, indicating that the FIR emission in these galaxies is dominated by synchrotron emission from a radio jet rather than thermally heated dust. They speculate that the millimeter excess emission recently seen in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) could be related to coronal emission above the accretion disk.

2. The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance, and it is important to understand how charge transfers between these two parts and the energies at which these transfers occur.
3. The quasiparticle (qp) description is a common way to calculate the addition and removal energies, but it has limitations, especially for molecules on surfaces, where the typical simulation cells have to include several atomic layers of the metal and should be laterally large enough to contain the image charge in full.
4. Constrained density functional theory (CDFT) is a more resource-efficient alternative to calculate the charge transfer energies of an organic molecule physisorbed on an inorganic substrate by avoiding the calculation of a qp spectrum and replacing it with a series of total energy calculations for different charge distributions.
5. The authors use CDFT to study the adsorption of molecules on a 2D metal (graphene) in various configurations and find that the addition and removal energies decrease in absolute value as the molecule is brought closer to the graphene sheet, which can be described with a classical electrostatic model taking into account the true graphene dielectric constant.

2. Observation of any particle in the central exclusive channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers, and by detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately, it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products.
3. The FP420 collaboration has proposed to install detectors in the region 420 m from the interaction points, which would allow the detection of central systems in the approximate mass range 70-140 GeV.
4. The CEP process is shown schematically in Figure [centralexclusive], and for a standard model Higgs boson with a mass of 120 GeV, the dominant decay channel is to a pair of b-quarks, which is very difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches at the LHC due to the large QCD background.

2. Galaxy clustering is a function of both star formation history and luminosity, with low luminosity galaxies showing strong clustering based on color, and luminous galaxies showing strong clustering based on luminosity. For red galaxies, clustering is a non-monotonic function of luminosity, peaking at both high and low luminosities.
3. The study explores the scale dependence of these relationships, finding that the dependence of mean environment on color persists to the lowest luminosities explored, with red, low luminosity galaxies tending to be in overdense regions.
4. At any given point of color and luminosity, a correlation function with a stronger amplitude implies a correlation function with a steeper slope.
5. In regions of a given overdensity on small scales, the overdensity on large scales does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of the galaxies, suggesting that only the masses of the host halos of the galaxies strongly affect their properties.

5. In the pure Hubbard model, the sublattice magnetization interpolates properly between the weak and strong coupling limits, approaching the spin-wave theory (SWT) results as U→∞.
6. For spin vacancies, the quantum spin-fluctuation correction increases with vacancy concentration, and the critical vacancy concentration at which the AF order parameter vanishes is determined.

2. This design enables the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling, which originate from the mechanical motion dependence of extrinsic losses and phase-dependent gradient forces.
3. The system's Hamiltonian includes terms for the cavity field, waveguide, and their interactions with incident pump and stokes fields.
4. The time evolutions of the system's expectation values are solved, and the output field's expectation value is calculated using the input-output relation.
5. Normal mode splitting in output fields is investigated, with a focus on the roots of the denominator of the stokes response.
6. Numerical analysis shows that reactive coupling between the waveguide and cavity leads to normal mode splitting in output fields, with increasing peak separation at higher pump powers.
7. The system also exhibits four-wave mixing, generating an anti-stokes component due to reactive coupling.
8. The study demonstrates the potential of reactive coupling in optomechanical systems for generating nonlinear optical effects.

1. The text discusses recent interest and studies on quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium, focusing on transport properties, especially magnetization transport in low-dimensional spin systems.
2. Earlier studies have shown that transport properties in closed quantum systems differ significantly from their classical counterparts.
3. The article presents a study on the dynamics of transverse magnetization transport in a quantum Ising chain, induced by preparing an initial state with inhomogeneity in transverse magnetization.
4. The system evolves in the presence of a homogeneous and constant external transverse field, and the study aims to determine if the magnetization becomes homogeneous over time and how it relaxes.
5. The initial state is constructed by including two odd-occupation basis states in fermionic momentum space, which have zero eigenvalues.
6. The system does not achieve homogeneous magnetization even after infinite time, and the local magnetization at different sites exhibits two different timescales of oscillation.
7. The smaller timescale contributes insignificant undulations, while the oscillations of the larger timescale exhibit generic power-law decay, with an exponent independent of the external field strength.
8. The absence of thermalization is indicated by the power-law decay, and no scaling form is observed in the large-time limit for this type of initial configuration.
9. The quantum phase transition is manifested in the dynamics in two ways: (i) the frequency of the characteristic oscillation is a monotonic function of the external field in the ordered phase and becomes independent of the field when it crosses the critical value to the disordered phase, and (ii) the transverse magnetization after infinite time at each site shows different functional behavior in the ordered and disordered phase, producing non-analyticity at the critical point.
10. The initial configuration contains several parameters, and all the observed features of the dynamics are valid for arbitrary values of those parameters, indicating that some characteristics of the dynamics are valid for a class of initial configurations despite the integrable Hamiltonian.

1. The debate about the properties of the melting phase transition of two-dimensional (2D) systems has been ongoing for decades.
2. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is the most widely accepted theory for 2D melting, but it assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which contradicts observations.
3. Different studies have reported various types of phase transitions (first order, second order, KTHNY-like) for different systems, leading to incongruity in results.
4. The range of the potential and the dimensionality of the system can affect the formation of a stable hexatic phase.
5. Recent studies suggest that the observation of the hexatic phase is linked to the thermodynamic equilibration of the system, which can take significantly longer for collective relaxations.
6. The authors performed microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D Yukawa system and found that the equilibration time strongly depends on the measured quantity, with local properties equilibrating faster than long-range correlations.

1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4,100 planetary candidates in 3,200 systems, with many being super-Earths to mini-Neptunes, a type not found in our solar system. The transition from rocky to non-rocky planets occurs near a radius of 4 R⊕ and is very sharp.
2. If stars are assumed to be single and no companion vetting is performed, the planetary radii are underestimated on average by a factor of 1.5, corresponding to an overestimation of the planet bulk density by a factor of 1.7. This is due to the presence of undetected stellar companions, which can dilute the observed transit depths.
3. Radial velocity and high-resolution imaging vetting can significantly reduce the mean planetary radius correction factor. For Kepler targets, the factor is reduced to 1.1, and for K2 and TESS targets, which are on average 10 times closer, the factor is further reduced to 1.05. This is because the vetting reduces the fraction of undetected companions.

1. The range of HI column densities in nearby galaxies is similar to those seen in Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (DLAs), but mapping HI gas in DLAs is currently impossible due to technological limitations.
2. DLAs are typically identified as absorbers in background quasar spectra, which is not distance-dependent, unlike 21-cm emission observations.
3. There are now around 100 DLA galaxies known at z<0.5, spanning a wide range in galaxy properties.
4. A statistical study using 21-cm emission line surveys shows that the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate of low and intermediate redshift DLAs, with no need for hidden low surface brightness galaxies or isolated HI clouds.
5. Most of the HI mass at z=0 is in column densities around 10^20.5 cm^-2, which seems to be the case at higher redshifts as well.
6. The expected median impact parameter of DLA systems is around 8 kpc, making high spatial resolution imaging programs necessary for successful identification of DLA host galaxies.

1. The vast majority of stars are thought to form in star clusters, with only a modest percentage of gas turned into stars initially.
2. During the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud into a star cluster, the gas is eventually expelled due to stellar winds and supernovae explosions, leaving the cluster out of equilibrium.
3. The paper presents observations and models of the luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters in nearby starburst galaxies: M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1.
4. The observed luminosity profiles of these clusters show an excess of light at large radii compared to analytical profiles like King and Elson, Fall, & Freeman.
5. The authors use N-body simulations to model the effects of gas expulsion on star clusters and find that the simulations also exhibit an excess of light at large radii due to stars escaping during violent relaxation.
6. The authors suggest that the excess light at large radii in the observed clusters is a signature of rapid gas removal and that these clusters are not in dynamical equilibrium.
7. The authors also note that mass estimates based on the assumption of stellar virial equilibrium may be wrong by a factor of up to three for clusters that have undergone rapid gas expulsion.
8. The observations and simulations presented in the paper support the idea of ""infant mortality"" in young star clusters, where low-effective star formation efficiency leads to the rapid dissolution of clusters.
9. The authors plan to further explore the dynamical state of young clusters in future work to constrain the star-formation efficiency within the clusters.

1. Dyadic data is common in psychosocial and behavioral studies, with many social phenomena being interpersonal by definition.
2. Members of dyads often influence each other's cognitions, emotions, and behaviors, leading to interdependence in a relationship.
3. The primary objective of relationship research is to understand the interdependence of individuals within dyads and how the attributes and behaviors of one dyad member impact the outcome of the other.
4. Many studies measure dyadic outcomes over time, resulting in longitudinal dyadic data.
5. Repeated measures on each subject and within-dyad correlation are two complications when analyzing longitudinal dyadic data.
6. The proposed method accounts for these two types of correlations simultaneously by using a random-effects transition model and dyad-specific random effects.
7. The method also addresses the missing data problem caused by dropout, which is often nonignorable or informative in psychosocial dyadic studies.
8. The dropout process is modeled using a discrete-time survival model, which is linked to the longitudinal measurement process through a selection model.
9. The method uses a data augmentation approach to handle the complex missing data problem caused by dropout and interdependence within dyads.

3. The length spectra were compared to the theoretical predictions using the 2D trace formula and the 2D approximation.
4. The experimental length spectra showed good agreement with the theoretical predictions, and the contributions of different periodic orbits (pos) could be identified.
5. The peak positions in the experimental length spectra were slightly shifted from the lengths of the pos, and this shift was attributed to two effects: the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and a systematic error in the 2D approximation.
6. The dispersion of the effective index of refraction was found to play an important role in the shift of the peak positions.
7. The semiclassical trace formula was found to be imprecise for pos with angles of incidence close to the critical angle, and higher-order corrections were needed for these cases.
8. The comparison of the experimental length spectra with the exact trace formula for the 2D dielectric circle resonator showed that the exact trace formula had larger peak amplitudes and slightly different peak positions compared to the semiclassical trace formula.

2. The rate at which DNS coalescences occur in the local universe is uncertain, but a previous investigation predicted a detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo, respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations.

Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods were performed to determine the critical redshift beyond which the duty cycle condition required to have a continuous background is satisfied, focusing on the few thousand seconds before the last stable orbit is reached, when more than 96% of the GW energy is released.

1. Left-handed metamaterials (LHMs) have attracted attention due to their negative refractive index and various applications in optics and microelectronics.
2. In 1D disordered metamaterials, the presence of negative refraction suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths.
3. Previous studies have reported a sixth power dependence of the localization length with wavelength under refractive-index disorder, instead of the usual quadratic behavior.
4. The authors numerically calculate the localization length of light in 1D arrangements of layers with alternating refractive indices and thicknesses, introducing positional disorder by randomly shifting layer boundaries.
5. They analyze two types of stacks: homogeneous (H) stacks composed of traditional right-handed materials and mixed (M) stacks with alternating LH and RH layers.
6. For H stacks, the localization length shows a quadratic dependence on wavelength for long wavelengths and saturates for shorter wavelengths. It is modulated by the transmission bands and is practically independent of disorder in the first gap.
7. For low-disordered M stacks and wavelengths much greater than the grating period, the localization length depends linearly on wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.
8. In both H and M stacks with non-symmetric band distributions, the localization length has an irregular form in the transmission spectrum, with changes more sensitive in M stacks.

2. Detailed timing analysis has revealed that the CV is orbited by two planets: a 5.7 Earth-mass planet in a 0.04 AU orbit with an eccentricity of 0.26, and a more massive (7.6 Earth-mass) planet in a wider (0.12 AU) and more eccentric (0.42) orbit.
3. Although the two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year timescale, a small fraction of numerical simulations exhibit long-term stability, with the inner planet's orbit being particularly stable.
4. The presence of these planets allows for a precision reconstruction of the CV's evolution and the history of the inner binary, even though the existence of these planets remains debated.
5. The original binary likely lost more than half its mass during the common-envelope phase, reducing the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude, making it challenging for planets to survive.

2. The Fermi surface (FS) in FeBS consists of two hole sheets around the Γ point and two electron sheets around the M and A points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ), with nesting between these two groups leading to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
3. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure, with the random-phase approximation spin fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach giving an extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets, and orbital fluctuations promoting a sign-preserving d-wave symmetry.
4. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure, with a well-defined peak in neutron spectra appearing only at or around the wave vector Q, which is the spin resonance appearing due to the sign-changing gap state.
5. The peak frequency in INS is less than the indirect gap scale, which is determined by the sum of gaps on two different FS sheets connected by the scattering wave vector Q, confirming that it is the true spin resonance and the superconducting state has the sign-changing gap structure.

1. The presence of impurities in a quantum system significantly modifies its spectrum, coherence, and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, impurities lead to exponential localization in 1D and 2D, while a mobility edge exists in 3D.
2. Correlated disorder can introduce delocalized states in the spectrum. This has been demonstrated in 1D using the random dimer model (RDM) and the dual random dimer model (DRDM). In 2D, the effect of correlations is less explored, with studies focusing on speckle potentials and pseudo-2D random dimer lattices.
3. The authors introduce a 2D generalization of the DRDM, where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites. They show that, in the non-interacting regime, there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized.
4. The authors then consider the case of a weakly interacting Bose gas confined on such a potential. Within a Gutzwiller approach, they show that the disorder induces a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength, and enhances both in correspondence with the resonance energy of the 2D-DRDM single-particle Hamiltonian.
5. The dependence of these quantities on the interaction strength can be explained by including the effect of the healing length in the resonance condition discussion.

2. A plausible explosion model for SNe Ia is the accreting white dwarf (WD) model, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from its companion star, increases its mass, and eventually explodes.
3. The accreting WD model has been improved by considering the stellar wind from the WD while it accretes material, leading to two main evolutionary paths for SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel.
4. The companion stars that lead to SNe Ia according to this model have not been confirmed by observations, requiring the identification of the companion star near the explosion site.
5. A study by @xcite argued that a G2IV star (Tycho G) was identified as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) based on its velocity and distance, although the thick disk star alternative is considered unlikely due to the low expected stellar mass in the vicinity.

In the special case of resonance, a maximally entangled bell state is achieved, but the approach to the steady state takes place over an infinite amount of time.
2. Quantum trajectory theory is used to analyze the conditional evolution of the qubit system to understand the dynamical creation of entanglement in the general case and to explain the infinitely slow approach to the steady state in the special case. The conditional dynamics exhibit a distinct bimodality, where the approach to the bell state is only one of two possibilities for the asymptotic evolution: the second is an entangled-state cycle, where the qubits execute a sustained stochastic switching between two bell states.
3. The entanglement of the cascaded qubit system is contextual, meaning that it depends on the specific measurement made on the environment. In a thought experiment, an observer (Eve) can measure the photons in a black box containing the system's output, revealing the state of the qubits and creating entanglement between them. However, the entanglement facilitated by Eve's measurements is contextual, as there are many other ways she could choose to measure her state, each producing a different unravelling of the qubit system and yielding a different value of entanglement.

1. The unification scheme of AGN explains the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN by angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region.
2. The obscuring dusty medium, commonly referred to as the ""dust torus,"" is optically and geometrically thick and extends from sub-parsec scales outward to several tens of parsecs.
3. The dust in the torus absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the received energy in the infrared.
4. Observations show that Type 1 AGN exhibit significantly more emission in the near-infrared than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity.
5. The anisotropy in the infrared emission of AGN may introduce a bias towards Type 1s over Type 2s in flux-limited infrared samples.
6. The authors use a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars at z~0.5 to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared.
7. They find that the ratio of Type 1 to Type 2 AGN emission decreases from 20 to 2 at wavelengths from 2 to 8 µm, increases slightly within the 10 µm silicate feature, and becomes more isotropic at longer wavelengths.
8. The intrinsic ratio between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN is ~1.4 at 15 µm.
9. The observed anisotropy is consistent with expectations from clumpy torus models without fine-tuning parameters.
10. The results suggest that the observed anisotropy is a measure of the intrinsic anisotropy of luminous Type 1 and Type 2 AGN at z~0.5.

1. Gas-rich galaxies exhibit highly structured HI distributions, marked by cavities, shells, and supershells, which are thought to be driven by internal or external processes.
2. The internal source model involves starbursts, driving stellar winds and subsequent supernova explosions, while the external source hypothesis invokes infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies.
3. The jet-ISM interaction scenario proposes that radio jets ejected during an active nuclear phase in the life of a large spiral galaxy could inflate out of the disk exceptionally large shells, i.e., supershells of neutral hydrogen gas.
4. This model can account for each of the several features enumerated in the study of NGC 3556, including the duality of the expanding HI supershells, their locations at the opposite edges of the disk, their z-symmetric deviations from spherical symmetry, and their anomalously large energy requirements.
5. The energy requirement is no longer a major issue in the present model, as even a modest energy input from a compact object at the galactic nucleus is more than adequate to supply the input energy required for the supershells.

This is useful for eavesdropping on quantum communication channels, where an eavesdropper (Eve) might only be interested in a specific part of the transmitted information.

1. The nature of dark matter remains one of the outstanding questions in modern astrophysics, with the cold dark matter cosmological model suggesting a major component in the form of an elementary particle. However, the inventory of baryons observed locally falls short of the total inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations, leaving open the possibility that there may be a significant baryonic component of dark matter.
2. The success of the cold dark matter cosmological model argues strongly for a major component of the dark matter being in the form of an elementary particle, but the lack of a direct detection of any of the candidate dark matter particles means that some authors have proposed models that include a large component of baryonic dark matter, such as cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds.

3. The nanotube-nanotube junction resistance is much larger than the nanotube resistance itself, making the network a system with randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport.
4. For sub-monolayer networks, the junction resistance dominates the overall resistance, and the network resistance shows percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence.
5. For thicker films with tens of nanometers in thickness, the conductance through the metallic tubes dominates the conduction, leading to metallic behavior of the overall resistance.

1. Topological properties of time-reversal invariant band insulators have been extensively studied, with a focus on topological insulators characterized by non-trivial topological invariants.
2. The stability of the topological Mott insulator (TMI) phase in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been examined using mean-field calculations and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method.
3. The long-period charge density wave (CDW) state with a 6-sublattice unit cell was found to be much more stable than previously estimated CDW states with smaller unit cells.
4. The TMI phase can be stabilized by suppressing the fermi velocity at the Dirac point, which can be achieved by introducing third-neighbor hopping in the honeycomb lattice.
5. The VMC method was used to study the stability of the TMI phase, taking into account quantum fluctuations and competing orders, such as the CDW and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases.
6. The on-site Coulomb repulsion was found to decrease the value of the TMI order parameter but did not destroy the stability of the TMI phase.
7. The realization of TMI in real materials, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), was discussed, with a focus on controlling the fermi velocity and effective Coulomb repulsions using dielectric substrates and adatoms.
8. The single-particle excitation gap induced by the TMI was estimated to be up to 0.1 eV, which is substantially larger than room temperature.

1. The text discusses the problem of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2D), with a focus on the scattering of dipoles due to their long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. The authors present a method for analyzing such scattering, based on a previous method for few-dimensional scattering, and apply it to two specific problems: scattering on a cylindrical potential with an elliptical base, and 2D dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles.
2. The method involves representing the wave function on an angular grid and solving a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The scattering amplitude is then constructed from the solution. The authors demonstrate the efficiency of their method by reproducing known results for the scattering on a cylinder potential with a circular base and for the 2D scattering of polarized dipoles.

Chimera states, first observed in populations of identical phase oscillators, have been extensively studied and experimentally verified in various models and systems, including coupled chemical oscillators, optical coupled-map lattices, and mechanical experiments involving metronomes.

The paper aims to identify chimera states in networks of non-locally coupled neurons represented by Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators, a more realistic model for single neuron dynamics compared to the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. The study considers both 2D and 3D versions of the Hindmarsh-Rose model, with different coupling schemes, and discovers a variety of single and multi-chimera states, as well as a novel mixed oscillatory state (MOS) where desynchronized neurons are interspersed among synchronized ones.

They attracted the interest of physicists in the 1980s due to their analogy with the disordered systems studied in statistical mechanics, such as the mean field spin glass.
2. A dynamical phase transition was found and studied in the framework of mean field theory in these networks. In the so-called chaotic phase, the average length of the cycles increases exponentially with system size, while in the frozen phase, the typical length of the cycles does not increase with system size.

1. Turbulence is a strong nonequilibrium phenomenon in fluid systems, exhibiting unpredictable behavior of the velocity field, which can result from the multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinearity of the system. It is one of the unresolved problems in modern physics.
2. In quantum turbulence (qt), many quantized vortices with quantized circulation are nucleated, forming tangles, which is drastically different from classical turbulence (ct) where the circulation of the velocity field is not quantized. The element of qt is more obvious than that in ct, and qt is believed to be useful for understanding ct.
3. Recently, a new trend in turbulence study in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is the study of turbulence in multi-component BECs, which have various characteristic features, including a realization of multicomponent BECs. In this system, there exists not only a velocity field but also a (quasi) spin field, leading to novel turbulence where both the velocity and spin fields are much disturbed and various topological excitations are generated.

1. Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) are found in about 40% of nearby bright galaxies and are the majority of the AGN population.
2. Their low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes, which is often explained by the model of optically thin discs such as an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF).
3. ADAFs are predicted to have a 'submillimetre bump' in their spectral energy distribution (SED), while standard discs are responsible for a big blue bump in the SED of luminous AGNs.
4. The authors conducted a millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF.
5. They found that at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz, and there is little diffuse contamination in the measurements for these sources.
6. The inverted spectra are intrinsic properties of the cores and are not caused by resolution effects.
7. There is an inverse correlation between the high-frequency radio spectrum and the low-frequency radio core power, which can be explained by varying flux ratios between the jet and the ADAF disc.

1. The paper presents three methods for measuring the extinction law slope (Rv) in the direction of differentially reddened globular clusters using photometry.
2. The first method, ""Rv rms"", relies on three-color photometry and minimizes the rms scatter of the blue horizontal branch (HB) when the appropriate Rv value is used for extinction and reddening correction.
3. The second method, ""Rv slope"", is similar to the first but plots one Rv value against the other and finds the slope that approaches unity when the test Rv approaches the true value.
4. The third method, ""optical/ir"", uses two-color photometry and a map of the dust thermal emission to correct for extinction and reddening.
5. The paper applies these methods to the globular cluster NGC 4833 and uses simulations to estimate the accuracy of each method.
6. The best-fit Rv value for NGC 4833 is found by combining the results from all three methods, giving a mean value of 3.0.
7. The width of the HB in NGC 4833 is used to estimate the amount of small-scale structure in the dust complex in the foreground of the cluster, which is found to be about 6% of the mean reddening value.
8. The angular power spectrum of the foreground dust is measured using star-to-star variations in relative visual extinction across the face of NGC 4833, and it matches smoothly onto the larger-scale power spectrum derived from the SFD reddening map of the region.

The discovery of a resonance at 125 GeV in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles and may also affect the field of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.

Upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons from LHC experiments have been discussed, and bounds on the coupling between the Higgs particle and gravity may also be obtained by considering strong-gravity astrophysical objects such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and primordial black holes. The presence of a strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles, leading to predicted wavelength shifts in electronic transitions that should be present in the spectra of strong-gravity sources.

3. The frozen nucleon approximation reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 to 1, making it well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux.
4. The frozen nucleon approximation was validated by comparing the nucleon frozen approximation results with the exact calculation using the electroweak meson-exchange current (MEC) model of @xcite.
5. The presence of virtual delta excitations requires the introduction of a ""frozen"" @xmath1-propagator, designed by a convenient average over the fermi sea.
6. The frozen nucleon approximation works properly in computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators.

1. A conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies was proposed by Weyl in 1919, where the dynamical equations of gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form under a conformally flat metrical field.
2. Confinement of quarks and gluons is described by introducing two scalar fields that spontaneously break the symmetry down to U(1) and SU(3), respectively.
3. A symmetric second-order tensor field serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism, with quarks and gluons confined to an anti-de Sitter universe.
4. The model comprises one real scalar field (Φ) and one complex scalar field (Ψ), with their dynamical equations solved under the condition that their vacuum expectation values satisfy a specific relation.
5. The only quadratic term in the lagrangian is proportional to (∂Φ)^2, leading to a light Φ field associated with confinement and a very heavy complex Ψ field associated with electromagnetism.
6. Weak interactions were not considered in the original model, but electroweak unification can be read for electromagnetism.
7. The model does not easily allow for interactions between hadrons, so it was simplified to study its main property of flavor-independent oscillations.
8. The model's predictions for the mass of the scalar field associated with confinement were estimated based on the average radius for quark-pair creation, extracted from mesonic resonance data.
9. Experimental evidence suggests the possible existence of a quantum with a mass of about 38 MeV, which could mediate quark-pair creation and serve as the scalar field for confinement.
10. The light scalar glueball discussed in the paper seems to correspond to the lowest-order empty-universe solution for strong interactions, with similar properties to the electroweak Higgs boson but coupling to quarks with an intensity proportional to their mass.

1. The term 'stochastic resonance' was introduced in the early 1980s to describe the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by adding noise.
2. The problem is to estimate a signal transmitted through a channel, which has to be detected by a receiver that can reveal signals louder than a threshold.
3. The optimal level of noise that maximizes the transmission of the signal is called stochastic resonance.
4. The authors study the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model with a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal.
5. They propose two schemes of observations: i) observing only the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold, and ii) measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.
6. The asymptotic properties of estimators given by the generalized method of moments are established for both models.
7. The presence of stochastic resonance in this context is noted for the first time in this paper.

1. The order parameter in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) has been proven to have mainly a d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant d-wave gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature Tc.
2. Thermal transport measurements have shown the predominance of this symmetry for the gap function, with a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO2 planes, which can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles.
3. The angular patterns of the longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures for twinned and untwinned YBCO crystals were measured, showing a fourfold oscillation at low temperatures and a change in symmetry at higher temperatures.
4. The experimental results were compared to a theoretical model involving Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the two-dimensional BRT expression for the thermal conductivity, assuming a d-wave pairing symmetry. The model reproduced the observed behavior in the whole measured temperature range, supporting the predominance of d-wave pairing symmetry of the order parameter.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive features such as calculable soft terms, real and flavor invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariance.
2. However, AMSB models suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass squared parameters, which can be resolved by adding a universal mass term.
3. An alternative setup for AMSB is hypercharged anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (HCAMSB), which uses a string-motivated scenario with a similar setup as AMSB.
4. In HCAMSB, the bino mass can lead to a small perturbation or dominate the spectrum, depending on its size.

2. Darboux Transformation (DT) is a technique that allows for the construction of exactly solvable potentials in a natural way. It can be used to correct the ZRP model by modifying the generalized ZRP boundary condition and creating a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.
3. The authors attempt to dress the ZRP to improve its possibilities. They use DT to modify the ZRP and create a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum. They also consider a multi-centered potential that includes ZRPs.

1. Rapidity gaps, regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron, attributed to color singlet quantum exchange between incident partons.
2. At the Tevatron, about 1% of dijet events with high transverse energies and large jet separations exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets.
3. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order 1% due to color singlet exchange and a survival probability of about 10% for rapidity gaps.
4. The two-gluon exchange model estimates the color singlet fraction using the imaginary part of the two-gluon exchange amplitude in impact parameter space.
5. The model predicts a decrease in the observable gap fraction with increasing jet transverse energy, as the contribution from gluon-induced dijet events is reduced.
6. Recent measurements by CDF and D0 at the Tevatron do not show this decrease, with D0 data suggesting a slight increase in the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse energy.
7. The paper reconsiders the two-gluon exchange model, demonstrating its limitations and showing that the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative.
8. The authors propose a unitarized model for rapidity gap formation, which depends on two parameters: the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift.

The maximum amount of MIP funds increased from $440 million in fiscal year 1997 to $720 million in fiscal year 2003, and has remained at $720 million since then.
2. **Allocation of Funds**: CMS allocates MIP funds primarily to support its contractors' program integrity efforts for the traditional Medicare program, known as fee-for-service Medicare. The five program integrity activities that MIP funds support are audit, medical review, secondary payer, benefit integrity, and provider education. CMS allocates funds to these activities based on historical funding and high-level priorities, but does not routinely consider data or information on the effectiveness of one activity over the other in ensuring the integrity of Medicare or allow CMS to determine if activities are yielding benefits that are commensurate with the amounts spent.
3. **Future Challenges**: Medicare's susceptibility to fraud is growing with the addition of the new Part D prescription drug benefit. CMS plans to use some of the additional funding provided under DRA for fiscal year 2006 to support Part D program integrity efforts. However, CMS's current allocation approach, which relies primarily on previous fiscal year funding allocations for each activity, will not be adequate to address emerging program integrity risks and ongoing programmatic changes, such as Medicare contracting reform.

1. **Bankruptcy Process for Financial Companies**: Large financial companies may be reorganized or liquidated under a judicial bankruptcy process or resolved under special legal and regulatory resolution regimes. Bankruptcy involves a court-supervised procedure where a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor's estate, reduces them to cash, and makes distributions to creditors. Reorganization proceedings allow debtors to continue some or all of their operations under court supervision.
2. **Safe Harbor Provisions for Financial Contracts**: Bankruptcy includes safe harbor provisions for certain financial and derivative contracts, such as qualified financial contracts (QFCs), which allow nondefaulting counterparties to liquidate, terminate, offset, or net these contracts even if doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay. This can lead to significant losses to the debtor's estate and may reduce market discipline.

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of species that are endangered or threatened with extinction.
2. Federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to determine if their actions might jeopardize listed species or destroy their critical habitat.
3. If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is released along with reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to avoid jeopardy.
4. The exemption process allows federal agencies, governors, or permit applicants to seek an exemption from the ESA's restrictions if there are no reasonable and prudent alternatives and the benefits of the action clearly outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action.
5. The exemption process is complex and time-consuming, taking up to 280 days, and requires the applicant to fund mitigation measures for the life of the action.
6. Even if an exemption is granted, other underlying issues related to natural resources may still exist, and conflicts may continue.
7. The exemption process has rarely been invoked in recent cases, possibly due to the complexity of the process, the need for the applicant to fund mitigation, and the fact that the exemption applies to the action rather than the species.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax calculation on a broader tax base than the regular tax, designed to ensure that high-income individuals pay at least some minimum amount of tax.
2. The AMT base includes not only business provisions but also certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions, while excluding capital gains and tax-exempt bond interest.
3. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, leading to an increasing number of taxpayers subject to the AMT over time.
4. In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but by 1999, this number had increased to 823,000, and it is projected to reach 9 million by 2009.
5. The AMT is expected to reach further down into the income distribution, affecting middle and upper-middle income classes more significantly in the future.
6. The cost of correcting the AMT by indexing exemptions is significant, estimated at $13.9 billion by 2008, and eliminating credit limits would cost billions more.
7. Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities but do not also alter the AMT will increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families.

2. **MPC Imports and Trade Restrictions**: The U.S. imports MPCs with limited or no trade restrictions, unlike many other dairy product imports that are restricted by tariff-rate quotas. Major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports.
3. **Proposed Legislation and Potential Impact**: The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act (S. 1542) was introduced to limit imports of MPCs, casein, and caseinates. Enactment of this legislation could lead to the U.S. entering into compensation negotiations with WTO member countries that are major suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market.

1. **Gross Estate Calculation**: The gross estate includes the value of all property owned by the decedent at death, certain lifetime gifts, and life insurance proceeds. It is valued at fair market value on the date of death or an alternate valuation date.
2. **Deductions from Gross Estate**: The taxable estate is calculated by reducing the gross estate with allowable deductions, including funeral expenses, administration expenses, debts, the marital deduction, charitable bequests, and state death taxes.
3. **Estate Tax Computation**: The estate tax is computed by applying the progressive tax rates to the sum of the taxable estate and taxable gifts made during life. Credits, such as the unified transfer tax credit, can then be applied to reduce the tax liability.
4. **Gift Tax**: The gift tax is imposed on gratuitous transfers of property made during life. The taxable gift is calculated by reducing the gross value of the gift by exclusions and deductions. The gift tax follows the same progressive rates as the estate tax and is computed cumulatively over the donor's lifetime.
5. **Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax**: The GST tax is a flat-rate tax (40% for 2014) applied to direct skips, taxable terminations, or taxable distributions. It aims to prevent property from being transferred to successive generations without paying multiple estate or gift taxes. An exemption of $5,340,000 per individual is allowed.
6. **Tax Liability**: The liability for the GST tax depends on the type of transfer. It is paid by the transferee in case of a taxable distribution, by the trustee in case of a taxable termination or direct skip from a trust, and by the transferor in case of direct skips, other than those from a trust.

1. The U.S. government has implemented various programs and policies to enhance border and transportation security, which can be categorized into pushing the border outwards, hardening the border, facilitating legitimate travel and trade, strengthening the border through intelligence, and multiplying effectiveness through engagement of other actors.
2. Pushing the border outwards involves intercepting unwanted people or goods before they reach the United States, such as through pre-inspections, advance passenger and cargo manifests, the Container Security Initiative, and passenger pre-inspection at foreign airports.
3. Hardening the border involves using technology and increasing the presence of agents at the border, such as through the U.S.-VISIT program, biometric identifiers, smart containers, and non-intrusive inspection technologies.
4. Facilitating legitimate travel and trade involves making the border more accessible for low-risk travelers and goods, such as through the NEXUS and SENTRI programs, the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program, and the Visa Waiver Program.
5. Strengthening the border through intelligence involves using traditional foreign intelligence and criminal intelligence to prevent certain goods and individuals from crossing U.S. borders, such as through the Terrorist Screening Database and the Automated Targeting System.
6. Multiplying effectiveness through engagement of other actors involves working with foreign governments, state and local law enforcement, and the private sector to enhance border security, such as through the Canada-U.S. Partnership Forum, the U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Action Plan, and the North American Security Perimeter concept.
7. The current programs and policies in place reflect some layering, with efforts to push the border outwards, harden the border, and engage other actors aimed at preempting potential attacks and preventing individuals who are trying to surreptitiously enter the United States.
8. While the current programs and policies may reflect an attempt at layering, some contend that there are still gaps in the system, and that a more comprehensive approach to border and transportation security may be necessary.

3. Mandatory coverage is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds, closing 8-9% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall and extending the trust fund exhaustion date by 1-2 years.
4. Mandatory coverage could simplify retirement planning, prevent gaps in pension or Social Security coverage, and provide better benefit protections for workers and their families through dependents' and survivors' benefits and full cost-of-living adjustments.
5. Opponents argue that mandatory coverage could lead to benefit reductions in non-covered pension plans, higher payroll taxes, and lower benefits for higher-wage workers, and that it could impose significant administrative burdens on state and local governments.

1. The Inland Waterways System (IWS) is a significant component of the nation's marine transportation system, carrying approximately one-sixth of the national volume of intercity cargo on 25,000 miles of commercially active inland and intracoastal waterways.
2. The federal government invests in inland waterways through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), which develops, operates, and maintains the infrastructure of these commercial waterways, including navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams.
3. The Corps pays for 100% of the cost for studies and operations and maintenance on the IWS, while the cost for new construction or major rehabilitation is shared equally between the Corps and the commercial industry.
4. The current revenue source for inland waterway system investments, a set tax on fuel agreed to in the mid-1980s, is insufficient to cover the nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures on inland waterways, leading to federal taxpayers covering more than half of these costs in some years.
5. Recent proposals highlight a number of issues associated with inland waterways, including who will finance what investments, and at what level. The executive branch has proposed to phase out the fuel tax in favor of lock usage fees, while the user industry has proposed a plan that includes increases to the existing fuel tax in combination with an increase in the overall federal share for inland waterway costs.
6. Congress is faced with competing proposals relating to future financing for inland waterway system investments, and may consider changes to the system that finances these investments, including options for additional revenue such as an increase to the fuel tax, new annual fees in addition to the current fuel tax, or other options such as a lock usage fee or some kind of toll system.

2. These ipsilateral motor deficits can emerge during the acute phase and persist chronically, but their causes are still unclear.
3. Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to differentiate ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination functions on the ipsilateral side.
4. Kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb have been found in various specific motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination.
5. Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, such as disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, or different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.
6. The current study aimed to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb and examine the correlation between the two variables in patients with stroke using a tracking and reposition sense test.

1. Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
2. Each MyoVa dimer consists of two motor domains (heads) connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, and ending in a globular cargo-binding domain.
3. MyoVa's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms, resulting in 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.
4. Calcium is required to activate MyoVa's ATPase activity, but high calcium (>1 mM) reduces motor processivity and may cause calmodulin dissociation from the lever arms.
5. Single MyoVa molecules can maneuver through actin intersections and travel along actin bundles in vitro.
6. The authors used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains.
7. TPM involves anchoring a MyoVa-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor.
8. The flexural stiffness of MyoVa subdomains, such as the lever arm and rod domain, was isolated by attaching quantum dots to expressed MyoVa constructs of different lengths.
9. The authors hypothesized that calmodulin dissociation from the MyoVa lever arm decreases its flexural stiffness, contributing to the motor's compromised processivity in the presence of calcium.

2. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aurka, erbb2, mdm2, cdh1, cdkn2a, and tp73 genes were genotyped in 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
3. In a multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous mdm2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients carrying the wild-type t/t genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.63, 95% CI [0.45-0.88], p=0.007).
4. Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous cdh1 (rs5030625) ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival compared to patients carrying the wild-type g/g genotype (AHR 4.0, 95% CI [1.41-11], p=0.008).

1. Candida albicans or other candida species colonize the oral cavity in 40-60% of healthy individuals, but in immune-compromised patients, they can cause various diseases, including oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC).
2. OPC is the most common opportunistic fungal infection among HIV-positive patients, with over 90% developing this infection at some point during their disease progression.
3. OPC appears as erythematous patches or white, scrapable lesions and is often one of the first clinical signs of HIV infection, occurring more frequently in patients with CD4+ counts below 200/mm³ or a high viral load (>10,000 copies/ml).
4. The study was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study conducted over two years, evaluating the forms of OPC and their correlation with CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients.
5. A total of 50 consenting participants were included in the study, with 90% being males and the median age being 39 years.
6. The most common clinical presentation of OPC was pseudomembranous candidiasis (52.6%), followed by erythematous (13.15%), angular cheilitis (13.15%), and a combination of these forms.
7. Candida albicans was the most frequent species isolated (92%), followed by Candida tropicalis (5.26%) and Candida glabrata (2.64%).
8. The majority of patients with OPC had CD4+ cell counts <200 cells/mm³ (73%), followed by 201-499 cells/mm³ (23%).

1. The study used data from two multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trials to test surrogate variables for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and explore the correlation between granulation tissue development and complete healing.
2. The first study was a dose-exploratory trial in five hospitals, and the second was a confirmatory trial in 20 hospitals, with a total of 190 ulcers included in the analyses.
3. The median time to complete closure was 15 weeks, with 25th and 75th percentiles of 9.6 and 21.4 weeks, respectively.
4. The study proposed several surrogate markers of complete healing, including percent change in area, log healing rate, ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT), and percent granulation tissue covering the ulcer area.
5. Ulcer areas and percent granulation were measured by planimetry using a validated portable wound measurement device.
6. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals.
7. The most efficient predictor of complete healing was granulation tissue covering >75% of the ulcer area at the end of treatment, with 79.5% correct classification and a high negative predictive value (93.5%).
8. The proportion mediated for granulation variables (at 2 weeks and at the EOT) was very high, suggesting that granulation is an essential part of the healing process in larger and advanced ulcers.
9. The study found that granulation tissue development had good capacity to discriminate healers from nonhealers, with ROC curve areas >70% at the 2nd week and EOT.
10. The results of this study suggest that granulation tissue development can be used as a predictor of wound healing in advanced DFUs and may have relevant implications for clinical trial design and healthcare programs managing DFUs.

1. Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all primary bone tumors, typically affecting the epiphyseal regions of tubular bones.
2. In the head and neck region, chondroblastoma is uncommon but can occur in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint (TMJ), causing symptoms like occlusal abnormalities, trismus, clicking of the TMJ, hearing impairments, dizziness, and otorrhea.
3. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma are rare but can occur after irradiation, so radiation therapy should be avoided.
4. Chondroblastoma in the temporal bone has unique histological features that make diagnosis difficult, and incomplete resection carries a high risk of recurrence.
5. A 41-year-old male presented with chronic hearing loss, trismus, and a tumor mass in the middle cranial fossa, including the TMJ and cochlea, despite earlier treatments.
6. Initial misdiagnosis led to a delay in accurate diagnosis and suitable treatment for this rare chondroblastoma with malignant potential.
7. The patient underwent a modified surgical procedure involving a radical mastoidectomy, subtotal resection of the temporal bone, skull base dissection, and resection of the TMJ using a zygomatic-extended middle fossa approach.
8. Four and a half years after surgery, the patient showed no signs of tumor recurrence, dizziness, and improvement in occlusal abnormalities and trismus, with no postoperative dysfunction.
9. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for treating chondroblastoma, as misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment and potential malignant transformation.

It included 53 eyes of 45 patients who presented with fireworks-related injuries during the 5 days of Diwali festival.
2. **Injury Characteristics**: The right eye was affected in 30 eyes, and the left eye in 23. Open-globe injury was seen in 9.43% of eyes, while closed-globe injury was seen in 90.56%. The severity of injury was more among those who ignited the fireworks themselves compared to bystanders.
3. **Management and Outcomes**: Eighteen eyes (33.96%) underwent surgical management, 34 eyes (64.15%) were managed conservatively, and one eye (1.88%) was advised primary enucleation. At the final follow-up, 22 eyes had a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/6, while 1 eye had no perception of light. Five eyes developed phthisis bulbi, and three of these underwent secondary enucleation.
4. **Prevention and Policy**: Fireworks-related ocular trauma can cause severe vision loss and facial disfigurement. To reduce this, immediate measures such as prohibiting dangerous fireworks, public awareness, and expert primary ophthalmic care are needed. Encouraging professional firework displays at public places during festivals is also suggested. Strong legislation is required to regulate the manufacture, sale, and use of consumer fireworks.

2. The prevalence of SCH varies, with women, elderly people, and iodine-sufficient populations being affected more often, ranging from 4% to 20% in the adult population.
3. SCH is associated with various adverse clinical effects, including increased body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and altered lipid levels, as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality.
4. The treatment of SCH is controversial, with some studies showing benefits in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, while others do not. The optimal TSH cutoff values and clinical significance of these subclinical abnormalities are also debated.
5. The Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) study, a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial, is currently underway to assess the multimodal effects of thyroid hormone replacement in adults aged 65 and older with persistent SCH, which may help clarify the populations that may benefit from treatment.

1. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, releasing toxins A and B that induce C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).
2. Diagnosis of CDAD widely uses an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B, but EIA has low detection sensitivity compared to PCR and cytotoxigenic culture.
3. The study investigated patients who submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA, comparing patient characteristics, diarrhea duration, antibiotics usage, and severity among toxin-positive stool, toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates, and dual toxin-negative stool and isolates groups.
4. A total of 68 patients were included in the study, with 39 having toxin-positive stool specimens, 14 having toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates, and 15 having both toxin-negative stool and isolates.
5. Patients with toxin-negative stool specimens had significantly shorter diarrhea duration (5.6 days) compared to those with toxin-positive stool specimens (10.6 days).
6. Only one patient in the toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates group received CDAD treatment, and diarrhea duration in this group did not differ significantly from the dual-negative group.
7. The study suggests that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens may have milder symptoms, even if toxigenic C. difficile is isolated from stool, and that severe symptoms are unlikely to develop at toxin concentrations below detection sensitivity.
8. EIA directly measures toxin proteins in stool and has a high positive predictive value, making it an important test in determining treatment approach, despite its low sensitivity compared to PCR.

2. The trial recruited 5,269 participants with IFG, IGT, or both, who were randomized to receive ramipril and/or rosiglitazone and followed for a median of 3 years.
3. A substudy of 982 participants from Canadian study centers had oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) at baseline, after 2 years, and at the end of the study to assess changes in beta-cell function over time.
4. Beta-cell function was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration, adjusted for insulin resistance and insulin secretion, respectively.
5. Rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI/IR and decreased PI/C over time, while ramipril had no significant effect on these measures.
6. Rosiglitazone's effect on diabetes prevention persisted after adjustment for baseline beta-cell function, but was modestly attenuated when accounting for changes in beta-cell function.
7. The study suggests that rosiglitazone's diabetes preventive effect may be partly mediated through improved beta-cell function, while ramipril's glucose-lowering effects may operate through other metabolic mechanisms.

2. In Denmark, a dramatic increase in VRE cases since 2012 has been due to multiclonal outbreaks of vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium.
3. It is estimated that for every detected VRE infection, up to ten patients are intestinal carriers, making screening and isolation precautions crucial.
4. The Xpert vanA/vanB assay, performed directly on rectal swabs, was implemented in the authors' laboratory in 2014 to rapidly detect vanA-positive VRE.
5. The study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert vanA/vanB assay and its impact on infection control decision-making.

The study aimed to compare the effects of a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ru28318, ru), an ACE inhibitor (captopril, capt), and an AT1 receptor blocker (losartan, los), alone or in combination, administered before or after ischemia on ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction in isolated hearts from normal and diabetic rats.
2. The results showed that ru was generally more effective than capt or los alone in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal hearts, while in diabetic hearts, ru was similarly effective as capt or los. Triple combination therapy was generally the most effective strategy in both normal and diabetic hearts.
3. The study also found that the effectiveness of drugs was cardiac parameter-specific, with some drugs being better at improving one cardiac function parameter over others. For example, ru was ineffective at improving peak left ventricular developed pressure (pmax) but was the most effective at improving the positive derivative of left ventricular pressure (+dp/dt) in diabetic hearts when given after ischemia.
4. The study suggests that mr antagonists, such as ru, may represent a novel class of RAAS inhibitor that could overcome the limitations observed with ACEi and ARB combinations and may have important clinical implications in the treatment of cardiac dysfunction.

1. The study evaluated the role of urethral plate characters (shape and width) in the success of Snodgrass tip urethroplasty for primary anterior penile hypospadias in 100 children.
2. Patients were divided into two groups based on urethral plate width: group A (>8 mm) and group B (<8 mm).
3. Group B patients had a statistically significant higher fistula rate (p=0.004) and failed 8Fr calibration rate (p=0.01) compared to group A.
4. The urethral plate was also categorized as flat, cleft, or deeply grooved, with flat plates showing a higher, but not statistically significant, fistula rate and failed 8Fr calibration rate.
5. Overall, 8% of patients developed fistula, 12% had failed 8Fr calibration, and 1% had partial dehiscence.
6. Redo surgery was indicated in 1 patient, and fistulectomy in 8 patients.
7. The study found that tip urethroplasty has good cosmetic and functional results, with advantages such as preservation of the urethral plate, single suture line, and short operative time.
8. However, flat plates may require augmentation with buccal mucosal graft (BMG) to improve results.

2. The most prominent EET isomer, 14,15-EET, along with other members of this autacoid family, arise via metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, especially members of the 2c and 2j families.
3. The ratio of EET isomers and their stereocomposition are CYP P450 isoform-dependent and, thus, species- and tissue-specific.
4. Numerous chemical and metabolic factors complicate investigations into the roles of 14,15-EET and restrain its potential therapeutic utility.
5. Its susceptibility toward aerial oxidation or auto-oxidation necessitates handling and/or storage under strict conditions that minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals.
6. A precis of inactivating enzymatic processes includes esterification, metabolism by other pathways of the arachidonate cascade, conjugation, -oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide.
7. In biological milieu, hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) is a major determinant in maintaining the steady state levels of 14,15-EET, whose half-life has been estimated at no more than seconds to minutes.
8. Pioneering studies by Hammock and others confirmed inhibition of SEH can elevate EET levels both in vitro and in vivo, offering an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes.
9. However, this strategy might prove less efficacious than an agonist replacement therapy whenever endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised, for instance, as a consequence of disease, inflammation, radiotherapy, aging, and/or exposure to xenobiotics and drugs that inhibit cytochromes P450.

3. **Improving Stem Cell Homing**: Strategies to enhance stem cell homing include ex vivo conditioning of donor cells, in vivo conditioning of the host vasculature, and utilization of master regulators and secreted homing factors such as SDF-1, VEGF, and MCP-3.
4. **Enhancing Stem Cell Survival**: Preconditioning stem cells with hypoxia, genetic modification to overexpress survival factors like Akt-1, sfrp2, thymosin 4, and IGF-1, and blocking apoptosis with Bcl-2 can improve stem cell survival and function.
5. **Cardiomyocyte Regeneration**: Recent studies suggest that cardiomyocyte regeneration may not be necessary for significant structural and functional benefits from cell therapy. Resident cardiac progenitor cells and committed cardiac progenitor cells derived from pluripotent stem cells can improve ventricular function after transplantation.

1. Polyhalite is a sulfate mineral found in sedimentary evaporite successions and in rare cases as a sublimate in volcanic successions.
2. It was first described from the salt mine Bad Ischl - Perneck in Austria by the German chemist Stromeyer in 1818.
3. In evaporites, polyhalite is commonly associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulfides.
4. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria and later confirmed by Bindig in 2005.
5. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by a reaction of gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C.
6. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C to a maximum of 343°C.
7. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements like Zn, Cu, Ni significantly changes dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures.
8. Polyhalite most commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite.

The Anterior and Middle Superior Alveolar (AMSA) Nerve Block is a technique proposed by Friedman and Hochman (1998) for achieving pulpal anesthesia in maxillary teeth from the central incisor to the second premolar with a single injection through a palatal approach, using a computer-controlled injection system.
2. The AMSA nerve block is intended to anesthetize the anterior and middle superior alveolar nerves, which are responsible for the pulpal innervation of the respective teeth, without causing lip numbness or interfering with facial muscle expression.
3. A study was conducted to determine the success rates of pulpal anesthesia with the AMSA nerve block technique using a conventional syringe. The study found that the success rates ranged from 16.7% to 66.6%, with no patient achieving anesthesia from the second premolar to the central incisor, and no facial anesthesia.
4. The main advantages of the AMSA nerve block are the reduction in the number of injections and the quantity of anesthetic solution administered compared to conventional infiltrative anesthesia. However, the low success rates and the unpredictable duration of anesthesia make it less favorable as a first-choice technique for maxillary anesthesia.

1. Advances in molecular biology and microscopy have revealed the hierarchical folding of the genome into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs).
2. TADs, ranging from 100 kb to 1 Mb, are stable structures that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions.
3. The boundaries of TADs serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions, with strong boundaries limiting interactions between adjacent TADs.
4. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning, as well as for establishing long-range chromatin interactions.
5. BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength, and its loss affects nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization.
6. BRG1 knockdown in mammary epithelial cells results in reduced nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions, suggesting a role for BRG1 in regulating nucleosome occupancy and CTCF localization at TAD boundaries.
7. BRG1 interacts with topoisomerases, and there is evidence of functional cooperativity between CTCF, BRG1, and topoisomerases in organizing TADs via active regulation of boundary regions.
8. Perturbations in the recruitment of CTCF and topoisomerases due to BRG1 knockdown may affect the integrity and stiffness of chromatin at TAD boundaries.

Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue, but more recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, along with sensory features of food.
2. The major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones like ghrelin, PYY, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the GI tract or associated organs. These models account for the regulation of appetite and contribute to the regulation of body weight through specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.
3. A new formulation based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects suggests that aspects of body composition and energy expenditure (EE) regulate hunger and appetite. This formulation is an alternative to the molecular approach and is based on the interrelationships between EE and energy intake (EI). It proposes that resting metabolic rate (RMR), the largest component of total daily EE, provides a tonic signal of energy demand that drives daily EI.

2. The study compared the shear bond strength of denture teeth to two types of denture base resins: heat-polymerized (Meliodent) and autopolymerized (Futura Gen). The denture teeth were subjected to three surface treatments: untreated, treated with monomer, and treated with airborne particle abrasion.
3. The results showed that the type of acrylic resin and the surface treatment significantly affected the shear bond strength, but there was no significant interaction between these factors. The control groups (untreated) had significantly lower bond strength than the treated groups, but there was no significant difference between the bond strengths of groups treated by monomer or airborne particle abrasion.
4. The failure mode was predominantly mixed in the Meliodent groups, whereas adhesive failure was reported for Futura Gen specimens.
5. The study concluded that treating the ridge lap surface of denture teeth with monomer or airborne particle abrasion significantly improved their bond strengths to the denture base resins, with no significant difference between the two treatment methods. The bond strength of the denture teeth to the studied denture base resins was significantly different, with predominantly adhesive failure in Futura Gen and mixed failure in Meliodent.

3. Two sarnas, klf4-pr1 and myc-pr2, were found to consistently induce increases in both mRNA and protein expression of klf4 and c-myc, respectively, in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
4. Neither of these sarnas activated the interferon response, and both appear to act through specific activation of transcription.
5. Microarray analysis showed that the majority of cellular genes exhibited concordant changes in expression between upregulation by sarnas and overexpression by lentiviral transduction, but with some notable differences.

3. Researchers have been searching for an ideal cell with absolute totipotency and regenerability for neural regeneration therapy, but many unanswered questions remain.
4. Recent studies suggest that a complex of cells, including olfactory ensheathing cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and olfactory epithelial multipotent stem and progenitor cells, can achieve more complete recovery of the structure, sensory, and motor functions of injured spinal cord.
5. The olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with possible neuroipotency: globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs).
6. GBCs are broadly multipotent progenitors capable of giving rise to neurons and all of the cell types of the epithelium, and may be totipotent stem cells of the epithelium.
7. The present research work helped to isolate and characterize GBCs in the olfactory epithelium of rats, confirming their neural progenitor cell nature through positive expression of various markers like NCAM, Nestin, Sox-2, CD-29, CD-54, and CD-73.

1. Methadone exposure induced a rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) in most SH-SY5Y cells, with four different types of calcium responses observed.
2. Methadone decreased the abundance of cells showing a transient rise in [Ca]cyt (type 4) and increased cells with short or delayed continuous rise in [Ca]cyt (types 2 and 3), suggesting it may induce short or delayed calcium deregulation.
3. Pharmacological studies revealed that only drugs affecting mitochondrial handling of calcium, such as oligomycin, FCCP, CGP37157, and cyclosporine A, modulated methadone-induced delayed calcium deregulation.
4. Methadone treatment caused mitochondrial fragmentation in SH-SY5Y cells and impaired mitochondrial calcium uptake, which may contribute to mitochondrial damage and cell death.

1. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, closely related to avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) subgroup C.
2. hMPV is a significant cause of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, with symptoms ranging from influenza-like syndromes to severe lower respiratory tract infections.
3. Previous studies have shown that many children exposed to hMPV are easily reinfected, making it a major concern in child respiratory tract viral infections.
4. The hMPV genome is approximately 13 kb in length, with a gene composition of N-P-M-F-M2-1/M2-2-SH-G-L, similar to human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) but lacking two nonstructural genes, NS1 and NS2.
5. hMPV has two main genetic lineages, A and B, each containing two subgroups (A1/A2 and B1/B2, respectively), with A2 exhibiting the greatest diversity.
6. The study analyzed the synonymous codon usage bias in 17 complete hMPV genomes representing two genotypes and found that all preferred codons ended with A/U, while none ended with G/C.
7. The study found that nucleotide composition, particularly the high abundance of A/U nucleotides, is the main force affecting codon usage bias in hMPV genomes.
8. The study also found that mutation pressure, rather than natural selection, is the most important determinant of codon usage bias in hMPV, as all plots were laid below the expected curve in the ENC-GC plot analysis.
9. The study observed that codon usage bias in hMPV showed distinct differences among different phylogenetic types, suggesting that codon usage bias plays an important role in hMPV evolution history and may influence its virulence in different genotypes.
