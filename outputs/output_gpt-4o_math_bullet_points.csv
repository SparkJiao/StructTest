Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

## 2. Calculate the number of eggs Janet consumes daily

Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. Therefore, she consumes a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs daily.

## 3. Calculate the number of eggs available for sale

Subtract the number of eggs Janet consumes from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs are available for sale.

## 4. Determine the selling price per egg

Janet sells each egg at the farmers' market for $2.

## 5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs

Multiply the number of eggs available for sale by the selling price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

**Step 1**: Define the initial number of vacuum cleaners.

- Let \( x \) be the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

**Step 2**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house.

- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

**Step 3**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house.

- After selling a third at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 4**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house.

- Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.

**Step 5**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house.

- After selling 2 more at the red house, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 6**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house.

- Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

**Step 7**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house.

- After selling half of what was left at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners remaining.

**Step 8**: Set up the equation for the remaining vacuum cleaners.

- We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we set up the equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
  \]

**Step 9**: Solve the equation for \( x \).

- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
  \]

- Add 2 to both sides:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{3} = 12
  \]

- Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
  \[
  2x = 36
  \]

- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 18
  \]

**Step 10**: Verify the solution.

- Initially, Melanie had 18 vacuum cleaners.
- She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) at the green house, leaving her with 12.
- She sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with 10.
- She sold half of the remaining 10 at the orange house, which is 5, leaving her with 5.
- This matches the given condition that she has 5 left.

30,"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to determine his current age based on the given ratio and total age. Here's how we can solve the problem step by step:

### 1. Understand the ratio

- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is given as 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts.

### 2. Define variables for ages

- Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

### 3. Set up the equation for total age

- The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:  
  \[
  7x + 11x = 162
  \]

### 4. Simplify the equation

- Combine the terms in the equation:  
  \[
  18x = 162
  \]

### 5. Solve for \(x\)

- Divide both sides of the equation by 18 to find \(x\):  
  \[
  x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
  \]

### 6. Calculate Allen's current age

- Substitute \(x = 9\) back into the expression for Allen's age:  
  \[
  11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
  \]

### 7. Determine Allen's age 10 years from now

- Add 10 years to Allen's current age to find his age 10 years from now:  
  \[
  99 + 10 = 109

### 1

First, identify the number of jewels Raymond has. According to the problem, Raymond has 40 jewels.

### 2

Next, determine how many jewels Aaron has. The problem states that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 

- Half of Raymond's jewels is calculated as \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Aaron has 5 more than this amount, so Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

\[ \text{Weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

### 2

Determine the remaining weight that needs to be removed after taking out the comic books. Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds with the comic books.

\[ \text{Remaining weight to remove} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

### 3

Calculate how many toys Uriah needs to remove to account for the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.

\[ \text{Number of toys to remove} = \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

84,"To solve the problem of determining how many games the football team won, we can follow these steps:

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( x \) be the number of games the team lost.
- Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \( x + 8 \).

### 2. Set Up the Equation

- The total number of games played is 22. Therefore, the sum of games won and games lost is equal to 22.
- This gives us the equation: 
  \[
  x + (x + 8) = 22
  \]

### 3. Simplify the Equation

- Combine like terms in the equation:
  \[
  2x + 8 = 22
  \]

### 4. Solve for \( x \)

- Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x = 14
  \]

- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 7
  \]

### 5. Calculate the Number of Wins

- Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, substitute \( x = 7 \) into the expression for wins:
  \[
  x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
  \]

### 6. Verify the Solution

- Check that the total number of games (wins + losses) equals 22:
  - Wins: 15
  - Losses: 7
  - Total: \( 15 + 7 = 22 \), which matches the given total.

Thus, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\).",0,False,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. This is the amount she was earning before any salary increase due to her tenure at the company.

### 2

According to the company's policy, Sylvie receives a 10% increase in her salary after completing five years of service. This increase is based on her initial salary.

### 3

Calculate the amount of the salary increase:  
10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.

Ryan plants 2 flowers each day. Over the course of 15 days, the total number of flowers he plants can be calculated by multiplying the number of flowers planted per day by the number of days.

\[ \text{Total flowers planted} = 2 \, \text{flowers/day} \times 15 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Total flowers planted} = 30 \, \text{flowers} \]

# 2. Account for the flowers that did not grow

Out of the 30 flowers that Ryan planted, 5 did not grow. To find out how many flowers actually grew, subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted.

\[ \text{Flowers that grew} = 30 \, \text{flowers} - 5 \, \text{flowers} \]

\[ \text{Flowers that grew} = 25 \, \text{flowers} \]

- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
- Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

**Step 2** Relate the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold to the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

- Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
- This is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- Let \( x \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- Therefore, \( 300 = 50 \times x \).

**Step 3** Solve for the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

- From the equation \( 300 = 50 \times x \), solve for \( x \).
- Divide both sides by 50: \( x = \frac{300}{50} \).

### 1. Convert Distances to Feet

- Steve lives 3 miles from school. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, Steve's distance in feet is \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet.
  
- Tim lives 2 miles from school. Therefore, Tim's distance in feet is \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet.

### 2. Calculate Steve's Travel Time

- Steve bikes at a speed of 440 feet per minute. To find the time it takes for Steve to get home, divide the distance by his speed: 

  \[
  \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}

### 2

The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.

### 3

Three pigeons then ate 3 fries each. Therefore, the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.

After the raccoon, ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \).

Calculate the total number of eggs Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

### 2

Determine how many eggs Sandra receives each time she babysits. According to the problem, she receives 9 eggs per babysitting session.

### 3

Calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit to obtain at least 45 eggs. Divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/session}} = 5 \text{ sessions} \]

### 4

Since the division results in a whole number, Sandra needs to babysit exactly 5 times to get the required number of eggs.

### 1. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

- A six-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6.
- The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
- There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

### 2. Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

- The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
- Probability = 3/6 = 1/2.

### 3. Calculate the probability of rolling an even number

- The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
- There are 3 favorable outcomes (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

### 4. Determine the probability of rolling an even number

- The probability of rolling an even number is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
- Probability = 3/6 = 1/2.

### 5. Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

- To roll two even numbers in a row, Jerry must roll an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll.
- The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2.
- The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.
- The probability of both events occurring is the product of their probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

### 6. Compare the probabilities

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 1/2.
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/4.

### 7. Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3

- To find how much more likely one event is compared to another, divide the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event.
- (1/2) / (1/4) = 2.

### 8. Express the result as a percentage

- The result of 2 means that rolling a number greater than 3 is twice as likely as rolling two even numbers in a row.

### 1. Define the Variables

- Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

### 2. Calculate the Total Cost

- The cost per bag is $20.
- The transportation cost per bag is $2.
- Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.
- The total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 22x \) dollars.

### 3. Calculate the Total Revenue

- The selling price per bag is $30.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \) dollars.

### 4. Calculate the Profit

- Profit is defined as total revenue minus total cost.
- The profit from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x - 22x = 8x \) dollars.

### 5. Set Up the Profit Equation

- We know the trader made a total profit of $400.
- Therefore, we set up the equation: \( 8x = 400 \).

### 6. Solve for \( x \)

- Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
  \]

### 7. Verify the Solution

- Calculate the total cost for 50 bags: \( 22 \times 50 = 1100 \) dollars.
- Calculate the total revenue for 50 bags: \( 30 \times 50 = 1500 \) dollars.
- Calculate the profit: \( 1500 - 1100 = 400 \) dollars, which matches the given profit.

- Tom starts with 50 trees.

### 2

- Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees.
- Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

### 3

- Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

### 2

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had. Since she initially had 20 cards, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards in the first month.

### 3

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. Since she collected 60 cards in the first month, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards in the second month.

### 4

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

### 1

Define variables for the number of chickens:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

### 2

Set up the equation for the total number of eggs produced per day:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so they produce \( 3r \) eggs in total.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs each, so they produce \( 5w \) eggs in total.
- The total number of eggs collected per day is 42.

Thus, the equation is:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

### 3

Use the information about the relationship between the number of chickens:
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

### 4

Substitute the expression for \( w \) from Step 3 into the equation from Step 2:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

### 5

Simplify and solve the equation:
- Distribute the 5:
  \[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
- Combine like terms:
  \[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
- Subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[ 8r = 32 \]
- Divide by 8:
  \[ r = 4 \]

### 6

Verify the solution:
- If \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 6 \).
- Check the total number of eggs:
  \[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

### 1

First, we need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know from the problem statement that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies.

- Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
- Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can write the equation:  
  \[
  2R = 54
  \]

### 2

Solve the equation for \( R \) to find out how many candies Robert has.

- Divide both sides of the equation by 2:  
  \[
  R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
  \]

### 3

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. The problem states that James has 6 more candies than Robert.

- Let \( J \) represent the number of candies James has.
- We can write the equation:  
  \[
  J = R + 6
  \]

### 4

Substitute the value of \( R \) (which is 27) into the equation to find \( J \).

- Calculate:  
  \[
  J = 27 + 6 = 33
  \]

### 5

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies.

- Calculate the difference:  
  \[
  54 - 33 = 21

### 1. Determine the number of pen pals Mike currently has.

- Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
- Therefore, he currently has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

### 2. Calculate the total number of letters Mike sends each week.

- Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week.
- Mike responds to each letter he receives.
- Therefore, Mike sends \(3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} = 6\) letters per week.

### 3. Determine the total number of pages Mike writes each week.

- Each letter is 5 pages long.
- Therefore, Mike writes \(6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30\) pages per week.

### 4. Calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week.

- Mike writes at a rate of 1 page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, writing 30 pages takes \(30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180\) minutes.

### 5. Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours.

- There are 60 minutes in an hour.

### 1

First, determine how many times Anne went down the slide. We know that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down 30 times.

### 2

Calculate 30% of Mitchel's slide count. This is done by multiplying 30 by 0.30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

### 3

Subtract the result from Mitchel's total to find out how many times Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

### 4

Now, calculate how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne.

### 5

Multiply Anne's slide count by 4 to find Robert's slide count:

First, determine the number of lines in the first scene. The problem states that the first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Since the solo song has 54 lines, the first scene has:

\[ 54 \times 2 = 108 \text{ lines} \]

### 2

Next, calculate how many of the lines in the first scene are Sean's. The problem states that only a third of the lines in the first scene are his. Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are:

\[ \frac{108}{3} = 36 \text{ lines} \]

### 3

Now, determine the number of lines in the second scene. The problem states that the second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Since the solo song has 54 lines, the second scene has:

\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]

### 4

Calculate how many of the lines in the second scene are Sean's. The problem states that four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are his. Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

### 5

Finally, add up all the lines Sean has to memorize. This includes his lines from the first scene, the second scene, and the solo song. Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:

\[ 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} + 54 \text{ (solo song)} = 138 \text{ lines} \]

- Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20.
- This is given as a starting point for understanding their current age relationship.

### 2

- In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will be 10 years older than they are now.
- This means each of their ages will increase by 10.

### 3

- To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages.
- Therefore, the increase in their combined age will be 10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco.

279,"# Solving the Age Problem

1. **Define Variables**  
   Let \( R \) represent Ruby's current age and \( S \) represent Sam's current age.

2. **Set Up the First Equation**  
   According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This can be expressed as:  
   \[ R = 6S \]

3. **Set Up the Second Equation**  
   In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be expressed as:  
   \[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

4. **Substitute the First Equation into the Second**  
   Substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:  
   \[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

5. **Simplify the Second Equation**  
   Distribute the 3 on the right side:  
   \[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

6. **Solve for \( S \)**  
   Rearrange the equation to isolate \( S \):  
   \[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]  
   \[ 3S = 18 \]  
   \[ S = 6 \]

7. **Verify the Solution**  
   Check the solution by substituting \( S = 6 \) back into the original conditions:  
   - Ruby's current age: \( R = 6 \times 6 = 36 \)  
   - In 9 years, Ruby's age: \( 36 + 9 = 45 \)  
   - In 9 years, Sam's age: \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)  
   - Check if Ruby's age is 3 times Sam's age: \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \), which is true.

Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones in the necklace. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 gemstones per necklace, multiply the number of gemstones by the length of each gemstone:

\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

### 2

Determine the remaining length that needs to be filled with sterling silver beads. Subtract the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

\[ 25 \text{ inches (total length)} - 8 \text{ inches (gemstones)} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

To determine how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, we first need to understand how pages are arranged on a single piece of paper. Each piece of paper, when folded, contains 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back.

### 2

Given that each piece of paper holds 4 pages, we can calculate the total number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper.

### 3

For a 32-page tabloid, the calculation is as follows: \( \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper} \).

### 4

This calculation assumes that the pages are arranged in such a way that they can be printed on both sides of each piece of paper, which is typical for a tabloid format.

### 5

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper required for a 32-page tabloid is 8.

354,"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from her jobs and add that to her current savings. Then, we subtract this total from the cost of the phone.

### 1. Calculate earnings from the first job

- Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job.
- She works 20 hours at this job.
- Total earnings from the first job: \(10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars}\).

### 2. Calculate earnings from the second job

- Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job.
- She works 15 hours at this job.
- Total earnings from the second job: \(5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars}\).

### 3. Calculate total earnings from both jobs

- Total earnings from both jobs: \(200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars}\).

### 4. Calculate total savings including current savings

- Annabelle already has $80 in her savings.
- Total savings including earnings: \(80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars}\).

### 5. Calculate the remaining amount needed

- The phone costs $400.
- Remaining amount needed: \(400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars}\).

- Each gumball costs $0.05.
- Billy bought 40 gumballs.
- Total cost of gumballs = 40 gumballs × $0.05/gumball = $2.

**Step 2** Determine how much money Billy had left after buying candy.

- Billy spends half of his change on gumballs.
- Let \( x \) be the amount of money he had left after buying candy.
- Half of \( x \) is spent on gumballs, so \( \frac{x}{2} = 2 \).
- Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 4 \).

**Step 3** Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy.

- Billy started with $10.
- After buying candy, he had $4 left.
- Therefore, the amount spent on candy = $10 - $4 = $6.

**Step 4** Determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

- The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
- Billy spent $6 on candy.
- Pounds of candy bought = $6 ÷ $1.5/pound = 4 pounds.

### 1. Initial Sales on Friday

- The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.

### 2. Sales on Saturday

- On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
- Therefore, the number of shoes sold on Saturday is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) pairs.

### 3. Sales on Sunday Before Returns

- On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday.

Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

# 2. Calculate total revenue from selling lemonade

Millie sells each cup for $1. If she sells all 36 cups, her total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

# 3. Calculate total cost of supplies

Millie spends $18 on supplies to make the lemonade.

# 4. Calculate total profit

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Therefore, Millie's total profit is:

\[ \$36 \text{ (revenue)} - \$18 \text{ (cost)} = \$18 \]

# 5. Calculate total hours spent selling lemonade

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To sell all 36 cups, the time spent is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \div 4 \text{ cups/hour} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

# 6. Calculate profit per hour

To find the profit per hour, divide the total profit by the total hours spent:

\[ \$18 \text{ (total profit)} \div 9 \text{ hours} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

### 2

Next, calculate double the number of books that Wendy wants to place. Since she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, we need to find the number of books that would fill the shelving system completely.

### 3

Let \( x \) be the number of books Wendy initially considers. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double this number. Therefore, the equation is:

\[ 2x + 20 = 36 \]

### 4

Solve the equation for \( x \) to find the initial number of books Wendy considers.

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 16 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 8 \]

### 6

Now, calculate the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, which is 20 more than double the initial number of books:

### 1. Determine the total amount needed

Mark wants to buy a bike that costs $300. He currently has $50 in his bank account. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to save.

### 2. Calculate the additional amount required

Subtract the amount Mark already has from the total cost of the bike:

\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ hours/month} \]

### 2

Determine the total number of hours worked by all employees in May. With 40 employees working 160 hours each, the total number of hours is:

\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 160 \text{ hours/employee} = 6400 \text{ hours} \]

### 3

Calculate the total payment for all employees in May. Each employee earns $15 per hour, so the total payment for May is:

\[ 6400 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$96,000 \]

### 4

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.

### 2

Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.

### 3

Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

### 4

Joanne's total apple count is the sum of apples from all tree types: \( 30 + 15 + x \).

### 5

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.

### 6

Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

### 7

Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees, so her total apple count is \( 60 + 45 = 105 \).

### 8

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we have the equation: 

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

### 9

Simplify the equation:

\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]

### 1

Define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

### 2

Set up the first equation based on the number of heads:
- Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is the sum of camels and dromedaries.
- Therefore, the equation is:  
  \[ c + d = 180 \]

### 3

Set up the second equation based on the number of humps:
- Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.
- The total number of humps is given as 304.
- Therefore, the equation is:  
  \[ 2c + d = 304 \]

### 4

Solve the system of equations:
- We have the two equations:  
  \[ c + d = 180 \]  
  \[ 2c + d = 304 \]

### 5

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
- \((2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180\)
- This simplifies to:  
  \[ c = 124 \]

### 6

Substitute the value of \( c \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):
- \( 124 + d = 180 \)
- Solving for \( d \) gives:  
  \[ d = 56 \]

### 7

Verify the solution:
- Check the number of humps:  
  \[ 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]
- The calculations are consistent with the given conditions.

**Step 1**: Define the variables.

- Let \( x \) be the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny originally had.

**Step 2**: Determine how many cards Kenny sells.

- Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them.

**Step 3**: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cards.

- Each card is sold for $1.5, so the revenue from selling \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x \).

**Step 4**: Set up the equation based on the problem's conditions.

- Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and $50 for spending cash, totaling $150. Therefore, the equation is:
  \[
  1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 150

**Step 5**: Simplify and solve the equation.

- Simplify the left side of the equation:

- Therefore, the equation becomes:
  \[
  x = 150

**Step 6**: Verify the solution.

- If Kenny had 150 cards, he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \times 150 = 100 \) cards.
- Selling 100 cards at $1.5 each gives him $150, which matches the amount needed for the ticket and spending cash.

1. **Determine the weight of each piece of cake.**

   - The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces.
   - The cake is cut into 8 equal pieces.
   - Therefore, each piece weighs \( \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \) ounces.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the pieces eaten.**

   - Rory eats 1 piece, and her mom eats 1 piece.
   - Together, they eat \( 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \) ounces of cake.

3. **Calculate the weight of the remaining cake.**

   - The original cake weighs 20 ounces.
   - The total weight of the pieces eaten is 5 ounces.
   - Therefore, the remaining cake weighs \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) ounces.

### 1

Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional loose eggs. Since a dozen equals 12, we calculate the total eggs from the dozens and add the loose eggs:

\[
4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[
48 \text{ eggs} + 2 \text{ eggs} = 50 \text{ eggs}

### 2

Determine how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with the total number of eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs:

- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.

**Step 3** Calculate the total value of aluminum cans Grayson drinks in one week.

- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week.
- Total value from aluminum cans per week = 3 cans × 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

**Step 4** Calculate the total value of plastic bottles Grayson drinks in one week.

- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles per week.
- Total value from plastic bottles per week = 5 bottles × 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

**Step 5** Calculate the total value Grayson earns from recycling in one week.

- Total value per week = Value from aluminum cans + Value from plastic bottles = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

**Step 6** Calculate the total value Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month.

- Total value in four weeks = 21 cents/week × 4 weeks = 84 cents.

### 1

Define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
- The number of cookies Matt can have is \(\frac{c}{2} + 2\).

### 2

Set up the equation based on the problem statement:
- Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies.
- Therefore, the equation is \(\frac{c}{2} + 2 = 5\).

### 3

Solve the equation for \( c \):
- Subtract 2 from both sides: \(\frac{c}{2} = 3\).

### 4

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
- \( c = 6 \).

### 5

Verify the solution:
- If Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, he can have \(\frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\) cookies.
- This matches the total number of cookies Matt wants to eat.

Thus, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is \(\boxed{6}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is \(10 \times 12 = 120\) inches.

**Step 2** Calculate the combined length of the remoras in inches.

- Each remora is 6 inches long.
- There are 2 remoras, so their combined length is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.

**Step 3** Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.

- The combined length of the remoras is 12 inches.
- The shark's length is 120 inches.
- The percentage is calculated as \(\left(\frac{12}{120}\right) \times 100\).

**Step 4** Perform the division and multiplication to find the percentage.

- We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers.
- We need to find the total number of students at that grade level.

**Step 2** Set up the equation

- Let \( x \) be the total number of students.
- According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the students have a desktop computer.
- Therefore, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the students do not have a desktop computer.

**Step 3** Relate the fraction to the number of students without computers

- We know that \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the students do not have a desktop computer, and this number is given as 20 students.
- Therefore, we can set up the equation: \(\frac{1}{4} \times x = 20\).

**Step 4** Solve for the total number of students

- To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate \( x \).
- This gives us: \( x = 20 \times 4 \).

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is \(2 \times 4.00 = 8.00\) dollars.

### 2. Apply the buy one get one free discount

- With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only needs to pay for one pack when she buys two.
- Therefore, the cost after this discount is \(4.00\) dollars for the two packs.

### 3. Apply the $2.00 coupon

- Heather has a $2.00 coupon that can be applied to her purchase.
- Subtract the coupon value from the discounted price: \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

### 4. Calculate the total number of razors

- Each pack contains 4 razors.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so she gets \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors in total.

### 5. Calculate the cost per razor in dollars

- The total cost after all discounts is $2.00.
- Divide this cost by the total number of razors: \(\frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25\) dollars per razor.

### 6. Convert the cost per razor to cents

- Since 1 dollar equals 100 cents, multiply the cost per razor in dollars by 100 to convert it to cents: \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents per razor.

527,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Let's break it down step by step.

### 1

First, determine how long it takes for one person to paint a whole house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house.

- Time for one person to paint a whole house = 5 days * 2 = 10 days.

### 2

Next, calculate the total amount of work (in terms of house-painting) that needs to be done. Painting a whole house is considered as 1 unit of work.

- Total work = 1 whole house.

### 3

Now, determine the rate at which one person works. Since one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, their rate of work is:

- Rate of one person = 1 house / 10 days = 0.1 house per day.

### 4

Calculate the combined rate of work for 5 people. Since each person works at a rate of 0.1 house per day, 5 people working together would have a combined rate of:

- Combined rate of 5 people = 5 * 0.1 house per day = 0.5 house per day.

### 5

Determine how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since their combined rate is 0.5 house per day, it would take them:

- Time for 5 people to paint a whole house = 1 house / 0.5 house per day = 2 days.

### 6

Finally, convert the time from days to hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house is:

- Total hours = 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours.

Thus, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \boxed{16}.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

### 1

- Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Therefore, the number of sofas Ophelia has is \( C_O - 2 \).

### 2

- We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- So, we can set up the equation: \( C_O - 2 = 20 \).

### 3

- Solve the equation for \( C_O \):
  \[
  C_O - 2 = 20 \\
  C_O = 20 + 2 \\
  C_O = 22
  \]
- Ophelia has 22 chairs.

### 4

- Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
- According to the problem, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
- Therefore, \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).

### 5

- Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Therefore, the number of sofas Jenna has is \( C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

### 6

- Now, calculate the total number of sofas:
  - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
  - Jenna has 64 sofas.
  - Total sofas = \( 20 + 64 = 84 \).

### 7

- Calculate the total number of chairs:
  - Ophelia has 22 chairs.
  - Jenna has 66 chairs.
  - Total chairs = \( 22 + 66 = 88 \).

### 8

- Finally, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
  - Total sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

### 1. Determine the number of days in April

- April has 30 days.

### 2. Define variables for daily savings

- Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
- Therefore, Elvis saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

### 3. Calculate the total savings for each half of the month

- The first half of April consists of 15 days, so the total savings for the first half is \( 15x \).
- The second half of April also consists of 15 days, so the total savings for the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

### 4. Set up the equation for the total savings

- The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

### 5. Set the equation equal to the monthly target

- Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so we set up the equation:  
  \[
  45x = 1125

### 6. Solve for \( x \)

- Divide both sides of the equation by 45 to find \( x \):  
  \[
  x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25

### 7. Calculate the daily savings for the second half

- Since Elvis saves twice as much daily in the second half, the daily savings for the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Thus, the amount Elvis has to save for each day in the second half of the month is \(\boxed{50}\).",0,False,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}

Since Jeff also walks back home, he covers another 3 miles on his return journey.

Each day Jeff works, he walks a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, which sums up to 6 miles per day.

Jeff works 5 times a week. Therefore, to find out how many miles he walks in a week, we need to multiply the daily walking distance by the number of days he works.

### 5

Multiply the daily walking distance (6 miles) by the number of workdays in a week (5 days):  
\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week} \]

Mark was unwell for 3 months, and during each of these months, he lost 10 pounds. 

### 2

To find out the total weight loss over the 3 months, multiply the monthly weight loss by the number of months:  
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

### 3

Mark's final weight after the 3 months of weight loss was 70 pounds.

### 4

To find Mark's initial weight before he started losing weight, add the total weight loss to his final weight:

- James's play set contains 80 toys.

### 2. Calculate the size of the sorted play set Jonathan wants

- Jonathan wants a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.
- Therefore, the size of Jonathan's desired play set is \(5 \times 80 = 400\) toys.

### 3. Set up the equation for Jonathan's current number of toys

- Let \(x\) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach his desired play set size.
- Therefore, the equation is \(x + 2 = 400\).

### 4. Solve the equation for \(x\)

- Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:  
  \(x + 2 - 2 = 400 - 2\)

- Simplify the equation:  
  \(x = 398\)

### 5. Conclusion

- Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

580,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to find the correct setting for a recipe that requires 520 degrees.

### 1. Determine the actual temperature when set to 450

- Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

### 2. Calculate the percentage error

- The percentage error can be calculated using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
  \]
- Substituting the given values:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
  \]

### 3. Apply the percentage error to the new recipe temperature

- The recipe calls for 520 degrees. We need to find the set temperature \( x \) such that the actual temperature is 520 degrees with the same 4% error.

### 4. Set up the equation for the new temperature

- The actual temperature should be 4% more than the set temperature:  
  \[
  520 = x + 0.04x
  \]

### 5. Solve for the set temperature \( x \)

- Simplify the equation:  
  \[
  520 = 1.04x
  \]
- Solve for \( x \):  
  \[
  x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500

### 1. Base Price of the Truck

- The base price of the truck is given as $30,000.

### 2. Cost of the King Cab Upgrade

- The king cab upgrade costs an additional $7,500.

### 3. Cost of the Leather Seats

- The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
- Therefore, the cost of the leather seats is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500\).

### 4. Cost of the Running Boards

- The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats.
- Therefore, the cost of the running boards is \(2500 - 500 = 2000\).

### 5. Cost of the Upgraded Exterior Light Package

- The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

### 6. Calculate the Total Cost

- Add up all the costs: base price, king cab upgrade, leather seats, running boards, and upgraded exterior light package.

- Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.

**Step 2** Calculate the cooking time for pork.

- It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
- Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

**Step 3** Calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

- The combined cooking time for pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.

**Step 4** Determine the cooking time for beans.

- Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
- Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

**Step 5** Calculate the total cooking time for all the food.

- Add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

660,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm given the total number of animal legs and heads. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( s \) represent the number of sheep.
- Let \( g \) represent the number of geese.

### 2. Set Up Equations for Heads

- Each animal has one head.
- Therefore, the total number of heads equation is:  
  \[
  s + g = 20
  \]

### 3. Set Up Equations for Legs

- Sheep have 4 legs each, and geese have 2 legs each.
- Therefore, the total number of legs equation is:  
  \[
  4s + 2g = 70
  \]

### 4. Simplify the Legs Equation

- Simplify the legs equation by dividing every term by 2:  
  \[
  2s + g = 35
  \]

### 5. Solve the System of Equations

- We now have a system of two equations:
  1. \( s + g = 20 \)
  2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)

- Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( g \):  
  \[
  (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
  \]
  \[
  s = 15
  \]

### 6. Verify the Solution

- Substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( g \):  
  \[
  15 + g = 20
  \]
  \[
  g = 5
  \]

- Check the legs equation with \( s = 15 \) and \( g = 5 \):  
  \[
  4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70
  \]

- Both equations are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

**Step 2** Set up the equation for Katarina's cookies.

- We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).

**Step 3** Set up the equation for Max's cookies.

- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so \( K = M - 5 \).
- Substitute \( K = 68 \) into the equation: \( 68 = M - 5 \).

**Step 4** Solve for Max's cookies.

- Add 5 to both sides of the equation: \( M = 68 + 5 \).
- Therefore, \( M = 73 \).

**Step 5** Set up the equation for the Cookie Monster's cookies.

- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation: \( 73 = C + 12 \).

**Step 6** Solve for the Cookie Monster's cookies.

- Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: \( C = 73 - 12 \).
- Therefore, \( C = 61 \).

**Step 7** Set up the equation for Summer's cookies.

- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so \( S = M + 23 \).

Define the variables for the ages of the twins and triplets. Let \( t \) be the age of one twin, and \( x \) be the age of one triplet.

### 2
According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
\[ t = x + 7 \]

### 3
There are two twins and three triplets. Therefore, the combined ages of the twins and triplets can be expressed as:
\[ 2t + 3x = 44 \]

### 4
Substitute the expression for \( t \) from step 2 into the equation from step 3:
\[ 2(x + 7) + 3x = 44 \]

### 5
Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 14 + 3x = 44 \]

### 6
Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 14 = 44 \]

### 7
Subtract 14 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 5x = 30 \]

### 8
Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

### 9
Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for \( t \) from step 2:
\[ t = 6 + 7 \]

Erin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream scoops, with each scoop costing $1.50.

### 2

The ice cream parlor offers a deal: buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free. This means for every 2 scoops Erin buys, she receives a total of 3 scoops.

### 3

Calculate how many sets of 2 scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, 2 scoops cost $3.00.

### 4

Divide Erin's total money by the cost of 2 scoops: $6.00 ÷ $3.00 = 2. Erin can afford 2 sets of 2 scoops.

### 5

For each set of 2 scoops purchased, Erin receives 1 additional scoop for free. Therefore, for 2 sets, she receives 2 additional free scoops.

### 6

Calculate the total number of scoops Erin gets: 2 sets × 3 scoops per set = 6 scoops.

### 1

Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches only. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, we need to convert 8 feet into inches and then add the remaining 4 inches.

\[
8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
\]

Adding the 4 inches:

\[
96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches.

### 2

Set up the equation based on the relationship given in the problem. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.

The equation is:

\[
100 = 9x + 10
\]

### 3

Solve the equation for \( x \). Start by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \).

\[
100 - 10 = 9x
\]

\[
90 = 9x
\]

### 4

Divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for \( x \).

\[
x = \frac{90}{9}
\]

\[
x = 10
\]

### 5

Conclude that the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. Therefore, the final result is:

     - Dark blue: 45  
     - Light green: 40  
     - Dark green: 50  
   - Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Blue Spools**  
   - Add the light blue and dark blue spools:  
     - Light blue: 15  
     - Dark blue: 45  
   - Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Blue Spools**  
   - Use the formula for percentage:  
     \[
     \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substitute the values:  
     \[
     \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**  
   - Simplify the fraction:  
     \[
     \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - Calculate the percentage:  
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40

   - The total number of students in the class is 50.
   - We know that 10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball.

2. **Determine Students with Unknown Preferences**

   - Subtract the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students: \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\).
   - Therefore, 35 students either like to play video games or play music.

3. **Establish Relationship for Music Lovers**

   - The problem states that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.
   - Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

4. **Calculate Students Who Like to Play Video Games**

   - Subtract the number of students who like to play music from the students with unknown preferences: \(35 - 10 = 25\).
   - Therefore, 25 students like to play video games.

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( x \) be the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.
- Let \( y \) be the number of votes against the new regulation.

### 2. Establish the Relationship Between Votes

- According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
  \[
  x = 2y
  \]

### 3. Use the Total Number of Council Members

- The total number of council members is 33, which means the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33:
  \[
  x + y = 33
  \]

### 4. Substitute the Relationship into the Total Equation

- Substitute the expression for \( x \) from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3:
  \[
  2y + y = 33
  \]

### 5. Simplify and Solve for \( y \)

- Combine like terms:
  \[
  3y = 33
  \]
- Solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 3:
  \[
  y = 11
  \]

### 6. Solve for \( x \)

- Use the relationship \( x = 2y \) to find \( x \):
  \[
  x = 2 \times 11 = 22
  \]

### 7. Verify the Solution

- Check that the total number of votes equals the number of council members:
  \[
  x + y = 22 + 11 = 33
  \]
- The solution satisfies the condition that the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against.

**Step 1** Determine the number of extra-small shirts needed.

- Krissa needs to order shirts for 11 students in size extra-small.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of small shirts needed.

- Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
- Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

**Step 3** Calculate the number of medium shirts needed.

- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
- Therefore, the number of medium shirts needed is \(22 - 4 = 18\).

**Step 4** Calculate the number of large shirts needed.

- Half as many students need size large as size medium.
- Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

**Step 5** Calculate the number of extra-large shirts needed.

- Six more students need size extra-large than large.
- Therefore, the number of extra-large shirts needed is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

**Step 6** Calculate the total number of shirts ordered.

- Add up all the shirts needed for each size: 
  - Extra-small: 11
  - Small: 22
  - Medium: 18
  - Large: 9
  - Extra-large: 15
- Total shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\).

First, identify the fraction of Pomeranians that are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.

### 2

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the number of Pomeranian girls represents one third of the total number of Pomeranians.

### 3

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we set up the equation based on the information that one third of the Pomeranians equals 6 girls:

Set up the relationships between the variables based on the problem statement:
- The first house needs half of what the second house needs: \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \).
- The third house needs double what the first house needs: \( z = 2x \).

### 3

Express the total number of cases needed for all three houses:
\[ x + y + z = 250 \]

### 4

Substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) from steps 2 into the total equation:
- Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) into \( z = 2x \) to get \( z = 2 \times \frac{1}{2}y = y \).
- Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) and \( z = y \) into the total equation: 
  \[ \frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250 \]

### 5

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}y + 2y = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}y = 250 \]

Solve for \( y \):
Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 5y = 500 \]
Divide by 5:
\[ y = 100 \]

First, determine how many books Ezra read initially. According to the problem, Ezra read 300 books in one hour.

### 2

Next, calculate how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Books read by Ezra} = 2 \times \text{Books read by Ahmed} \]

Given that Ezra read 300 books, we have:

\[ 300 = 2 \times \text{Books read by Ahmed} \]

### 3

Solve the equation for the number of books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Books read by Ahmed} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

### 4

Now, calculate the total number of books Ezra read after deciding to read 150 more books:

\[ \text{Total books read by Ezra} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

### 5

Finally, find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed together:

\[ \text{Total books read by both} = \text{Books read by Ezra} + \text{Books read by Ahmed} \]

\[ \text{Total books read by both} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

### 1. Calculate Billy's initial hourly wage

- Billy's starting wage was $10 per hour.

### 2. Calculate Billy's wage after the first raise

- After 2 months, Billy received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
- New wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

### 3. Calculate Billy's wage after the second raise

- On his first anniversary, Billy received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
- New wage = $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

### 4. Calculate Sally's starting hourly wage

- Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage.
- Sally's starting wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

### 5. Calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours

### 2

Determine the desired percentage of stuffed goats.

- Bubbles wants stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.

### 3

Set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats needed.

- Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy.
- The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).
- The number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total stuffed animals: \( x = 0.3 \times (14 + x) \).

### 4

Solve the equation for \( x \).

- Start with the equation: \( x = 0.3 \times (14 + x) \).
- Distribute the 0.3: \( x = 4.2 + 0.3x \).
- Rearrange the equation: \( x - 0.3x = 4.2 \).
- Simplify: \( 0.7x = 4.2 \).
- Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{4.2}{0.7} = 6 \).

### 5

Verify the solution.

- If Bubbles buys 6 stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + 6 = 20 \).
- The number of stuffed goats will be 6, which is 30% of 20.

Let \( S \) represent the number of cards Smendrick has. According to the problem, Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. Therefore, Becca has \( S + 12 \) cards.

### 2

Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has. The problem states that Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has. Therefore, \( S = 3P \).

### 3

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, the equation representing the total number of cards is:

\[ S + (S + 12) + P = 341 \]

### 4

Substitute \( S = 3P \) into the equation:

\[ 3P + (3P + 12) + P = 341 \]

### 5

Combine like terms:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

### 6

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

### 7

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

   - We have 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, taking 18 hours to cross a highway.  
   - We need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same highway.

2. **Determine the Speed of One Kangaroo**  
   - Since the kangaroos travel together and take 18 hours, the speed of one kangaroo is the same as the speed of the group.  
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \).

3. **Calculate the Distance**  
   - The distance \( d \) traveled by the kangaroos is given by the formula:  
     \[ d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = v \times 18 \]

4. **Determine the Speed of One Turtle**  
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.  
   - Therefore, the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

5. **Calculate the Time for One Turtle**  
   - Using the formula for distance, the time \( t \) it takes for one turtle to travel the same distance \( d \) is:  
     \[ d = \text{speed of turtle} \times t \]  
     \[ v \times 18 = \frac{v}{2} \times t \]

6. **Solve for Time \( t \)**  
   - Simplify the equation:  
     \[ 18v = \frac{v}{2} \times t \]  
     \[ 18 = \frac{1}{2} \times t \]  
     \[ t = 18 \times 2 \]  
     \[ t = 36 \]

7. **Conclusion**  
   - It will take one turtle 36 hours to cross the highway.  
   - Since all turtles travel at the same speed and independently, the time remains the same for 4 turtles.

843,"To determine how much money Craig has left after his purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and subtract that from the amount of money he initially had. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Initial Amount of Money

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills.

- Each twenty dollar bill is worth $20.
- Therefore, the total initial amount of money Craig has is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

### 2. Cost of Squirt Guns

Craig buys six squirt guns, each costing $2.

- The total cost for the squirt guns is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

### 3. Cost of Water Balloons

Craig buys three packs of water balloons, each costing $3.

- The total cost for the water balloons is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.

### 4. Total Cost of Purchases

To find the total cost of all the items Craig bought, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the cost of the water balloons.

- Total cost = Cost of squirt guns + Cost of water balloons
- Total cost = \(12 + 9 = 21\) dollars

### 5. Money Left After Purchases

Subtract the total cost of the purchases from the initial amount of money Craig had.

- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = \(40 - 21 = 19\) dollars

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is \(\boxed{19}\).",0,False,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}

847,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, given that she invested $300 at a simple interest rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

Here are the steps to find the solution:

### 1. Determine the Simple Interest Rate

- The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.
- Therefore, the interest rate per year is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 \).

### 2. Calculate the Annual Interest

- Calculate the annual interest by multiplying the original amount by the interest rate.
- Annual interest = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \).

### 3. Calculate the Total Interest for 3 Years

- Since the interest is simple, it remains the same each year.
- Total interest over 3 years = Annual interest \(\times\) Number of years.
- Total interest = \( 225 \times 3 \).

### 4. Calculate the Total Amount After 3 Years

- The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the original investment and the total interest earned.
- Total amount = Original investment + Total interest.

### 5. Perform the Calculations

- Total interest = \( 225 \times 3 = 675 \).
- Total amount = \( 300 + 675 \).

### 6. State the Final Result

- The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is the sum calculated in the previous step.

### 1. Determine the cost of one pack of bacon

- Kelly has 5 packs of bacon costing $10 in total.
- Therefore, the cost of one pack of bacon is \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) dollars.

### 2. Calculate the cost of the chicken

- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
- Since one pack of bacon costs $2, one packet of chicken costs \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
- Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) dollars.

### 3. Calculate the cost of the strawberries

- Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.
- Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

### 4. Determine the cost of one pack of apples

- Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
- Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.

### 5. Calculate the cost of the apples

- Kelly has 7 packs of apples, each costing $2.
- Therefore, the total cost for apples is \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) dollars.

### 6. Calculate the total cost of all items

- Add up the costs of all the items: bacon ($10), chicken ($24), strawberries ($12), and apples ($14).
- The total cost is \( 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \) dollars.

### 1. Identify the total runtime of the final concert.

- The problem states that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

### 2. Account for the encore performance.

- Elaina performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the final concert.

### 3. Calculate the runtime of the concert excluding the encore.

- Subtract the 15-minute encore from the total runtime of the final concert:

### 4. Understand the relationship between the final concert and usual concerts.

- The final concert, excluding the encore, is twice as long as her usual concerts.

### 5. Set up an equation to find the length of a usual concert.

- Let \( x \) be the length of a usual concert. According to the problem, the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as a usual concert:  
  \[

  \]

### 6. Solve for \( x \).

- Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the length of a usual concert:

### 7. Verify the solution.

- A usual concert is 25 minutes. The final concert, excluding the encore, is twice this length, which is \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore gives the total of 65 minutes, which matches the given runtime of the final concert.

1. **Determine Dijana's Distance**  
   Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

2. **Calculate Anis's Additional Distance**  
   Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed an additional \(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

3. **Compute Anis's Additional Distance**  
   \(\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10\) miles. So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana.

4. **Calculate Anis's Total Distance**  
   Anis's total distance is Dijana's distance plus the additional distance: \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

### 1. Determine material needed per small mask

- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, each small mask requires \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).

### 2. Calculate material for 20 small masks

- Each small mask requires 0.5 yards.
- For 20 small masks, Jo needs \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

### 3. Determine material needed per large mask

- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, each large mask requires \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).

### 4. Calculate material for 8 large masks

- Each large mask requires 0.75 yards.
- For 8 large masks, Jo needs \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

### 5. Sum total material needed

- In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of berries needed per trip.

- The sloth wants to collect a total of 24 berries.
- Since he can make 2 trips, he needs to collect \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) berries per trip.

**Step 3** Verify the calculation.

- If the sloth collects 12 berries per trip and makes 2 trips, he will collect \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) berries in total.

### 1. Determine Deanna's Age

- Deanna's age is given directly in the problem statement.
- **Deanna is 26 years old.**

### 2. Determine Marcus's Age

- Marcus is described as being five years younger than Deanna.
- Since Deanna is 26, we calculate Marcus's age as follows:
  - **Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 years old.**

### 3. Relate Marcus's Age to Leo's Age

- The problem states that Marcus is half of Leo's age.
- We can express this relationship with the equation:
  - **Marcus's age = (1/2) * Leo's age**

### 4. Set Up the Equation for Leo's Age

- Substitute Marcus's age from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3:
  - **21 = (1/2) * Leo's age**

### 5. Solve for Leo's Age

- To find Leo's age, solve the equation from Step 4:
  - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate Leo's age:
  - **Leo's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years old.**

952,"To determine how many reports Vince stapled altogether, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### 1. Determine the total time spent stapling

- Vince starts stapling at 8:00 AM and finishes at 11:00 PM.
- Calculate the total number of hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

### 2. Calculate the total number of hours

- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a span of 15 hours.
- This is calculated as follows: 11:00 PM is 23:00 in 24-hour time, and 8:00 AM is 8:00, so 23 - 8 = 15 hours.

### 3. Convert hours to minutes

- Since Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes, convert the total hours to minutes.
- 15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

### 4. Determine Vince's stapling rate

- Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.

### 5. Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes

- Divide the total minutes by the length of each interval: 900 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

### 6. Calculate the total number of reports stapled

- Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval: 60 intervals × 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

## 1. Understand the problem

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance at the concert. Kelly claims that this number is overstated by 20%.

## 2. Define the relationship

If Courtney's number is overstated by 20%, it means that the reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of attendees.

## 3. Set up the equation

Let \( x \) be the actual number of attendees. According to the problem, 48 is 120% of \( x \). This can be expressed as:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

## 4. Solve for \( x \)

To find the actual number of attendees, solve the equation for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

## 5. Perform the calculation

Calculate the value of \( x \):

\[ x = 40 \]

## 6. Verify the solution

To verify, calculate 20% of 40, which is 8. Adding this to 40 gives 48, confirming that Courtney's number was indeed 20% more than the actual number.

- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Step 2** Set up the equation for the total number of Pokemon caught.

- According to the problem, the total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339.
- Therefore, the equation is: \( A + S + W = 339 \).

**Step 3** Express Alex's Pokemon count in terms of Stan's.

- The problem states that Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
- Therefore, \( A = S + 5 \).

**Step 4** Express Stan's Pokemon count in terms of Adelwolfe's.

- The problem states that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe.
- Therefore, \( S = 4W - 13 \).

**Step 5** Substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation.

- Substitute \( A = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( A + S + W = 339 \).
- This gives: \( (4W - 13) + 5 + (4W - 13) + W = 339 \).

**Step 6** Simplify and solve the equation for \( W \).

- Simplify the equation: \( 4W - 13 + 5 + 4W - 13 + W = 339 \).
- Combine like terms: \( 9W - 21 = 339 \).
- Add 21 to both sides: \( 9W = 360 \).
- Divide by 9: \( W = 40 \).

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

**Step 2** Establish the relationship between Emil's age and his dad's age when Emil is 24.

- When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- Let Emil's dad's age when Emil is 24 be \( x \).
- Therefore, \( 24 = \frac{x}{2} \).

**Step 3** Solve for Emil's dad's age when Emil is 24.

- Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: \( 24 \times 2 = x \).
- Thus, \( x = 48 \).
- Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24.

**Step 4** Establish the relationship between Emil's age and his brother's age when Emil is 24.

- When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
- Let Emil's brother's age when Emil is 24 be \( y \).
- Therefore, \( 24 = 2y \).

**Step 5** Solve for Emil's brother's age when Emil is 24.

- Divide both sides of the equation by 2: \( \frac{24}{2} = y \).
- Thus, \( y = 12 \).
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24.

**Step 6** Calculate the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad is currently \( 48 - 5 = 43 \) years old.

### 1

Convert the width of each flower from inches to feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a flower that is 12 inches wide is equivalent to 1 foot wide.

### 2

Calculate the total space each plant occupies, including the space between plants. Each plant is 1 foot wide, and there is an additional 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Therefore, each plant occupies \(1 + 1.5 = 2.5\) feet of space.

### 3

Determine how many plants can fit in the 111-foot flower bed. Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies: \(\frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4\). Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, round down to 44 plants.

### 4

Calculate how many additional plants Pat needs to buy. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs \(44 - 17 = 27\) more plants.

### 5

Calculate the total cost for the additional plants. Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).

### 1. Calculate the total soil used by the sunflowers.

- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.
- Total soil for sunflowers = \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

### 2. Calculate the total soil used by the carnations.

- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

- Total soil used = \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

### 4. Determine the remaining soil available for roses.

- They started with a 30-pound bag of soil.
- Remaining soil = Total soil available - Total soil used.
- Remaining soil = \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

### 5. Calculate how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil.

- The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
- Calculate the number of female porcupines: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

**Step 2** Determine the number of babies born each month.

- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
- Calculate the total number of babies born each month: \( 30 \text{ females} \times 4 \text{ babies per female} = 120 \text{ babies per month} \).

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.

- There are 12 months in a year.
- Calculate the total number of babies born in a year: \( 120 \text{ babies per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1440 \text{ babies} \).

**Step 4** Calculate the total population after a year.

- The initial population is 50 porcupines.

### 1. Calculate the amount won in the second race

- Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race.
- He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
- Twice the amount lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
- Therefore, the amount won in the second race is \(10 + 1 = 11\).

### 2. Calculate the amount lost in the third race

- Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

### 2

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer. Add this growth to his original height in inches:

### 1. Calculate the total number of days worked.

- There are 7 days in a week.
- The painters worked for 3 weeks.
- Therefore, the total number of days worked is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

### 2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.

- The painters worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

### 3. Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over the entire period.

- Multiply the fraction of a day worked each day by the total number of days: 
  \[
  \frac{3}{8} \times 21 = \frac{63}{8}

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

### 2. Express the First Set in Terms of the Second Set

- According to the problem, Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).

### 3. Express the Third Set in Terms of the Second Set

- The problem states that Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

### 4. Set Up the Equation

- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
  \]

### 5. Simplify the Equation

- Combine like terms:
  \[
  2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
  \]

### 6. Eliminate the Fraction

- Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  4x + 8 + x = 38
  \]

### 7. Combine Like Terms Again

- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  5x + 8 = 38

### 8. Solve for \( x \)

- Subtract 8 from both sides:
  \[
  5x = 30
  \]

- Divide by 5:
  \[

- Begin by identifying the initial price of the car, which is $20,000 in 2007.

### 2

- Recognize that the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### 3

- Calculate the depreciation factor for one year. Since the car depreciates by 21%, the remaining value of the car each year is 79% of its value from the previous year. This can be expressed as a factor of 0.79 (since 100% - 21% = 79%).

### 4

- Determine the number of years between 2007 and 2010. This is 2010 - 2007 = 3 years.

### 5

- Use the depreciation factor to calculate the car's value over 3 years. The formula for depreciation is:  
  \[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (\text{Depreciation Factor})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

### 6

- Substitute the known values into the formula:  
  \[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

### 7

- Calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):  
  \[ 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

- Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

**Step 3** Use the given information about the number of jellyfish that change color.

- It is given that 6 jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on.
- Therefore, \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

**Step 4** Solve for \( x \).

- Multiply both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \) by 15 to solve for \( x \).
- \( x = 6 \times 15 \).

**Step 5** Calculate the total number of jellyfish.

1105,"**Step 1** Calculate Lauren's annual savings.

- Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year.
- Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

**Step 2** Determine the annual amount Lauren needs during retirement.

- Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary during retirement.
- Annual retirement need = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

**Step 3** Calculate the total amount Lauren needs for 20 years of retirement.

- Total retirement savings needed = 20 years * $40,000/year = $800,000.

**Step 4** Determine how many years Lauren needs to save to reach her retirement goal.

- Let \( x \) be the number of years Lauren needs to save.
- Total savings after \( x \) years = $20,000 * \( x \).
- Set up the equation: $20,000 * \( x \) = $800,000.

**Step 5** Solve for \( x \).

- Divide both sides of the equation by $20,000: 
  \[
  x = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
  \]

**Step 6** Calculate how many more years Lauren needs to work.

- If Lauren has already been working and saving, subtract the number of years she has already saved from 40 to find out how many more years she needs to work.
- Since the problem does not specify how many years she has already saved, assume she is starting now.
- Therefore, Lauren needs to work and save for 40 years in total.

First, determine the total length of the ribbon Marty has, which is 100 centimeters.

### 2

Next, Marty needs to cut the ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, divide the total length of the ribbon by 4.

\[ \text{Length of each part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

### 3

Now, take each of the 4 parts, which are 25 centimeters long, and divide each into 5 equal parts.

### 4

To find the length of each final cut, divide the length of each part (25 cm) by 5.

\[ \text{Length of each final cut} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

### 5

Verify the calculation by considering the total number of final cuts. Since there are 4 initial parts and each is divided into 5 parts, there will be \(4 \times 5 = 20\) final cuts.

### 6

Multiply the length of each final cut (5 cm) by the total number of final cuts (20) to ensure it equals the original ribbon length.

\[ 5 \text{ cm} \times 20 = 100 \text{ cm} \]

This confirms the calculations are correct.

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
- All workers work for 10 hours.

**Step 4** Calculate the total production of the two workers who produce 6 toys per hour.

Each of these two workers produces 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys. Therefore, together they produce 60 toys * 2 = 120 toys.

**Step 5** Calculate the total production of the two workers who produce 4 toys per hour.

Each of these two workers produces 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys. Therefore, together they produce 40 toys * 2 = 80 toys.

- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs painted by Camden.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs painted by Sarah.

**Step 2** Establish relationships based on the problem statement.

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \( A = M \).
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so \( C + S = 30 \).
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

**Step 3** Use the total number of eggs painted to form an equation.

- The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

**Step 4** Substitute known relationships into the total equation.

- Since \( A = M \), substitute to get \( 2A + C + S = 56 \).

**Step 5** Substitute the relationship between Camden and Sarah into the equation.

- From \( C = S + 12 \), substitute to get \( 2A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \).

**Step 6** Simplify the equation to find the number of eggs Sarah painted.

- Simplify to \( 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \).

- From \( C + S = 30 \) and \( C = S + 12 \), substitute to get \( (S + 12) + S = 30 \).
- Simplify to \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
- Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
- Divide by 2: \( S = 9 \).

**Step 8** Calculate the number of eggs Camden painted.

1130,"1. **Calculate the number of groups:**  
   Nik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8. To find the number of groups, divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per group:  
   \[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]  
   So, there are 25 groups of crayons.

2. **Determine the number of boxes:**  
   Since each group of 8 crayons is put into one box, the number of boxes needed is equal to the number of groups. Therefore, Nik needs 25 boxes.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**  
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:  
   \[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**  
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:  
   \[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of crayons and boxes in ounces:**  
   Add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes:  
   \[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

6. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**  
   There are 16 ounces in a pound. To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, divide by 16:  
   \[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

- Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
- Therefore, 5 bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand (since 100% / 20% = 5).

**Step 2** Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people.

- If 5 bottles are needed for one person, then for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

**Step 3** Determine the current production capacity of Hortex.

- Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day.

**Step 4** Calculate the additional number of bottles needed.

- To satisfy the demand of 11500 bottles, and given that Hortex can produce 4200 bottles, the additional number of bottles needed is 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

First, determine the amount of paint that is yellow. Since half of the mural is yellow, and the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the yellow paint accounts for half of this total.

\[ \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, divide the remaining paint equally among these three colors.

**Step 1**: Define Variables

- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

**Step 2**: Translate the First Condition

- Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
- Seven years from now, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \).
- Therefore, Wendy's age is \( W = 5(C + 7) \).

**Step 3**: Translate the Second Condition

- In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
- In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
- Wendy's current age is \( W \).
- Therefore, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \).

**Step 4**: Set Up the Equations

- From Step 2: \( W = 5(C + 7) \).
- From Step 3: \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \).

**Step 5**: Substitute the First Equation into the Second

- Substitute \( W = 5(C + 7) \) into \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \).
- This gives: \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \).

- Jay can build 20 snowballs in one hour.
- This means he builds \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) snowballs per minute.

### 2

- Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
- This means \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs melt per minute.

### 3

- The net rate of snowball production is the rate of building minus the rate of melting.
- Net rate = \( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} \).

### 4

- To find a common denominator, convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to \( \frac{5}{15} \).
- Net rate = \( \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \).

- Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it was released 20 years ago.
- If the current year is 2023, then Digimon was released in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

**Step 2** Calculate John's age in 2003.

- John is currently 28 years old.
- To find John's age in 2003, subtract the number of years since 2003 from his current age: 28 - (2023 - 2003) = 28 - 20 = 8.

**Step 3** Establish the age relationship between John and Jim in 2003.

- In 2003, John was twice as old as Jim.
- Let Jim's age in 2003 be \( x \).
- Therefore, John's age in 2003 was \( 2x \).

**Step 4** Solve for Jim's age in 2003.

- From Step 2, we know John's age in 2003 was 8.
- Set up the equation: \( 2x = 8 \).
- Solve for \( x \): \( x = 8 / 2 = 4 \).

**Step 5** Calculate Jim's current age.

- Jim was 4 years old in 2003.
- To find Jim's current age, add the number of years since 2003 to his age in 2003: 4 + (2023 - 2003) = 4 + 20 = 24.

- On the first day, 38 bandages were used.
- On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day.
- Therefore, the number of bandages used on the second day is \(38 - 10 = 28\).

**Step 2** Calculate the number of bandages used on the third day.

- A bulk pack contains 50 bandages.
- On the third day, they used half a pack.
- Therefore, the number of bandages used on the third day is \(50 \times 0.5 = 25\).

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days.

- Total bandages used = bandages used on the first day + bandages used on the second day + bandages used on the third day.
- Total bandages used = \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\).

**Step 4** Determine the total number of bandages ordered.

- On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- Total bandages ordered = \(50 + 100 = 150\).

**Step 5** Calculate the initial number of bandages.

- Let \(x\) be the initial number of bandages.
- The equation based on the problem is: initial bandages + ordered bandages - used bandages = remaining bandages.
- Therefore, \(x + 150 - 91 = 78\).

**Step 6** Solve for the initial number of bandages.

- Simplify the equation: \(x + 59 = 78\).
- Subtract 59 from both sides: \(x = 78 - 59\).
- Therefore, \(x = 19\).

**Step 1** Define the variables.

- Let \( x \) be the length of the shorter piece in feet.
- Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, it can be expressed as \( 4x \).

**Step 2** Set up the equation.

- The total length of the board is 40 feet. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board.
- This gives us the equation: \( x + 4x = 40 \).

**Step 3** Simplify the equation.

- Combine like terms in the equation: \( 5x = 40 \).

**Step 4** Solve for \( x \).

- Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate \( x \): 
  \[
  x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
  \]

**Step 5** Calculate the length of the longer piece.

- Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, multiply \( x \) by 4:
  \[
  4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
  \]

**Step 6** Verify the solution.

- Check that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces equals the total length of the board:

- Total treats needed = 5 people × 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

**Step 2** Define variables for the number of cupcakes and brownies.

- Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
- The number of brownies is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, so the number of brownies is \( 3c - 2 \).

**Step 3** Set up an equation based on the total number of treats.

- The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies.
- Therefore, \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \).

**Step 4** Simplify and solve the equation for \( c \).

- Combine like terms: \( c + 3c - 2 = 10 \) simplifies to \( 4c - 2 = 10 \).
- Add 2 to both sides: \( 4c = 12 \).
- Divide both sides by 4: \( c = 3 \).

**Step 5** Verify the solution.

- If \( c = 3 \), then the number of brownies is \( 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \).
- Total treats = 3 cupcakes + 7 brownies = 10 treats, which matches the requirement.

   - Madeline ate 6 grapes.
   - Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.
   - Therefore, her brother used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.

2. **Calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother.**

   - Madeline used 6 grapes.
   - Her brother used 30 grapes.
   - Total grapes used by both: \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.

3. **Determine the number of grapes used by their mother for pies.**

   - The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie.
   - Their mother made 4 pies.
   - Therefore, she used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

4. **Calculate the total number of grapes initially.**

   - The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the initial number of grapes.
   - Total grapes used: \(36 + 48 = 84\).

First, determine the time it takes John to solve the first side of the Rubik's cube. According to the problem, it takes him 5 minutes to solve the first side.

### 2

Next, calculate the time it takes to solve the second side. The problem states that the second side takes twice as long as the first side. Therefore, it takes John \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes to solve the second side.

### 3

Similarly, calculate the time it takes to solve the third side. Like the second side, the third side also takes twice as long as the first side. Thus, it takes John another 10 minutes to solve the third side.

### 4

Now, determine the time it takes to solve the fourth side. The problem states that the last two sides each take half as long as the first side. Therefore, it takes John \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes to solve the fourth side.

### 5

Calculate the time it takes to solve the fifth side. Like the fourth side, the fifth side also takes half as long as the first side. Thus, it takes John another 2.5 minutes to solve the fifth side.

- The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, 6 lemons are needed for 1 gallon of lemonade.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons of lemonade.

- Tim plans to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
- Each gallon requires 6 lemons.
- Therefore, for 4 gallons, Tim needs \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons.

**Step 3** Determine the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart.

- The extra gallon is twice as tart, meaning it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
- Normally, 1 gallon requires 1 cup of juice, which is 6 lemons.
- Therefore, the extra gallon requires \(2 \times 6 = 12\) lemons.

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of lemons needed for all the lemonade.

- Tim needs 24 lemons for the 4 regular gallons.
- He needs an additional 12 lemons for the extra tart gallon.

### 1

Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days.

\[
6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

### 2. Set Up Equations

- We know the total number of animals is 20:  
  \[
  c + w = 20
  \]

- Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70:  
  \[
  2c + 4w = 70
  \]

### 3. Simplify the Second Equation

- Simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:  
  \[
  c + 2w = 35
  \]

### 4. Solve the System of Equations

- We now have the system of equations:  
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  c + w &= 20 \\
  c + 2w &= 35
  \end{align*}
  \]

- Subtract the first equation from the second equation:  
  \[
  (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
  \]

- Simplify the result:  
  \[
  w = 15
  \]

### 5. Find the Number of Chickens

- Substitute \( w = 15 \) back into the first equation:  
  \[
  c + 15 = 20
  \]

- Solve for \( c \):  
  \[
  c = 5
  \]

### 6. Verify the Solution

- Check the total number of legs:  
  \[
  2c + 4w = 2(5) + 4(15) = 10 + 60 = 70

- The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.
