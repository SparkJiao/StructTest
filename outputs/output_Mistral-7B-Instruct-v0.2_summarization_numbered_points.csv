1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, specifically ratchet systems with asymmetric periodic potentials, are not well-understood.
2. Recent interest in ratchets is due to their potential for extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems.
3. Chaotic and Hamiltonian ratchets have been the focus of attention, with chaotic systems defined as those that are sensitive to initial conditions and have complex phase space structures.
4. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and found that the ensemble average velocity could be positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.
5. He conjectured a connection between current reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics.
6. Barbi and Salerno argued against this conjecture, showing that current reversals could occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative explanation related to the stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits.
7. The results of Barbi and Salerno assumed ergodicity, which is not always true in chaotic systems, leading to ensemble dependence and the need to understand the impact of different kinds of ensembles on the current.
8. The current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and the number of trajectories considered. It is important to discard transients and understand the location and width of the ensemble to accurately quantify the current.

1. The text discusses the results of observations and simulations of six extrasolar planetary systems, each hosting a planet with high eccentricity. The systems were chosen based on their eccentric planets and availability of data from the McDonald Observatory.
2. The authors performed orbital fits, dynamical simulations, and detection limit computations for each system. They found that test particles survived in stable orbits near the known planets' apastron distances, near the 1:2 mean-motion resonance. The results showed that hd 3651 and hd 37605 swept clean the region inside of about 0.5 au, while hd 45350 and hd 80606 removed all test particles to a distance of about 1.5 au.
3. The authors also investigated the possibility of additional low-mass planets in each system using test particle simulations and detection limit computations. They found that for hd 3651 and hd 45350, protected resonances were present, and additional short-period planets could be ruled out down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions.
4. The authors set limits on additional planets using the high-precision het data and combined it with all available published data. They found that the tightest limits were obtained for hd 3651, which had a total of 195 measurements, including 29 independent het visits. For periods less than about 1 year, they could exclude planets with m sin ≥ 2 neptune masses.
5. The authors concluded that for the six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems studied, there was no evidence for additional planets. They also showed that test particle simulations and detection limit computations could be used together to rule out planets in the dynamically stable regions of a system.

1. The Large Electron-Positron (LEP) experiments have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the decay of the @xmath1-boson into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand.
2. The agreement of LEP data with SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the @xmath1-pole.
3. The physics of the @xmath1-boson is expected to play a central role in particle physics if the next generation @xmath1 factory comes true, generating @xmath16 @xmath1 events in an operational year of gigaz.
4. The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a proposed electron-positron collider with a tunable energy ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and polarized beams in its first phase. The gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of the @xmath1 boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
5. With the high luminosity and cross section at the resonance of the @xmath1 boson, about @xmath18 @xmath1 events can be generated in an operational year of gigaz, implying that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of @xmath1-decay can be improved from @xmath18 at the LEP to @xmath19 at the gigaz.
6. The @xmath1-boson properties, especially its exotic or rare decays, should be investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential in probing new physics. Among the rare decays, the flavor changing (fc) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics.
7. The decay of the @xmath1-boson into a light higgs boson(s) is another type of rare process that was widely studied. The decay @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) with the particle @xmath0 denoting a light higgs boson was studied in [xcite], the decay @xmath23 was studied in the two-higgs doublet model (2hdm)[xcite] and the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM)[xcite], and the decay @xmath4 was studied in a model-independ",0

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem, predicts gauge coupling unification, and predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles.
2. The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector is an important problem in SUSY phenomenology, and the no-scale type Khler potential is a popular scenario for addressing this issue.
3. The no-scale type Khler potential separates the hidden sector and observable sector fields, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings (a-terms) vanish when the cosmological constant vanishes, leaving only gaugino masses as the source of SUSY breaking.
4. The no-scale structure of the Khler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and the sequestered sector scenario. In the latter, the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other, and the form of the khler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed eq.([eq : noscalekahler]).
5. The minimal scenario of the no-scale boundary condition is severely constrained by direct search bounds and the cosmological bound, but the other two scenarios, where universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale or non-universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale, are not.
6. The minimal scenario is excluded when the lightest Higgs mass is lighter than the current 95% c.l. limit from LEP 2 experiments, but the other two scenarios may still be explored at the LHC or future experiments.

Additionally, the text discusses the calculation of the Higgs mass and the chargino contribution to the Higgs mass in the no-scale scenario, as well as the possibility of detecting SUSY signals at the Tevatron run 2 or LHC experiments. The text also mentions the importance of radiative corrections and the high degeneracy of masses in the wino-like neutralino lsp and sneutrino lsp cases.",1

1. Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but these singularities can be weakened by endowing the waves with a relative cross polarization or by coupling them with an electromagnetic (EM) field.
2. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) gave a solution that possesses a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity.
3. Yurtsever showed that the CH formed in spacetimes of CPW is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and CX's solution also reveals an analogous result.
4. The electromagnetic field itself weakens the strength of a singularity in CPW, and the collision of pure EM waves has a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned.
5. Bell and Szekeres gave a solution describing the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves, and the singularity formed in the interaction region of the solution was shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation on the null boundaries but possesses essential curvature singularities which cannot be removed.
6. Cross polarization and the EM field both play roles in the nature of the resulting singularity, so a cross polarized version of the Bell-Szekeres (CPBS) solution was pursued.
7. The CPBS solution was chosen as a test ground to justify the validity of a CH stability conjecture proposed previously by Helliwell and Konkowski. Unlike the tedious perturbation analysis of CX and Yurtsever, the conjecture seems to be much economical in reaching a direct conclusion about the stability of a CH.
8. The paper discusses the spacetimes of a) single plane wave with added colliding test fields and b) colliding plane waves having non-singular interaction regions with test field added. The paper investigates the stability of quasiregular (QR) singularities that are developed at certain regions in both cases by expressing geodesics and behaviour of test EM and scalar fields by calculating stress-energy tensor in local and ppon frames.

1. Deep X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N), have detected normal galaxies with X-ray emission at cosmologically interesting distances, contributing up to 51% of the diffuse X-ray background flux in the 0.52 keV band.
2. The study presented in the text focuses on galaxies at redshifts 0.5 to 1.5, using both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, to investigate the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity in normal spiral galaxies.
3. The authors find significant detections in the soft X-ray band for all redshift bins up to z = 0.8, with nearly identical results for two different spiral galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) assumptions. They also find that the average X-ray luminosity of galaxies has not evolved significantly by z = 1.
4. The authors suggest that the increase in the average X-ray luminosity of galaxies at higher redshifts may be due to the higher prevalence of star formation, and they discuss the potential implications of their findings for star-formation models.

Additionally, the study uses stacking techniques to estimate the X-ray emission of normal galaxies that are not individually detected, and finds that many of these objects should be detectable with future ACIS exposures. The authors also investigate the radio properties of the detected galaxies and find a higher percentage of radio detections among the individually detected galaxies compared to the stacked galaxies, which is significant at the 93% level.",1

1. Quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical descriptions, with degrees of non-classicality ranging from non-separable (entangled) states to Bell-nonlocal states.
2. Non-separable states are those whose quantum states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents, and they allow for Bell-nonlocal correlations that violate Bell inequalities.
3. Bell-nonlocal correlations demonstrate the violation of local causality and are the only way to verify entanglement if either party or their detectors cannot be trusted.
4. EPR-steerability is a weaker form of non-classical correlation that allows one party to steer the state of the other by measurements on their own system.
5. EPR-steerability is a necessary condition for Bell-nonlocality, but not all Bell-nonlocal states are EPR-steerable.
6. The steering ellipsoid formalism is a mathematical tool used to study EPR-steerability, and it has been used to investigate the class of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, called t-states.
7. The authors have developed a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for projective measurements on t-states using the steering ellipsoid formalism and have found two sufficient conditions for t-states to be EPR-steerable.
8. The authors conjecture that their LHS model is optimal and that their sufficient conditions touch the necessary condition in some regions of the space of t-states, with a small gap elsewhere.

1. The first suggestion of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode binary information is attributed to Feynman, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates did not exist until the mid-1990s.
2. Encoding information in spin may offer advantages such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and potential for faster operation.
3. In 1994, a scheme was proposed for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field.
4. The ground state of the array has a specific spin configuration due to exchange interaction and anti-ferromagnetic ordering.
5. The system can get stuck in a long-lived metastable state, which is a subtle issue when dealing with input changes.
6. The real problem is the bidirectional exchange interaction, which cannot ensure unidirectional flow of logic signals.
7. In 1996, a more elegant solution was proposed by imposing unidirectionality in time through clocking.
8. The use of single electron or nuclear spin to encode qubits and realize universal quantum gates has gained popularity due to longer spin coherence times.
9. Optical readout, which does not require contacts, is a more practical approach for reading qubits compared to electrical readout.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binary systems consisting of a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
2. The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors are the lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range (the period gap) and the sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.
3. Theoretical models have not been able to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
4. Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum (AM) reach a minimum period at around 65 minutes. The probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region.
5. The mass transfer rate is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses. The minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses.
6. The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and investigate ways to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of period minimum values in the CV population. They consider a form of consequential AM loss (CAML) where the AM is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary.

1. The Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of interacting galaxies that has produced a large-scale intergalactic shock wave, observed in radio continuum and X-ray emissions. The shock wave is believed to be caused by the collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318b, with the intergalactic medium of the group.
2. The shock wave has produced a highly disturbed intragroup medium, with evidence of strong shocks and not star formation. The main elements of SQ include a primary shock defined by the 20 cm radio continuum emission, NGC 7318b, a large Seyfert 2 galaxy, and other group members.
3. A recent discovery of powerful, pure rotational hydrogen line emission from the center of the shock using the Spitzer Space Telescope has sparked intense interest in the SQ system. The emission is believed to be caused by the collision between two inhomogeneous gas flows and an efficient cooling channel for high-speed shocks as an alternative to X-ray emission.
4. Several other systems exhibiting similarly strong hydrogen emission have been discovered since the SQ detection. The low AGN and star formation power are insufficient to drive the hydrogen emission, and mechanical heating driven by the radio jet interaction with the host galaxy ISM is the favored mechanism.
5. The large-scale (630 kpc) shock wave in SQ is well-suited for studying the nature of these more distant systems, and ongoing research includes full spectral maps of SQ using the IRS instrument on Spitzer, detailed 2-dimensional excitation maps of the hydrogen emission, and studies of the relationship between UV/X-ray emission and emission from dust.

1. The short-lived radioisotope @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, as evidenced by CAIs in primitive chondritic meteorites.
2. The injection of SLRIs into the solar nebula may have occurred through a supernova or AGB star shock wave, leading to spatial heterogeneity.
3. Previous models suggest that MGU disks can reduce initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity through large-scale transport and mixing of gas and particles.
4. Stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation.
5. UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula is the leading explanation for generating oxygen anomalies, with self-shielding leading to isotopic fractionation.
6. MGU disks offer a means to accomplish early large-scale transport of refractory particles from the inner to outer solar nebula.
7. MGU disks are involved in FU Orionis outbursts, which are believed to be caused by a combination of MRI and MGU instabilities.
8. The authors present new sets of MGU disk models to examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula by a single-shot event or a continuous injection process.
9. The study aims to understand mixing and transport processes in M dwarf disks, as low-mass exoplanets are being discovered around an increasing fraction of M dwarfs, some of which are potentially habitable.

2. The search includes looking for axigluons, excited quarks, color octet technirhos, new gauge bosons, and scalar diquarks.
3. The analysis uses four triggers and combines dijet mass spectra above certain thresholds with different integrated luminosities.
4. Jets are defined using a fixed cone clustering algorithm and corrected for detector response, energy lost outside the cone, and underlying event.
5. The data is compared to a smooth function of three parameters to determine the background, and any upward fluctuations are noted.
6. The text also discusses the possibility of excited quarks contributing to the angular distribution of the fluctuations.
7. The analysis searches for topgluons, massive color octet bosons that couple largely to the third generation, and topcolor, a new symmetry that keeps the third generation quark light while the top quark is heavy.
8. The analysis uses a dijet search in the b-quark channel, which has a higher tagging efficiency and purity, and finds a cross section of 55 pb for a narrow resonance.
9. The text sets limits on new particle production using the likelihood distribution and compares the results to the production cross sections of various particles, including axigluons, excited quarks, technirhos, w and z bosons, and e6 diquarks.

Additionally, the text mentions that the large mass of the top quark suggests that the third generation may be special and introduces the concept of topcolor, a new symmetry that arises from the breaking of a coupling to the third generation and an coupling to the first two generations only. It also discusses the use of a new tagging algorithm and the potential for higher tagging efficiency and better use of double b-tagged events. The analysis also searches for topcolor in the b-quark and tau-lepton channels and sets limits on its production cross section.

1. The first observational evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was obtained from the discovery that Type Ia supernovae were fainter than expected. This has been confirmed by various observations including the cosmic microwave background, inhomogeneities in matter distribution, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, baryon acoustic oscillations, weak lensing, and gamma-ray bursts.
2. The accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, termed dark energy (DE), which is currently unknown in nature. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of DE and a dark matter (DM) component giving rise to galaxies and their large scale structures.
3. The current model, known as ΛCDM, is not satisfactory from a theoretical point of view due to the fine-tuning problem, or coincidence problem, which asks why the current values of DE and DM are so similar if their time variations are very different. Interacting DE models have been proposed to alleviate this problem.
4. Observational facilities such as the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey, Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment, Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astronomical Survey, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, South Pole Telescope, Dark Energy Survey, and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope are currently operating or under construction to test the current period of accelerated expansion and clarify the nature of DE and DM interactions.

1. Type 1 AGNs show a diversity of broad and narrow emission lines, with broad lines arising in or near an accretion disk and narrow lines like [OIII]5007 being a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame, except for ""blue outliers"" in sources with fwhm Hβ=1500-3500 and weak [OIII].
2. Broad Hβ profiles can be fit by a single Lorentz function for population A sources with the smallest broad-line widths (fwhm Hβ=1000-4000), while population B sources require two Gaussians (one unshifted and one redshifted) for a reasonable profile description.
3. Broad FeII emission has been found in Type 1 quasars since the era of photographic spectroscopy and is believed to arise in or near the emitting clouds that produce other low ionization lines.
4. The feII line width correlates with the Hβ line width over the full range where feII can be detected, and the shape of the feII 4450-4700 blue blend near [OIII]5007 can reveal the smoothness of the blend, which resolves into individual lines in population A sources and becomes much smoother in population B sources.
5. The strongest feII emission also shows a weakening of Hβ emission, as expected if the latter is collisionally quenched in the same dense medium where strong feII emission can be produced.
6. Systematic line shifts place important constraints on models for the geometry and kinematics of the broad line region, with the most famous example being a systematic blueshift of high ionization lines (e.g., CIV 1549) relative to low ionization lines (e.g., Balmer lines), especially in population A sources.
7. A recent study claimed the existence of a systematic redshift of feII relative to [OIII]5007 (and hence the Balmer lines) in a majority of Type 1 quasars, but this result has been challenged due to potential causes such as host galaxy contamination, blue outliers, and differences in how spectral signal-to-noise (s/n) was computed.

1. Nuclear multifragmentation is a topic of intense study due to potential signs of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. Theoretical calculations on this subject began in the 1980s, while the first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995.
2. The caloric curve exhibits a wide plateau-like region at around 5 MeV temperature, lasting from 3 to 10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy. This region is associated with the possible existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter.
3. Discrepancies in experimental caloric curves are due to factors such as the precision of measurements and finite-size effects. Recent reevaluations of the ALADIN group's data have brought corrections to the kinetic energies of emitted neutrons and the energies of spectator parts.
4. The microcanonical multifragmentation model is improved by refining the primary break-up part and including the secondary particle emission. The new version of the model preserves the general aspect of the caloric curve, with an important plateau-like region and clearly indicated transition regions.
5. The model can simultaneously fit the ""definitory"" characteristics of the nuclear multifragmentation phenomenon, such as the multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments and charge asymmetry. The equilibrated source sequence is evaluated, revealing a nonequilibrium part of the experimentally evaluated excitation energy growing with the increase of the bombarding energy.
6. The calculated heli caloric curve shows an excellent agreement with the experimental heli curves recently evaluated by the ALADIN group.

2. Threshold nets have recently gained attention due to their modular structure and the ability to compute important structural benchmarks like degree distribution, triangles, betweenness centrality, and the spectrum and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian.
3. Sequence nets are a broader class of nets constructed from a sequence of letters by deterministic rules of connectivity. They retain the desirable properties of threshold nets, such as modularity and easily computable structural measures, while allowing for more latitude in the types of nets that can be described.
4. There are two types of symmetries, permutation and time reversal, that can be applied to sequence nets to generate equivalent graphs. These symmetries form a symmetry group and can be combined to yield graphs with complementary or inverse connections.
5. Threshold graphs are a special case of sequence nets, and there are only three equivalence classes of two-letter sequence nets, with threshold nets being one of them. The remaining two classes also exhibit high degrees of modularity and can be related to a generalized form of threshold nets.
6. Three-letter sequence nets have 30 distinct classes, and some of them can be mapped to threshold nets with two thresholds instead of one. The mapping of sequence nets to generalized threshold graphs may be helpful in analyzing their properties.
7. Three-letter sequence nets can be analyzed for structural properties such as degree, distance, and betweenness centrality, and some of them can be mapped to generalized threshold nets. Open questions include finding which sequences lead to connected nets, whether sequence nets can always be mapped to generalized threshold nets, and what kinds of nets would result if the connectivity rules applied only to the preceding letters instead of all preceding letters.

1. The text discusses the use of subordinators in Bayesian nonconvex penalization problems under supervised learning scenarios. The authors model latent shrinkage parameters using subordinators, which are defined as stochastic processes of regularization parameters. They consider two families of compound poisson subordinators: continuous compound poisson subordinators based on a gamma random variable and discrete compound poisson subordinators based on a logarithmic random variable. Both the gamma and poisson subordinators are limiting cases of these two families of compound poisson subordinators.
2. The authors formulate a hierarchical model with multiple regularization parameters and devise an ECME algorithm for finding the sparse solution simultaneously. They also show that the latent shrinkage parameter is a stochastic process of the regularization parameter and that there is an important connection between the latent shrinkage parameter and the corresponding regularization parameter.
3. The text also discusses the use of Bernstein functions and subordinators in Bayesian sparse learning problems and applies compound poisson subordinators to Bayesian linear regression, devising an ECME algorithm for finding the sparse solution.

1. The text discusses the study of superfluid current response in superconductors, focusing on the nonlinear term and its differences between one-band and two-band superconductors.
2. The authors illustrate the generic features of the superfluid current in a one-band superconductor and extract the nonlinear term using the Eliashberg equations.
3. The authors find that dimensionality and strong electron-phonon coupling affect the nonlinear current in one-band superconductors, with strong coupling increasing the nonlinear piece near the critical temperature and giving a finite contribution at low temperatures. Impurities further reduce the nonlinearity near the critical temperature and increase it at low temperatures.
4. The authors then turn to the two-band case, where signatures of the two-band nature may occur in the nonlinear coefficients. They find that for nearly decoupled bands, a strong signature of the small gap band will appear in the nonlinear coefficients, but with increased interband coupling or interband scattering, such a signature will rapidly disappear. Intraband impurities in the smaller gap band wash out the temperature variation of the band, whereas intraband impurities in the larger gap band largely affect the nonlinearity at higher temperatures above the energy scale of the smaller gap band.
5. The authors provide a prediction for the nonlinear coefficient in the two-band superconductor MgB2 using the parameters set by band structure calculations. They find that the nonlinear coefficient is monotonically increasing in contrast to a previous prediction, and that the increased nonlinearity due to the smaller gap band is best reduced by adding impurities to the smaller gap band.
6. The authors also discuss the importance of studying nonlinear current response for device applications and for providing fundamental signatures of order parameter symmetry, such as have been examined in the case of d-wave superconductivity. They await experimental verification of their predictions.

1. The Standard Model of Elementary Particles (SM) has been successful in describing nature at the electroweak scale.
2. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle, consistent with the SM Higgs boson, strengthening the model.
3. No explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM has been reported from the LHC, but an anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) has been observed.
4. The muon g-2 anomaly, with estimated discrepancies from SM predictions, is a hint of new physics related to the muon sector.
5. The authors in this paper explore the possibility of a new gauge interaction beyond the SM for the muon.
6. The lepton symmetry is broken by the anomaly against the U(1) gauge interaction, whose effect is efficient at the early universe through the sphaleron process. If both effects are important simultaneously, the baryon asymmetry is washed out.
7. The authors calculate a condition for the washout not to occur, assuming the baryon asymmetry is produced above the electroweak scale. The condition depends on the masses and couplings of the particles involved.

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems, particularly qubits, plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.
2. The study of entanglement's essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence has attracted significant attention.
3. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) is a phenomenon where qubit entanglement terminates due to Markovian decoherence, but it is not always the final fate.
4. Some studies have observed entanglement revival after ESD in optical systems, which plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.
5. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD is always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.
6. The entanglement dynamics and distribution in bipartite partitions are determined by the time-dependent factor of single-qubit excited-state population.
7. Population trapping, a phenomenon responsible for the suppression of spontaneous emission in photonic band gap (PBG) reservoirs, can lead to the formation of bound states between qubits and their reservoirs, preventing complete entanglement transfer.
8. The condition for ESD of qubits and the accompanying ESB of reservoirs is not always satisfied, and the presence of bound states can prevent both phenomena.
9. When bound states are available, the entanglement distribution among all bipartite subsystems can be stably distributed, and the identity about the entanglement in all subsystems is always satisfied.
10. The study of entanglement distribution among bipartite subsystems of two qubits in independent amplitude-damping reservoirs is significant for understanding the physical nature of entanglement under decoherence and potential applications in quantum reservoir engineering.

1. The text discusses a study aimed at detecting correlations between gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational waves (GWs) using data from the BEPPOSAX satellite and gravitational antennas NAUTILUS and EXPLORER. The study uses a cross-correlation algorithm to cope with the unknown time difference between GRBs and GW bursts and unmodelled noise. The researchers found that the present sensitivity of the best GW antennas is not sufficient to detect a signal associated with a single GRB, but studying the sum of many events could be more realistic.
2. The text also explains the Bayesian approach used to infer the GW amplitude from the observed data. The probability density function of the GW amplitude is modeled using a Gaussian probability density function and a Jeffreys prior. However, the Jeffreys prior produces a divergence for infinite orders of magnitudes, so a cut-off is needed to obtain a finite result. The study provides upper limits for the GW amplitude and discusses the importance of choosing an appropriate prior probability density function in probabilistic results.

1. The text describes a model for studying the growth of interconnected networks in two research areas, with a focus on the distribution of intra- and cross-links. The model is based on the preferential attachment process, where new nodes attach preferentially to nodes with a higher number of connections.
2. The model is analyzed using a rate equation approach, and the time evolution of the joint distribution of intra- and cross-links is described by a rate equation. The results can be used to find other distributions, such as the total in-degree distribution.
3. The total in-degree distribution in each network is found to be a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes. The distribution of the average number of nodes with intra-links in one network is also a power-law form and depends on the coupling parameter between the networks.
4. The distribution of average nodes with incoming cross-links in one network is found by summing over the joint distribution for all its intra-links. The distribution has a power-law form, and the exponents are inversely proportional to the coupled parameters in each network. In the weak coupling case, the exponent of the cross-link distribution decreases as the coupling parameter increases.

1. The text discusses the importance of shower partons and their distributions (spd) in hadron production at large transverse momentum in high-energy nuclear collisions.
2. The traditional two-step process of hadron production involves a hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation to detected hadrons, but it is inadequate for heavy-ion collisions where recombination of partons is more appropriate, especially for soft partons.
3. The authors aim to take the first step towards a universal description of hadronization by introducing the concept of shower partons and determining their distributions to represent phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
4. Shower partons are not new, but the authors focus on their role in heavy-ion collisions where they can recombine with thermal partons, leading to a new component that has escaped theoretical attention.
5. The authors use equations ([1]) and ([2]) to determine the spd's, which depend on the specific form of the recombination function (rf) for the formation of a meson.
6. The authors select five fragmentation functions (ff) to determine five spd's, three of which form a closed set that involves no strange quarks or mesons. They use the BKK parameterization to demonstrate the importance of shower partons in heavy-ion collisions.
7. The authors also consider the strange sector and make use of two new ff's to determine two additional spd's specifying the strange quark distributions in showers initiated by non-strange and gluon partons, respectively.
8. The authors specify the rf's, which depend on the square of the wave functions of the mesons, and implement the recombination process in the same framework as the recombination model, although gluon conversion is done only implicitly.

1. Differential geometry is valuable for extracting geometric meaning from continuum vector theories.
2. The Dirac-Khler formulation of fermionic field theory using the antisymmetry of differential forms to describe the Clifford algebra is of interest.
3. To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, preferably with the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit.
4. Defining such a scheme has proven to be challenging, particularly due to the hodge star and the wedge product between forms.
5. Several discrete schemes have been proposed, each with varying success in addressing these difficulties.
6. Becher and Joos used a lattice to define operators with desirable properties but introduced translation operators to resolve non-locality.
7. Kanamori and Kawamoto used a lattice and introduced non-commutativity between fields and discrete forms to fulfill the product rule but found the need for a second orientation of form for hermitian action.
8. Balachandran et al used a quantized phase space to regularize their system, leading to a fuzzy coordinate space.
9. Adams proposed using two parallel lattices to maintain locality of the hodge star and a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product.
10. The proposal describes a local, discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space and has been thoroughly studied. In this paper, the application of this proposal to the Dirac-Khler formulation is explored, along with the implementation of chiral symmetry and flavour projection.

The authors characterize the secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (AF) cognitive relay channel and formulate the beamforming optimization as a quasiconvex optimization problem.
2. The authors propose two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes to reduce computational complexity and obtain the highest achievable secrecy rate. They assume that the relay node lies in the null space of the eavesdropper's channel and eliminate its capability of eavesdropping on the destination.
3. The text provides numerical results illustrating the performances of different beamforming schemes, comparing optimal secrecy rates and suboptimal null space beamforming schemes under both total and individual power constraints. The results show that null space beamforming achieves near-optimal performance and is a good alternative due to its lower computational burden.
4. The authors assume that the channel coefficients are complex, circularly symmetric gaussian random variables and plot optimal secrecy rates and suboptimal null space beamforming schemes as a function of the interference temperature limit. They observe that beamforming in the null space of the eavesdropper's channel achieves near-optimal performance regardless of the value of the interference temperature limit.

2. The prediction of the Higgs boson mass in the SM is strongly correlated with the top quark mass and increases quadratically as the top quark mass is increased. This correlation can be used to limit the allowed region for the Higgs boson mass in models with new physics.
3. In models with new physics, there are more parameters in the gauge/higgs sector than in the SM, and the SM tree level relation no longer holds when the theory is renormalized at one loop. Models with new physics are often written in terms of the SM Lagrangian plus an extra contribution, where @xmath9 represents contributions from new physics beyond the SM.
4. The text discusses two specific examples where the procedure of considering the contributions of the SM Lagrangian at one loop plus the tree level contributions of new physics is incorrect. The authors demonstrate that in these models, the SM is not recovered when the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale.
5. The possibility of a heavy Higgs boson that is consistent with precision electroweak data has been considered in the context of oblique corrections. A large contribution to isospin violation can offset the contribution of a heavy Higgs boson to electroweak observables such as the W boson mass.

1. The text discusses the study of phase transitions in the surface reaction model proposed by Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad for the oxidation of species over a catalytic surface. A modified version of the model with randomly distributed inert sites is considered. The text presents results obtained using site and pair approximations, as well as Monte Carlo simulations.
2. The site approximation does not give any continuous transition for all values of the concentration of inert sites and the presence of inert sites allows for the formation of nearest-neighbor pairs, explaining the absence of a continuous phase transition. The pair approximation gives two solutions, which join together at the spinodal point, and the net effect of adding inert sites is to shift the curves horizontally.
3. Monte Carlo simulations show that for large concentrations of inert sites, the transition between the active and co-poisoned states becomes continuous. The critical concentration for this transition is found to be @xmath113. The phase diagram for the zgb model with inert sites is plotted, showing a decreasing reactive window as the concentration of inert sites increases.

1. Organic molecular crystals, composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces, are emerging as excellent candidates for fabricating nanoscale devices, particularly in electronics and optoelectronics.
2. The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance. Charge transfer and energies at which it takes place need to be understood carefully.
3. Upon adsorption on a substrate, electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change due to the formation of image charges on the substrate. The presence of defects in the substrate, such as a stone-wales defect in graphene, does not significantly alter the charge transfer energies.
4. The charge transfer energies are weakly affected by the presence of other molecules in the vicinity. This behavior can be explained by a simple classical effect where the presence of other molecules induces a charge dipole that lowers the associated electrostatic potential, resulting in a reduction of the charge transfer energies.
5. The charge transfer energies can be calculated using Constrained Density Functional Theory (CDFT), which avoids the calculation of a quasi-particle spectrum and instead uses a series of total energy calculations for different charge distributions.
</summary>

Additionally, the text discusses the use of CDFT to study the adsorption of a benzene molecule on a graphene sheet, and the results show that the charge transfer energies decrease in absolute value as the molecule is brought closer to the graphene sheet, which can be described with a classical electrostatic model taking into account the true graphene dielectric constant. The presence of defects in the graphene sheet, such as a stone-wales defect, does not significantly alter the charge transfer energies. The charge transfer states are weakly affected by the presence of other molecules, and the charge transfer energies are smaller for the @xmath61 configuration due to the finite dielectric constant of the molecule between the sheet and the molecule. The calculated energy levels alignment can be obtained from a classical electrostatic model, and the results agree well with the curves predicted by the classical model using an effective dielectric constant of 2.4 for graphene.",1

1. MOPED (Multiple Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data Compression) is a patented algorithm used for compressing data and speeding up the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis. It becomes particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the parameters of the model and must be calculated and inverted at each likelihood evaluation.
2. MOPED compresses data by generating a set of weighting vectors and creating a set of moped components from the theoretical model and data. The weighting vectors must be computed at some assumed fiducial set of parameter values.
3. The text discusses a scenario where MOPED did not accurately represent the true likelihood function in the context of gravitational wave data analysis for the LISA space antenna. MOPED created a second solution that was indistinguishable in likelihood from the correct one, leading to a serious problem for parameter estimation.
4. The text also explores other scenarios where MOPED works and does not work, and discusses the criteria under which MOPED is believed to accurately represent the likelihood. An implementation of the solution provided by the authors of [xcite] is also presented.
5. MOPED has the benefit of reducing the memory requirements and the need to compute the inverse of the noise covariance matrix at each point in parameter space. However, it assumes that the covariance matrix is independent of the parameters, and can create additional peaks in the likelihood function equal in magnitude to the true one, leading to potential issues for parameter estimation.

1. The cosmological constant problem (CCP) in particle physics is a major puzzle that consists of several pieces, including the fact that the vacuum energy density can be the cosmological constant, various sources of vacuum energy, and the large radiative corrections including a cutoff scale. The experimental value of the cosmological constant is estimated to be around 10^-47 geV^4, and the vacuum energy density of the universe is given by the sum of the zero point energy density of particles and other contributions.
2. It is difficult to derive the observed cosmological constant in the framework of ordinary quantum field theory, and a radical assumption is needed to reconcile the classical and quantum descriptions. One possible assumption is that the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively, despite the coupling between graviton and matter at a microscopic level.
3. The text suggests that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy of around 10^(tev) in the framework of effective field theory, under the assumptions that the graviton couples to the potential of matter fields and the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively. External gravitons can also couple to gravitational corrections involving internal gravitons.

1. The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC, specifically the central exclusive production (CEP) process, has attracted significant attention due to its ability to directly observe the quantum numbers of centrally produced particles and measure their mass regardless of decay products.
2. Proposals exist to install forward detectors at ATLAS and CMS to detect central systems in the approximate mass range of 70 GeV to beyond 1 TeV. These detectors would allow for the observation of the SM Higgs boson and supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson in the CEP process.
3. The CEP process is schematically shown in Figure [centralexclusive], and the dominant decay channel of the Higgs boson is to a bottom quark-antiquark pair, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches due to large QCD backgrounds. However, the CEP process suppresses these backgrounds due to the color singlet selection rule.
4. The acceptance of the forward detectors is critical for this analysis, as it determines the fractional momentum losses of the outgoing protons and the center-of-mass energy of the collision. The acceptance is influenced by the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam and the aperture of the LHC beam elements between the interaction point and the forward detectors.
5. The analysis focuses on the measurement of the central exclusive production of the SM Higgs boson and a particular choice of MSSM parameters, where the lightest scalar Higgs boson has an enhanced CEP cross section and is almost degenerate in mass with the pseudo-scalar. The analysis shows that the lightest scalar Higgs boson can be observed in the CEP channel within 3 years of data taking at the LHC if suitable proton tagging detectors are installed and the current predictions for the CEP cross section are correct.

The authors derive the response functions governing the pair motion and arrive at a matrix dielectric function that describes the total screening effect under time-dependent perturbation.
2. The frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor is investigated, with the bound pair and free vortex contribution treated separately. The results show that the hall conductivity can be nonzero due to the vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process or free vortex motion even in the absence of a magnetic field. Power dissipation is also predicted.

The results depend solely on the convective ratio and are valid even without an applied magnetic field. The authors suggest that theoretical calculations of the drag coefficients, which take into account the temperature and delocalized excitations, will be useful to estimate the strength of the convective ratio.

2. Galaxy clustering is a function of both star formation history and luminosity. For low luminosity galaxies, clustering is a strong function of color, while for luminous galaxies, clustering is a strong function of luminosity. For red galaxies, clustering is a non-monotonic function of luminosity, peaking at both high and low luminosities.
3. The investigations also show that galaxy environment is independent of these properties at fixed color and luminosity. However, the scale dependence of these relationships is still being explored.
4. The study examines the dependence on scale of the relative bias of SDSS galaxies, specifically focusing on the low redshift catalog. The results demonstrate that the environments of low luminosity, red galaxies do continue to become denser as absolute magnitude increases down to absolute magnitudes of about two magnitudes less luminous than previously explored.
5. The study also finds that the smaller scales are important to the process of galaxy formation, while the larger scale environment is of little importance for the blue fraction and star formation rate. This contradicts previous findings, which may be due to differences in methods, density estimates, or tracer samples.

2. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are crucial in both two and three dimensions, reducing the zero-temperature order parameter to nearly 0.4 of the classical value in two dimensions and the Néel temperature to nearly 0.7 of the mean-field result in three dimensions for the equivalent quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
3. Recent interest includes spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet. In the random-AF model, the lattice-averaged AF order parameter appears to be enhanced for small fractions of vacancies, while spin fluctuations are enhanced by strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies.
4. A new method is presented for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the hf-level broken-symmetry state using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
5. The method is applicable in the whole interaction strength range and is illustrated with three applications: the pure model in the strong coupling limit, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-impurity concentrations in the strong coupling limit.
6. The method for obtaining quantum correction to sublattice magnetization solely in terms of transverse spin correlations is parallel to the spin-wave theory (SWT) approach but differs from the method involving self-energy corrections.

The focus is on multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation. These models can lead to features unavailable in the case of a single field, such as hybrid inflation models.
2. The text also covers the subsequent phase of energy transfer between the inflaton and other degrees of freedom, leading to the standard picture of big bang cosmology. The inflaton may decay through perturbative processes and non-perturbative parametric amplification, which can lead to explosive particle production and very efficient reheating of the universe.
3. The text discusses the renormalization of time evolution equations in a two-field system, where the mass matrix is allowed to be non-diagonal for all times and accounted for by expanding each field in terms of all of the in-state creation and annihilation operators. This allows standard techniques to be used to properly renormalize the system, and the analysis is applied to a simple reheating model and a hybrid inflation model motivated by supersymmetry.

The imaginary parts of the roots of the denominator changed with increasing pump power for nonzero reactive coupling, indicating that the normal mode splitting was solely due to the reactive coupling. The output fields depended on the behavior of the roots of the denominator, and the stokes field could be amplified by the stimulated process, generating an anti-stokes component.

2. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase, which was proposed decades ago based on the attractive interaction between quarks in the color antitriplet channel.
3. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, and the charge neutrality condition is required to form bulk matter inside them.
4. The charge neutrality condition induces a mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks, which eventually destroys the cooper pairing and may lead to a first order phase transition to the normal phase when the mismatch increases.
5. In a certain window of moderate mismatch, the system can experience a spatial non-uniform Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fudde-Ferrell (LOFF) state.
6. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system, and if it is satisfied globally and the surface tension is small, the mixed phase is favored.

8. The meissner effect, which is the expulsion of magnetic fields by superconductors, can be understood using the standard Anderson-Higgs mechanism. However, in the g2sc phase, the meissner screening masses for five gluons corresponding to broken generators become imaginary, indicating a type of chromomagnetic instability.

1. The melting phase transition of two-dimensional (2D) systems is a topic of ongoing debate, with recent advancements in the fabrication of 2D materials potentially providing clarification.
2. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is the most widely accepted theory for the melting phase transition in 2D systems, describing two separate continuous transitions as the solid transforms into a liquid.
3. The theory assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which is criticized as contradicting observations of aligned and accumulated dislocations into small angle domain walls.
4. Extensive microcanonical MD simulations of 2D Lennard-Jones systems have revealed the metastable nature of the hexatic phase, supporting PFC simulations operating on the diffusive time scale.
5. The observation of the hexatic phase is strongly linked with the thermodynamic equilibration of the system, and the necessary equilibration time depends on the measured quantity of interest.
6. In simulations of repulsive screened coulomb (Yukawa) pair potentials, the velocity distribution relaxes quickly, while the configurational temperature and long-range correlations relax much more slowly, with a strong temperature dependence.

Additionally, the text discusses the importance of increasing both system size and simulation time to accurately study the equilibration of interacting charged many-particle systems and avoid misleading conclusions.

1. The Kepler mission discovered over 4100 planetary candidates in 3200 systems, revealing that small planets are ubiquitous, particularly those with sizes between Earth and Neptune. The transition from rocky to non-rocky planets occurs near a planet radius of approximately 1.5 Earth radii, and the presence of stellar companions can significantly affect the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii.
2. The text discusses the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample. The authors present probabilistic uncertainties of the planetary radii based on expected stellar multiplicity rates and companion sizes. They find that, in the absence of spectroscopic or high resolution imaging observations, the observed planetary radii will be systematically too small.
3. The authors also explore the effectiveness of observational vetting, such as radial velocity (RV) and high resolution imaging (HRI), in reducing the uncertainties of the planetary radii estimates. They find that RV and HRI vetting can significantly improve the accuracy of the planetary radii measurements, especially for the K2 and TESS missions, which observe stars that are typically brighter and closer than those observed by Kepler.

1. The range of Hi column densities in nearby galaxy neutral gas disks is similar to those in damped Lyman-α systems (DLAs), making it attractive to map the Hi gas of DLAs in 21-cm emission and measure their total gas mass, extent, and dynamics.
2. However, present technology cannot observe the 21-cm emission of DLAs due to the weak transition probability and large distances, leaving a gap between local galaxy information and DLAs.
3. Most observers study DLAs in the optical wavelengths, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been unsuccessful. There are now hundreds of DLAs known at various redshifts, spanning a wide range of galaxy properties.
4. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe with single dish radio telescopes have resulted in accurate Hi mass measurements, which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLAs studies. The Hi mass distribution function, calculated by integrating over the Hi mass function of galaxies, can be used to determine the column density distribution function of Hi.
5. The results from a large sample of local galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WHISP) show that there is only mild evolution in the intersection cross section of Hi from redshift z=0 to intermediate redshifts. This implies that the local galaxy population explains the incidence rate of low and intermediate redshift DLAs, and there is no need for a population of hidden very low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies or isolated Hi clouds.
6. The WHISP sample allows for the calculation of cross-section weighted probability distribution functions of various galaxy parameters, providing insights into the properties of DLAs and their host galaxies, such as their luminosities, impact parameters, and metallicities.

1. Stars are primarily formed in star clusters during the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds.
2. Only a modest percentage of the gas in a star cluster is turned into stars, and the initial phases of a cluster's lifetime involve a combination of gas and stars.
3. During the onset of stellar winds and after the first supernovae explosions, enough energy is injected into the gas within the embedded cluster to remove it on timescales shorter than a crossing time, leaving the cluster out of equilibrium.
4. Recent studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in young clusters by studying their internal dynamics, but results have been discrepant, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard IMFs.
5. The youngest clusters (tens of Myr) show a significant scatter from standard IMFs, which may be due to their being out of equilibrium.
6. The authors present evidence that m82-f and ngc 1569-a, which have been reported to have non-standard stellar IMFs, are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss.
7. The authors use observations of the luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters, m82-f, ngc 1569-a, and ngc 1705-1, to test the scenario that they are out of equilibrium due to gas loss.
8. The authors find that all three clusters display an excess of light at large radii with respect to the best fitting power-law profile, which is a signature of violent relaxation after gas expulsion.
9. The authors suggest that the excess light at large radii seen in many massive young star clusters is a signature of violent relaxation after gas expulsion, indicating that these clusters have effective star formation efficiencies of around 40-50%.

Additionally, the authors use simulations to model the effects of gas expulsion on massive young clusters and find that the simulations display excess light at large radii, which is consistent with the observations.

1. The text discusses the relation between quantum fluctuation, tunneling, and decoherence in the context of a one-dimensional double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field.
2. The authors estimate the degree of coherence of the tunneling probability for various numbers of frequency components to quantitatively compare coherent and incoherent motions.
3. The perturbation strength dependence of the degree of coherence is investigated for various numbers of frequency components.
4. The text divides the type of motion of the wave packet into coherent, irregular, and transitional cases based on the value of the degree of coherence.
5. The numerical estimation suggests that there are critical values of the perturbation strength depending on the number of frequency components where the tunneling oscillation loses coherence.
6. The approximated phase diagram is roughly the same as the diagram generated by the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics.
7. The reduction of the tunneling period in the regular motion regime is investigated, and it is observed that the period decreases monotonically as the perturbation strength increases.
8. The reduction of the tunneling period can be explained by applying the Floquet theorem to the quasi-energy states and the quasi-energy as the Hamiltonian is time-periodic.
9. The increasing of the width of the stochastic layer contributes to the reduction of the tunneling period even in the polychromatically perturbed cases.

1. The text discusses the importance of understanding dissipative quantum dynamics of a system embedded in a complex environment, focusing on condensed phase systems.
2. Significant progress has been made in understanding condensed phase dynamics using prototypical models like the Caldeira-Leggett model and spin-boson model.
3. Bosonic bath models, which model the environment as a set of non-interacting harmonic oscillators, are prevalently adopted due to the argument that knowing the linear response of an environment near equilibrium should be sufficient to predict dissipative quantum dynamics.
4. However, more physical and chemical studies have suggested the essential roles of other bath models, such as fermionic and spin bath models.
5. A standard bosonic bath model fails to predict the correct electron transfer rate in donor-acceptor complexes strongly coupled to low-frequency intramolecular modes.
6. Alternative models to describe anharmonic, condensed phase environments include using a bath of non-interacting Morse or quartic oscillators and mapping anharmonic environments onto effective harmonic modes with a temperature-dependent spectral density.
7. The fermionic bath model is another prominent example, particularly for electronic transports through nanostructures like quantum dots or molecular junctions, where particle exchange occurs across the system-bath boundary.
8. The spin bath model has received increased attention due to ongoing interests in developing various solid-state quantum technologies under ultralow temperature when the phonon or vibrational modes are frozen and coupling to other physical spins, nuclear spins carried by the lattice atoms, defects, or impurities in the host material emerge as the dominant channels of decoherence.
9. The text discusses a stochastic formulation of quantum dissipation that extends to all three fundamental bath models: non-interacting bosons, fermions, and spins.
10. The stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) prescribes a simple yet general form of quantum dissipative dynamics when the bath effects are modeled as colored noises, and different bath models and bath properties are distinguished by assigning distinct noise variables and associated statistics.

1. The text discusses a molecular dynamics simulation study of the glass transition in a ni@xmath1zr@xmath2 system using the mode coupling theory (MCT). The study aims to determine the critical temperature @xmath0 from evaluating and analyzing the nonergodicity parameter, the @xmath14-parameter in the ergodic regime, and the diffusion coefficients.
2. The results show that the system exhibits a weak temperature dependence of the partial structure factors and a structural relaxation in the intermediate temperature regime for both species, ni and zr. The incoherent intermediate scattering functions of both species show a three-step relaxation process, with the first step being a fast initial decay on the vibrational time scale and the second and third steps being the @xmath98-relaxation regime and the @xmath7-relaxation, respectively. The system exhibits aging effects at temperatures near the glass transition, with the nonergodicity parameters decreasing sharply at large times. The memory functions evaluated from the md data show a minimum in the @xmath119 for both species around a time of 0.1 ps, which reflects the crossover from the vibrational dynamics to the escape from local cages in the melt. The @xmath119 versus @xmath120 plot shows limiting values for both species, with significant deviations below the universal behavior for @xmath127. The @xmath118 function, which is the integral of the memory function, has a maximum at an intermediate value of @xmath128 for all temperatures. The values of @xmath130, the maximum of @xmath118, move towards the limiting value 1 in the high temperature regime. The diffusion coefficients of the ni and zr species are determined from the simulated atomic motions and show a fixed ratio in the Arrhenius plot for temperatures above the critical temperature @xmath0. The critical power law for the diffusion coefficients is adapted by a least mean squares fit to the simulated data, resulting in an estimated critical temperature of about 850-900 k.

2. Members of dyads often influence each other's cognitions, emotions, and behaviors, leading to interdependence in a relationship.
3. Interdependence results in correlated observations of the two individuals, and longitudinal dyadic data are often collected to understand the interdependence and how one dyad member impacts the other.

5. Parsegian and Weiss derived an equation for the non-retarded van der Waals interaction energy between two dielectrically anisotropic plates immersed in a third anisotropic material.
6. A torque develops between two parallel birefringent slabs placed in an isotropic medium, causing them to spontaneously rotate towards the configuration in which their principal axes are aligned due to the anisotropy of the zero-point energy between the plates.
7. The casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been verified in several high-precision experiments, and although most attention has been focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum, it is generally accepted that the theory is valid for any material combination.

The text describes the detection of circumstellar absorption toward the debris disk hd32297 using high resolution optical spectra, revealing two absorption components: a strong one at rest in the stellar reference frame, likely caused by circumstellar material, and a weaker one similar to that of interstellar absorption. The ism absorption is also detected among hd32297 and its two closest neighbors, indicating it is likely from the boundary of the local bubble. Some variation in local bubble absorption is detected toward 18 ori. Radial velocities of hd32297, bd+07 777s, and bd+07 778 are measured and differ significantly, suggesting they are not physically associated. Some indication of temporal variability is detected over several epochs of observations, but instrumental resolution variations and masking by the strong ism absorption make a definitive detection of circumstellar variability difficult.
2. The measured circumstellar feature toward hd32297 is the strongest such absorption detected around a nearby main sequence debris disk, 45 times greater than the column density of the prototypical edge-on debris disk, β Pic. An upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding hd32297 is estimated, assuming similar morphology and abundances as β Pic. Future observations are planned to continue monitoring the temporal variability of the circumstellar gas and measure the gas disk absorption to independently determine the gas-to-dust ratio.

The authors note that while major advances have been made in studying dynamic processes in static networks, the effects of temporal structural variations on network dynamics are poorly understood. They focus on the adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (asis) model, where edges can be temporarily removed to prevent the spread of the epidemic, and derive a lower bound on the epidemic threshold for arbitrary networks and heterogeneous node and edge dynamics.

2. The simplest protocol is the traditional two-way relaying protocol, which consists of four successive point-to-point phases. The text also introduces two other protocols: time division broadcast (TDBC) and multiple access broadcast (MABC).
3. The TDBC protocol combines the relay-to-user 1 and relay-to-user 2 phases into one phase, allowing each user to recover its intended information by self-interference cancellation. The MABC protocol combines the user-to-relay and user-to-relay phases into one phase, allowing both users to transmit to the relay simultaneously.

It mentions that the achievable rates of most existing protocols are limited by the instantaneous capacity of the weakest link associated with the relay.

The text proposes a goal to utilize all available degrees of freedom of the three-node half-duplex bidirectional relay network with fading, via an adaptive mode selection and power allocation policy. Given a joint power budget for all nodes, the goal is to find a policy that selects the optimal transmission mode and allocates the optimal powers to the nodes in each time slot, such that the sum rate is maximized.

2. This length scale, known as the sound horizon, can be used as a ""standard ruler"" to measure the matter and energy content of the universe at low redshifts.
3. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, which are both well-measured in the CMB.
4. The sound horizon depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, making it insensitive to changes in other cosmological parameters.
5. Measuring the sound horizon at low redshifts, such as in large galaxy surveys, can constrain cosmology by allowing us to predict the distance ratios between low and high redshifts.
6. Other cosmological measurements, such as the measurement of the actual densities of matter and radiation, can reveal new relativistic components or unexpected evolution.
7. The CMB is sensitive to non-photonic radiation through its effect on equality and the evolution of potentials, allowing us to constrain a ""conventional"" neutrino at the sub-eV level.
8. The acoustic oscillation standard ruler method is robust to uncertainties in the matter density provided that the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well-measured, and it is likely that the CMB will be able to constrain the actual matter and radiation densities in the future.

3. The constant @xmath0 presents serious challenges to its interpretation, particularly for values outside the range (0, @xmath10).
4. For small @xmath0, LC describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass, with mass @xmath0 per unit coordinate length. When the spacetime is flat, circular timelike geodesics exist only when @xmath8 and are spacelike for @xmath9.
5. As @xmath0 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11, the corresponding Kretschmann scalar diminishes monotonically, vanishing at @xmath12, implying a flat space.

2. LHMs can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, or yield slow light propagation.
3. The presence of negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) disordered LHMs suppresses Anderson localization, leading to unusual behavior of the localization length @xmath0 at long wavelengths.
4. A sixth power dependence of @xmath0 with wavelength @xmath5 under refractive index disorder was reported instead of the quadratic asymptotic behavior.
5. Positional disorder was introduced by changing the position of layer boundaries while maintaining the same refraction indices.
6. The localization length was calculated numerically for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with alternating indices of refraction @xmath1 and @xmath3 and thicknesses @xmath2 and @xmath4.
7. The localization length was found to be quadratic for long wavelengths in homogeneous stacks, but it saturated for lower values of @xmath5. An exhaustive study of @xmath0 in the allowed and forbidden bands of weakly disordered systems was carried out.
8. The localization length was modulated by the corresponding bands and this modulation decreased as the disorder increased. For low-disordered m stacks and wavelengths of several orders of magnitude greater than the grating period @xmath11, the localization length depended linearly on @xmath5 with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.

3. The remaining 73% of the universe's content is in the form of dark energy, which is inferred from the Hubble diagram of supernovae of type Ia and is believed to be a constant cosmological term.
4. Dark matter is needed to explain the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of the visible matter, which includes galaxies and hot intergalactic gas.
5. Dark matter is also crucial in the formation of large structures, as it causes the ordinary matter to collapse gravitationally, explaining the observed distribution of visible matter from galaxy clusters to the cosmic scale.
6. Simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) support this hypothesis, and the assumption that dark matter is non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation is essential for this explanation.
7. The form of dark matter is believed to be in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which are still not explained within the standard model of particle physics.
8. Dark energy, on the other hand, appears as a constant energy density during the expansion of the universe, implying a violation of the usual energy conditions with negative pressure.

A closed labeling is a bijection between the vertices of a graph and the set {1, ..., n} such that whenever we have distinct edges uv and wz with either u = w or v = z, then the labels of u and v (or w and z) are adjacent in the labeling.
2. Closed graphs were first encountered in the study of binomial edge ideals, and it was discovered independently in [xcite] and [xcite] that the binomials form a Gröbner basis of the ideal for lex order with respect to the reverse lexicographic order if and only if the labeling is closed.

4. Every closed graph is chordal and claw-free, where claw-free means that it has no induced subgraph of the form K3,3.
5. Narrowness is another property of closed graphs, which means that for every longest shortest path, either all vertices on the path are at distance zero or all vertices are at distance one from the path.

The origin of high energy cosmic rays is still a mystery, with possible scenarios including acceleration in astrophysical objects such as young pulsars, gamma ray bursts, our own galaxy, active galaxies, and the local group of galaxies. The power supply needed to keep the observed cosmic rays at the highest energies is consistent with the known power and distributions of these objects.

Optical lattices are formed by interference of two or more laser beams and can be used to cool and trap atoms in one-, two-, or three-dimensional lattices. The success of this technique has led to the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and the superfluid-to-Mott insulator (SF-MI) transition, enabling the investigation of various phenomena in condensed matter physics using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.
2. The text also discusses the two-mode approximation for investigating spin ordering in an isolated double-well-type potential, which is a simplified experimental setup for studying spin Hamiltonians in optical lattices. The double-well potential can be completely controlled and measured in an arbitrary two-spin basis by dynamically changing the lattice parameters. The system can be considered as two localized spatial modes separated by a barrier and investigated as a two-mode approximation. The potential bias or tilt is introduced by changing the relative phase of the two potentials, which can be realized by applying a magnetic field gradient. The system can be used to study a chain of double wells, an isolated symmetric double well, or an asymmetric double well.

1. The text discusses methods for calculating the energy and lifetime of resonance states in quantum systems. The complex scaling method is used to reveal resonance states by the appearance of isolated complex eigenvalues in the non-hermitian complex scaled Hamiltonian. However, the analysis of numerical results requires careful consideration, as variational basis sets depend on non-linear parameters and the complex virial theorem is used to pick the best numerical solution.
2. The density of states (DOS) method is an alternative approach for obtaining resonance energies and widths. It relies on the availability of the Ritz variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter. The DOS can be calculated for each eigenvalue, providing an approximate value for the energy and width of the resonance state. However, there is no clear criterion for selecting the best result from the plethora of possible values.
3. The text also discusses the Hellmann one-particle model and a two-particle model for studying resonance states. The Hellmann model is a one-electron atom model that allows for the calculation of resonance energies using complex scaling methods. The two-particle model describes two electrons interacting via the coulomb repulsion and confined by an external potential with spherical symmetry. The variational solution of the one-particle model is discussed in detail, and the discrete spectrum and resonance states are obtained using a real truncated basis set and the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method.
4. The text also critiques the DOS method for calculating resonance energies and widths, noting that it provides a host of approximate values whose accuracy is hard to assess and does not seem to converge to the value obtained using complex scaling when the basis set size is increased and the energy is kept fixed. The text suggests that the DOS method can be supplemented by a new optimization rule to obtain convergent series of approximate values for the energy and lifetime of resonance states.

Note: The text also discusses some properties of the variational spectrum, finite size scaling arguments, and the behavior of the maximum value of the DOS for different basis set sizes and pairs of eigenvalues.

The text also mentions the existence of additional asymmetric modes and the potential interplay of linear systems with nonlinear effects.

The analysis is restricted to modes that can be found in the analytical form, while their stability against small perturbations is analyzed using numerical methods. Effects such as the existence of solution branches that terminate at critical points of the respective linear symmetric systems and the breaking of symmetry are discussed. The text also mentions the potential existence of isolated solutions versus branches of solutions in symmetric systems and the potential future considerations of two-dimensional and three-dimensional symmetric lattice systems.

1. The cataclysmic variable HU Aqr consists of a 0.80 white dwarf that accretes from a 0.18 main-sequence companion star. Irregularities in the observed variations led to the discovery of two planets: a 5.7 planet in a 0.013 orbit with an eccentricity of 0.21, and a 7.6 planet in a wider and more eccentric orbit.
2. The two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year timescale, but some numerical simulations exhibit long-term dynamical stability. It is peculiar to find planets orbiting a cataclysmic variable, but they could be a natural consequence of the evolution of these systems.
3. The presence of planets around HU Aqr allows for a precision reconstruction of the binary history and the derivation of the rate of mass loss during the common-envelope phase. The outer planet also helps validate the calculation and determine the conditions under which the cv was born.
4. The original binary lost more than half its mass during the common-envelope phase, reducing the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude. It is hard to imagine how planets could survive such a turbulent past, but their survival offers unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and evolution of the system.
5. During the common-envelope phase, the primary's mantle is blown away, causing the planets to migrate to their current orbits. The response of the orbit to mass loss depends on the total amount of mass lost and the rate at which it is lost.
6. The authors calculate the effect of mass loss on the orbital parameters by numerically integrating the planet orbits and test the dynamical stability of the entire system. They find that only a small range of initial conditions around a specific mass loss rate and initial orbital separation results in a dynamically stable system.

1. The experimental evidence of skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric compounds with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction has attracted scientific interest, particularly in the preparation of thin films of b20 type MnSi on silicon substrates.
2. MnSi films offer a variety of magnetic phases and are easy to integrate into devices due to the use of silicon as a substrate material. However, they have a low magnetic ordering temperature below liquid nitrogen temperature.
3. MnGe, a suitable candidate with a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K and a helical spin structure, has shown promising results with a large topological Hall effect and evidence of skyrmions.
4. The synthesis of MnGe is laborious due to its high pressure and temperature requirements, but molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) allows for thin film growth under strong non-equilibrium conditions.
5. The use of Si(111) as a substrate offers the opportunity to prepare a seedlayer of MnSi, which realizes the b20 crystal structure for MnGe growth.
6. The structure and morphology of MnGe films were investigated using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements were also performed.
7. The growth of MnGe thin films was achieved by depositing a 5nm Mn layer on a P-doped Si(111) substrate, followed by heating to 300°C to form a thin MnSi seedlayer. MnGe was then codeposited by simultaneous evaporation of Mn and Ge.
8. The MnGe films were found to have a two-dimensional growth structure, as indicated by RHEED patterns, and were nearly pseudomorphic with the Si substrate. However, some lattice relaxation was observed due to the compressive strain imposed by the substrate.

1. The text discusses the concept of core entropy for quadratic polynomials and its relation to the Mandelbrot set.
2. The core entropy is the topological entropy of the restriction of a polynomial to its hubbard tree, a finite topological tree that is forward invariant under the map.
3. The text aims to prove that the core entropy function extends continuously from the set of postcritically finite parameters to the complex plane.
4. Thurston introduced the concept of core entropy and showed it can be defined combinatorially but displays a rich fractal structure.
5. Hubbard trees have been used to classify postcritically finite maps and provide a new tool to study the parameter space of polynomials.
6. The core entropy equals the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for a polynomial up to a constant factor.
7. The simplest way to compute the core entropy is by computing the Markov transition matrix for the map acting on the hubbard tree and taking the logarithm of its leading eigenvalue.
8. The text develops an algorithm to compute the core entropy for any angle using an infinite version of Thurston's algorithm, which bypasses the need to know the topology of the hubbard tree.
9. The growth rate of a countable graph with bounded cycles is defined as the exponential growth rate of the number of its closed paths, and the inverse of the growth rate equals the smallest zero of a certain function constructed by counting multi-cycles in the graph.
10. The text applies these combinatorial techniques to the core entropy and shows that the growth rate of the associated graph varies continuously as a function of the angle and coincides with the core entropy for rational angles.

1. GRBs are most likely of cosmological origin, as evidenced by the detection of X-ray, optical, and radio afterglows. The fireball model is favored.
2. The degree of beaming in GRBs is still uncertain, making it difficult to determine their energetics. Three methods have been proposed to help determine the degree of beaming: the presence of a break in the light curve during the relativistic phase, optical polarization, and the detection of orphan afterglows.
3. The first method, based on the presence of a break in the light curve during the relativistic phase, is not conclusive due to the smoothness of the break and the presence of other factors that can cause light curve breaks.
4. The third method, based on the detection of orphan afterglows, is also challenging due to the difficulty of distinguishing an fGRB orphan (a baryon-contaminated fireball with an initial Lorentz factor less than 1000) from a jetted GRB orphan. The absence of large numbers of orphan afterglows in many surveys has been used as evidence against extreme collimation, but it may be difficult to measure the grb beaming angle using optical orphan searches.
</summary>

Additionally, the text discusses the concept of failed gamma-ray bursts (fGRBs), which are baryon-contaminated fireballs with initial Lorentz factors less than 1000. These events can manifest as fast x-ray transients or x-ray-rich GRBs and should be followed rapidly and extensively in all bands to check our concept of fGRBs and even test the fireball model under different conditions. The text also mentions that strange stars, which are compact objects composed mainly of u, d, and s quarks, can avoid baryon contamination if grbs are due to the phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars or collisions of binary strange stars, resulting in very few fGRBs.",1

1. Cosmic bursts of gamma rays, which last less than a minute, have been discovered to produce x-ray afterglows that can be detected for several hours and sometimes several days after the burst.
2. Two such x-ray afterglows were observed using the XMM-Newton satellite, specifically for GRB 011211 and GRB 001025.
3. GRB 011211, detected on December 11, 2001, was the longest event localized with BEPPOSAX and was faint in both x-rays and gamma rays. An optical afterglow was identified and its redshift was measured to be z=2.14.
4. GRB 001025, detected on October 25, 2000, lasted approximately 15-20 seconds and reached a peak flux of 154 crab in the 5-12 keV band. No optical afterglow was detected for this burst.
5. The XMM-Newton observation of GRB 011211 started on December 12, 2001, and the data were analyzed using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS). The data were found to be consistent with a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.16±0.03.
6. No significant spectral evolution was detected in the sequence of 5-ks intervals within the observation. The x-ray light curve could be fit with a power-law decay or an exponential decay.
7. The XMM-Newton observation of GRB 001025 started on October 27, 2000, 151.9 days after the burst. Two x-ray sources were detected in the error box, and the brighter source was analyzed. The spectrum was found to be consistent with a power-law model with a photon index of 2.01±0.09 and a galactic absorption value of 6.01×10^20 cm^-2.

1. The text discusses the results of magneto-transport measurements on the layered organic material AI3, which reveals the presence of high-mobility dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes under hydrostatic pressure. The interplay between both carrier types is the main result of the study. The measurements also suggest that the scattering mechanisms for both carrier types are due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.
2. The text also presents the experimental setup and results of the magneto-transport measurements under hydrostatic pressure, as well as the temperature dependence of the carrier densities and mobilities for both carrier types. Thermopower measurements are used to corroborate the two-carrier scenario. The analysis is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity and is similar to the one presented in previous studies for multi-carrier semiconductor systems. The magneto-conductivity is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor, and the contributions of each carrier type can be added in a two-carrier system. The strong temperature dependence of the carrier density is a signature of the absence of charge inhomogeneities that prevent the approach of the dirac point in graphene on SiO2 substrates.

1. Fe-based superconductors (FEBS) are a class of high-temperature superconductors with unconventional superconducting states. They can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides, both having a square lattice of iron as the basic element.
2. The Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe 3d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the M point and two electron sheets around the X and Y points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ), with one Fe per unit cell. In the two-fe BZ, electron pockets are centered at the Γ point.
3. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, with maximal scattering near the wave vector equal to M or X/Y in the 1-fe BZ or to Γ in the 2-fe BZ. Different mechanisms of pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetries and structures.
4. The RPA-SF approach gives the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets (d-wave state), while orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have sign-preserving s-wave symmetry. Probing the gap structure can help elucidate the underlying mechanism.
5. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for studying the gap structure, as the measured dynamical spin susceptibility carries information about the gap structure. There is evidence of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems appearing only for Tc or near Tc, which is commonly explained as the spin resonance arising from the d-wave state. However, recent ARPES and Andreev spectroscopy results suggest the presence of at least two distinct gaps in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LFEAS. The larger gap is about 9 meV and the smaller gap is about 4 meV in BACO122 materials. The very existence of the smaller gap raises the question of what would be the spin resonance frequency in the system with two distinct gaps.

1. The text discusses the effect of a short-range correlated disorder on a 2D Bose gas using a 2D extension of the random dimer model (2D-DRDM). In the non-interacting regime, this model introduces delocalized states if the resonance energy characterizing these structures belongs to the spectrum of the unperturbed system.
2. In the presence of weak interactions, the 2D-DRDM drives the density spatial fluctuations. Using a mode-matching argument that includes the effect of interactions, it is shown that the resonance energy is at the origin of these phenomena.
3. The results show a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength and its enhancement for values close to the resonance condition.
4. The study demonstrates that short-range correlations in a disordered potential can modify and enhance the coherence of a many-body system in the weak interacting regime.
5. The findings could be measured in the context of ultracold atoms using techniques such as fringes contrast interference experiments, and could potentially be extended to homogeneous systems with engineered impurities that are transparent for a given energy.

2. The text provides upper and lower bounds for the independence number of generalized Petersen graphs when the number of vertices in the outer cycle is even.
3. The text explains that for even outer cycle size, the generalized Petersen graph is bipartite, making the maximum independent set problem trivial. For odd outer cycle size, the graph is not bipartite, but can be made bipartite by removing some edges.

The text also mentions some previous research on the independence number and vertex cover problem in generalized Petersen graphs, as well as some specific results for certain values of the number of vertices in the inner and outer cycles.

1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD) has been proposed as a solution to remove potential loopholes of detectors without sacrificing performance.
2. MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol and is remarkable for its ability to cover twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD.
3. The only assumption needed in MDIQKD is that the preparation of quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is almost perfect and carefully characterized.
4. Two schemes of phase encoding MDIQKD have been proposed, and their unconditional security has been proven with basis-dependent flaw.
5. The first scheme employs phase locking of two separate laser sources, while the second scheme uses the conversion of phase encoding into polarization encoding.
6. The security of these schemes has been simulated with realistic parameters, and the results imply that the first scheme covers shorter distances and may require less accuracy of state preparation, while the second scheme can cover much longer distances when prepared state is very precise.
7. The study also considers the most general type of attacks and establishes unconditional security for the proposed protocols.
8. The paper is organized into sections discussing the protocol, phase encoding schemes I and II, proof of security, and simulation results.

2. Recent high-resolution observations using sub-arcsecond resolution imaging and mid-infrared (MIR) windows have revealed the environment surrounding individual massive protostellar systems.
3. These observations suggest that massive stars form through accretion based on the discovery of Keplerian disks around four massive young stellar objects and a Salpeter-like mass function of protostellar dust clumps.
4. Methanol masers, which exclusively trace regions of massive star formation, are generally not associated with UCHII regions and are found in earlier evolutionary stages.
5. Observations of five star-forming complexes traced by methanol maser emission revealed that weak radio continuum flux maser sites are associated with massive, luminous, and deeply embedded cores.
6. The authors observed three of these regions at high spatial resolution to uncover the embedded sources inside the cores using the MIR wavelengths.
7. The results showed multiple point sources at close angular separations, which could be physically bound or simply close due to projection effects. The instrumental sensitivity required to confirm or deny the association was calculated.
8. The simulations showed that it is difficult to generate the observed mass distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the core using a standard form of the IMF, but this conclusion may not hold if there is a substantial stellar mass already in the cluster or if much of the original gas mass has already been dispersed.

1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource in quantum mechanics that can be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization. It is a feature of quantum systems that proves useful in making quantitative predictions and obeys conservation laws. However, the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear when quantum systems interact with their environment, leading to mixed states.
2. Various measures have been proposed to quantify entanglement in mixed states, such as the entanglement of formation and entanglement of distillation. These measures give the value zero for some states, such as the equal mixture of Bell states, which might seem counterintuitive but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state description.
3. Quantum trajectory theory can provide insights into the behavior of open quantum systems and help characterize the long-term behavior or find perfect entanglement after a finite time by considering measurements on the environment. At resonance, the system may exhibit distinct bimodal behavior, where it either evolves into a maximally entangled bell state without emitting photons or an entangled-state cycle is initiated under which the system switches indefinitely between orthogonal bell states while emitting a continual stream of photons.

The text discusses the importance of considering LO intensity fluctuations in the security analysis of continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems. The LO is an auxiliary light beam used as a reference to define the phase of the signal state and is necessary for balanced homodyne detection. However, it is often neglected in traditional security analysis, leaving security loopholes for Eve as the LO is within her manipulating domain. The text also highlights the consequences of not monitoring LO intensity for security proofs in discrete QKD protocols and the excess noise caused by imperfect subtraction of balanced homodyne detector (BHD) in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations. The text proposes an attacking scheme exploiting LO intensity fluctuations and analyzes its impact on the secret key rate for both reverse and direct reconciliation protocols. The results show that the fluctuation of LO could compromise the secret keys severely if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values.

1. The text discusses the phenomenon of high velocity ionized hydrogen (HI) supershells in galaxies, which have a complex structure marked by cavities, shells, and supershells. These features were first discovered in the Milky Way and have since been observed in several other spiral galaxies.
2. The text describes two main classes of explanations for the formation of HI supershells: internal and external sources. The internal source model involves starbursts, stellar winds, and subsequent supernova explosions. The external source model suggests that infalling massive gas clouds are responsible for the HI supershells.
3. The text presents evidence for and against both models. The starburst model faces difficulties in explaining the energy requirements for the largest HI supershells, especially in edge-on galaxies where only the largest shells are observed. The external source model, on the other hand, requires the presence of interacting companions or sufficiently massive clouds in the vicinity.
4. The text introduces a new explanation for HI supershells, suggesting that they have been formed by radio jets which plow through the interstellar medium (ISM), accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles. This explanation allows for an internal energy source for the HI shells, provides a natural explanation for any spatial symmetries seen in the HI features, and resolves the energy problem.

4. Order parameters, which are zero in the disordered phase and nonzero in the ordered phase, can be used to identify phases.
5. In some systems, such as topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin hall states, or quantum spin liquids, order parameters cannot be determined by symmetry considerations of the underlying Hamiltonian and must be defined in a complicated non-local way.

Neural networks can approximate any function under mild assumptions and have been successful in image classification, speech recognition, natural language understanding, and predicting from high-dimensional data.

1. The text discusses quantum cloning machines (QCMs) that can approximate the cloning of quantum states, but cannot perfectly clone them due to the laws of quantum mechanics. The text focuses on symmetric QCMs that produce identical copies of the initial state and partial QCMs that copy only one constituent of two-partite states. The text also mentions the possibility of designing QCMs for eavesdropping on quantum channels.
2. The text describes the construction of a partial QCM for cloning one component of a two-qubit state, with the goal of eve copying the first component of a quantum state carried in the quantum channel. The text introduces the unitary operator for the QCM and discusses the symmetry and unitarity conditions. The fidelity measure is used to compare the initial and produced states, and the text discusses the dependence of the QCM on the initial state and the choice of parameters for minimizing the average distance between the initial and output states. The text also mentions the possibility of applying this approach to mixed states by using their purification.

1. The text discusses the possibility that dense gas clouds could be a significant component of the dark matter in the galaxy based on the observed gamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray interactions within the clouds. The authors use a Monte Carlo simulation code, Geant4, to calculate the gamma-ray spectra from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds of various column densities. They find that the predicted spectra differ substantially between high and low column-density clouds, and the results can be used to constrain dark matter models.
2. The authors assume a spherical cloud of molecular hydrogen of uniform density and temperature, and vary the density from 0.01 to 100 g/cm3 in factors of 10. They find that the gamma-ray emissivities for clouds of various column densities are shown in figures [fig: f4] and [fig: f5], and the results are consistent with previous calculations for column densities less than about 100 g/cm3, except in the energy range where the maximum energy assumed in the Monte Carlo simulation is evident. The very low values of the emissivity at energies less than 100 MeV for column densities greater than 100 g/cm3 are due to the omission of the contribution of heavy nuclei, which were taken into account in a previous study. The power-law index above 1 GeV is almost the same as the input cosmic-ray proton flux for column densities less than about 1000 g/cm3, but for higher column densities, the statistics of the simulations are not good enough to decide whether this result still holds.

1. Soft X-ray Transients (SXRTs) exhibit properties similar to Persistent Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXRBs) containing a neutron star when in outburst.
2. The origin of the low luminosity X-ray emission detected in the quiescent state of several SXRTs is unclear.
3. Aql X-1 is the most active SXRT known, with over 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts detected.
4. The companion star of Aql X-1 is identified as the K1v variable star V1333 Aql, with an orbital period of 19 hours.
5. Aql X-1 outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with a folding time of 3070 days.
6. Type I X-ray bursts were discovered during the declining phase of an outburst, indicating the presence of a neutron star.
7. The X-ray luminosities of Aql X-1 are in the 0.01-10 keV range, and the spectrum is soft during the outburst with an equivalent bremsstrahlung temperature of 7 keV.
8. During the early part of the outburst decay, the spectrum changes to a power law with a photon index of 2, extending up to energies of 9 keV.
9. In quiescence, the spectrum is considerably softer and consistent with a black body temperature of 0.42 keV.
10. The sharp flux decay leading to the quiescent state of Aql X-1 is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts, but there are differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra likely due to the different efficiencies in gravitational energy release between white dwarfs and neutron stars.

2. The SN was classified as a type Ib supernova based on its spectra, but showed strange spectral features and their evolutions. A bright blue continuum was prominent in the optical spectrum at early epochs, which was also observed in type II SN 1988z but the origin is still unclear.
3. The optical light curve showed a rapid decline from 50 days after discovery, while near-infrared (NIR) emissions brightened and then declined. The NIR brightening and the fact that the redder side of the He emission profile declined faster than the bluer side suggested ongoing dust formation.
4. X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) emissions were also observed, and the x-ray detection suggested an interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar matter (CSM). The radio emission was not detected, and a model was presented to explain the bolometric and x-ray light curves.

3. The outbursts sometimes come in pairs or in a series with decreasing maximum brightness and different shapes, separated by periods slightly shorter than the orbital one.
4. The 1984-1986 event was characterized by two maxima in the visual magnitude, leading to an ambiguous interpretation of the outburst as a double or a disturbed single one.
5. The wind collision model is used to reveal unpredicted episodes by modeling the spectra, focusing on the physical conditions in the nebulae and their fluctuations during the 1984-1986 period.
6. The stellar wind of the cool giant has a velocity of around 25 km/s, and varying the wind velocity from 25 to 30 km/s changes the accretion regime from disk to wind accretion, increasing the hydrogen burning rate.
7. An optical thick wind forms from the white dwarf (WD), and the shocks from WD and red giant (RG) wind collision yield an increase in the luminosity of the system.

Grover's algorithm can be implemented using a three-qubit phase gate, which reduces the number of quantum gates required and simplifies the implementation compared to conventional gate decomposition methods. This scheme does not require adjustment of squid level spacing during the implementation of grover's search iteration, suppressing decoherence caused by level spacing adjustment.
3. The text describes a proposed implementation of three-qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level squids in cavity QED. The scheme is based on resonant and off-resonant interaction of the cavity field with the squid transitions and application of resonant microwave pulses.
4. The text also discusses the effects of spontaneous decay rate from the intermediate level and decay of the cavity field during the implementation of grover's iterations. The fidelity and success probability of the three-qubit phase gate and grover's search are calculated and plotted as a function of cavity decay rate and decay rate of the intermediate level.

1. The phase-field method is a popular approach for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity and ability to describe geometry in terms of phase fields.
2. The method is based on the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than other physical length scales, and the equations are analyzed under this assumption to obtain effective boundary conditions.
3. The thin-interface limit procedure was pioneered by Karma and Rappel, who obtained a thin-interface correction to the expression of the kinetic coefficient for symmetric models.
4. However, extending this method to models with arbitrary diffusivities is not trivial, as several new thin-interface effects appear which cannot all be eliminated simultaneously.
5. A solution was found later for the one-sided model with the introduction of the antitrapping current, which restores local equilibrium for arbitrary interface thickness and velocity.
6. However, there is a second, independent thin-interface effect, the Kapitza resistance, which cannot be removed by an antitrapping current.
7. Orientation-field models for pure substances were put forward to formulate a model with a small number of field variables, but their evolution equation for the angle field does not correctly describe the microscopic evolution of the orientation field.
8. The misorientation of a circular grain increases with time due to the decrease in dislocation density in the grain boundaries, leading to a rigid body rotation of the grain away from the orientation of the outer crystal.

3. The presence of dichotomic tension, which fluctuates between two levels of force, can lead to a minimum looping time at an optimal flipping time, an extension of the resonant activation phenomenon.

Tidal interactions can lead to phenomena such as synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, or disruption of an object, and the fall of the object onto the star. The authors investigate the dynamical tides by taking into account the stellar evolution for three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses.
2. The authors find that the overlap integrals, which measure the intensity of tidal interactions, decrease rapidly as the star's lifetime increases due to changes in stellar structure. In the high-frequency part of the spectrum, the absolute value of the overlap integrals increases and characteristic kinks appear. They also show that all planets with a mass equal to one jupiter mass and an initial orbital period of 2 days or shorter will fall onto the star in the main-sequence lifetime of the star for stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses.

1. The text discusses a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light. This method, which uses the intensity-intensity correlation function and the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by the two sources, can monitor the relative distance between the sources in the range 10-500 nm with a precision not limited by diffraction but by the microstructure of the scattering medium.
2. The method can simplify green function retrieval techniques in complex media by replacing the two-point field-field correlation of the background noise with a measurement at a single point of the intensity noise due to the two fluctuating sources. The approach might be particularly useful in the visible or near-IR frequency range where time-domain field-field correlations are not easy to measure. The results also suggest that multiple scattering, which had long been considered as an unavoidable nuisance, can actually enhance the performance of sensing, imaging, and communication techniques.

1. The text discusses the mechanical behavior of sticky biopolymer networks using a polymer-based theoretical framework. The framework is based on the glassy wormlike chain (GWLC) model, which is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike chain model for semiflexible polymers.
2. The authors extend the GWLC model to account for a dynamically evolving thermodynamic state variable characterizing the network of thermo-reversible sticky bonds, which is updated dynamically upon bond breaking according to an appropriate rate equation.
3. The authors find that the mean fraction of closed bonds, reflected in the thermodynamic state variable, can influence material properties to a degree that the material behaves qualitatively different from the usual viscoelastic paradigm. They predict a pronounced fluidization response, which develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers.
4. The authors also find that the yield force for the onset of fluidization is sensitive to the deformation rate and is accompanied by a cyclic softening or shake-down effect. They take into account the spatial heterogeneity of biopolymer solutions by a distribution of entanglement lengths, which renders the force-displacement curves smoother without affecting their qualitative characteristics.
5. The authors acknowledge the importance of the prestressing force, which is present in adhering cells even in the absence of external driving. They suggest that the cell responds to stiff substrates or persistent external stresses by a biological remodeling that corresponds to an increase of the bond energy and bond length, and possibly to a decrease of the minimum interaction distance. By adapting also the internal prestress, the cell may avoid structural collapse and an undesirable loss of flexibility.

1. Topological insulators (TMI) are a class of insulators characterized by non-trivial topological invariants and robust surface metallic states.
2. They are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and are studied extensively due to their potential applications.
3. The honeycomb lattice system, which is a Dirac semimetal in the non-interacting limit, becomes a topologically non-trivial insulator driven by coulomb interaction, known as a topological Mott insulator (TMI).
4. The emergence of the TMI in the honeycomb lattice requires the coulomb repulsion between next nearest neighbor sites, making the long-period charge density wave (CDW) instability a competing order.
5. The stability of the TMI and estimation of the critical value of interaction on the honeycomb lattice have mainly been considered by mean-field calculations, but quantum many-body fluctuations beyond the mean-field approximation severely affect the stability of the TMI.
6. The TMI is not stabilized when other competing orders, such as CDW, are taken into account in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice.
7. However, by tuning the fermi velocities of the Dirac cones, the TMI is indeed stabilized in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice.
8. The TMI becomes stable by modulating the fermi velocity at the Dirac cones in the electronic band dispersion, which is achieved by introducing third neighbor hopping in the honeycomb lattice.

1. The text discusses the discovery of gapless edge states at tilt boundaries in gated bilayer graphene, which are protected by time (valley) reversal, no-valley mixing, and electron number conservation symmetries. The edge states are predicted to be topological in nature and are expected to remain gapless as long as the protecting symmetries are maintained.
2. The text also proposes that these tilt boundaries could be the first topological structural defects to host topologically protected gapless modes of transport, solving the long-standing mystery of sub-gap transport in gated multi-layer graphene.
3. The authors propose experiments, such as four-terminal transport measurements, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, thermoelectric imaging, and scanning squid experiments, to test their proposal and confirm the tilt-boundary transport origin of sub-gap transport.

Additionally, the text discusses the effect of the arbitrary angle between the Burgers vector and the tangent vector on the transport through the network of tilt boundaries and the possible symmetry change from quantum valley hall (QVH) to layer antiferromagnetic (LAF) phase, where spin is a dynamic degree of freedom. The LAF phase is predicted to be a topological insulator, protecting odd numbers of edge modes for each valley. The authors also acknowledge the support of various grants and institutions.",1

1. The text discusses the behavior of charged polymers in solution, specifically polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes, and their application in industrial and medical fields. Polyelectrolytes have repulsive intra-chain electrostatic interactions that tend to swell the chain, while polyampholytes have attractive interactions between charged monomers of opposite sign that tend to decrease the chain size.
2. The text describes the properties of polyelectrolyte and polyampholyte brushes formed by grafting charged polymers onto a surface. Polyelectrolyte brushes have strong electrostatic interactions that make it easy for the system to access the brush regime, while polyampholyte brushes have weaker electrostatic interactions and are more affected by the properties of the chains such as fraction and sequence of charged monomers and bending energy.
3. The text presents the results of MD simulations of planar brushes of flexible, semiflexible, and rodlike diblock polyampholytes, and a scaling analysis to describe the dependence of the brush thickness on the grafting density for flexible chains. The simulations show that the brush thickness is a linear function of the grafting density for all values of bending energy, and the strength of this dependence is weaker for flexible polyampholyte brushes.
4. The text also discusses the importance of considering finite-size effects in simulations and the results of simulations of larger brushes containing semiflexible chains, which show that the chains do not overlap with their own images and the histograms of equilibrium conformations do not change noticeably with increasing system size.

1. The text discusses the study of nonet scalar mesons below a certain energy using tetraquark currents constructed from scalar diquark fields in QCD sum rules. The diquarks are taken as point particles and described as basic quantum fields, and the quark-quark correlations are found to be very weak. The article also introduces new vacuum diquark condensates to parameterize the nonperturbative QCD vacuum and takes the confinement energy scale as the dimension-one parameter. The numerical results are presented and shown to be compatible with experimental data and theoretical estimations.
2. The text also mentions the controversy surrounding the existence and properties of certain scalar mesons, such as the @xmath8 mesons, and discusses the importance of taking into account the finite widths of resonances in the hadronic spectral densities when calculating modified masses from QCD sum rules. The article also mentions the potential couplings of the scalar tetraquark currents with higher resonances and the small expected couplings with glueballs or molecular states. The work is supported by grants and references several previous studies on scalar mesons and QCD sum rules.

1. IME (ime) domain simulation is an important approach for power system dynamic analysis, but the complete system model, or long-term stability model, includes various components with different differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) and time scales, making it large and complex for time domain simulation over long intervals.
2. Intense efforts have been made to accelerate the simulation of long-term stability models using larger time step sizes, automatic adjustment of step sizes, and quasi-steady-state (qss) model implementation.
3. The qss model suffers from numerical difficulties when it gets close to singularities and cannot provide consistent approximations of the long-term stability model.
4. Pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) method is a theoretically-based numerical method used in power system long-term stability analysis to accelerate simulation speed and overcome possible numerical difficulties in the qss model.
5. The long-term stability model for power systems includes transmission system equations, internal static behaviors of passive devices, internal dynamics of devices such as generators, and long-term dynamics including exponential recovery load, turbine governors, load tap changers, and over excitation limiters.
6. The proposed paper applies PTC method to the long-term stability model and qss model in power systems, modifies the original PTC method for its implementation, and presents numerical examples to demonstrate its feasibility and advantages over conventional methods.

The authors reproduce the threshold formula for the scattering amplitude on the cylinder potential with a circular base and the results of previous studies for the 2D scattering of polarized dipoles.

1. G65.2@xmath05.7, also known as thermal composite SNR or mixed morphology SNR, is a supernova remnant with a shell-like radio continuum morphology and a centrally bright x-ray morphology.
2. It was first identified as a supernova remnant in the late 1980s but was later ignored until recently due to its mysterious origins.
3. The remnant is now gaining interest because it helps explain an unusual class of supernova remnants called thermal composite SNRs.
4. Various theories suggest that thermal composite SNRs lack x-ray shells due to evolution into the radiative phase or that their centers are x-ray bright due to thermal conduction, entropy mixing, or cloudlet evaporation.
5. The remnant's optical observations indicate that it has entered the shell formation phase, and its radio and low spatial resolution x-ray observations show a shell-like radio continuum morphology and thermal x-ray emission.
6. Archival _ROSAT _ observations confirm that the remnant is in the radiative phase, as shown by a temperature peak in the center and a mild decrease in temperature with radius.
7. The remnant's true extent was unknown until an optical emission line survey revealed filaments circumscribing a 4.563.3@xmath5  ellipse.
8. The remnant is sufficiently evolved for the shock to be weak and the gas behind it to be relatively cool and recombined.
9. The remnant's size and distance have been estimated using various techniques, and it lies approximately 22 pc above the galactic disk with a distance of 800 pc and major and minor axes of 56 and 64 pc, respectively.

1. The text discusses various methods for encoding and compressing permutations, focusing on those that support efficient computation of the permutation and its inverse. The authors show that some concepts originally defined for adaptive sorting algorithms, such as runs and shuffled upsequences, are useful for compression of permutations. They also demonstrate that concepts from data compression, like the entropy of the sets of sizes of runs, can be applied to the study of adaptive algorithms.
2. The authors present several encoding schemes for permutations, including those based on runs, strict runs, and shuffled upsequences. These schemes use varying amounts of space and support different operations in different time complexities. They also discuss applications of these encoding schemes to various data types, such as integer functions, text indexes, and others. The authors note that the results can be extended to more complex permutations and functions, and that the link between algorithms and encodings is not limited to complexity lower bounds suggested by information theory.

Additionally, the text mentions various results and techniques from previous research on permutations, sequences, and measures of disorder in permutations. It also discusses the Hu-Tucker algorithm and its application to permutations, as well as the concept of partitions formed by interleaved runs and the advantages of considering permutations formed by shuffling a small number of runs.

1. The text discusses the discovery and study of chimera states in networks of non-locally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators. Chimera states are characterized by the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators in a population. The study identifies various single and multi-chimera states in 2D and 3D versions of the Hindmarsh-Rose model, which is a simplified model for single neuron dynamics. The authors also discuss the importance of chimera states in neuroscience applications and their relevance to synchronization phenomena in complex systems.
2. The text also introduces a novel type of mixed oscillatory state (MOS) in which desynchronized neurons are interspersed among those that are either stationary or oscillate in synchrony. The study identifies the occurrence of chimera states for various coupling schemes in 2D and 3D Hindmarsh-Rose models and provides evidence for the relevance of this counterintuitive phenomenon in neuroscience.

The model attracted the interest of physicists in the 1980s due to its analogy with disordered systems in statistical mechanics. The text focuses on the structural properties of the networks and their attractors, introducing the concept of relevant elements and studying their probability distribution.
2. The authors propose a new approach to describe the phase transition in random boolean networks in terms of the scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size or a percolation transition in the set of relevant elements. They also discuss the limitations of the annealed approximation and propose a new approximation scheme that works better in the frozen phase and on the critical line.
3. The text presents numerical results on the magnetization and stable elements, the distribution of relevant elements and its connection with the properties of the attractors in the chaotic phase and on the critical line.

1. The text discusses the study of spin-superflow turbulence (sst) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where both the velocity and spin fields are disturbed, leading to novel turbulence. The authors focus on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy and find it shows a Kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields.
2. The authors also discuss the dependence of the spectra on the relative velocity and the absence of energy dissipation. They find that the period sustaining the kolmogorov spectrum in the superflow kinetic energy becomes shorter when the relative velocity is large due to modulation of the total density and high energy injection wave number. However, the spin-dependent interaction energy can exhibit the @xmath1 power law independently of the relative velocity.
3. The authors also consider the possibility of inverse energy cascade in sst but find that it does not occur in the two-dimensional system due to the lack of enstrophy conservation.

1. Low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) make up about 40% of nearby bright galaxies and are responsible for the majority of the AGN population. Their low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto super-massive black holes.
2. The accretion is often explained by the model of an optically-thin disc, such as an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), rather than an optically-thick disc. The ADAF model predicts a ""submillimetre bump"" in its spectral energy distribution (SED), while the standard disc is responsible for a ""big-blue bump"" in the SED of luminous AGNs.
3. The first imaging investigations for accretion discs must be promising with future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments that will provide micro-arcsec resolutions. The observational evidence of the ADAF is crucial in the LLAGN radio sources.
4. Although the ADAF model successfully explains the broadband spectra of LLAGNs, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands. This indicates that additional unknown emission exists and may be buried under it.
5. The present paper reports millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs. A high-frequency observation is very promising to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF because of its advantages in avoiding non-thermal jets and the prediction of larger flux densities at higher frequencies.
6. The authors made millimetre continuum observations for 16 out of 20 targets using the Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) and found statistically significant variability in several LLAGNs, which will be reported in a separate paper. They also attempted to measure flux densities at submillimetre band from the nuclear regions using archival data.
7. The authors suggest that all low-core-power sources also have sub-pc-scale or smaller jets, and that the detectability of small-scale jets might merely depend on distance. They also discuss the discrepancy between the unified scheme and the observed differences in spectral properties between type 1 and type 2 AGNs.

2. Studies of these processes have provided insights into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains.
3. Dust extinction and reddening affect various astronomical observations, including photometry and spectroscopy of stars and galaxies, and mapping small-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation.
4. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation and can be quantified using the normalized dust extinction law or reddening law.
5. The ratio of total to selective extinction, Rv, is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.
6. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with an average Rv of 3.1 but significant deviations from this value in different interstellar dust clouds, which are generally correlated with environment.
7. The study proposes three methods for measuring the Rv of dust in the foreground of differentially-reddened globular clusters using accurate three-band optical photometry and two-band optical photometry with a map of the dust thermal emission.
8. The methods are applied to NGC 4833, a low-latitude galactic globular cluster with variable extinction across its face, and the results are used to estimate the accuracy with which Rv can be recovered.

Additionally, the text discusses the discovery of infrared cirrus, which is associated with thermal emission from dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium, and the use of the Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis (SFD) maps to correct extragalactic sources for extinction and reddening. The SFD maps show structure in the cirrus down to the smallest angular scales resolved by IRAS, and the power spectrum of the cirrus varies from field to field over a range of angular scales larger than a few arcminutes. The study also mentions the importance of quantifying extinction/reddening variations on the smallest scales possible to improve the accuracy of astronomical measurements.",1

1. The text discusses the Kondo lattice model (KLM) and its ground state using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) method. The model describes an array of localized magnetic moments coupled antiferromagnetically to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons.
2. The authors present DCA calculations for the KLM ground state, considering both magnetically ordered and disordered phases. They map out the magnetic phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and conduction electron density, focusing on the single-particle spectral function and the evolution of the Fermi surface.
3. The authors find that the KLM exhibits a kondo insulator phase at half-filling and with particle-hole symmetry, where the minimum of the valence band lies at the bottom of the Brillouin zone, and the maximum of the conduction band is at the top.
4. In the weakly antiferromagnetically ordered phase, the system shows shadow bands due to scattering of heavy quasi-particles off magnetic fluctuations. The minimum of the valence band shifts to a lower energy, and the form of the lower band changes such that the maximum of this band now lies at a higher energy.
5. The authors observe a continuous change in the Fermi surface topology as a function of decreasing interaction strength and increasing dopings, with the rkky interaction progressively dominating over the kondo scale and the magnetic metallic state being stabilized.
6. The authors propose a mean-field model to explain the topological transition of the Fermi surface within the ordered phase, suggesting two Lifshitz transitions where hole pockets around certain wave vectors disappear and new ones emerge, satisfying the Luttinger sum rule.

1. The recent discovery of a resonance at 125 GeV compatible with the expectations for the Higgs particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles. This discovery may also affect the subfield of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
2. White dwarfs, which have had a prominent role in fundamental physics since the early 20th century, can be used to obtain limits on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant, the Kreschmann invariant, by means of spectroscopic observations. The analysis is complemented by considering data from a second white dwarf, Procyon b, in which Caii and Mgii lines, in addition to the C@xmath3 bands, are also present. The search for coupling between the Higgs (or any scalar field permeating the whole universe) and spacetime curvature arises naturally within the framework of field theory in curved spacetime.

1. The text discusses the discovery of pulsations in two new extremely low-mass white dwarfs (elm wds), j1614 and j2228, which are the coolest pulsating wds ever found. These discoveries bring the total number of pulsating elm wds to five, establishing them as a new class of pulsating white dwarfs. The luminosity variations in these elm wds are consistent with surface temperature variations caused by non-radial mode pulsations driven to observability by a hydrogen partial ionization zone.
2. The text also discusses the complexity of understanding the evolution of elm wds through the instability strip, as theoretical models predict multiple unstable hydrogen-burning episodes. Empirical discoveries of elm wds that do or do not pulsate offer the possibility to use the presence of pulsations in elm wds to constrain binary and stellar evolution models used for low-mass wds, which may better constrain these poorly understood CNO-flashing episodes.

Additionally, the text mentions that j1614 and j2228 were discovered using optical facilities at the McDonald Observatory, and their atmospheric parameters were determined through spectroscopic observations and model atmospheres. The text also discusses the lack of radial velocity variability in j1614 and the possibility of a companion being a much cooler low-mass white dwarf or the system being inclined nearly face-on to our line of sight. High-speed photometric observations were obtained for j1614 to search for pulsations, and non-detection of variability was reported. The text also mentions the importance of further empirical exploration of the entire elm wd instability strip to constrain physical and evolution models of elm wds and the mass boundary for the occurrence of pulsations.

1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into distinct phases: hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium. Star formation is restricted to cold dense gas, and molecular gas strongly correlates with the star formation rate.
2. The link between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution relies on understanding the pathways and conditions for cold, molecular gas development. The gas temperature sets the size and mass of prestellar cores in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds.
3. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity far below its mean. The atomic-to-molecular transition occurs in photodissociation regions (PDRs), with the outer, unshielded layers composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon.
4. Simulating the ISM and accurately representing the chemical state requires understanding the structure of a dynamic environment where a variety of non-linear, coupled processes determine the global distribution and state of gas. Three-dimensional simulations of finite, but representative, portions of galactic disks have attempted to replicate a supernova-driven ISM, finding success in reproducing a multiphase ISM or demonstrating the regulation of the star formation rate by stellar feedback.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) shows an overdensity of stars in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with nearly the same color as the red clump of core he-burning stars but extending about 10.9 mag brighter. This feature, labeled as the vertical extension of the red clump (VRC), is interpreted as an intervening population of stars or tidal debris sheared from a small Milky Way satellite.
2. The VRC has been challenged as a stellar foreground population explanation for the LMC microlensing optical depth, with some studies finding no evidence for such a population and others suggesting alternative explanations such as stellar evolution or binary stars.
3. The VRC's origin is still a topic of ongoing research, with some studies suggesting it is due to stellar evolution and others proposing it is a result of a tidal streamer or debris from a disrupted satellite.

2. The study finds that the fraction of demi-lirgs (star-forming galaxies with nearly half the total infrared luminosity of a luminous infrared galaxy) and the mean specific star formation rate (mssfr) of cluster galaxies increase with projected distance from the cluster center.
3. However, the fraction of demi-lirgs remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius, suggesting that even galaxies that reside significantly beyond the virial radius have already been quenched in their previous environments.
4. The study also finds no evidence of a correlation between the cluster specific star formation rate (cssfr) and cluster mass, indicating that cluster mechanisms which scale with cluster mass, such as ram pressure or harassment, are not likely to play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in local clusters.
5. The study suggests that strangulation, a mechanism in which a galaxy's hot halo gas is removed as it enters the cluster intracluster medium (ICM), may be a plausible candidate for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies.
6. The study concludes that the dominant process for regulating star formation in dense environments does not depend upon cluster mass, and hence must be efficient in small groups or filaments.

2. Multi-nucleon events are crucial for charge-changing quasielastic cross sections, and 2p-2h excitations are essential for a proper description of data.
3. The only 2p-2h model implemented in some neutrino event generators is the ICF-Valencia model, but plans exist to incorporate the Lyon model and effective transverse enhancement models.
4. The main challenge in implementing 2p-2h models is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved.
5. The text introduces a new method, called the frozen nucleon approximation, to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model (RFF) efficiently.
6. The frozen nucleon approximation assumes that the momenta of the initial nucleons can be neglected for high enough momentum transfer, significantly reducing the number of nested integrals needed.
7. The text validates the frozen nucleon approximation by comparing the approximate 2p-2h response functions with exact results and shows that it works well for a range of momentum transfers.

3. The authors also obtained r-band images with the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (HFOS) but had to remove some observations contaminated by the light of nearby bright stars. They performed profile fitting photometry using the DAOPHOT and ALLSTAR packages.
4. The authors found that the continuum and hα fluxes vary, while the [O III] line is nearly constant. They obtained the lightcurves of the continuum at 5100 Å, hα, and [O III] using the final inter-calibrated spectra.
5. The authors used the cross-correlation function (CCF) method to determine the time lag between the continuum and hα variations. They obtained a statistically significant centroid and the associated uncertainty using a bootstrap technique. The estimated time lag was found to be consistent with the expected value based on the r-band lightcurve and the known relationship between the BLR size and the optical continuum luminosity.

They found that only a few candidates were suitable for their campaign due to the lack of available spectra. The authors also mentioned that the extrapolation of the known r-band luminosity-BLR size relation suggests that the time lag between the variations of the broad line and that of the continuum will be of the order of hours to days for low luminosity sources, requiring monitoring programs of short durations but fast sampling.",1

1. The broad emission iron lines in active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries are believed to originate close to the black hole due to the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc.
2. The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in determining the position of the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc.
3. The innermost stable orbit occurs closer to a black hole with a higher spin value.
4. The Laor model, which includes the effects of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used for evaluating the spin of black holes based on the position of the lower boundary of the broad line.
5. The authors of this paper have relaxed the limitation of the Laor model by allowing the dimensionless angular momentum to be fitted, enabling comparison with other models.
6. The authors aim to compare the Laor and another relativistic disc spectral line model using the current XMM-Newton data and artificial data for two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit an extremely skewed iron line.
7. The authors used the SAS software and standard tools to reduce the XMM-Newton data and prepared and fitted the data. The sources were observed for different exposure times and spectral results were described in previous papers.
8. The authors find that the Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, leading to discrepancies in the overall shape of the line, especially for lower spin values. They also emphasize the importance of correct re-binning of the data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution to obtain statistically relevant results.
</summary>

Additionally, the authors compare the Laor model with another relativistic disc spectral line model and find that the latter has a smoother adjustment between different points in the parameter space, allowing for more reliable constraints on the spin. However, the discrepancies between the models are within the general uncertainties of the spin determination using the skewed line profile when applied to the current data. The authors suggest that the Laor model may be less accurate for higher quality data, such as those simulated for the XEUS mission.",1

The domain walls are solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations and are characterized by a change in the relative phase between the two condensates. The text also explores the physical interpretation of these domain walls, their boundary conditions, and their decay mechanisms.
2. The text also discusses the symmetry properties of the binary BEC system, including the conservation of the number of atoms of each species and the spontaneous breaking of two global U(1) symmetries. The text also mentions the possibility of violating the U(1) symmetry by coupling the two condensates with a driving electromagnetic field, leading to the preservation of only one U(1) symmetry and the violation of the other. The text also discusses the stability and ground-state properties of the binary BEC system and the collective excitations that can be observed in such a system.
</summary>

Additionally, the text discusses the domain wall solution in the binary BEC system, its physical interpretation, and its properties. The domain wall is a local minimum of the energy functional and is not topologically stable, as it can decay through the unwinding of the domain wall. The text also discusses the boundary conditions of finite domain walls and the phenomenon of vortex confinement in binary BEC systems. The text concles with a discussion of the experimental realization of domain walls in binary BEC systems and the potential applications of these domain walls in quantum computing and other areas of physics.",1

1. Anomalies in quantum field theory occur when a symmetry of the action or corresponding conservation law is violated in the quantized version. Adler, Bell, Jackiw, Bardeen discovered this phenomenon in 1969. External symmetries do not pose a threat to the consistency of the theory, but internal symmetries (gauge symmetries) lead to inconsistencies, destroying renormalizability and potentially unitarity.
2. The text discusses the calculation of gravitational anomalies, specifically the Einstein anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, using the method of dispersion relations. The authors choose to focus on the case where the Lorentz anomaly is vanishing.
3. The energy-momentum tensor in the quantum case can have anomalous features such as an Einstein anomaly, Lorentz anomaly, or Weyl anomaly. The authors calculate the gravitational Schwinger terms, which are related to these anomalies.
4. The authors use dispersion relations to calculate the imaginary parts of the formfactors via the cutkosky rule. They also discuss the equivalence between the dispersive approach and the dimensional regularization procedure.
5. The anomalous Ward identities and trace identities are derived from the formfactors, and the linearized gravitational anomalies (Einstein and Weyl) are deduced.
6. The origin of the anomaly in the dispersive approach is due to the existence of a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of the formfactor, which exhibits an infrared feature at zero momentum squared.
7. The authors find agreement between their results and those of other authors, such as Tomiya, Alvarez-Gaum, and Witten, and demonstrate the independence of the results from a specific renormalization procedure.

1. The STE-Quest mission is a European Space Agency (ESA) candidate for launch in 2022/2024, which aims to study the cornerstones of Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) by measuring gravitational red shift and testing the universality of free fall.
2. The mission consists of two parts: the Space Time Explorer (STE) for measuring gravitational red shift, and the Quantum Equivalence Space Test (QUEST) for testing the weak equivalence principle.
3. The STE instrument measures the gravitational red shift experienced by highly accurate clocks in the gravitational fields of Earth or the Sun, while the QUEST instrument measures differential accelerations of microscopic quantum particles to test the universality of free fall.
4. The mission objectives include measuring the gravitational red shift to a fractional frequency uncertainty better than ground clocks at apogee, comparing the frequency variation of the space clock over the elliptical orbit, measuring the gravitational red shift of the Moon, and testing the weak equivalence principle using an atom interferometer.
5. The mission design includes a space segment with a highly stable bi-directional microwave and optical link system, and a ground segment with three ground terminals connected to highly accurate ground clocks.
6. Earth gravitational red shift measurements are performed by comparing the frequency output of the on-board clock to that of ground clocks, with a highly elliptical orbit chosen to maximize the signal. Sun and moon gravitational red shift measurements are performed by comparing the relativistic frequency offset between a pair of ground clocks, with the spacecraft serving as a link node between them.
7. Atom interferometer measurements are used to test the weak equivalence principle, with differential measurements performed using two isotopes of rubidium atoms to reject common mode noise. The atoms are cooled to the nk regime and released into free fall before being prepared in superpositions and split into partial waves by laser pulses.
8. The mission faces challenges including the development and testing of the required technology, the availability and performance of optical links, and the need for highly accurate ground clocks.

3. Experiments in the 1970s at Platteville in Colorado and Arecibo in Puerto Rico demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation of ionosonde records, and excitation of spread @xmath0 in the ionosphere after the hf transmitter was turned on.
4. Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence in the ionosphere.
5. A full-scale simulation study was conducted to investigate the propagation of an hf em wave into the ionosphere, with results suggesting that such simulations will be a powerful tool for studying hf-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation.
6. The simulation showed that the em pulse propagates without changing shape through the neutral atmosphere until it reaches the ionospheric layer, where it undergoes Faraday rotation and excites both r-x and l-o mode pulses, which have different turning points and polarizations.

Additionally, the simulation revealed the presence of weakly damped electrostatic waves, which were identified as mode conversions of the l-o mode, and the reflection of the l-o and r-x modes at different altitudes.

2. Recent experiments have demonstrated the Mott transition in an optical lattice, leading to increased theoretical and experimental interest in the Mott-insulator quantum phase transition.
3. The Mott-Hubbard model is described by a bosonic Hamiltonian that includes on-site repulsion and hopping between nearest-neighbor sites. The ratio of the on-site energy and the bandwidth is the key parameter in the system.
4. The Mott-Hubbard model can be studied by probing the system using absorption pictures to image expansion patterns, which yield information about the momentum distribution of the state.
5. The essential physics of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic Mott-Hubbard model, and various approximation schemes have been used to study this model analytically and numerically, including perturbation theory, Gutzwiller mean-field theory, density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), exact diagonalization (ED), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC).

The authors are interested in solutions of the field equations for a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime with a flat, expanding universe that undergoes a transient period of accelerating expansion. They show that such solutions are typical in all compactifications involving compact hyperbolic spaces or non-vanishing flux.
2. The authors develop a new method to visualize cosmological solutions in the context of multi-scalar models with an arbitrary scalar potential. They augment the target space to a larger space of lorentzian signature, where the logarithm of the scale factor plays the role of time. They then further enlarge the target space to a ""doubly-augmented"" target space, foliated by copies of the augmented target space. Geodesics in this space yield cosmological trajectories for any spatial curvature when projected onto a given hypersurface.
3. The authors find that within the lightcone (defined by the metric with respect to which the trajectories are geodesics), there is an acceleration subcone. A given trajectory corresponds to an accelerating universe whenever its tangent vector lies within the acceleration cone. They also present a complete treatment of cosmological trajectories for any spatial curvature and any spacetime dimension for the special case of simple exponential potentials, which serve as reference potentials in determining the asymptotic behavior of cosmologies in models with other potentials.

1. A conformally symmetric model was proposed for strong interactions at low energies based on the observation that gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form under conformally flat metrical fields.
2. Quarks and gluons are confined to an anti-de Sitter (AdS) universe with a finite radius in the flat space-time.
3. The model describes quarks and gluons oscillating with a universal frequency inside a closed universe, while photons freely travel through flat space-time.
4. The model consists of one real scalar field and one complex scalar field, whose dynamical equations were solved for a particular vacuum expectation value leading to AdS confinement.
5. The only quadratic term in the Lagrangian is proportional to a mass term, resulting in a light scalar field associated with confinement and a very heavy complex scalar field associated with electromagnetism.
6. The model was simplified to only preserve its main property, namely flavor-independent oscillations, for comparison with experimental data.
7. An interference effect was observed in preliminary radiation data of the BABAR collaboration, which could be due to interference between the typical oscillation frequency of quark pairs and that of the gluon cloud.
8. A light scalar particle of about 38 meV was observed in the expected place in the invariant-mass distribution of BABAR events, but its existence is not yet confirmed due to insufficient statistics.
9. The light scalar particle is likely to be a scalar glueball, as it has scalar properties and does not interact through electroweak forces to leading order.

2. The phenomenon occurs when a signal, which is below the detection threshold without noise, becomes observable and estimable with the addition of appropriate noise levels.
3. The optimal noise level for stochastic resonance can be determined by maximizing the Fisher information quantity, which is a measure of the signal's information content.
4. The authors study the problem of estimating a constant signal and testing hypotheses using two observation schemes: observing the proportion of time spent above a threshold and measuring the energy of the signal above the threshold.
5. They consider a model with a threshold, a constant signal, and a diffusion process as noise, and propose two estimators for the two observation schemes.
6. The authors show that the estimators are asymptotically equivalent to maximum likelihood estimators and that the phenomenon of stochastic resonance emerges in both observation schemes.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have received attention due to their calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor invariant soft terms, renormalization group invariant soft terms, and the ability to calculate them at any convenient scale choice. However, they suffer from negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be solved by adding a universal mass term.
2. Hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMSB) is a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB but localizes supersymmetry breaking at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, making anomaly mediation the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector. The mass of the bino, the gaugino of U(1)Y, can lead to a small perturbation or the largest soft supersymmetry breaking parameter in the visible sector.
3. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions. The hcamsb model is easily distinguishable from the minimal AMSB model at the LHC if the mass splitting between the wino-like and bino-like neutralinos is not too large.
4. The hcamsb model predicts a decrease in the mass of the doublet scalar states with increasing hypercharge mediation contribution, leading to highly split third generation squark states for large hypercharge mediation values. The light third generation squarks are expected to be generically lighter than the gluino mass, leading to cascade decays that produce large multiplicities of quarks in the final state.
5. The hcamsb model gives rise to multi-jet plus multi-lepton plus charged lepton events with hits and a prominent peak in the os dilepton invariant mass distribution, which may be a smoking gun signature for hcamsb models at the LHC.

1. The text describes the discovery and study of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) using data from the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) and the Millimeter Anvil Bolometer Array (MABOLA). The first surveys using these instruments led to the discovery of a large population of dusty, starburst galaxies that were surprising due to their high source density at the flux levels accessible to the first generation of bolometer arrays.
2. Early efforts to study SMGs at optical and infrared wavelengths suggested that the majority of the submillimeter population had no plausible optical counterparts. However, recent progress has been made through radio imaging of submillimeter survey fields, which has enabled the detection of roughly half of the submillimeter sources observed and the determination of their redshifts.
3. The sample presented in the text is a robust sample of bright SMGs selected using SCUBA and MABOLA in one of the ""8-mJy survey"" regions: the Lockman Hole. The goal is to provide a bright sample that can be detected in well-matched radio imaging while minimizing the possibility of spurious or anomalously bright sources.
4. The sample consists of 19 SMGs, of which 15 are detected securely by deep radio imaging. The resulting redshift distribution is consistent with that determined for a much larger sample by Chapman et al. (2005), supporting their conclusions about the median redshift and the statistical properties of the bright SMG population.

2. The authors find that the local LF of galaxies, when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields, agrees well with the LCRS and Stromlo/APM surveys. However, the normalization of the local LF is roughly a factor of 1.6 higher than that of the Stromlo/APM survey, indicating a systematic error in one of the surveys.
3. The authors observe evolution of the field galaxy LF within their sample, confirming the conclusions drawn from several previous redshift surveys. The evolution is limited to the population of blue, star-forming galaxies, which become more luminous with increasing redshift.
4. The authors find that the star formation is long-lived, as evidenced by the larger fraction of galaxies at higher redshift exhibiting spectral signatures of ongoing star formation. They do not see evidence for short-term bursts of star formation.
5. The LFs of the two superclusters show significant differences from the field galaxy LF, despite overall similarity. The supercluster LFs contain a population of very luminous galaxies, which are likely to be giant ellipticals found in the densest regions of the superclusters.

Additionally, the text discusses the importance of measuring the masses and chemical abundances of distant galaxies to aid in the identification of their present-day counterparts and to provide insights into the nature of the rapidly evolving galaxy population.

2. These gaps are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, with the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state being the simplest model.
3. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies of more than 100 GeV and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets.
4. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent based on the fraction of dijet events due to 0-channel color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps of order 10%.
5. The two-gluon exchange model, which replaces the two-gluon loop-integral with its imaginary part, is used to calculate the color singlet fraction.
6. However, this model is shown to have limitations and the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative.
7. The analysis demonstrates that the one- and two-gluon exchange amplitudes are too large to be compatible with unitarity when using phase shifts.
8. The paper performs a numerical analysis for running strong coupling constant and shows that the key properties of the fixed-coupling results remain unchanged.

Additionally, the text discusses the elastic scattering of two arbitrary partons, the unitarity constraints, and the decomposition of color factors into irreducible color representations.

1. The text discusses a method for extending the results of infinitesimal deformation theory of associative algebras to arbitrary pasting diagrams of 0-linear categories, functors, and natural transformations. The authors establish that obstructions are cocycles for deformation complexes of pasting diagrams in general, using a method developed heuristically by Shrestha. They also make explicit a previously overlooked point that the cochain maps constructed in certain theorems depend on choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions.
2. The authors describe chain maps induced by pasting compositions on the full deformation complexes when a composable pasting diagram is given. They provide propositions for chain maps induced by functors, natural transformations, and their interaction with each other. They also show that these chain maps are independent of choices of association, up to algebraic homotopy.
3. The authors give explicit examples of deformation complexes associated to various shapes of commutative pasting diagrams, including a ""commutative pillow with triangular cross-section"" and ""pillows with square cross-sections."" They show that cochain maps induced by two different associations of the 2-dimensional composition are not actually equal but only chain homotopic. They also relate the deformation complex of a pasting diagram to the map of proposition [chainmapfrom2comp] using a lemma about mapping cylinders.

5. In QCD, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important phenomenon for understanding the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties.
6. Beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting by the exchange of goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.
7. The chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to a subgroup by the QCD vacuum in the large limit.
8. Evidence for spontaneously broken chiral symmetry includes nonzero quark condensates for light flavors, which represent the order parameter, and are confirmed by current algebra, QCD sum rules, and lattice gauge calculations.
9. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry results in the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass, which represent the associated approximate goldstone bosons, and the acquisition of dynamical mass by valence quarks, known as constituent quarks.

1. The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for forming bias laid, non-woven fabrics, where the yarns in at least two layers are laid at an angle of 30° to 150° to the long axis of the fabric. The yarns in the various layers are held together by stitching through the layers or by other external means, such as adhesive bonding.
2. The invention provides a rake mechanism synchronized with, but driven separately from, the conveyors, yarn carrying means, and bonding mechanism, to achieve greater assurance of parallelism of the yarns and allow for overlapping of successive courses to better control the strength and thickness of the resulting layer. The rake mechanism accepts and retains the yarns being carried by the yarn carrying means at either end of their travel, and places them onto or between the appropriate needles on the conveyors using a movement opposed to the direction of travel of the conveyors and in conjunction with the return travel of the yarn carrying means. The yarns can be placed between adjacent needles on the conveyors or impaled on those needles. The rake mechanism moves a slight distance in the same direction as the conveyors to trap the yarns before releasing them to the conveyor needles. The rake system may either move a full course or a fraction of a full course, resulting in varying degrees of overlap of successive courses and affecting the density of the fabric.

The process begins by knitting two tape-shaped knit pieces on a flat knitting machine with at least a pair of front and rear needle beds, one or both of which are movable in the longitudinal direction. The loop portions of the final course of one knit piece are transferred to the needles of the other needle bed, and the needles are moved to overlay and bind off the loops, decreasing the number of loops in the moving side knit fabric while also decreasing the number of loops in the fixed side knit fabric. This process is repeated until the end parts of both knit fabrics are joined, preventing the final end portion of the junction from loosening.

The mass flow through each of several parallel turbine inlet control valves is controlled using a test compensation circuit that uses control valve positions as feedback and compensates by adjusting the flow through parallel control valves. The test compensation circuit is reproduced along with the test control circuit and valve servo position loop for each valve of several parallel turbine inlet",1

1. The present invention provides a mixing valve for an aircraft cleaning apparatus having two inlets A and B, and one outlet, wherein the outlet mixture comprises a solution ranging from 0% inlet A fluid, 100% inlet B fluid to 100% inlet A fluid, 0% inlet B fluid. The valve includes a valve body, a first inlet passage for receiving a first fluid at a first predetermined pressure, a second inlet passage for receiving a second fluid at a second predetermined pressure, an outlet passage for providing a proportional mixture of the two fluids, and a valve means for directing the two fluids toward the outlet passage. The valve means is adjustable to permit the mixture to range between 0% first fluid, 100% second fluid to 100% first fluid, 0% second fluid.
2. The valve system reduces the flow rate of soap solution and water entering the valve, allowing multiple identical valve systems to operate from a common soap solution source and common water source without adversely affecting fluid pressure. The maximum flow rate of fluid occurs only when the bore is axially aligned with its respective fluid communication passages, diminishing fluid demand from the respective fluid source and maintaining constant fluid pressures at inlets.

1. The present invention relates to a method of compressing gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas, involving compressing the gas to a higher pressure, cooling it, and feeding it back into the pipeline with a lower exit temperature and increased exit pressure.
2. In permanent frost areas, natural gas pipelines are placed at a depth where permanent frost prevails, and the ground thaws only during summer months. Heating the soil to prevent pipeline sinking and resulting mechanical stresses is a possibility, but it requires cooling the compressed gas before returning it to the pipeline to maintain a temperature of at most 0°C.
3. During the summer months, gas coolers are insufficient for cooling the compressed gas, and special re-cooling plants with separate cooling cycles are used. However, these plants are expensive, completely unused for eight months, and pose safety risks due to the flammable and heavier-than-air nature of the cooling agent, propane.
4. The present invention proposes a method and arrangement for carrying out the method that substantially reduces investments and operation risk. It utilizes the physical effect that a compressed gas is cooled when expanded to a lower pressure.
5. The method involves compressing the gas to an excess pressure above the desired exit pressure, cooling it by heat exchange, and expanding it to the desired exit pressure. The excess pressure is selected based on the cooling capacity during expansion and the required temperature reduction.
6. The compressor station includes a compressor, heat exchanger, valve-controlled pipelines, and control units. An electronic control system operates the compressor to compress the gas to an excess pressure and expands it to the desired exit pressure.
7. The compressor station can be operated in two primary compression stages, each with compressors having approximately the same pressure ratio, and an additional compression stage with booster compressors. The excess pressure is reached in the additional compression stage, and the compressed gas is expanded in an expansion turbine to recover mechanical energy for providing a portion of the drive energy for compressing the gas to the intended excess pressure.
8. The compressors in the primary compression stages can be completely exchanged for one another, allowing for flexibility in handling changes in pipeline pressure requirements and environmental conditions for cooling by heat exchange throughout the year.

2. The cooling fan assembly includes a motor, fan blade, and mounting legs with resilient leg portions. The panel provides the mounting interface and includes recess portions with enlarged and residual openings. The motor carrier includes spring members that urge the assembly away from the panel once the mounting legs are seated.
3. To install the cooling fan assembly, a combined compressive and rotating force is applied to the assembly or the panel, compressing the spring member and moving the turned-out portions fully into the recess. As the assembly is further rotated, the resilient leg portions enter into the residual opening and spring outwardly, capturing each leg portion pair within its respectively associated residual opening.
4. The spring member remains in a compressed state in the fully installed position, urging the turned-out portions of the resilient leg portions against the exterior surface of the panel, preventing vibrational noise and preventing vibrational forces from causing the resilient leg portions to ""back out"" of their respective openings.

The foils are arranged in discrete multiplication stages, and voltage is applied to each foil to accelerate electrons and generate secondary electrons that continue to the next foil in the series.

1. Vehicle battery rebalancing is a process to correct cell voltage imbalance conditions by equalizing the voltages of all cells in a battery.
2. A power system may include a battery with multiple cells and a controller that causes the cells to acquire charge for a period of time, allowing their voltages to become approximately equal.
3. The rate at which charge is acquired by the cells may differ for some cells during a portion of the charging period.
4. The maximum capacity of a battery cell can be determined using the relationship between the change in capacity, change in state of charge, and the current flowing through the cell.
5. A battery cell's energy content can be approximated using the power applied to the cell over time, which is the product of voltage and current.
6. The controller determines the required cell voltage to provide a specified energy content for each cell in a battery pack to support a target drive range.
7. The time required to charge the battery pack depends on the cell requiring the greatest ΔIhrs (change in hours), the cell requiring the least ΔIhrs, the method of balancing the cells, and the portion of the charge cycle selected for balancing.
8. The controller determines the charge time for the battery pack and the resistive circuitry activation time for each cell. If the pack charge time is greater than the maximum resistive circuitry activation time, the controller activates the resistive circuitry for each cell and waits for it to expire before deactivating it. Once all resistive circuitry has been deactivated, the controller charges the battery pack to a target voltage.

1. The text describes a system for controlling lighting and window treatments in a space to maintain a desired illumination profile and reduce sun glare.
2. The system uses a central processor and photosensors to detect light levels and determine if the lighting conditions are too dark, acceptable, or too light. Based on this determination, the system controls electric lights and window treatments accordingly.
3. The system includes presets for electric light control, such as Minimum, Medium Low, Medium High, and Maximum, which define target intensities for one or more electric lighting zones. The system can also adjust the electric light levels based on the time of day and the spectral sensitivity of the photosensors.
4. The system also includes a process for controlling window treatments to minimize or eliminate sun glare based on the readings of photosensors. This process uses a dead-band and a low sampling rate numerical integration of the light level error to determine when to move the window treatments and adjust the timing thresholds based on the sign of the error and the persistence of the lighting condition.

1. Before September 2001, significant vulnerabilities existed in aviation security, including weaknesses in screening passengers and baggage, controlling access to secure areas at airports, and protecting air traffic control computer systems and facilities.
2. In response to these vulnerabilities, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created, and security requirements were established with mandated deadlines. TSA's primary responsibility is ensuring security in all modes of transportation, and it shifted security-screening responsibilities from airlines to itself. Some aviation security responsibilities remain with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), such as securing its air traffic control and other computer systems and facilities.

Over the past 2 years, TSA and FAA have taken major steps to increase aviation security. TSA has implemented congressional mandates and explored options for increasing the use of technology and information to control access to secure areas of airports and to improve passenger screening. FAA has focused its efforts on enhancing the security of the nation's air traffic control systems and facilities.

In its first year, TSA worked to establish its organization and focused primarily on meeting the aviation security deadlines set forth in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), accomplishing a large number of tasks under a very ambitious schedule. TSA reported that it met the November 2002 deadline to deploy federal passenger screeners at airports across the nation, hired and deployed more than 20,000 individuals to screen all checked baggage using explosives detection technology, and confiscated over 4.8 million prohibited items from passengers.

However, TSA experienced difficulties in meeting some deadlines and achieving certain goals, such as operational and management control problems with the Federal Air Marshal Service and delays in deploying some explosives detection systems. TSA granted waivers to a few airports, allowing them to use alternative means to screen all checked baggage. Some airport representatives expressed concern that these airports would not meet the new December 2003 deadline established in their waivers.

To strengthen control over access to secure areas of airports and other transportation facilities, TSA is pursuing initiatives that make greater use of technology and information, such as the Transportation Workers Identification Card (TWIC) program. TSA plans to implement the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening",1

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engages in three primary activities: aviation safety oversight, Air Traffic Control (ATC), and airport infrastructure development. The costs associated with each activity depend on the nature and usage of the specific service.
2. FAA safety activities include licensing pilots and mechanics, as well as inspecting various aspects of the aviation system, such as aircraft and airline operations. Costs are primarily driven by the volume of each. ATC includes guiding and controlling the flow of aircraft through the National Airspace System (NAS), with costs influenced by the amount and nature of specific services used and peak periods. Airport infrastructure development is funded through the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which is a multibillion-dollar grant program that provides funding for airports based on congressional priorities.
3. The Trust Fund was established in 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system. It provides funding for FAA's two capital accounts, AIP and the Facilities and Equipment account, as well as the Research, Engineering, and Development account. The Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through dedicated excise taxes, including ticket taxes, passenger segment taxes, cargo/mail taxes, fuel taxes, and international arrival/departure taxes.
4. Concerns have been raised about the current funding structure, including revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency. Some stakeholders argue that the current excise tax system has been successful in funding FAA but may not be sustainable in the long term due to declining revenues and increasing costs. Alternative funding options, such as direct user charges, have been proposed to address these concerns.

1. ICE officers and attorneys exercise discretion during the alien apprehension and removal process in various phases, including initiating removals, apprehending aliens, issuing removal documents, and detaining aliens. Discretion is most commonly used for aliens with humanitarian issues and those who are not investigation targets.
2. ICE has designed internal controls to guide officer decision making, such as policies, procedures, and training materials. However, there is a need for comprehensive and up-to-date guidance to support officers in dealing with humanitarian issues and aliens who are not primary targets of ICE investigations.
3. ICE has implemented an inspection program for OI field offices and plans to do the same for DRO field offices to ensure compliance with established policies and procedures. However, the inspection program does not currently analyze information on officer decision making regarding alien apprehensions and removals.
4. ICE relies on two databases, ENFORCE and DACS, to document officers’ decisions regarding alien apprehensions but does not collect or analyze data on the rationale behind these decisions or the actions taken by officers to address aliens with humanitarian issues. ICE plans to update these systems to provide additional capabilities, but it is unclear whether they will provide the necessary information for managers to monitor and analyze officer decision making across all field offices.

1. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) was passed in 1976 and amended in 1984 to establish a national policy for managing hazardous waste. It governs the identification, listing, and management of hazardous waste from generation to disposal.
2. RCRA's regulations apply to all hazardous waste, regardless of where or how it is generated, including waste from cleanups. Waste associated with cleanups, often referred to as remediation waste, must be managed under RCRA's stringent requirements.
3. Several legislative proposals have been introduced since 1995 to amend the application of RCRA's requirements to remediation waste, and the EPA has considered reforming these requirements through regulations. However, stakeholders disagree on the extent to which waste should be exempt from RCRA's requirements and on EPA's legal authority to exempt waste.
4. Three of RCRA's hazardous waste management requirements—land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and requirements for permits—may be unduly stringent for a significant portion of remediation waste that poses a lesser risk to human health and the environment.
5. EPA has provided alternative policies to mitigate the impact of these requirements, but their applicability to cleanups is unclear, and some, such as the CAMU rule, have been legally challenged.
6. EPA has concluded that comprehensive reform of remediation waste management can best be achieved through legislative action.

1. IRS' toll-free network consists of 10,000 customer service representatives located at 25 call sites around the country. In 1999, IRS began operating the network as a single call center to optimize service by routing calls to sites with the shortest hold times.
2. Before operating as a single call center, calls were routed based on area codes or percentage of staff, making it difficult to reroute when sites experienced frequent busy signals or lengthy hold times. IRS expanded its coverage from 16 to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
3. The Operations Center is responsible for forecasting call demand, planning call routing, developing staffing requirements, and monitoring network call traffic status. Call sites are expected to adhere to staffing requirements and are responsible for recruiting, training, and assigning customer service representatives.
4. IRS lacks a long-term, desired level-of-service goal based on taxpayer needs and annual goals aimed at achieving the long-term goal. Instead, IRS determines staffing levels based on its judgment of how to balance service and compliance activities within overall budget limitations.
5. IRS faces challenges in recruiting, training, retaining, and scheduling customer service representatives. Recruiting is difficult due to job characteristics, and training is inadequate due to the broad range of topics representatives must address, inadequate resources, and the cyclical nature of taxpayer demand.

2. Ginnie Mae's mission is to expand affordable housing in America by linking capital markets to the housing markets.
3. Ginnie Mae does not buy or sell loans or issue MBS directly, but rather guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on securities backed by pools of government-backed loans.
4. Ginnie Mae has several different MBS programs, including Ginnie Mae I, Ginnie Mae II, and the Multiclass Securities Program, which offer varying levels of flexibility in pool composition.
5. Ginnie Mae securities are popular among investors due to the government backing and the absence of credit risk, but investors face prepayment risk due to the possibility of borrowers paying off their mortgages early.
6. FHA, VA, RHS, and PIH insure or guarantee nearly 100 percent of the loan amount, while issuers are responsible for delinquent loans in pools.
7. Ginnie Mae charges issuers a guarantee fee for its guarantee of timely payment and a commitment fee for the authority to pool mortgages into Ginnie Mae MBS.
8. Ginnie Mae securities finance the majority of FHA and VA loans, but their share of the total MBS market has declined over the last 20 years due to the growth of the conventional MBS market.
9. Ginnie Mae faces challenges in maintaining its viability, adequately disclosing loan information, working within the limits of its commitment authority, and ensuring the reliability of its data systems.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) identified $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments in a prior report. DOD has reversed $592 million of these adjustments, but additional accounting problems have been discovered that require detailed reviews to determine the correct accounting actions.
2. DOD has provided documentation indicating that $8 million of the remaining $23 million of adjustments were proper and do not need to be reversed. However, DOD has not provided sufficient support for the remaining $15 million, which are considered unnecessary or unsupported adjustments.
3. Of the 45 contracts involved in the $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper adjustments, 30 of these contracts had additional accounting errors that must be corrected. These 30 contracts include over $457 million (77 percent) of the reversed transactions.
4. DFAS Columbus estimates that it will take over 21,000 hours to correct the accounting for the 30 contracts. For example, one contract had $210 million of unnecessary adjustments that required reversing all $590 million of the closed account adjustments, creating additional errors that must be corrected.
5. DOD plans to complete all reaudits to correct the fiscal year 2000 illegal and otherwise improper adjustments by September 30, 2002. In addition, the Air Force is investigating personnel responsible for monitoring and administering the contract to determine if any Antideficiency Act violations occurred.
6. DOD's inability to accurately account for and report on disbursements overall is a long-term, major problem. For example, almost $1 of every $3 in contract payment transactions was for adjustments to previously recorded payments in fiscal year 1999. Simplifying contract accounting and modernizing financial management systems are key to resolving DOD's financial management and contract payment problems.

2. The domain name system functions rely on a set of rules that determine which top-level domains (TLDs) are recognized by most computers connected to the Internet.
3. The domain name system is managed through a set of 13 computers called root servers, which coordinate the translation of domain names into Internet addresses.
4. The U.S. government supported the implementation of the domain name system for nearly a decade, but began a process in 1997 to transition technical responsibility to the private sector.
5. The White Paper, issued in 1998, outlined four guiding principles for the transition: stability, competition, representation, and private, bottom-up coordination.
6. ICANN, a not-for-profit organization, was established to manage the domain name system under an MOU with the Department of Commerce.
7. ICANN has made progress in increasing competition, such as allowing multiple registrars to register domain names and expanding the pool of available domain names through new TLDs.
8. However, progress has been slower on activities designed to address other guiding principles, such as improving security and stability, ensuring representation of the Internet community, and using private, bottom-up coordination.
9. ICANN faced serious problems in accomplishing the transition and needed fundamental reform, leading to the establishment of an internal committee to recommend options for reform.

2. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for managing these trust funds and providing trust services to beneficiaries, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee (OST) carrying out these responsibilities.
3. OST has been implementing trust reforms since 1997, including the Trust Funds Accounting System (TFAS), Trust Funds Receivable, Trust Beneficiary Call Center, and Risk Management Program. These reforms aim to improve trust management and provide better services to beneficiaries.
4. OST has relied heavily on contractors to perform trust reform activities, with about 21% of its appropriated funds going to contracting during fiscal years 2004 and 2005. However, there have been concerns about preferential treatment of certain contractors and the size of OST's permanent staff.
5. The Special Trustee has not provided the Congress with a timetable for completing trust reforms or a plan for future trust fund operations, which hinders oversight and planning for trust fund operations once reforms are completed. The Special Trustee plans to reduce OST's budget by terminating contracts as reforms are completed, but a workforce plan has not been developed to reexamine responsibilities and needs for trust fund operations.

3. Workpapers document the audit process, assist in planning, record procedures, tests, and evidence, support technical conclusions, and provide the basis for the auditor's report.
4. IRS' primary tool for controlling quality under the nine standards is the review of ongoing audit work by group managers.
5. Group managers review audit workpapers during the audit to identify problems and ensure recommended tax adjustments are supported and audits do not unnecessarily burden taxpayers.
6. IRS historically has found issues with the quality of its workpapers, with only 72% of audits meeting all key elements of the workpaper standard between 1992 and 1997.
7. Our observations from 1996 and 1997 found that IRS auditors did not always meet the workpaper standard's requirements.
8. We found limited documentation of supervisory review in the sampled audits, which can help identify areas contributing to IRS' ongoing issues with creating audit workpapers that meet quality standards.

1. Large financial companies in the United States can reorganize or terminate their operations under judicial bankruptcy process or special legal and regulatory resolution regimes. Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure aimed at eliminating or restructuring debts, providing equitable treatment to creditors, and stopping collection activities against the debtor.
2. The bankruptcy process includes several stages, such as first-day motions, disclosure, plan of reorganization, and reorganization. Debtors may file voluntarily or involuntarily, and creditors can defend against involuntary proceedings. Involuntary proceedings require a judge's decision to grant or dismiss the request.
3. Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code govern liquidation and reorganization, respectively. Insured depository institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, and commodity brokers have special provisions for resolution under different laws. Regulators often play a role in financial company bankruptcies, with FDIC, CFTC, and SEC having specific rights to be heard before the court.
4. The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities, including bankruptcy courts, the Judicial Conference, the Federal Judicial Center, and the U.S. Trustee Program. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Reserve Act to prohibit the establishment of emergency lending programs for the purpose of assisting a single company to avoid bankruptcy. However, the Federal Reserve may still design emergency lending programs for the financial system.

The industry is undergoing modernization to become more reliable and efficient, facilitating alternative forms of generation, and giving consumers real-time information about energy costs through the implementation of smart grid systems. These systems include advanced metering infrastructure, smart components, and IT systems and networks for automating system management and recovery.
2. Threats to the electricity industry and its transmission and distribution systems are evolving and can come from unintentional or intentional sources. Unintentional threats include natural disasters, defective equipment, software coding errors, and poorly trained employees. Intentional threats include criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled insiders, foreign nations, and terrorists. The increased reliance on IT systems and networks exposes the electric grid to potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including an increased number of entry points, unknown vulnerabilities from new technologies, wider access to systems and networks, and a tempting target for customer information. Smart grid and related systems have known cyber vulnerabilities, and incidents affecting the electricity subsector have had a variety of impacts, including hacks into smart meters, control system failures, and safety monitoring system disabling.

1. The federal workforce faces significant skills gaps, which can impede the government's ability to effectively serve the public and achieve results. These gaps can be caused by a lack of sufficient numbers of employees or employees without the necessary skills or abilities.
2. Various factors, including budget pressures, the changing nature of federal work, and upcoming retirements, threaten to exacerbate existing skills gaps. By 2020, over 34% of federal employees will be eligible to retire, with some agencies, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, having particularly high eligibility levels.
3. To address talent needs, agencies face challenges in areas such as the classification system, recruiting and hiring, pay system, performance management, and employee engagement. For example, the GS classification system has not kept pace with the government's evolving requirements, and the federal pay system rewards length of service rather than individual performance and contributions.
4. To improve human capital management, agencies should focus on values and objectives, examine total compensation competitiveness, build in safeguards for fairness, devolve decision-making, provide training, build consensus, and monitor and refine the implementation of pay systems.

1. About 90% of the costs associated with the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) fall into two accounts: military personnel and operation and maintenance.
2. Military personnel funds cover pay and allowances for mobilized reservists and special payments or allowances for all qualifying military personnel. Operation and maintenance funds are used for transportation, unit operating support costs, and intelligence, communications, and logistics support.
3. Estimating the cost of ongoing military operations is difficult due to operational requirements that can differ substantially from budget estimates, leading to the need for DOD to use transfer and reprogramming authorities to meet its needs.
4. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, DOD received supplemental appropriations totaling about $114.8 billion for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses. However, DOD and the military services have lost visibility over funds provided through annual appropriations, including about $7.9 billion in fiscal year 2004 and $7.6 billion in fiscal year 2005.
5. To cover gaps between reported obligations and supplemental appropriations for GWOT, DOD and the military services have taken actions such as transferring funds and reducing or deferring planned spending for peacetime operations. However, these actions may affect DOD’s flexibility to cover potential gaps in fiscal year 2005 and beyond.

However, they can use their food safety authorities to control insanitary conditions, detect contamination, and control contaminated food. FDA's food safety authorities do not extend to the regulation of physical facility security measures, while USDA has a more expansive view of its authority and believes it can require food processors to implement certain security measures related to sanitary conditions.
2. FDA and USDA have taken various actions to help food processors prevent or reduce the risk of deliberate food contamination. They have issued voluntary guidelines to the industry, conducted risk assessments, and provided training for their field staff. However, they do not collect information on industry's voluntary implementation of security measures and lack the authority to mandate security measures. They also expressed concerns about gathering security information from facilities due to potential public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. To better assess industry's efforts to prevent deliberate contamination and advise processors on needed security enhancements, FDA and USDA are recommended to study their agencies' existing statutes and identify what additional authorities they may need from Congress. They are also recommended to provide training for their agencies' field staff on food security issues and the voluntary security guidelines.

3. Enterprisewide contracts are similar to interagency contracts but generally do not allow purchases from outside the original acquiring activity and can reduce contracting administrative overhead.
4. The total number of MACs and enterprisewide contracts is unknown due to insufficient data in the official procurement database, and agencies cite various reasons for establishing their own contracts instead of using existing ones.
5. Concerns exist about contract duplication, with vendors and agency officials expressing concerns about the same vendors offering similar products and services on multiple contracts, resulting in increased costs and missed opportunities to leverage the government's buying power.
6. OFPP has made recommendations to improve data, strengthen policy, and better coordinate agencies' awards of MACs and enterprisewide contracts, but prior attempts to identify these contracts have not resulted in a reliable database.
7. Agencies establish their own MACs and enterprisewide contracts for reasons such as cost avoidance, fewer fees, mission-specific requirements, and better control over contract management.

2. The program aims to boost international business and tourism, as well as airline revenues, and create substantial economic benefits for the United States. Participating countries must offer reciprocal visa-free travel to U.S. citizens, have a low refusal rate for their nationals applying for business and tourism visas, issue machine-readable passports, and meet other requirements.
3. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and gave it responsibility for establishing visa policy, including policy for the VWP. DHS created the Visa Waiver Program Office in 2007 to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating countries' adherence to program requirements.
4. ESTA, an automated, Web-based system, was implemented in 2008 to assist in assessing passengers' eligibility to travel to the United States under the VWP by air or sea before they board a U.S. bound carrier. ESTA notifies passengers of program ineligibility before they embark for the United States, reducing the burden on passengers and U.S. government officials.
5. DHS has made progress in negotiating information-sharing agreements with VWP countries, but only half of the countries have entered into all required agreements, and many of those agreements have not been implemented. The 9/11 Act requires VWP countries to enter into agreements to share information regarding lost or stolen passports and report such information to the United States.
6. DHS has not completed half of the mandated biennial reports on VWP countries in a timely manner since 2002, which hinders Congress' ability to assess the security measures in place in VWP countries and potential vulnerabilities that could affect their continued participation in the program. To address this issue, DHS should establish time frames for the regular review and documentation of cases of VWP passengers traveling to a U.S. port of entry without verified ESTA approval and take steps to address delays in the biennial country review process.

1. The text discusses the complexities of state child welfare systems and the growing challenges they face due to increasing caseloads. From 1984 to 1995, the foster care population grew significantly, with an estimated 261,000 children supported by federal funds. The federal government plays a role in financing foster care and establishing minimum procedural requirements for the placement process. States must make reasonable efforts to prevent child removals and provide services to families and children with the goal of reunification. If reunification is not possible, states must find permanent placements outside the family home.
2. The text highlights various initiatives states have taken to expedite the permanency planning process and reduce the time children spend in foster care. These initiatives include shorter time frames for permanency hearings, expediting the process for terminating parental rights, and concurrent planning. Some states have also implemented creative methods for financing and providing services to address specific barriers to reuniting families. The text emphasizes the importance of long-term involvement, stakeholder consensus, and resources for successful implementation of these initiatives.

1. The DATA Act, signed into law in 2014, expanded federal transparency legislation by requiring the disclosure of federal agency expenditures and linking agency spending information to federal program activities.
2. The act requires government-wide reporting on a greater variety of federal funds and tracking of these funds at multiple points in the federal spending lifecycle.
3. To improve data quality, the act requires agency-reported award and financial information to comply with new data standards established by OMB and Treasury.
4. OMB and Treasury are responsible for leading government-wide implementation of the act.
5. OMB has taken steps to help agencies meet their reporting requirements, including issuing guidance, establishing data element definitions, and conducting meetings with agencies.
6. In May 2015, OMB issued initial guidance to federal agencies on reporting requirements under the DATA Act and FFATA. In May 2016, OMB released guidance on reporting financial and award information required under the act. In November 2016, OMB issued additional guidance in response to agencies' questions and concerns.
7. Agencies are not required to submit spending data in compliance with the act until May 2017, but IGs are required to assess and report on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of spending data submitted by federal agencies. The first IG reports were due to Congress in November 2016, but were delayed due to the anomaly of agencies not yet reporting in compliance with the act.
8. Challenges identified in agency annual financial reports and IG readiness reviews include data quality issues and challenges related to internal controls over financial reporting and financial management operations. Some agencies' financial management systems did not substantially comply with Section 803(a) of FFMIA, which may limit their ability to provide reliable and timely financial information for managing day-to-day operations and to produce reliable financial statements, maintain effective internal control, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including the DATA Act.

1. SSA administers two programs, DI and SSI, which provide benefits for individuals with disabilities. Both programs use the same definition of disability for initial entitlement, but have different purposes and requirements. DI is an insurance program that helps replace lost earnings due to disability, while SSI is a needs-based program that provides a minimum income for individuals with limited income and assets.
2. The text discusses the work incentive provisions of both programs, which are intended to encourage beneficiaries to return to work. However, the provisions differ significantly, with DI providing more safeguards for continuing eligibility, income, and medical coverage. For example, earnings do not affect a DI beneficiary's cash benefit during the trial work period, but will eventually stop completely if earnings exceed a specified level. In contrast, earnings can affect an SSI beneficiary's cash benefit immediately, but the reduction in benefits is gradual.
3. The text also highlights the challenges faced by SSA in serving concurrent beneficiaries, who are individuals receiving benefits from both programs. These challenges include the lack of integrated guidance for processing work information reported for concurrent beneficiaries and the absence of formal operating procedures to ensure that information is collected and communicated between programs. As a result, SSA may be overpaying benefits to concurrent beneficiaries and other DI beneficiaries who return to work.
4. The text suggests several recommendations for SSA to improve its administration of the DI and SSI programs for concurrent beneficiaries. These recommendations include developing procedures and integrated guidance to ensure information about work activity is collected and shared between the programs, creating a new position and software to handle work-related issues for all beneficiaries, and providing public information materials that explain the complex interaction of the two programs in language that beneficiaries can understand.

Explanation:

The text discusses the $88 billion in hurricane relief and recovery funds provided by the federal government through four emergency supplemental appropriations. However, there is no central collection point or framework to consolidate and report on the use of these funds on a governmentwide basis. FEMA's weekly reports to the Appropriations Committees on the use of its $42.6 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund do not provide complete or timely information due to reporting issues related to mission assignments and expenditures. Specifically, FEMA's reported obligations and expenditures for mission assignments do not reflect the actual status from a governmentwide perspective, and performing agencies have not provided timely or detailed billing documentation to support their reimbursements. To address these issues, it is recommended that the Director of FEMA explain in its weekly reports how its reported obligations and expenditures for mission assignments do not reflect the status from a governmentwide perspective, request and include actual obligation and expenditure data from agencies performing mission assignments, and reiterate to agencies the detailed information required in supporting documentation for reimbursements and the timeliness of agency billings. Additionally, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is recommended to establish a framework for governmentwide reporting on the status of hurricane-related funding.",1

2. IAEA's safeguards objectives are to account for nuclear material and prevent its diversion to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes. IAEA uses various methods to meet these objectives, including inspections, material-accounting measures, containment measures, and surveillance devices.
3. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a multilateral export control regime that helps prevent the spread of nuclear weapons by controlling the export of nuclear-related materials and technology. NSG members must adhere to IAEA safeguards at facilities using controlled nuclear-related items and require non-member states to have IAEA safeguards as a condition of supply.
4. IAEA has taken steps to strengthen its safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program. This includes developing the capability to independently evaluate all aspects of a country's nuclear activities and conducting complementary access to resolve questions or inconsistencies.
5. The NPT requires non-nuclear weapons states to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with IAEA, but many countries have not yet done so. This limits IAEA's ability to detect clandestine nuclear programs and transshipments of nuclear material and equipment through these countries.

5. The Federal Reserve, the Investment Company Institute, and industry data were used to assess the impact of mutual funds on deposits.
6. The flow of funds into mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, although the exact magnitude is disputed.
7. In the early 1990s, the deposit-to-GDP ratio dropped significantly below its previous band, indicating a large movement of funds into mutual funds.
8. The mutual fund industry's growth has led to a decline in the share of bank loans in total finance, but both mutual funds and banks generally invest a substantial portion of the funds they receive.
9. The availability of finance for residential, consumer, and business borrowers could be disproportionally affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds.
10. The securitization of consumer credit, residential mortgages, and corporate debt has increased access to finance for these sectors, but small businesses that are heavily dependent on small banks for loans might face reduced credit availability if their banks lost deposits to mutual funds.

1. The survey of large DB pension plan sponsors revealed that they have made revisions to their benefit offerings over the last 10 years, including modifications to formulas, conversions to hybrid plans, and freezes.
2. For plans covering nonbargaining employees, the primary reason for changes was unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements. For plans covering collectively bargained employees, the primary reason was global or domestic competitive pressures.
3. Many sponsors reported increasing the generosity of DB plan formulas for collectively bargained employees due to inflation or cost-of-living adjustments, suggesting flat-benefit plans with annual benefit increases as part of bargaining agreements.
4. Sponsors were more likely to report converting DB plans covering nonbargaining unit employees to hybrid plans due to trends in employee demographics. Among those reporting on collectively bargained plans, 21% had converted traditional plans to cash balance plans.
5. Sixty-two percent of responding firms reported a freeze, or a plan amendment to limit future pension accruals, for one or more of their plans. Among these, 8% were hard frozen, meaning that all current employees receive no additional benefit accruals after the effective date, and 20% were under a soft freeze, partial freeze, or ""other"" freeze.
6. The survey also found that health benefits are a significant component of employer offered benefits, representing 15% of base pay. All respondents offered health insurance to active employees and contributed to the cost, and all offered health benefits to some current retirees. However, 46% of responding firms reported that retiree health benefits were no longer offered to employees hired after a certain date.

1. Refugees are individuals who are unable or unwilling to return to their country due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The Refugee Act of 1980 established a systematic and permanent procedure for admitting refugees to the United States and provided comprehensive and uniform provisions for their resettlement.
2. The federal government, state agencies, and private organizations coordinate to implement the refugee admission and resettlement process. The President determines the maximum number of refugees to be admitted each year, and refugees are assigned to communities based on their capacity to support them.
3. Refugees are eligible for temporary assistance from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for up to 5 years, including cash and medical assistance, employment and other social services, and housing assistance. ORR's performance measures focus on short-term outcomes, such as employment, but refugees may face unique challenges that require longer-term support.
4. Communities that have effectively consulted with stakeholders before resettling refugees have been able to better serve their needs and avoid reaching a crisis point. The federal government can facilitate this process by providing guidance and best practices to resettlement agencies and state coordinators.
5. The federal government can also improve its response to secondary migration, which can strain local resources and make it difficult for refugees to access services when they relocate. This could include collecting and disseminating more up-to-date population data, allowing resubmission of rejected data, and creating an emergency grant program to assist communities experiencing high levels of secondary migration.

1. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 as an alternative to direct assistance after floods to reduce federal government costs for repairing flood damage.
2. NFIP provides government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses and is overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
3. Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation to strengthen NFIP, including making flood insurance mandatory for owners of properties in vulnerable areas with mortgages from federally regulated lenders and increasing mandatory purchase requirements for owners of properties located in special flood hazard areas.
4. NFIP offers two types of flood insurance premiums: subsidized and full risk. Subsidized premiums apply to about 22 percent of all NFIP policies and are significantly lower than full-risk premiums.
5. NFIP has mapped flood risks across the country and assigns flood zone designations based on risk levels, which are used to determine premium rates.
6. NFIP faces financial challenges, including the need to charge premium rates that fully reflect actual risks, limiting costs to taxpayers before and after a disaster, encouraging broad participation in natural catastrophe insurance, and reducing taxpayer exposure to flood risks.

1. Medicare is a federal health insurance program with two main parts: hospital insurance (Part A) and supplemental medical insurance (Part B). Claims are processed by intermediaries and carriers.
2. Intermediaries and carriers are selected through a unique process that deviates from the Competition in Contracting Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Intermediaries are chosen through provider association nominations, while carriers are selected by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers.
3. Medicare contracts are primarily cost-based, with no express provision for profit. Contractors cannot be terminated without a public hearing, a process not afforded under the FAR.
4. Medicare could benefit from contracting reforms, including competitive contracting, functional contracting, and performance-based contracting. These reforms could lead to greater efficiency, better performance, and a broader pool of qualified contractors.
5. The use of health insurers for claims administration may no longer be necessary, as advancements in technology and the decline in the number of willing contractors have made it difficult for Medicare to find replacements when one contractor leaves the program.
6. Challenges of implementing contracting reforms include preparing clear statements of work, efficiently integrating new contractors, and developing sound evaluation criteria for assessing performance. CMS would be wise to adopt an experimental, incremental approach to implementing any changes in its contracting authority.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) is seeking to reduce support costs and increase defense budgets for modernization by outsourcing and privatizing certain activities. The Defense Science Board (DSB) identified potential savings of $6 billion annually by fiscal year 2002 through outsourcing support functions, primarily in CONUS logistics infrastructure activities.
2. The DSB's savings estimates were overstated, according to a Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) assessment. The overstatement was due to underestimation of contract administration and oversight costs, one-time inventory savings claimed as steady state savings, and the assumption that DOD would overcome legislative and cultural impediments to outsourcing.
3. The private sector has achieved significant savings and improvements by using highly accurate information systems, consolidating and centralizing activities, employing process streamlining methods, and outsourcing non-core activities. DOD has also made progress in reducing logistics costs and improving performance through actions such as consolidating depots and using prime vendors for certain commodities.
4. To effectively implement cost-reduction initiatives, DOD is recommended to develop a detailed implementation plan for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its logistics infrastructure, including reengineering, consolidating, outsourcing logistics activities where appropriate, and reducing excess infrastructure. The plan should establish time frames for identifying and evaluating alternative support options and implementing the most cost-effective solutions, and identify required resources for accomplishing the cost-reduction initiatives.

2. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists play a role in meeting the MHSS medical readiness mission by providing mental health care to active-duty personnel. Psychiatrists can diagnose and treat mental disorders medically, while clinical psychologists provide psychotherapy and can diagnose mental conditions based on behavior.
3. The PDP was established in 1991 to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists in the military by allowing them to prescribe psychotropic medication under certain circumstances. This was in response to a conference report that emphasized the importance of addressing ""battle fatigue.""
4. The PDP was designed and implemented by the Army Surgeon General, with a blue ribbon panel recommending a 2-year training model for the project. The training consisted of coursework at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences and clinical experience at military medical centers.
5. The PDP faced several challenges during implementation, including a lack of a clearly defined purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, unspecified participant selection criteria, repeated changes in the curriculum, delays in granting prescribing privileges, and unresolved issues involving supervision.
6. The cost of the PDP was substantial, with an estimated total cost of $6.1 million through the completion of the proctored year for those currently in the program. The cost per graduate was about $94,000 less if the project had progressed beyond the developmental stage and external evaluations could have been discontinued.
7. The PDP increased the number of MHSS mental health care providers who may prescribe drugs to treat certain mental conditions, potentially reducing psychiatrists' workloads. However, the cost-effectiveness of the PDP is unclear, and DOD has no current or upcoming need for clinical psychologists who may prescribe medication due to having more psychiatrists than needed to meet medical readiness requirements.

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates the National Airspace System (NAS) ATC system, which includes radars, automated data processing equipment, navigation and communication facilities, and provides services such as controlling takeoffs and landings and managing air traffic between airports.
2. FAA's modernization program, which began in 1982, has experienced substantial cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls. The Advanced Automation System (AAS) project, the centerpiece of the modernization program, was restructured in 1994 due to tripled costs and delayed capabilities.
3. FAA has spent over $25 billion on modernization projects, with about $5.3 billion on completed projects, $15.7 billion on ongoing projects, $2.8 billion on cancelled or restructured projects, and $1.6 billion for personnel-related expenses.
4. FAA has implemented some new systems, such as the Voice Switching and Control System (VSCS) and the Automated Surface Observing System, but has also added interim projects to sustain and enhance current equipment due to delays in other projects.
5. Two major components of the modernization effort, the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), have encountered delays and cost increases.
6. FAA lacks reliable cost-estimating processes and cost-accounting practices, making it difficult to make informed decisions on critical air traffic control systems. The agency has begun to improve its cost-estimating processes and acquire a cost-accounting system but will need time before accurate information is available.
7. FAA's software acquisition processes are ad hoc and lack discipline, putting the agency at risk of acquiring software that does not perform as intended and is not delivered on time and within budget. FAA has initiated efforts to improve its software acquisition processes but has not yet fully implemented them agencywide.

2. In 1992, the World War II 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coins Act was passed, directing the Treasury to mint and sell commemorative coins with surcharges, some of which were transferred to the Foundation to create a US D-Day and Battle of Normandy Memorial in Normandy.
3. The Foundation obtained 2.5 acres of land adjacent to a World War II museum in Caen, France, and constructed the Memorial Garden on it, which required the Foundation to fund the costs of operating and maintaining the land and garden for the entire lease term.
4. The Foundation planned to build a Wall of Liberty in Normandy and requested additional financial support for the project to register veterans who may be unable to contribute the $40 fee.
5. In 1993, allegations of financial impropriety were made against the Foundation and its president, Anthony C. Stout, in a series of articles. The Foundation appointed a special committee to investigate the allegations and reported that they were unsupported.
6. The Foundation experienced significant financial problems, including weak internal controls over transactions between the Foundation and Mr. Stout, a lack of formal written policies and procedures for travel and expense reimbursements, and a precarious financial condition that casts doubt on its ability to continue operations.
7. The Foundation received $3 million from the Treasury in 1993 for the Memorial Garden and used the funds toward the project's costs, which exceeded the amounts provided by the Coins Act. The Foundation's financial condition is uncertain, and it is unclear whether it will be able to fund future costs of operating and maintaining the Memorial Garden or other projects such as the Wall of Liberty.

However, these investments pose challenges, including reliance on manager skill, use of leverage, higher fees, limited transparency and liquidity, and operational risks.
2. Hedge funds are actively managed investments that can generate large returns but also involve significant risks, such as relying on manager skill, use of leverage, and higher fees. Limited transparency and liquidity are also challenges, as well as the need for a due diligence review of the fund of funds firm.
3. Private equity investments require longer-term commitments and may involve concentration risk due to the limited number of underlying holdings. Valuation is also uncertain during the fund cycle, and private equity funds often require commitments of capital for several years before any returns are realized.
4. ERISA requires plan fiduciaries to meet general standards of prudent investing but does not impose specific limits on investments in hedge funds or private equity. Some states have policies that restrict or prohibit pension plan investment in these asset classes.

2. The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) are the two defined benefit retirement plans administered by OPM. CSRS covers most federal employees hired before 1984, while FERS covers most employees hired in or after 1984.
3. The retirement application process begins when an employee submits a paper application to their employer's human resources office, which provides retirement counseling and augments the application with additional paperwork. The package is then sent to the payroll office for review and submission to OPM. OPM calculates an interim payment and begins the process of analyzing the application and associated paperwork to determine the total monthly benefit amount.
4. OPM has faced challenges in modernizing its retirement processing systems due to paper-based, manually intensive processes, high costs and limited capabilities of existing information systems, and a lack of qualified personnel to operate and maintain the antiquated systems.
5. OPM has attempted to modernize its retirement processing through various initiatives since the late 1980s, including the FERS Automated Processing System (FAPS) and the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program.

3. The four bilingual education programs share the same performance goals, eligibility criteria, and allow similar uses of program funds. They target students with limited English proficiency in kindergarten through 12th grade and aim to help such children reach high academic standards.
4. The grant competition cycle for the four programs lasts approximately 4 to 6 months, and applications are reviewed and scored based on selection criteria. The applications are similar but tailored to local needs, and school districts may submit applications to receive funding from more than one program.
5. The effectiveness of the four bilingual education programs on a national level is unknown due to the variability in assessment tests, performance standards, and definitions of key terms used by grantees. Education may be able to gather some information about program effectiveness by comparing local data with Education's performance standards, but isolating the effects of BEA funding would be difficult due to multiple funding sources.

2. Pesticides play a significant role in increasing tobacco production but can harm humans if not used properly. Exposure to pesticides is through residues that remain on crops and reflect the amount applied, time since application, and speed of dissipation. Residue levels on tobacco decline as it moves from field to finished consumer product.
3. The primary federal requirements for pesticide registration, sale, and use are in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), both as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). EPA determines the safety of pesticides for human health and the environment and registers them for use.
4. EPA conducts health risk assessments to evaluate the potential health impacts of pesticides on humans and determine what measures are needed to mitigate identified risks.

3. User fees can be imposed on various activities, such as motor fuels, tires, heavy vehicles, aviation fuel, and airline tickets, and can be used to fund federal highway and transit programs, as well as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) activities.
4. The boundaries between fees and taxes are not always clear, and the tradeoffs among design elements can be relevant to both.
5. User fees can promote equity by assigning costs to those who both use and benefit from the services, and can also enhance economic efficiency by ensuring that resources are allocated to the most highly valued use.
6. User fees can be set under the beneficiary-pays principle, which guides decisions about how program costs are divided between the general public and users, and can also guide how program costs are assigned among users.
7. User fees should be sufficient to cover the intended portion of program costs over time, and agencies must project and consider future program costs.
8. User fees can be collected at the point of sale, point of service, or after the service has been provided, and collecting the fee at the point of sale or point of service may decrease administrative costs.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) sets an annual standard price for fuel based on three components: crude oil price, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs. The crude oil price is based on the forecasted price provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), while the refinement markup and nonproduct costs are estimated based on historical data and current market experience.
2. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DOD faced significant challenges in setting a standard price that closely approximates its actual fuel costs. Actual prices have differed from DOD's estimates largely due to changes in fuel market conditions that were not reflected in the standard price.
3. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, designed to absorb the effects of price fluctuations, has been insufficient to absorb the significant net outlays for fuel. This has led to large transfers into the fund from other DOD accounts and adjustments to the standard price DOD charges to customers, disrupting other DOD programs and straining the military services' budgets.
4. DOD has not reevaluated its approach to setting the standard price since 2007, and has not fully documented its rationale for the assumptions it uses. Documenting its assumptions and providing a detailed rationale for each component of the standard price would provide greater transparency and clarify the process for fuel customers and decision makers.
5. To improve its process for setting the standard fuel price, DOD is recommended to reevaluate its approach for estimating the components of the standard price and document its assumptions. This would allow DOD to develop more informed estimates and better position the department to minimize risks and uncertainty resulting from changing market conditions.

2. The assessment included reviewing 853 randomly selected refunds, analyzing data from IRS' Management Information System, reviewing reports on refund fraud, attending operational meetings, assessing availability of tax materials at walk-in sites, testing access to ordering forms and publications, analyzing IRS' toll-free telephone system accessibility data, and interviewing IRS officials.
3. The number of individual income tax returns filed in 1994 was 1.1 million short of IRS' revised expectations due to several factors, including the IRS Reduce Unnecessary Filings program, a drop in interest rates, and a change in withholding rates.
4. Electronic and TeleFile use increased in 1994, while 1040PC use declined slightly. IRS plans to expand TeleFile to all or parts of three more states in 1995 and make it available nationwide in 1997.
5. IRS' computer systems generally performed well during the 1994 filing season, but some systems problems occurred that had operational impacts, such as downtime for IRS personnel and short delays in refunds for taxpayers.
6. IRS exceeded its accuracy and timeliness goals for processing refunds and its accuracy goal for processing returns and took positive steps to improve its processing of tax receipts.
7. The EIC continued to be a leading source of errors by taxpayers and tax practitioners, contributing to IRS' error resolution workload. IRS changed its procedures in 1993 to require taxpayers to submit a completed Schedule EIC with their returns when claiming the credit, but some taxpayers still did not comply.
8. The number and dollar amount of IRS-detected fraudulent refund claims, on both electronic and paper returns, have been steadily increasing over the past several years, and IRS took several steps to better control filing fraud, including adding up-front computer checks, adding staff to fraud detection teams, initiating studies, and engaging the services of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

4. The Clinton administration proposed legislation to implement worker profiling in 1993, which was enacted as the Unemployment Compensation Amendments.
5. The law requires states to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for UI regular compensation and refer those most likely to exhaust benefits to reemployment services.
6. States are required to collect information on the type of services claimants receive, their participation, and their subsequent employment outcomes.
7. Labor issued guidance to help states establish profiling tools and provide necessary reemployment services, recommending the use of five variables: union status, industry or occupation, tenure at previous job, education level, and state unemployment rate.
8. Many states use statistical models to identify claimants most likely to exhaust benefits, while others use characteristic screens.
9. The effectiveness of the worker-profiling initiative is unclear, with limited research and inconsistent data.
10. Labor has not published any studies on the effectiveness of the initiative since 1999 and has not conducted ongoing or future research on the topic.

1. The Medicare Subvention Demonstration was established in 1998 to provide health care coverage to older military retirees through TRICARE, with Medicare acting as a secondary payer. The demonstration aimed to improve access and contain costs, and it offered three options: TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Standard.
2. The demonstration resulted in higher costs for DOD due to retirees' heavy use of services and prescription drugs, despite retirees being healthier on average than comparable Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. DOD incurred greater costs to support the demonstration and had to cover the shortfall. The payment rules prevented the government from paying twice for the same care and protected Medicare from a large increase in spending for Senior Prime enrollees.

The Corporate Information Management (CIM) initiative was launched by the Department of Defense (DOD) in 1989 to improve business practices, make better use of information technology, and eliminate duplicative information systems across seven administrative areas. The scope of CIM has since broadened to include all DOD functional areas, with a primary objective of significantly improving business processes through techniques such as business process reengineering and continuous process improvements.
2. The CIM initiative has faced challenges, including a lack of clear program authority, insufficient integration of CIM efforts, and resistance from some functional and technical managers. DOD has taken steps to address these challenges, including the establishment of the Enterprise Integration Executive Board and the clarification of program authority under the CIM Strategic Plan. However, more action is needed to ensure active participation and leadership from functional managers and to build support and commitment from all DOD employees for the cultural changes required to implement CIM.

1. The distribution of prescription drugs involves multiple entities including wholesalers, independent pharmacies, Pharmacy Services Administrative Organizations (PSAOs), and third-party payers and their Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). Wholesalers purchase drugs from manufacturers and distribute them to independent pharmacies, offering ancillary services such as inventory management. Independent pharmacies primarily purchase drugs from wholesalers and provide patient-care services. They are an important part of a wholesaler's customer portfolio due to the potential for multiple business opportunities and administrative efficiencies.
2. In 2011 or 2012, there were at least 22 PSAOs, which varied in the number and location of pharmacies they served. The largest 5 PSAOs combined contracted with more than half of all pharmacies represented by a PSAO. PSAOs provide a range of services to independent pharmacies, including contract negotiation, communication, and help-desk services, which are considered their ""key services.""
3. PSAOs negotiate and enter into contracts with third-party payers or their PBMs on behalf of member pharmacies. Small independent pharmacies often lack the legal expertise and time to negotiate contracts effectively. PSAOs may review and negotiate a wide range of contract provisions, including reimbursement rates, payment terms, and audit provisions.
4. PSAOs provide communication services to pharmacies, including information about contractual and regulatory requirements and general news and information. They may also provide assistance with issues related to third-party payers and their PBMs, such as questions about claims, contracting, reimbursement, and audits. PSAOs create administrative efficiencies for both independent pharmacies and third-party payers or their PBMs by acting as a single point of contact and reducing call center volume.

2. Federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to determine if their projects might jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify their critical habitat.
3. If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is released along with reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to avoid jeopardy. To excuse incidental taking of listed species, the Services issue an incidental take statement with reasonable and prudent measures (RPMs) to minimize project effects.
4. When a federal action cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species, and the federal agency believes that RPAs would thwart the project, the federal agency, governor, or licensees or permittees may seek an exemption.
5. The exemption process offers the opportunity to consider economic circumstances and provides a chance for economic factors to override jeopardy to the species, but it applies to the federal project, not the species.
6. The Tellico Dam controversy in Tennessee in the 1970s led to the creation of the exemption process, which involves a committee of top government officials who balance the national interest in protecting listed species against the national interest in proceeding with an important federal project.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a tax calculation with a broader base than the regular tax, which requires individuals to add back certain provisions and tax them at a higher rate.
2. The AMT base includes business provisions, state and local taxes, some medical expenses, miscellaneous deductions, and personal exemptions, but excludes benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds.
3. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, leading to an increase in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT.
4. In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but by 1999, this number had increased to 823,000, and it is projected to reach over 9 million by 2009.
5. The AMT will affect a larger share of joint returns and returns with tax liability, as well as those with limited tax credits.
6. The marriage penalty arises for some families due to the combination of income and progressive tax rates, and H.R. 1836 aimed to address this issue for most taxpayers.

2. India has traditionally had positive relations with Iran, which it views as having ""civilizational ties."" India and Iran signed a strategic partnership in 2003.
3. Some in the U.S. are concerned that India's friendship with Iran could hinder the further development of U.S.-India ties. However, India-Iran relations have not evolved into a strategic alliance and are unlikely to derail the U.S.-India partnership.
4. India has shown interest in maintaining positive ties with Iran, especially in the area of energy commerce. Indian firms have taken long-term contracts for purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and India supports the proposed construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan.
5. The U.S. opposes the pipeline project, but top Indian officials insist it is in India's national interest. Some analysts believe that geostrategic motives beyond energy security drive India's pursuit of closer relations with Iran.
6. There have been concerns in the U.S. about India's defense relations with Iran and its energy deals with the country. Some Indian persons have been sanctioned by the U.S. under various non-proliferation acts for transfers of technology that could be useful for Iran's purported weapons of mass destruction programs.

1. In 2009, there was renewed interest in imposing new import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs) due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes. Advocates argue that stricter import controls would prevent unlimited importation of milk protein, encourage domestic production, and raise milk prices for farmers. Opponents contend that such measures would increase costs for food manufacturers and result in higher retail food prices.
2. Milk protein is a component of milk, making up approximately 3.4%, and is split into casein (2.8%) and whey protein (0.6%). Casein is extracted from milk using enzymes or acids, while whey protein is found in liquid whey, a by-product of cheese manufacturing. MPCs are manufactured using ultrafiltration, blending, or co-precipitation and are used in various food products due to their functionality and exact product composition.
3. The United States imports a significant amount of dairy products, with cheese being the largest share, followed by MPCs and casein/caseinates. The U.S. produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates, and federal dairy policies have been criticized for encouraging the production of nonfat dry milk at the expense of protein products. Imports of MPCs are currently subject to very low tariffs and are not subject to import quotas or licensing requirements. However, there have been efforts to change the tariff treatment of MPCs and introduce import quotas.

2. In Florida v. Jardines, the Court held that a dog sniff at the front door of a suspected grow house by a trained narcotics-detection dog is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause.
3. In Florida v. Harris, the Court refused to accept a trained drug-detection dog's positive reaction as per se probable cause to search a vehicle.
4. In Bailey v. United States, the Court held that the detention of an individual who has just left premises to be searched under warrant is permissible when the individual is detained out of view of the house as soon as practicable.
5. In Missouri v. McNeely, the Court refused to establish a per se exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases.
6. Drug-sniffing dogs first appeared in the Court's jurisprudence in Place, where the Court observed that the use of a dog in a public area was something less than a typical Fourth Amendment search.
7. The Florida Supreme Court held that the use of a drug-sniffing dog on Jardines's front porch constituted a search and that such a search required probable cause before it could be conducted.
8. The Florida Supreme Court distinguished the case at hand from United States Supreme Court precedents on several grounds, including the minimally intrusive manner of the tests conducted in Place, Edmond, and Caballes, and the public spectacle and potential for arbitrary or discriminatory application of the dog sniff searches.
9. The concurring justices in Jardines offered another factor: the lack of a uniform system of training and certification for drug-detection canines.
10. The majority in Jardines concluded that the dog sniff searches may only be conducted on the basis of probable cause in the absence of exigent circumstances or non-law enforcement special needs.

2. The District of Columbia was established in 1790 as the permanent seat of government, with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant designing the federal city and Major Andrew Ellicott surveying the 10-square-mile district.
3. The CWA was enacted to preserve the integrity of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans for the Nation's Capital, ensure public use and enjoyment of open space, preserve and protect limited open space, and encourage the location of commemorative works within the urban fabric of the District.
4. The CWA defines a commemorative work as any statue, monument, sculpture, memorial, plaque, inscription, or other structure of landscape feature, including a garden or memorial grove, designed to perpetuate in a permanent manner the memory of an individual, group, event, or other significant element of American history.
5. The process for creating a memorial in the District of Columbia involves a 24-step outline, including seeking National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission (NCMAC) assistance, drafting and introducing a bill, site selection and approval, design approval, fundraising, and construction.
6. Memorial sponsors must find a congressional sponsor to introduce authorizing legislation, which cannot be enacted until at least 25 years after the event, death of the individual, or death of the last surviving member of the group being commemorated. For military works, legislation can only be considered for wars or similar major military conflicts officially ended for at least 10 years.
7. Once a memorial is authorized, the memorial sponsor works with the National Park Service (NPS) to get plans approved by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Commission of Fine Arts, raises funds, and begins construction. The memorial is then dedicated and transferred to NPS or the General Services Administration for management.

2. HRPs generally cover individuals who have been denied coverage, received quotes higher than HRP premiums, or received offers with exclusions for preexisting conditions.
3. HRPs help states comply with HIPAA provisions requiring guaranteed availability and prohibition of exclusions for preexisting conditions in the individual market.
4. Approximately 200,000 individuals were enrolled in HRPs in 2008, but nearly 4 million more were potentially eligible.
5. HRPs fill a niche in the health insurance system, as most Americans receive coverage through group markets or public programs, and some individuals cannot access either.
6. Insurers in the individual market rigorously underwrite applicants, excluding those with moderate to severe health conditions, leaving a need for HRPs.
7. HRPs are designed to be publicly subsidized insurance pools that help stabilize the private market by removing high risk individuals and reducing premiums for others.
8. HRPs are usually operated through state-established nonprofit organizations, with premiums capped and losses covered through various funding sources.
9. Federal grants have been provided to states to establish and operate HRPs since the 1990s, with the most recent funding coming from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).

The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a program established by President Truman in 1951 that allows the Departments of Defense and Transportation to work together to manage civil aircraft for military airlift needs during emergencies. CRAF participants must be U.S. carriers fully certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and commit at least 30% of their passenger fleet and 15% of their cargo fleet to the program. Aircraft committed must meet FAA regulations and be U.S. registered.
2. The CRAF program has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the aircraft performance characteristics needed. The long-range international section consists of commercial airliners capable of transoceanic operations, while medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft make up the short-range international section. The aircraft in the Alaskan section provide airlift within U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility. The domestic section is designed to satisfy increased DOD airlift requirements in the United States during an emergency. The aeromedical evacuation segment assists in the evacuation of casualties from operational theaters to hospitals in the continental United States using civil Boeing 767 passenger aircraft converted into air ambulances.

3. The Act includes affirmative defenses such as the ""meeting competition"" defense, which allows sellers to charge different prices if the lower price is necessary to meet competition, and the ""cost justified"" defense, which permits price differentials if they only make due allowance for costs incurred in producing or delivering the goods. The Nonprofit Institutions Act also provides a broad exemption from the general price-discrimination prohibition for purchases by schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions not operated for profit.
4. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Nonprofit Institutions Act's ""for their own use"" exemption narrowly, limiting it to purchases made by nonprofit institutions for their own use in providing services to their clients, and not for resale or use in competing against private enterprise.

1. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) are the two WTO agreements most relevant to U.S. domestic farm policy. The AoA sets country-specific aggregate spending limits on market-distorting policies and defines rules for trade among member countries. The SCM details rules for determining when a subsidy is prohibited or actionable based on its degree of market distortion.
2. The AoA categorizes agricultural domestic support programs according to their potential to distort markets, with amber box subsidies being the most market-distorting and subject to spending limits. Green box programs are minimally or non-trade distorting and not subject to any spending limits, while blue box programs are production-limiting and also not subject to spending limits. De minimis exemptions allow for certain small domestic support spending to be excluded from the AMS limit.
3. The U.S. notified the WTO of $127.5 billion in green box outlays, $0 in blue box outlays, $5.3 billion in de minimis exclusions, and $6.9 billion in amber box support for the 2012 marketing year. The U.S. has not notified any blue box payments since 1995.
4. To comply with WTO rules, U.S. farm policies must be designed to minimize market distortion and avoid prohibited or actionable subsidies under the SCM. Policymakers consider the potential impact of new farm proposals on U.S. commitments under the AoA and the degree of market distortion they may cause under the SCM.

1. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV) amends and revises the Perkins Act, authorizing funding for FY2007-FY2012 for Perkins Act programs and activities. It retains the overall purpose and structure of the Perkins Act, but makes changes to funding formulas, accountability requirements, state and local plans, and the tech-prep program.
2. Perkins IV makes changes to funding formulas, including reducing the percentage reserved for assistance for outlying areas and increasing direct grants to these areas. It also modifies the state allotment formula when there are ""additional funds"" above the amount allotted to states for FY2006, allowing for more funds to be distributed to qualifying states with smaller grants.
3. Perkins IV strengthens and substantially changes accountability requirements and associated sanctions for both eligible agencies and recipients. It establishes separate core indicators of performance for the secondary and postsecondary levels, requires annual data reporting, and sets minimum performance levels for each core indicator. It also allows for the withholding of funds for eligible agencies and recipients that fail to meet these performance levels.

2. The federal estate tax is a tax on the estate of a decedent, while the inheritance tax is paid by the heirs based on the property they receive. The determination of federal estate tax liability involves adjusting the gross estate and applying tax rates.
3. The gross estate includes all property owned by the decedent on the date of death, as well as certain transfers made prior to death, such as life insurance proceeds and property with retained interests.
4. Deductions from the gross estate include funeral expenses, administration costs, debts, charitable bequests, and state death taxes. The marital deduction allows for the transfer of property to a surviving spouse without estate tax.
5. The gift tax is imposed on gratuitous transfers made during life and seeks to account for potential reductions in estate tax liability at death. The taxable gift is determined by reducing the gross value with exclusions and deductions, and the donor's tax liability is reduced by the unified transfer tax credit.
6. The generation-skipping transfer tax is a flat-rate tax on transfers to individuals two or more generations below the transferor, with a rate set at the highest estate tax rate (currently 40%). The tax applies to direct skips, taxable terminations, and taxable distributions, and the taxable amount is determined based on the value of the property transferred and the inclusion ratio.

1. The expedited removal process is a streamlined procedure for removing certain arriving aliens or aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled who have been in the country less than two years and are inadmissible due to a lack of entry documents or fraud or misrepresentation. This process allows for summary removal without a hearing or further review, unless the alien indicates an intent to apply for asylum or expresses a fear of persecution.
2. The Supreme Court has recognized the federal government's broad plenary power over the admission and exclusion of aliens seeking to enter the United States, and may deny admission without affording due process protections. However, an alien who has entered the United States is generally entitled to due process protections prior to removal. The ""entry fiction"" doctrine allows courts to treat an alien seeking admission as though he had not entered the country, but its application to aliens already within the United States remains unclear.

3. Proposals have been made to mandate Social Security coverage for all newly hired state and local government employees to increase the universality of the program and improve its financial status.
4. Mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds on average over the 75-year projection period.
5. Opponents argue that mandatory coverage may not result in better benefit protections for workers due to potential reductions in pension benefits or changes to Social Security contribution and benefit structures.
6. Some observers suggest that mandatory Social Security coverage could simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who divide their careers between state and local government positions and other positions, and provide better benefit protections through the provision of dependents' and survivors' benefits and full cost-of-living adjustments under Social Security.

2. Corruption among officials in Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), facilitates trafficking and provides criminal groups with immunity from law enforcement and judicial action. Synergistic links connect various forms of trafficking, with smugglers using the same routes for multiple forms of contraband.

1. Noncitizen detention: ICE is responsible for ensuring safe and humane conditions of confinement for detained aliens, including the provision of reliable, consistent, appropriate, and cost-effective health services. Detainees include criminal aliens, asylum seekers, illegal aliens, and those arriving without proper documentation.
2. Detention Standards: ICE's National Detention Standards outline the conditions for immigration detainees, but they do not have the force of law. The Detention Operations Manual contains a section on health services, which includes standards for medical care, hunger strikes, suicide prevention, and terminal illness.
3. Health Care Provision: ICE contracts with Creative Corrections and Nakamoto Group Inc. for facility inspections and quality assurance, while the Detention Facilities Inspection Group (DFIG) provides oversight and investigates serious incidents. The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS) is responsible for providing health care to noncitizens detained by ICE, with on-site care at some facilities and contract workers at others.
4. Issues and Concerns: Reports of substandard medical care for detainees have led to increased congressional interest and legislation. Concerns include the effectiveness of oversight, the adequacy of the covered benefits package, and the appropriate standard of care for foreign nationals in immigration detention.

1. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a new foreign aid initiative announced by President Bush in March 2002, with the goal of providing aid to countries that have demonstrated a commitment to sound economic and good governance policies.
2. The MCA is a performance-based initiative, with countries selected based on their records in three areas: ruling justly, investing in people, and pursuing sound economic policies.
3. The MCA legislation, signed into law in January 2004, authorized the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and appropriated $994 million for FY2004. The MCC is headed by a CEO who reports to a Board of Directors, and is intended to focus exclusively on development goals without being influenced by other foreign policy objectives.
4. The MCA is intended to represent a significant shift in U.S. aid policy, with the entire $5 billion money pool tied to performance and results, and program proposals based on national development strategies developed by the countries themselves.
5. The MCA has been criticized for targeting both low and lower-middle income countries, with some arguing that resources should be focused exclusively on the poorest nations where the needs are greatest. Others have raised concerns about the selection criteria and the impact on other U.S. development aid programs.
6. The MCA is part of a larger trend towards increased foreign aid funding, with President Bush pledging to maintain economic aid amounts at least at the FY2006 level and increase them by $5 billion by that year.

2. The Senate Agriculture Committee passed its version of the bill, S. 3240, on June 21, 2012, and the House Agriculture Committee passed its version, H.R. 6083, on September 13, 2012.
3. Both bills aim to reduce spending compared to the current farm bill, with the Senate bill reducing spending by $23.1 billion and the House bill reducing it by $35.1 billion.
4. Both bills eliminate direct payments, counter-cyclical price programs, and the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program, but continue marketing assistance loans and provide programs for covered crops except cotton.
5. The Senate bill provides for only a revised revenue program called Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC), while the House bill offers a choice between a price loss coverage (PLC) and revenue loss coverage (RLC) program.
6. Both bills reauthorize disaster programs for livestock and tree assistance for FY2012-FY2017, but the Senate bill also provides disaster benefits to tree fruit producers and includes conservation compliance for crop insurance.
7. The bills make significant changes to farm commodity programs, including eliminating dairy product price support, the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, and export subsidies, and replacing them with a new program that makes payments to participating dairy producers when the national margin falls below $4.00 per hundredweight.
8. The bills also include provisions for rural development, conservation, trade, nutrition, credit, energy, and miscellaneous issues, with some differences between the Senate and House versions.

1. Inland waterways are a significant component of the nation's marine transportation system, carrying approximately one-sixth of the national volume of intercity cargo on 25,000 miles of commercially active waterways.
2. The Inland Waterway System (IWS) consists of approximately 12,000 miles of federally managed waterways, covering 38 states and handling approximately half of all inland waterway freight.
3. The Corps of Engineers develops, operates, and maintains the infrastructure of these commercial waterways, and also maintains and regulates channel depths through dredging and water management. Costs for maintenance and construction are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry through user fees.
4. The current revenue source, a set tax on fuel, is insufficient to cover nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures on inland waterways, resulting in federal taxpayers covering more than half of these costs and limiting the number of new and ongoing projects.
5. Recent proposals include increasing the fuel tax, implementing a lock usage fee, or a combination of both, to address the revenue shortfall and ensure the solvency of the trust fund.
6. The IWTF balance has varied considerably since 1986, with significant increases and decreases due to appropriations, cost overruns, and stopgap measures. The current balance is stabilized, but without changes to IWTF financing, funding for new projects is expected to be extremely limited in the foreseeable future.

1. Commemoratives have been used by Congress to express gratitude, dramatize virtues, and perpetuate remembrance since its inception.
2. The scope of commemoratives expanded in the 19th century with the recommendation of special days for national observance, funding of monuments and memorials, creation of federal holidays, authorization of commemorative coins, and establishment of commemorative commissions.
3. In the 20th century, it became commonplace for Congress to use commemorative legislation to name buildings and other public works, scholarships, endowments, fellowships, and historic sites.
4. In response to concerns about excessive legislative time spent on commemoratives, initiatives were undertaken in the 1960s to reduce the number of commemorative measures. These initiatives included creating an advisory commission and amending congressional rules.
5. Commemorative options available to Congress include legislative and nonlegislative actions. Legislative options require passage of a bill or resolution by the House, Senate, or both chambers, while nonlegislative options can be accomplished by individual offices without legislative approval.
6. Legislative options for commemoratives include naming federal buildings, designing postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding congressional gold medals, creating monuments and memorials, designating commemorative observances, establishing federal holidays, and requesting presidential proclamations. Nonlegislative options include creating individual office awards, giving floor speeches, sending official letters, and ordering flags.

2. COMPETES 2010 increased funding authorizations for the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, as well as authorized new technology transfer and commercialization activities at these agencies.
3. The President's FY2013 budget request sought increased funding for the doubling path accounts, but included support for few COMPETES 2010 authorized STEM education programs. Only the Regional Innovation Program (RIP) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) was specifically included in the Administration's FY2013 budget request.
4. FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for selected COMPETES 2010 provisions was generally below FY2010 authorized levels, with some exceptions such as the NIST core laboratory account.
5. The House and Senate Committee on Appropriations agreed on major funding levels for the NSF in FY2013, but the House committee report directed NSF to give priority to research in certain fields and encouraged collaboration between research institutions and STEM-focused K-12 schools.
6. The debate about FY2013 funding for COMPETES 2010 provisions occurred within the broader conversation about the role of the federal government in encouraging scientific and technological innovation to improve national competitiveness. Opposition to the innovation policy approach embodied in the COMPETES acts has come from questions about fundamental assumptions, preferences for alternative policies or approaches, and cost concerns.

2. The Lacey Act now makes it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state or foreign law that protects plants or regulates taking or exporting plants and plant products in certain situations.
3. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act require importers of all covered plants and plant products to submit an import declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the time of importation, which must contain certain information such as identification of the species and genus of plants or plants used in a product, and country of origin of plants.
4. The primary aims of the 2008 amendments were to reduce illegal logging and to increase the value of U.S. wood exports. Illegal logging is a pervasive problem affecting several countries that produce, export, and import wood and wood products, and is a concern due to its economic, environmental, social, and political implications.

1. Farming is a cyclical business with price swings that can be destabilizing. Farmers respond to high prices by increasing production, but are less likely to cut back during price drops, leading to losses and depletion of resources. Factors contributing to price instability include weather, export demand, currency exchange rates, and farm support and export subsidy programs of foreign competitors.
2. The U.S. has provided counter-cyclical assistance to farmers for nearly 70 years, including deficiency payments linked to target prices, fixed production flexibility contract (PFC) payments, marketing assistance loans, and emergency market loss payments. The 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act ended deficiency payments and introduced PFC payments, marketing assistance loans, and loan deficiency payments (LDPs). The new law, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) of 2002, restores target prices and deficiency payments, while maintaining marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments, and brings soybeans and minor oilseeds under the support program rules. The new law also introduces counter-cyclical payments for grains, cotton, oilseeds, and milk, and national dairy market loss payments. The U.S. is committed to providing subsidies of no more than $19.1 billion per year under the URAA, and the new counter-cyclical assistance may be subject to this limit depending on its classification as an ""amber"" or ""green"" box policy.

2. The syntheses of the anhydrides were achieved through different methods, including conjugate addition of benzenesulfinic acid sodium salt to maleic anhydride and Michael addition of sulfone acetate to various tert-butyl acrylates.
3. The sulfone-substituted lactams were formed as single isomers in high yields upon decarboxylation, and the diastereoselectivity was reversed relative to aryl and thioaryl cases.
4. The AMRs were found to proceed via a mannich-like mechanism, with the iminium ion being attacked by the enolate of the anhydride and the cyclic transition state being stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the sulfone.
5. The AMRs tolerated a variety of non-enolizable aldehydes and alkylamines and anilines, and the use of commercially available imines or those purified by distillation significantly increased the yields of the lactam products.

1. The text discusses the role of microRNAs (mir-125a, mir-206, mir-145, mir-21, and mir-10b) in the invasion and development of breast cancer. Mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 are similar to tumor suppressor genes and may be involved in the suppression of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Mir-10b expression may indicate the invasion and development of breast cancer. Mir-21 is related to old patients with lymph node metastasis and positive her-2 expression, and is an independent prognostic factor of breast cancer. Mir-145 and mir-206 are related to negative er and negative her-2, and may be new targets in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. Mir-21, mir-125a, and mir-145 may contribute to the chemotherapy effect of epirubicin and are important in guiding the development of chemotherapy for breast cancer.
2. The text also mentions the functions and locations of each microRNA. Mir-125a is located at chromosome 19q13.41 and can inhibit tumors by directly lowering the mRNA and protein levels of some genes. Mir-206 is located at human chromosome 6p12.2 and can inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells by lowering the mRNA and protein expression levels of er and er co-regulatory proteins. Mir-145 decreases in many types of tumor tissues, including breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer, and can inhibit hyperplasia in tumor cells by affecting target genes. Mir-21 is located in the fra17b fragile area of chromosome 17q23.2 and controls the expression of many anti-oncogenes to prompt the metastasis and hyperplasia of breast cancer cells. Mir-10b is located between the hoxd4 and hoxd8 genes of 2p31.1 and is related to many types of tumors.

The text describes a study investigating the role of tissue transglutaminase 2 (tgm2) in the pathogenesis of chronic allograft injury (CAI) during reversible acute rejection in a rat model of kidney transplantation. The study found that mononuclear leukocytes isolated from allografts on day 9 after transplantation express high levels of tgm2 mRNA and protein, which is not reflected in increased protein levels on day 42. Monocytes were identified as the main cell type expressing tgm2, and its expression was suggested to be induced by interactions with graft endothelial cells and proinflammatory cytokines produced during acute rejection.
2. The study also investigated the effect of cystamine, a general inhibitor of tgm, on CAI development in the rat model. No difference in renal function or arterial remodeling was observed between placebo- and cystamine-treated groups, and arteries with intimal hyperplasia were detected in both groups. The study concluded that tgm2 expression by monocytes during acute rejection might be linked to apoptosis, and its potential role in the pathogenesis of CAI requires further investigation.

3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm EMP size and morphology.
4. EMPs were introduced into an intravenous (IV) bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) solution and circulated through a continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) circuit.
5. EMP clearance was rapid, with 50% clearance occurring within the first 30 minutes and circulating EMP levels reducing to 29% of the starting concentration within 40 minutes.
6. The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis.
7. The low dialysate EMP level and plateauing circulation EMP level beyond 40 minutes suggest that EMP sequestration occurs within the CVVH filter or tubing and that this is a saturable phenomenon.
8. Frequent filter changes or the use of more efficient and selective EMP clearance methods, such as conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to specialty CVVH filters, could overcome this limitation.

1. Researchers have developed a post-coupling methodology to attach biological targeting ligands to nanoparticles with controlled mol% attachment and ligand orientation. They achieved this by designing hybrid targeting ligands that consist of a peptide targeting moiety conjugated to a peg extension chain, which can then be post-coupled to a nanoparticle surface.
2. The researchers prepared rgd peptides and corresponding rge control peptides using solid-phase peptide synthesis and then subjected them to cyclization and deprotection to obtain cyclic pentapeptides. They then acetal protected the aldehyde functionality of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and activated the carboxy function for coupling using pentafluorophenol esterification. The resulting heterofunctional peg moiety was then coupled to the cyclic pentapeptides to obtain rgd acetal and rge acetal. Routine acetal deprotection yielded the desired products, rgd-peg-cho and control rge-peg-cho.
3. The researchers performed liposome-coupling reactions using rgd-peg-cho, rge-peg-cho, and prnhco-peg-cho with neutral cholesteryl-aminoxy lipid and neutral liposomes. The reactions were monitored by HPLC and mass spectrometry, and the resulting ligand-pegylated liposomes were described as belonging to either bcd1 or bcd2 nanoparticle families depending on the parent liposome formulation used in preparation. The results demonstrated that only 10mol% pegylated rgd-bcd1 nanoparticles were capable of delivering measurable and observable levels of fluorescent-label to integrin-rich human umbilical vein endothelial cells, highlighting the importance of optimizing nanoparticle physical properties for receptor-specific cellular uptake.

The economic burden of RA includes direct medical costs (hospitalizations, specialist visits, treatments, diagnostics, and nonmedical costs) and indirect costs (productivity loss and informal care). The introduction of biological agents has led to increased direct medical costs but also improved disease activity, joint damage, and loss of productivity.
3. The prevalence of RA in Italy is estimated to be around 0.5%, with higher rates in older adults. The aging population in Italy is expected to lead to a significant increase in the socioeconomic burden of RA on the national health system.
4. The cost-effectiveness of RA treatments should be evaluated not only based on direct medical costs but also on the impact on disease progression, indirect costs, and long-term safety and efficacy. Accurate pharmacoeconomic analyses can help guide treatment decisions and ensure effective spending without compromising the quality of care delivered.

1. A 71-year-old male patient with oral submucous fibrosis and limited mouth opening of 2.5 cm was treated with sectional maxillary and mandibular final impression procedures, followed by fabricating maxillary hinged and mandibular sectional and hinged complete dentures. The patient's primary impressions were taken using smallest size stock trays, and final impressions were made with light body polyvinyl siloxane addition silicon impression material. Sectional impression trays were poured with dental stone and joined extra-orally using dowel pins and acrylic plates. Denture bases were fabricated, sectioned, and rejoined using press buttons. Hinge assemblies were incorporated using self-cure acrylic resin.
2. The patient's maxillary and mandibular master casts were obtained, and denture bases were fabricated and sectioned. Press buttons were removed, and the gap between the two parts of the denture bases was closed by incorporating wax. The dentures were processed conventionally, and hinge assemblies were incorporated using orthodontic mandibular molar tubes and stainless steel wires. The dentures were placed back over the casts and the hinge assemblies were incorporated using self-cure acrylic resin. Proper care was taken to avoid acrylic material entrapment inside the hinges.
3. The patient was educated about the insertion and removal of dentures and recalled for follow-up visits to check for maintenance and adaptability. The patient initially experienced difficulty placing and removing the dentures but eventually got used to them. The text also discusses various techniques and modifications for fabricating dentures for patients with microstomia, including simplified sectional tray designs and ease of fabrication, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of this technique.

1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly form of liver cancer with a disproportionate impact on developing countries and males. Risk factors for HCC include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens, and genetic metabolic diseases. The molecular pathogenesis of HCC is complex and involves the dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways, including the HGF-CMET pathway.
2. The HGF-CMET pathway is a critical signaling system involved in normal development and tissue repair, but its dysregulation plays a key role in HCC and other solid tumors. HGF is a mitogenic and motogenic factor that interacts with the CMET receptor, leading to downstream signaling and the activation of multiple pathways, including the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Dysregulation of the HGF-CMET pathway can occur through various mechanisms, including aberrant paracrine or autocrine ligand production, overexpression of HGF and CMET, and mutations in the CMET gene.

1. The association between diabetes and cancer has been a subject of debate for over a century, but most diabetologists do not view cancer as a specific risk associated with diabetes in day-to-day practice.
2. Diabetes is a disease of increased intracellular oxidative stress and accelerated biochemical aging, and insulin, which is used in the management of type 2 diabetes, has raised concerns due to its ability to bind and activate the IGF-1 receptor.
3. Recent epidemiologic studies have confirmed that type 2 diabetes increases the risk for certain types of malignancies, including breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors.
4. The long-acting insulin analogue, glargine, is commonly used in the management of type 2 diabetes, and several studies have demonstrated its potential mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on cultured cancer cells, implicating activation of the IGF-1 pathway.
5. A German epidemiologic study suggested a specific cancer risk associated with glargine, but the findings were controversial, and three additional studies were commissioned to confirm or refute the findings.
6. The studies had limitations, including the lack of prospective treatment allocation, insufficient insulin dose data, and the exclusion of patients on combination insulin therapy or other potential confounding factors.
7. Further research is needed to address the relationship between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues and secretagogues, and cancer, as well as the potentially protective effects of metformin and the question of why diabetes is not more strongly associated with cancer.

1. Antireflection (AR) technology is important for increasing light coupling into high-efficiency solar cells by reducing their reflectivity.
2. Crystalline silicon solar cells can achieve low reflectivity through surface texturization and thin-film deposition, but further reduction is desired for improved efficiency.
3. Various nanostructures, such as photonic crystals, porous structures, plasmonics, nanowires, nanocones, frustum nanorods, biomimetic nanostructures, and dielectric nanoparticles, have been proposed for AR applications.
4. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a popular material for AR layers due to its wide bandgap and use in photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices.
5. ZnO nanorod arrays have shown better AR properties than other oxide compounds, with a reported weighted global reflectance of 6.6% in the 400-1,200 nm range.
6. ZnO nanowhiskers (NWS) have been grown on the surface of Czochralski (Cz) silicon solar cells using a seeding and growth two-step process for improved AR properties.
7. The growth of ZnO NWS is influenced by the length of growth time, with longer growth times resulting in increased density and length.
8. The efficiency of Cz silicon solar cells can be improved by up to 3% using ZnO NWS as the AR layer.
9. The fabrication of ZnO NWS involves nucleation and growth in an aqueous solution, with the decomposition of hexamethylenetetramine producing ammonia for the reaction and regulating the pH value.
10. The ZnO NWS grown for 45 minutes exhibit the lowest reflectivity and best AR properties, with the decrease in reflectivity primarily due to multiple scattering and the gradually changing refractive index profile.

1. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons with Lewy bodies.
2. The clinical diagnosis of PD can be challenging, especially in mild or uncertain cases, and it is important for accurate diagnosis as it affects management and prognosis.
3. Molecular imaging techniques using PET or SPECT have improved diagnostic accuracy for PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes.
4. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and sympathetic innervation of the heart have become popular tools for diagnosing PD.
5. DAT SPECT using [i]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-n-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) can visualize presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract and help exclude essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism.
6. Meta-[i]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy assesses sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals and can distinguish PD from other parkinsonian syndromes with decreased cardiac MIBG uptake.
7. Combined use of DAT SPECT and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in the same patient population can improve diagnostic accuracy compared to using each method alone.
8. In a retrospective study, the results of DAT SPECT and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy were compared with clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes, and the combined use of both methods showed increased diagnostic accuracy.

2. The patient had visited a water reservoir in a rural area of South Korea one month before the presentation and felt pain around the anus after defecating on the grass.
3. The tick was 25 mm long and 18 mm wide, with a small ornate scutum and long pedipalps. Its genital aperture and anus were located at specific levels, and it had various spurs on its coxae.
4. Histopathological examination revealed an intense skin reaction, a small epidermal defect, and a characteristic feeding lesion beneath the attachment site. The lesion was composed of a superficial perirostral portion and a deep cavitary portion.
5. Amblyomma testudinarium is a longirostrate tick that is more common in tropical and subtropical areas, including South East Asia and the Indian peninsula. It is distributed in South Korea, particularly in the southern coastal areas and Jeju Island.
6. The tick embeds its anterior part, called the capitulum, into the skin, and its chelicerae lacerate the epidermal layers for feeding. The dermis is infiltrated with various inflammatory cells, and a paucicellular zone around the lesion has relatively few inflammatory cells due to tick saliva's anti-inflammatory effects.

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heart condition characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, predominantly involving the interventricular septum, in the absence of other causes.
2. Familial HCM is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with at least 15 genes implicated and major genes including cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH7), troponin T (TNNT2), cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), cardiac troponin I (TNNI3), cardiac myosin regulatory light chains (MYL2), and cardiac myosin essential light chains (MYL3).
3. Mutations in the TNNT2 gene, which encodes cardiac troponin T, have been reported in approximately 15% of familial HCM cases, with most missense mutations located in exons 8-16 and associated with a severe form of the disease characterized by a poor overall prognosis and high incidence of sudden death despite only mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
4. Late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been identified as a predictive marker of ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in HCM.
5. Genetic analysis and determination of genotype-phenotype correlation in HCM have been considered clinically informative in recent years, with the TNNT2 mutation having the third-ranked incidence of familial HCM and insufficient genotype-phenotype correlation in Japanese familial HCM.

1. The text discusses a study conducted to determine predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of colorectal liver metastases (sclm). The study analyzed medical records of patients who underwent liver resections for sclm, hepatectomy for metachronous liver metastasis, and only resection for colorectal cancer from 1992 to 2004.
2. The study found that postoperative complications were significantly correlated with presence of a diverting stoma, duration of operation greater than 8 hours, amount of intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion. Only a greater amount of blood loss had a predictive value for increased occurrence of postoperative complications.
3. Anastomotic leakage was significantly correlated with lateral lymph node dissection, primary site of rectum, duration of operation greater than 8 hours, and amount of intraoperative blood loss. Operation time greater than 8 hours was the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sclm.
4. The text also discusses the controversy surrounding the optimal surgical strategy for resectable sclm, with simultaneous resection and staged resections being the two main options. Simultaneous resection could simplify and shorten the treatment schedule, while staged resections might offer a chance to evaluate liver or extrahepatic metastases between the two operations.

2. The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, and imaging studies suggested a simple liver cyst. However, during surgery, the cyst was found to be adherent to the liver by a small pedicle, leading to a complete excision instead of deroofing. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of CHFC.
3. CHFCs are rare, congenital lesions that have been reported in approximately 103 cases since their first description in 1857. They are most commonly found in segment iv of the left lobe of the liver and are characterized by a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer with interspersed mucus cells, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule. Laparoscopic excision is a viable option for treating CHFCs, especially for lesions in segments ii to vi, due to their superficial location, benign nature, and thick cyst walls.

2. The review identified 43 abstracts as potentially relevant studies, of which 19 were retrieved and reviewed for inclusion criteria and data extraction. The studies originated from various countries and aimed at community-dwelling participants, acute recovery phase, care home residents, and used individualised, workbook, group, or existing self-management programs adapted for stroke.
3. The review found that six studies adopted unreported measures of concepts presumably related to the process of self-management, but their reliability, validity, and responsiveness were unknown. Two studies used 10-point visual analogue rating scales (VAS) to assess usefulness, intelligibility, and satisfaction related to the intervention, but without established reliability or validity.
4. The review highlighted the importance of developing measures of self-management with involvement of the target population to enhance content validity and clinical utility. Three measures scored excellent in the content validity category, but measures that did not include user involvement scored poor. The use of a standardized critical appraisal tool and consensus between reviewers facilitated the selection and data extraction process.
</summary>

Additionally, the text emphasizes the need for clarifying the theoretical premise of interventions and selecting outcome measures that appropriately reflect and capture the expected outcome change. The reported theoretical drivers within stroke SMIs are unclear, and the heterogeneity of outcome measures utilized by SMIs may indicate a difficulty in determining the expected outcomes. Further work is warranted to conceptualize stroke self-management, examine theoretical premises, and develop appropriate outcome measures. The lack of measures specifically designed to measure self-management as a discrete concept is a significant limitation, and there is a need for studies to explore the theoretical underpinnings of SMIs and develop robust outcome measures to enable evaluation.",1

1. Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy diet. Adipose tissue secretes pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, and the presence of endotoxins and saturated fatty acids in the diet can trigger inflammation through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4).
2. Menopause, defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to the loss of ovarian function, leads to specific physical and metabolic remodeling, particularly a decline in estrogen production, which promotes adverse changes in lipoproteins, glucose and insulin metabolism, body fat distribution, clotting, and vascular endothelium.
3. Estrogens have both anti- and pro-inflammatory effects, and their reduction during menopause can contribute to the inflammatory processes that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. In vitro studies suggest that estrogen exerts anti-inflammatory effects by antioxidant actions, generation of nitric oxide, prevention of apoptosis, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, and modulation of the renin-angiotensin system.
4. In a study, rats were fed a control or hyperlipidic diet for 8 weeks with or without ovariectomy. The results showed that a hyperlipidic diet caused a decrease in il-6 and il-10 levels in mes adipose tissue, while ovariectomy combined with a hyperlipidic diet promoted a decrease in tnf-, il-6, and il-10 content in mes adipose tissue.
5. The findings suggest that both a high-fat diet and estrogen can influence the circadian rhythm and modify the expression of clock genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and protein expression. The disruption of circadian clock genes in fat tissue could contribute to the observed changes in cytokine content.

1. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels through the activation of VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2), is essential for the growth of solid tumors. Inhibition of angiogenesis through the use of drugs such as bevacizumab, 2c3, and r84, which block VEGF binding to its receptors, is an attractive therapeutic target in cancer treatment. These drugs have low toxicity as they target normal processes and not cancer cells directly.
2. Anti-VEGF therapy with drugs like bevacizumab, 2c3, and r84 reduces tumor size, microvessel density, and macrophage infiltration in an orthotopic model of breast cancer. These findings support the concept that reducing macrophage infiltration is an important aspect of anti-VEGF therapy. Additionally, these studies show changes in other immune cell infiltrates, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells (DCs), and neutrophils, following anti-VEGF therapy.

1. Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common condition in postmenopausal women, affecting an estimated 32 million women in the US.
2. Symptoms include dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation, and can negatively impact women's quality of life.
3. The Revive survey, conducted in 2012, demonstrated that many postmenopausal women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its symptoms.
4. Most women did not associate their vaginal symptoms with menopause or hormonal changes, and many had never discussed their symptoms with their healthcare providers (HCPs).
5. Among those who had discussed VVA symptoms with their HCPs, the HCP was the initiator only 13% of the time.
6. The most common reasons for not mentioning symptoms to HCPs were the assumption that symptoms were a natural part of aging or not bothersome enough at that time.
7. Among women who used VVA treatments, reported limitations included inadequate symptom relief, inconvenience, and dislike of accommodations needed for vaginal administration.
8. Women who remained naive to treatment despite a diagnosis of VVA cited safety concerns and concerns about hormone exposure as major reasons for not initiating treatment.
9. Effective patient education might begin with explaining that VVA is a common medical condition associated with reduced estrogen levels after menopause, and that it will worsen over time if left untreated.

1. In Denmark, women are advised to take a daily supplement of 400 g folic acid (FA) until the 12th week of gestation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs).
2. Women in the preconceptional period have inadequate dietary intake of folate and low supplementation from FA tablets or multivitamins (MVs).
3. Previous studies reported poor compliance with the FA recommendation, with rates ranging from 12% to 44% in various countries.
4. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of FA and MV supplement use and identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, reproductive, and medical predictors of such use among Danish pregnancy planners.
5. The study was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an internet-based prospective cohort study of Danish pregnancy planners called ""snart-gravid.""
6. The study found that 62% of the 5383 pregnancy planners adhered to the Danish FA recommendation, but this proportion may be overestimated due to the lack of information on exact doses and brand names of supplements.
7. The study found that higher age, finishing high school, having a short vocational training, intercourse frequency, and having had a pap smear once or more during the last 3 years were associated with increased prevalence of FA or MV use.
8. The study also found that women who had a previous spontaneous abortion, were physically active, and had a normal weight were more likely to use FA or MV supplements, while those with hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, or chlamydia infections showed little association with preconceptional use of FA or MVs.

1. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is linked to an increased risk of coronary and cerebral vascular diseases. Intermittent claudication is a common symptom of mild to moderate PAD, affecting around 5% of individuals over 60 years old.
2. Oxidative stress, which increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a role in the development and progression of PAD. Risk factors for PAD, like high total and LDL cholesterol levels, are similar to those for coronary heart disease.
3. Statins, which lower lipid levels and have pleiotropic effects, are suggested for three reasons in PAD patients: preventing coronary heart disease, treating lower extremity PAD, and perioperative treatment. While several studies show statins reduce coronary heart disease events and mortality, few specifically address PAD treatment.
4. The present study aimed to evaluate lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in PAD patients before and after surgery, comparing them to a simvastatin-treated group. The study found that PAD patients had higher total and LDL cholesterol levels and enhanced oxidative stress before surgery. However, no significant decrease in lipid peroxidation or increase in antioxidant capacity was observed after surgery. A decrease in thiol group concentrations and ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was noted postoperatively.

1. The text discusses a study investigating the effect of oral and repeated exposure to the herbal remedy ""fijk"" on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology. The herbal mixture contains 13 medicinal plants and is commonly used in Nigeria for various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, and sexual improvement. However, there is a lack of scientific data to support its medicinal benefits or potential toxicity.
2. The study found that oral administration of fijk to rats did not significantly change their average body weights or relative organ weights. However, it caused a significant reduction in rat plasma protein levels, elevated plasma triglyceride levels, and depleted plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The lipid profile indices suggest that these changes may increase the risk for cardiovascular disorders. Additionally, fijk caused hepatic alterations, including hypochromic, hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, and hyperemia, as evidenced by histopathological examinations. The study also found that oral exposure to fijk caused lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, as indicated by increased levels of malondialdehyde and decreased levels of reduced glutathione.

1. Preconceptional carrier screening allows couples to become aware of potential genetic risks and reproductive options before pregnancy.
2. Carrier screening and testing are two approaches to identifying carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders. Carrier screening is for individuals without an increased risk, while carrier testing is for those with a higher a priori risk.
3. Preconceptional carrier screening has been extensively studied for cystic fibrosis and has received positive attitudes from healthcare providers, patients, and the general public.
4. Traditional healthcare systems have hesitated to implement population-wide carrier screening due to concerns such as psychological impact, stigmatization, impairment of freedom of choice, medicalization, difficulty in reaching couples before conception, and provider-related barriers.
5. Commercial companies now offer direct-to-consumer (DTC) preconceptional carrier tests for autosomal recessive disorders, but concerns include the validity and utility of tests, absence of individualized medical supervision, lack of adequate consent procedures, absence of pre- and post-test genetic counselling, inappropriate testing of minors, privacy concerns, and potential burden on public health resources.
6. The large number of monogenic disorders included in DTC genetic testing panels challenges established screening guidelines, which require the condition to be an important health problem, have a suitable test with known predictive value, and lead to a favorable ratio of advantages to disadvantages.

1. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve atrophy.
2. Factors related to glaucoma include high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
3. Müller cells, the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina, support and nourish RGCs, maintain extracellular ion homeostasis, and interact in synaptic transmission.
4. Müller cells are involved in retinal function and are also implicated in multiple pathological retinal diseases, including glaucoma.
5. Reactive Müller cells can aggravate retinal damage by releasing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
6. Increased glial production of TNF-α contributes to the neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
7. TNF-α is a secreted inflammatory cytokine responsible for apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation.
8. A study aimed to determine if 1-aminoadipic acid (AAA), a compound that induces specific glial toxicity, inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
9. The study found that AAA treatment attenuated Müller cell gliosis and reduced retinal TNF-α levels, suggesting that AAA may promote RGC survival and be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.

1. The text describes the use of a new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFTR-L) for the treatment of nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms. The procedure involves identifying the lesion using endoscopy, ligation of the tumor with a ligation device, temporary suturing of the seromuscular layer, resection of the lesion under the ligation band using snare technique, and closure of the defect in the duodenal wall with ligation of vessels. The procedure was completed without complications in five consecutive patients.
2. The advantages of LEFTR-L over conventional full-thickness resection (FTR) include the avoidance of peritoneal exposure of tumor cells and the shorter endoscopic resection time. The procedure can be applied to lesions smaller than 15 mm in diameter and not close to the ampulla of vater. However, additional studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEFTR-L.

1. Self-rated health (SRH) has been shown to predict mortality and is a valid tool to assess health status and predict mortality in populations with and without cardiovascular diseases and functional ability. SRH is measured by asking participants to rate their overall health on a five-point scale.
2. Poor SRH has been linked to poor management of chronic diseases, such as tiredness/weakness, depression, and musculoskeletal pains. Lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases.
3. Dietary patterns, such as high consumption of fruits and vegetables, have been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and improve quality of life. Conversely, unhealthy dietary patterns, such as high intake of fast food and high-fat diets, have been associated with poor SRH.
4. Physical activity has been shown to lower the risk for the development of chronic diseases and improve health outcomes for those with chronic diseases. Regular physical activity is also associated with better SRH in various populations.
5. The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between dietary and physical activity behaviors and SRH in a multi-ethnic population. The study hypothesized that participants who reported lower fruits and vegetables intake and higher fatty-food intake and perform less physical activity will have poorer SRH.

2. Deflux was FDA approved in 2001 for treating grade 2-4 VUR in single systems without accompanying urological malformations in children above one year of age.
3. The ease of technique, short procedure, and recovery time, as well as repeatability, have made endoscopic injection a popular choice among surgeons and parents.
4. Reports suggest expanded use of Dx/HA injections for patients of all ages and grades of VUR, even in the presence of duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies.
5. The American Urological Association (AUA) endorses Dx/HA injections as a management option for pediatric VUR.
6. Initial success rate was quoted as 68%, but success rates have improved and currently show an overall radiographic success rate of 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection.
7. Pic cystography was developed to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent UTIs after a negative standard voiding cystogram and has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystogram.
8. Intraoperative pic cystography can predict a successful surgical outcome by correlating the results with a standard 2-month postprocedure vcug.

2. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used as an adjunct to ultrasound for diagnosing and characterizing fetal anomalies, particularly central nervous system pathology.
3. Ventriculomegaly, a condition characterized by an enlarged lateral ventricle, has a wide range of causes, including imbalances in cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, abnormal cerebral development, and destructive disease processes.
4. MRI has several advantages over ultrasound, including excellent contrast resolution, the ability to directly visualize the cortical region, and a larger field of view. However, it has limitations such as the impact of fetal motion and relatively low spatial resolution.
5. The interobserver agreement for both ultrasound and MRI can vary greatly, and the level of subspecialty training of the individuals interpreting the MRI examination significantly improves agreement.
6. MRI is particularly useful for detecting and characterizing additional anomalies associated with ventriculomegaly, such as intraventricular hemorrhage, corpus callosum dysgenesis, cortical malformations, and congenital infections.

2. The study identified a cohort of patients aged 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of lung cancer between July 1, 1999, and December 31, 2005, and used SEER and Medicare data to determine possible occurrence of bone metastasis, SREs, and deaths through December 31, 2006. The study excluded patients without full fee-for-service Medicare coverage or with missing data.
3. The study found that 19.8% of patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer presented with or subsequently had evidence of a possible bone metastasis as indicated by Medicare claims. Among these patients, 51% had one or more SREs. Having a bone metastasis was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer, and the association was similar for bone metastasis complicated with an SRE and for bone metastasis without an SRE. The most common SRE was radiotherapy to bone, followed by fracture, spinal cord compression, and surgery to bone. Among patients with fractures, 65% had a pathological fracture, with the spine as the most common site of occurrence.

2. The null hypothesis was that no significant differences would be found among push-out bond strength values after different root canal surface treatments.
3. The study used 55 extracted maxillary central incisors, which were cleaned and prepared using a rotary system and irrigated with sodium hypochlorite or ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA).
4. Some teeth were also treated with a photodynamic diode laser to remove the smear layer.
5. The teeth were then filled with gutta-percha and self-adhesive resin cement, and push-out bond strength was tested.
6. The results showed that orthophosphoric acid and the photodynamic diode laser were more effective at increasing bond strength than sodium hypochlorite or EDTA.
7. The study concluded that modifying the smear layer may be more effective when using a self-adhesive system.

Additional information:
- Self-adhesive resin cements have positive features such as esthetic and mechanical properties, resistance to moisture, and the ability to release fluoride.
- Failure of fiber-reinforced post and core restorations often occurs due to debonding at the post-resin or resin-dentin interface.
- Sodium hypochlorite and EDTA are commonly used for smear layer removal during root canal preparation.

1. The text reports an observational open clinical trial of the use of topical tazarotene for the treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis in 15 patients. The study documented the safety and rapid efficacy of the treatment, with mycological cure observed in 40% of patients after 4 weeks and complete healing in all patients after 12 weeks. The study also showed the fungistatic activity of tazarotene against T. mentagrophytes, T. verrucosum, C. albicans, and C. glabrata.
2. Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nail characterized by discoloration, thickening, and defect. Dermatophytes, yeasts (Candida), and nondermatophytes are the causative agents, with dermatophytes being the most common. Risk factors for onychomycosis include aging, reduced peripheral circulation, and diabetes. Successful topical treatment is challenging due to slow nail growth, physical presence of the nail plate, and difficulty in finding compounds with adequate pharmacologic profile for nail penetration.
3. Tazarotene is a synthetic retinoid that has shown beneficial effects in modulating keratinocyte proliferation and reducing inflammation. It is used for the treatment of acne, nonmelanoma skin tumors, and inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. The study suggests that tazarotene's fungistatic activity may be due to its ability to exert a protective action on the microvascular bed against fungal infection and its immunomodulatory effects, which may induce the blocking of fungal keratinolytic proteases.

Five of the nine acute haemodynamic non-responders with left bundle branch block (LBBB) showed an increase in acute haemodynamic response (ahr) above the 15% level with LV endocardial pacing.
3. The study found that basal or mid-posterolateral segments had the highest ahr in all 14 patients who showed ahr greater than 15%, and the best results were obtained by combining the best results from basal posterolateral and mid-posterolateral segments (pl-best). The average q-lv/qrs width ratio was 90%.
4. The study demonstrated that endocardial LV pacing, guided by acute haemodynamic studies, could improve clinical outcome in patients not responding to conventional CRT. However, there were limitations to the use of acute haemodynamic studies to predict clinical outcome, and further research is needed to determine the optimal cut-off value for increase in LVdp/dtmax before intervention is justified.

3. The data was collected from the National Dairy Research Institute in India for a period of 12 years and included fortnightly test-day milk yields for 733 cows.
4. The lactation curve was modeled using a gamma type function for normal and mastitis cows to predict milk yield with minimum error.
5. The normal cows had a lower initial milk yield and a gradual increase in milk yield up to peak production in the 3rd or 4th fortnight, followed by a steady decline. Mastitis cows had a lower initial milk yield and a rapid decline in milk yield after peak production in the 3rd fortnight.
6. The milk yield increased in the second parity and then declined gradually in both normal and mastitis cows. The highest milk yield was observed in the 4th parity.

2. Personalized medicine, which includes the identification of the optimal drug and dosage for a subgroup of patients, as well as situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options, is the driving hope of these advances in genetic epidemiology.
3. Biomarkers, which are substances or biological structures that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain, or predict the incidence or outcome of disease, are diversely defined but should be defined as characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.
4. DNA biomarkers, which are discrete in nature and stable over an individual's lifetime, are used for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes in personalized medicine. For example, they can be used to determine the precise stage of tumor and aggressivity in breast cancer, or to predict the response to treatment in colon cancer.
5. General biomarkers, which can be measured in biofluid, tissue, or cell lines, are quantitative in nature and can be used for therapy monitoring, pharmacodynamics, and as surrogate markers. For example, they can be used to monitor the efficacy or safety of a drug treatment, or to predict the likely response to treatment.
6. The validation of predictive biomarkers in personalized medicine involves various study designs, including retrospective and prospective studies, and requires the demonstration of clinical validity, analytical validity, and clinical utility. The use of biobanks for prospective validation of DNA biomarkers may play a role for already approved drugs in improving efficacy or safety in biomarker-defined subgroups.

1. Myosin VA (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
2. Each myova dimer consists of a pair of n-terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, and ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain.
3. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms, allowing the motor to take 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.
4. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs, stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains.
5. Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of myova, but in the presence of high calcium (>1 m), motor processivity is reduced, and one or more calmodulins may dissociate from each lever arm.
6. Calmodulin dissociation may render the lever arm highly compliant, reducing the efficiency of both the lever arm displacement amplification and the strain-dependent gating between the two heads, which are necessary for the motor's processivity.
7. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains.
8. TPM involves anchoring a myova-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor. Thermal energy causes the qdot to be randomly displaced, and the resulting motion is measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered qdot to a stationary reference qdot.
9. The flexural stiffness for the various myova constructs was determined by equipartition due to thermal energy, resulting in Brownian motion of the tethered qdot relative to the actin filament. The persistence length of the tether was calculated directly from the motion of the tethered qdot relative to actin and the length of the molecule.

3. In multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous mdm2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.45-0.88], p = 0.007). Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous cdh1 (rs5030625) ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival (AHR 4.0, 95% CI [1.4-11], p = 0.008).
4. The study suggests that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC.

1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with the combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla.
2. A magnetic tracer and a handheld magnetometer were evaluated as a radiation-free alternative to the combined technique in two clinical trials, with identification rates of 94.4%-98.0% that were noninferior to the combined technique. However, there was a discordance in SLNs identified between the magnetic and combined techniques, potentially leading to false-negative staging with the magnetic technique.
3. The particle size of the magnetic tracer used for the magnetic technique is much larger than that of the radioisotope used in the combined technique, which could influence lymphatic uptake and lymph node retention and lead to different SLNs being identified by the two techniques.
4. In an in vivo porcine model, three different-sized spio-based formulations were evaluated for their performance in SLNB using a handheld magnetometer. The 59 nm tracer demonstrated the highest magnetometer counts and iron content, while the 32 nm tracer had the lowest iron content and fewer magnetic hotspots.
5. The 59 nm tracer is currently the best-performing magnetic nanoparticle tracer for SLNB with a handheld magnetometer, as it distributes rapidly from the injection site, retains in the first nodes reached, and accumulates in high concentrations, making it the most suitable magnetic tracer for SLNB.

1. Vaspin, a serine proteinase inhibitor, was identified in visceral adipose tissue of otsuka long-evans tokushima fatty rats, an animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
2. Vaspin is expressed in various tissues including visceral adipose tissue, skin, hypothalamus, pancreatic islets, and stomach.
3. Circulating levels of adiponectin, another hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are inversely associated with T2DM and other metabolic traits.
4. Plasma vaspin concentrations are higher in men with the metabolic syndrome compared to those without it, and serum vaspin levels in T2DM patients are higher or similar to those in subjects with normal glucose tolerance.
5. Serum vaspin levels are negatively correlated with creatinine levels and are significantly reduced in Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients.
6. The study aimed to compare serum vaspin and adiponectin levels in subjects with normal renal function and renal insufficiency with or without T2DM.
7. The study recruited 416 local Han ethnicity residents of Shanghai and recorded clinical characteristics such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), risk factors for renal function, and T2DM.
8. The study found that patients with T2DM and renal insufficiency (group iii) had lower serum vaspin levels than those without T2DM (group iv), but no significant difference was observed between non-T2DM patients with renal insufficiency (group i) and those without (group ii).
9. The study also found that serum adiponectin levels were higher in non-diabetic individuals with renal insufficiency (group i) than in diabetic patients with normal renal function (group iv), but no significant difference was observed between diabetic patients with and without renal insufficiency (group iii and iv).

1. The text discusses the use of surrogate variables for predicting complete healing in advanced diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) using data from clinical trials and a postmarketing surveillance study.
2. Two clinical trials were conducted: a dose-exploratory trial and a confirmatory trial, involving a total of 190 ulcers.
3. Patients were diabetic, had Wagner grade 3 or 4 ulcers larger than 1 cm, and received standard care including debridement, moist dressing, pressure offloading, and antibiotics if necessary.
4. Granulation tissue development and percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT) were used as surrogate variables.
5. The median treatment duration was 5 weeks, and missing data at the 2nd week were imputed using the last observation carried forward or the average of contiguous evaluations.
6. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination.
7. The product coefficient (pc) was used to quantify the contribution of the surrogate on ulcer closure, and the results showed that granulation tissue development had a high pc and proportion mediated.
8. The association between some baseline influencing factors and healing and candidate surrogate variables was estimated using binary logistic regression.
9. The results confirmed that granulation tissue development at the EOT was an early predictor of final healing, with a high negative predictive value.
10. The study provides evidence for the use of granulation tissue development as a predictor of wound healing in advanced DFUs, which can be useful for clinical trial design and managing diabetic foot ulcers.

1. The text describes a retrospective cohort study comparing the perioperative surgical trauma and postoperative impact on the abdominal wall between needlescopic transabdominal preperitoneal (ntapp) and single-incision laparoscopic (stapp) repair for inguinal hernia.
2. The study involved 85 patients with a single-sided primary inguinal hernia, and data were collected on demographic and surgical factors, postoperative outcomes, and follow-up assessments.
3. The results showed that ntapp procedures had a significantly shorter operative time and smaller umbilical skin incision length than stapp procedures. However, stapp patients experienced greater wound pain intensity and longer pain duration after hospital discharge.
4. Both procedures had comparable results in terms of hernia recurrence, abdominal wall mobility, and cosmetic satisfaction after an approximate observation time of 30 months. However, ntapp patients had a shorter total time until return to work due to a shorter hospital stay and sick leave.

2. The study involved children who underwent both nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry examinations to determine the correlation between the two methods.
3. The results showed a regular and positive correlation between the two exams, but a perfect correlation was not found. Cephalometry tended to underestimate the size of the pharyngeal tonsils compared to nasopharyngoscopy.
4. The study emphasizes the importance of nasopharyngoscopy as the gold standard exam for assessing the nasopharynx due to its dynamic and tridimensional view, which allows for a more accurate diagnosis of pharyngeal tonsil size and its relation to other structures in the region.

1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in older adults, with the neovascular form accounting for most cases of severe central vision loss. Upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is implicated in AMD development and progression.
2. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, such as ranibizumab and aflibercept, is more effective than previous alternative treatments for neovascular AMD, preventing vision loss and potentially improving visual acuity (VA). Ranibizumab and aflibercept have different binding affinities to VEGF, with aflibercept having a greater potency and longer duration of action.
3. Contrast sensitivity (CS) testing measures an individual's ability to detect low contrast images and perceive differences between light and dark, while VA testing measures the level at which an individual can identify fine detail at high contrast using black-on-white letters. CS can detect subtle vision changes that may be concealed by acuity and is a sensitive and essential outcome end point for a complete assessment of visual function and visual performance.
4. A study was conducted to evaluate change from baseline to week 12 in Pelli-Robson CS as the primary clinical end point in patients with recalcitrant exudative AMD who were switched to aflibercept therapy after previous ranibizumab treatment. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in CS and a reduction in central retinal thickness (CRT) after treatment switch, with no meaningful change from baseline VA observed. The results support the use of CS measurement as a valuable additional outcome end point in future clinical studies of neovascular AMD, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion.

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system with symptoms including network vascular inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage. The most common type is relapsing-remitting MS, which accounts for 85-90% of cases.
2. Researchers are investigating the role of interleukin-25 (IL-25), a cytokine with a similar structure to IL-17 and involved in stimulating Th2 responses and controlling endothelial cells, Th1, and Th17 cells, in the pathogenesis of MS. A polymorphism (c424c/a) within exon 2 of the IL-25 gene may be associated with immune system-related diseases.
3. In a case-control study, the frequency distribution of the IL-25 c424c/a polymorphism was not statistically different between MS patients and healthy controls. The results did not show any association between the genotypes or alleles and MS in the Iranian population.
4. Previous studies suggest that serum levels of IL-25 are decreased in MS patients, and polymorphisms within cytokine genes can influence their expression. However, the current study and a previous one on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) found that the c424c/a polymorphism was not associated with MS or IBD. Other polymorphisms within the IL-25 gene and evaluation of serum levels of IL-25 may be important for understanding the roles of IL-25 in MS.

1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with the highest incidence rates in Europe and North America. Digital mammography (DM) is the most commonly used method for breast cancer detection, with a 50% reduction in mortality rate in some areas. Tomosynthesis is a 3-D mammography technique that helps solve the problem of overlapping tissue and may enhance tumor detection.
2. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a mammography-based technique that obtains multiple low-dose images using a moving x-ray tube head. It has the advantages of fewer artifacts, consistent quality, and digital image processing. DBT can be used for both screening and diagnostic mammography and has shown promising results in increasing mammogram accuracy and reducing false positives and recalls.
3. Contrast-enhanced digital breast tomosynthesis (CEDB) is a technique that uses intravenous contrast material to take advantage of malignant neovascularity and enhance tumor detection. It has shown high sensitivity and excellent correlation with histologic size of tumors, particularly in patients with dense breast tissue. CEDB may also help determine the local extent of disease or assessment of residual or recurrent disease, with potential advantages over MRI such as shorter examination time and easier comparison to conventional mammography.

1. Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications, including those containing diphenhydramine, have been criticized for lack of evidence supporting their efficacy as antitussives.
2. Diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, is classified as an antitussive by the FDA and has been shown to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in healthy volunteers and those with chronic cough.
3. Cough is the most common reason for medical visits in the US, and billions of dollars are spent annually on OTC cough preparations, yet there is little evidence supporting their efficacy as antitussives.
4. Three non-narcotic oral agents are approved by the FDA as antitussives: chlophedianol, dextromethorphan, and diphenhydramine. Chlophedianol and dextromethorphan have limited published evidence supporting their efficacy, and dextromethorphan's effects may not be fully understood due to older studies using less robust endpoints.
5. Capsaicin cough challenge testing is an important tool in clinical research to measure the effect of pharmacological interventions on cough reflex sensitivity. The standard end point is the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs (C5).
6. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a diphenhydramine-containing multicomponent syrup compared to a dextromethorphan-containing syrup and placebo on cough reflex sensitivity in healthy subjects with acute URI. The study found that diphenhydramine significantly inhibited cough reflex sensitivity 2 hours after administration.
7. The study also found that the diphenhydramine-containing formulation was more effective than dextromethorphan as an antitussive, but the timing of the cough challenge may not have allowed demonstration of the maximal antitussive effect of dextromethorphan.

1. The global population is getting older, and aging is associated with a decline in endothelial function, making it a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
2. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in vasodilator substance output, particularly nitric oxide (NO), and an increase in endothelium-derived contracting factors.
3. Oxidative stress, caused by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defense, plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction, particularly in older individuals.
4. ROS, such as superoxide anions, inactivate NO, leading to impaired relaxation and inhibition of the antiproliferative effects of NO. ROS also oxidize tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an important cofactor for NO synthase (NOS), causing it to produce superoxide instead of NO.
5. Regular exercise can improve endothelial function by upregulating antioxidant defense mechanisms and increasing NO bioavailability. Exercise also reduces inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
6. IL-6, a cytokine released during exercise, acts as both a proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory agent. It stimulates the immune response and boosts inflammatory reactions when secreted by T cells and macrophages, while muscle-produced IL-6 exerts anti-inflammatory effects through its inhibitory effects on TNF-α and IL-1, and activation of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and IL-10.

1. Axillary lymph node status is a crucial prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, and the number of metastatic lymph nodes is a significant predictor of worse prognosis.
2. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/International Union Against Cancer (UICC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification categorizes nodal disease into three groups based on the number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes: n1 (1-3 metastatic lymph nodes), n2 (4-9 metastatic lymph nodes), and n3 (10 or more metastatic lymph nodes).
3. The number of metastatic lymph nodes depends on the number of lymph nodes removed and examined by the pathologist. Studies have shown that the number of metastatic lymph nodes increases with the number of removed lymph nodes.
4. The lymph node ratio (LNR), which is the ratio of the number of metastatic lymph nodes to the number of removed lymph nodes, provides more useful prognostic information compared to nodal disease classification based on the number of metastatic lymph nodes.
5. The threshold value of clinically significant LNR varies in different studies, and it is generally accepted that a higher LNR is associated with a worse prognosis.
6. In patients with 13 axillary metastatic lymph nodes, dfs (disease-free survival) and lrfs (locoregional recurrence-free survival) of patients with 15 lymph nodes removed were significantly worse than those with 6 or more lymph nodes removed, and this grouping had independent prognostic significance for both types of survival outcomes.
7. LNR is a more powerful prognostic factor than the number of metastatic lymph nodes and can be used to separate n1 disease patients having at least 10 lymph nodes removed into low- and high-risk prognostic groups for distant metastasis development, providing more detailed and useful prognostic information than TNM nodal disease classification.

The study evaluates various acid phosphatases, including phonsf, phonse, aphast, and piacp, and investigates techniques to enhance product titers and minimize hydrolysis. Phonsf and phonse were found to be the most efficient catalysts for transphosphorylation, while aphast and piacp showed lower activity. The study also explores the effect of pH and phosphate donor type on product formation and the potential for immobilizing the enzymes for large-scale applications.
2. The text highlights the advantages of using phosphatases for synthetic applications, such as the broad substrate spectrum, the absence of cofactor recycling requirements, and the environmentally benign byproduct of inorganic phosphate. However, the reversibility of the reaction necessitates careful control of reaction conditions to maintain high product titers and minimize hydrolysis. The study demonstrates the successful synthesis of 4hydroxybutyl phosphate on a preparative scale using an immobilized enzyme in flow mode.

1. The phenomenon of biological invasions by non-native species has been a concern for centuries, with notable examples such as the phylloxera and chestnut blight.
2. Charles Elton's work in the 1950s on invasions did not lead to a significant research thrust or public response, but in the 1980s, an international project by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) sparked a surge of research on invasions, which is now recognized as a major global environmental change.
3. Research on invasions has focused on how introduced species impact native species at various levels, from population to ecosystem, and has revealed new lines of research on genetics and evolution.
4. Impacts of invasive species are more varied and widespread than previously thought, with examples of hybridization, introgression, and novel genetic combinations.
5. Critics have raised objections to invasion biology and management, including claims that the problems are overblown, that introduced species increase biodiversity, that the antipathy is xenophobic, and that it is a hopeless battle. However, the majority of criticisms focus on the ecological implications and the feasibility of intervention.
6. Modern invasion biology is a relatively new field, and the majority of introduced species have not been studied in their introduced ranges. Despite this, it is known that about 30% of introduced terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater plants, and animals have harmful impacts, and eradication or containment is most effective when attempted early. Technological advances and improved biosecurity measures offer hope for preventing and mitigating invasions.

The study used 12 fresh-frozen calf lumbar specimens and tested their flexibility, created a burst fracture, and then tested the stiffness of the construct with and without intermediate screws.
2. The study found that the addition of intermediate screws at the level of the burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation, regardless of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used. However, the short-segment construct with monoaxial screws was more stable in flexion and extension than the construct with polyaxial screws.

1. The text discusses a study comparing the costs of open and laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The study found that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered advantages over open cholecystectomy with no increase in morbidity or mortality, but charges for laparoscopic procedures were higher due to equipment and technical requirements.
2. The study used matched pair comparisons to determine the true charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including increased operative time, anesthesia time, and instruments. A reduction in the charge for laparoscopic cholecystectomy through the use of reusable instruments and advanced laparoscopic skills for high-risk patients could make it more cost-effective. The study also found that managed care contractors preferred open cholecystectomy for all patients with cholecystitis due to lower charges, but most patients would not accept this limitation. To make laparoscopic cholecystectomy attractive to buyers, a significant reduction in charges would be necessary, depending on the conversion rate.

1. The text describes a retrospective study evaluating the characteristics and determinants of partial remission (PR) in children with type 1 diabetes based on the new definition of IDAA1c. The study included 242 children diagnosed between 1994 and 2008, followed up to adulthood.
2. PR occurred in 56.2% of patients, with no difference in proportion between girls and boys. Mean age at diagnosis was 8.8 years, and height and BMI z-scores were similar between PR and non-PR patients. The absence of DKA at diagnosis was more common in PR patients (82.3%) than in non-PR patients (63.5%), especially in boys.
3. Lower a1c at diagnosis was associated with higher chances of PR in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Mean PR duration was 9.2 months, with 71.6% lasting less than one year and most occurring during the first 6 months. However, 7.5% of patients experienced PR for more than 2 years.
4. A1c levels at 3 months after diagnosis allowed estimation of the proportion of patients who will experience PR for more than 1 year, with 34% having a1cs of 6%, 16% having a1cs > 6-7%, and 5% having a1cs > 7-8%. C-peptide secretion was significantly different in PR versus non-PR patients up to 3 years after diagnosis, with higher baseline concentrations in both girls and boys entering PR, especially in boys.
5. No differences were observed in the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia or diabetes-related complications between PR and non-PR patients, but a short-term effect on metabolic control was suggested in patients with PR durations between 510 and 570 days.

1. The present study aimed to find the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in 5,100 geriatric patients in India. Of these patients, 3,264 (64%) presented with various oral lesions, with males being more affected (66%) than females (34%). The most common oral lesions were nicotinic stomatitis (43%) due to tobacco use and denture stomatitis (34%) due to long use of prostheses. The hard palate had the most lesions (23.1%), followed by the tongue (16.4%) and gingiva (14.7%).
2. The elderly population is more susceptible to oral mucosal lesions than younger populations, with a prevalence of 64% in the present study. Denture stomatitis was the second most common lesion (34%), and oral cancer and precancerous conditions were commonly associated with oral mucosal disease. The use of poorly adapted prostheses and long denture use were significant risk factors for denture stomatitis. Hard palate (23.1%) was the most commonly affected site, and knowledge of site predilection for different diseases is useful in acknowledging the factors responsible for the same.

1. Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that affects the epiphyseal regions of tubular bones, especially the ends of tibia, femur, and humerus.
2. Chondroblastoma in the head and neck region, including the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint (TMJ), can result in various symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, clicking of the TMJ, hearing impairments, dizziness, and otorrhea.
3. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma are rare but have been observed after irradiation.
4. Diagnosis of chondroblastoma can be difficult due to its unusual histological features and the high risk of recurrence with incomplete resection.
5. A 41-year-old male presented with chronic hearing impairments and progressive trismus, which were initially misdiagnosed as otitis media and TMJ disorder.
6. The patient underwent several unsuccessful treatments, including antibiotic therapy and endoscopic surgery, before being diagnosed with a giant cell tumor in the temporal bone.
7. Re-examination of the CT scan and pathologic findings revealed the presence of chondroblastoma with malignant potential.
8. The study presents methods for diagnosing chondroblastoma and suitable surgical procedures for maintaining postoperative functionality.
9. Treatment for chondroblastoma in the temporal bone requires total en bloc excision, curettage, and accurate, early-stage diagnosis to prevent malignant progression.

1. The text discusses a study aimed at evaluating the relationship between sedentary behavior, habitual physical activity, and visceral adiposity (vat) and intrahepatic lipid (ihl) in adults with overweight/obesity. The study hypothesized that there would be a negative relationship between time spent in moderate intensity physical activity and levels of vat and ihl and a positive relationship between time spent in sedentary behavior and vat and ihl content.
2. The study found no significant relationship between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat. Instead, there was a weak positive association between vat volume and time spent in moderate activity and total energy expenditure. The inclusion of objectively measured levels of moderate activity and sedentary behavior did not improve the potency of traditional risk factors for predicting liver fat concentration or level of visceral adiposity.

1. The text is a retrospective case series study conducted in a tertiary eye care hospital in North India from 2011 to 2015, documenting fireworks-related eye injuries during the Diwali festival. A total of 53 eyes of 45 patients were included, with 30 right eyes and 23 left eyes affected.
2. The severity of ocular damage was more among those who ignited the fireworks themselves than bystanders. Five eyes had open-globe injuries, and 18 underwent surgical management, while 34 were managed conservatively. The most common types of firecrackers causing injury were bombs, and corneal abrasions, corneal foreign bodies, and hyphema were the most common anterior segment findings.
3. The study highlights the importance of public awareness and legislation to reduce the burden of firework-related ocular morbidity and noise pollution. The limitations of the study include its retrospective method and the potential underestimation of the actual magnitude of the problem due to the inclusion of only cases presenting during the 5-day Diwali period.
4. Serious fireworks-related eye injuries can lead to blindness, facial burns, and permanent disfigurement. In India, where festivals hold significant cultural and economic importance, a combined approach of public awareness and strong legislation is required to regulate the manufacture, sale, and use of consumer fireworks to prevent this preventable cause of ocular morbidity.

1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, which is considered early, mild thyroid failure.
2. The relationship between SCH and adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes is unclear, and the optimal TSH cutoff values and clinical significance of SCH are controversial.
3. The most common cause of SCH is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is associated with increased prevalence in women, elderly people, and iodine-sufficient populations.
4. SCH is associated with increased body weight, blood pressure (BP), and altered lipid levels, as well as increased risk of metabolic syndrome (METS) and vascular problems such as increased vascular stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.
5. The treatment of SCH is typically considered for pregnant women, infertile individuals, those with associated symptoms, or those at high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. The benefits and risks of screening and treatment remain controversial, and a large, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial (TRUST study) is currently being conducted to clarify the clinical significance of SCH.

1. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but not all patients who carry C. difficile in their intestines present with symptoms.
2. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits are commonly used for C. difficile diagnosis, but their sensitivity for detecting toxins A and B is lower than polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytotoxigenic culture.
3. Patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates are often overlooked, as they may not receive treatment and infection countermeasures.
4. The present study investigated patients with gdh-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens to investigate their clinical history and need for treatment.
5. The study retrospectively analyzed patients whose stool specimens were submitted for C. difficile toxin testing between March 2013 and June 2014.
6. Patients were divided into three groups based on EIA results: toxin-positive stool group, toxin-negative stool/toxin-positive isolate group, and dual toxin-negative stool and isolate group.
7. No significant differences were observed in clinical characteristics, diarrhea duration, antibiotics usage, or severity among the three groups. However, there was a significant difference in diarrhea duration between the positive stool group and the dual-negative group.
8. Patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates had shorter diarrhea duration than those with toxin-positive stool specimens, despite fewer of them receiving treatment.
9. The findings suggest that patients who test positive for C. difficile on culture but negative for toxins in their stool have milder symptoms, and that it is difficult to predict toxin negativity or positivity based on drug use status or other test results.

1. The Dream Trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled study designed to determine if ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with IFG or IGT.
2. The study recruited 5,269 participants with these disorders and randomized them to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two-by-two factorial design. Participants were followed for a median of 3 years.
3. A substudy of 982 Dream Trial participants attending Canadian study centers had OGTTs at baseline, after 2 years, and at the end of the study, with blood samples drawn fasting as well as 30 and 120 min after the glucose challenge.
4. The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow-up. -cell function was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
5. IGI was assessed by dividing it by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and PI was assessed by dividing it by c-peptide concentration or adjusting for insulin secretion using c-peptide as a covariate.
6. The study found that rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI and reduced PI concentrations over time after adjustment for age and relevant covariates. Ramipril did not significantly change adjusted IGI or PI concentrations.
7. The study also found that rosiglitazone's effect on diabetes prevention persisted after adjustment for baseline -cell function. The findings suggest that measures of change in -cell function in response to therapy may be indexes of that therapy's ability to reduce the incidence of diabetes.

1. Microbial communities differ from monocultures in various aspects, including toxin degradation, natural product production, and capacity to grow in certain environments.
2. Understanding microbial metabolism requires studying individual strains and their interactions in complex communities.
3. Strains may exhibit complementary metabolism due to naturally occurring or engineered interactions.
4. Interacting strains share metabolites such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose.
5. Metabolic cooperation is enhanced at intermediate cell densities when the concentration of cross-fed metabolites is sufficient.
6. A quantitative and predictive theoretical model was developed to reveal the extent of complex metabolic interactions from the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network.
7. The study selected 46 conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli mutants and investigated their cooperative behavior in minimal media.
8. The results showed that certain pairs of auxotrophs exhibited synergistic growth, which can be applied to infer properties of the E. coli metabolic network.

1. Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome (BSS) is a rare genodermatosis caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene cyld (cylindromatosis gene) on chromosome 16q12q13.
2. BSS is characterized by the progressive formation of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, mainly trichoepitheliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas.
3. The risk of malignancy is low, but patients require long-term follow-up.
4. A 71-year-old woman with multiple rounded skin-colored or erythematous papules in her scalp and forehead was diagnosed with spiradenoma in all but one lesion, which was cylindroma.
5. The woman's family history revealed the presence of similar lesions in her mother, her mother's brother, and two of her three daughters.
6. Exon 8 sequencing of the cyld gene revealed a heterozygous mutation c. 1628_1629delct in the patient and her two affected daughters.
7. The loss of deubiquitining activity of cyld correlates with tumorigenesis, and germline mutations predispose to the disease.
8. BSS is characterized by the progressive development of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, with clinical manifestations starting since puberty and a higher incidence in females. It is also associated with an increased risk of salivary gland neoplasms and other tumors.

1. The study evaluates the mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics of phasix mesh and p4hb plug designs when utilized to bridge a surgical defect in the porcine abdominal wall for 6, 12, 26, or 52 weeks.
2. Mechanical testing revealed that the burst strength and relative stiffness of the phasix mesh and p4hb plug repaired sites were similar to each other at all time points, with no significant differences detected between the two devices. Both designs exhibited significantly greater burst strength and relative stiffness compared to the native abdominal wall at all time points.
3. Gel permeation chromatography showed that the phasix mesh and p4hb plug possessed similar molecular weights at all time points, and both materials significantly resorbed over time. However, significant material resorption did not correspond with a significant drop in mechanical strength at the repair site for either design. Histological analyses revealed no statistically significant changes over time for either design with respect to inflammation, granulation tissue/vascularization, giant cells, or collagen morphology.

1. Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, specifically vancomycin resistance (VRE), has been a significant issue in healthcare settings for over 25 years, leading to high mortality and costs.
2. VRE is mediated by van genes, with vanA and vanB being the most prevalent.
3. Several European countries have reported an increasing incidence of VRE, with Denmark experiencing a dramatic increase since 2012 due to multiclonal outbreaks of vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium.
4. Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, which relies on selective culturing and/or detection of resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR.
5. Rapidly available results from VRE screening can lead to substantial indirect savings, as shown in a report from France.
6. Several studies have examined the diagnostic accuracy of various assays to detect vanA and vanB, reporting sensitivities from 43.5% to 100% and specificities from 79.2% to 99.6%.
7. The specificity of vanB detection is lower due to the presence of vanB-positive anaerobic bacteria.
8. In autumn 2014, the laboratory implemented the Xpert vanA/vanB assay, a fully automated system that provides results within an hour, to screen for VRE.

1. The study aimed to compare the effects of ru28318 (ru), captopril (capt), and losartan (los), alone or in combination, administered before or after ischemia on ischemia/reperfusion (i/r)-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal and diabetic rats.
2. In diabetic hearts, captopril + losartan (capt + los) therapy given before ischemia resulted in a rapid improvement in pmax and cf within the first 10 minutes of reperfusion. Ru + capt and triple therapy (ru + capt + los) given before ischemia to diabetic hearts resulted in the most rapid recovery in + dp/dt. Ru + los yielded the most rapid recovery in lvedp when given before ischemia in nondiabetic hearts.
3. Drug treatments generally led to marked and significant improvement in function, with triple therapy being the most effective in improving recovery of + dp/dt and dp/dt in both normal and diabetic hearts. Ru was the most effective in improving dp/dt when administered to diabetic hearts after ischemia.
4. The study suggests that mr antagonists, such as ru, may represent a novel class of raas inhibitor that could overcome the limitations observed with acei and arb combinations. Ru treatment locally might be considered as an effective therapy or preventative measure in cardiac i/r injury for susceptible patients and possibly also preoperatively for patients undergoing aortic cross-clamping or other cardiac surgeries.

2. Acoustic rhinometry (AR) is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry, which has a close correlation with the cross-sectional area measured by rhinomanometry.
3. AR uses analysis of reflected acoustic impulses to measure nasal cavity dimensions, and it is easy to perform and requires less cooperation from subjects.
4. Nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers were evaluated using AR before and after cosmetic rhinoplasty surgery.
5. The study included 24.63 (4.4) year-old volunteers, without prior nose surgery, fracture, allergy, asthma, or sinus disorders, and aged 18 to 40.
6. The surgeries were open rhinoplasty with or without septoplasty, depending on the surgeon's preference.
7. AR measurements were taken after acclimatization, in a quiet room, during a breathing pause, and with a nosepiece applied to the tip of the nose.
8. The study found that bilateral d1 and both mca2 decreased significantly, while mca1 increased significantly postoperatively. The effect of septoplasty, osteotomy, and placing a columellar strut on mca1, mca2, and v was not significant according to regression analysis.

1. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in economically developed nations, and its incidence is increasing. Ongoing research aims to prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
2. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health in observational and experimental studies. They were initially used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders due to their lipid-lowering action, but their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects were later discovered.
3. Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. N-3 PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response.
4. Fish is the major food source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a plant n-3 fatty acid mainly found in seeds, nuts, and their oils. Plant sources of n-3 fatty acids cannot currently replace seafood-derived n-3 PUFAs, and n-3 fatty acids derived from different sources may have their own specific effects on cardiovascular risk markers.

1. Rudolf Virchow, a 19th century Prussian physician-scientist, is considered the father of modern pathology and was the first to propose that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation.
2. Gastric cancers have been linked to chronic inflammation, particularly atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria.
3. Pelayo Correa, a Colombian pathologist, devoted his career to understanding the etiology of gastric cancer and published a model in 1975 hypothesizing that gastric cancer results from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over several decades.
4. Correa initially believed that environmental factors, such as a diet high in salt and nitrosamines and low in micronutrients, were responsible for promoting this process. However, he later suggested a possible role for Helicobacter pylori in the initiation of the disease.
5. Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered Helicobacter pylori in 1982 and showed that it causes gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005 for their discovery.
6. Early investigations into the association between Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer provided weak evidence, but three large cohort studies in the 1990s provided compelling evidence that prior Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of gastric cancer.
7. H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer, and population-based screening and eradication programs have shown promising results in reducing gastric cancer incidence and peptic ulcers.
8. The relationship between Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer is complex, as it is a risk factor for both intestinal-type and diffuse-type gastric cancers, and measuring prior exposure through more sensitive methods can increase the estimated risk.

1. Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, affecting 25% of pregnancies.
2. Proteinuria is a common symptom of PE, but several studies suggest it is not a significant predictor of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
3. Hypoalbuminemia, caused by systemic small vessel spasm, increased angiotensin secretion, and damaged vascular endothelial cells, may indicate the severity of PE.
4. Intravascular dehydration due to hypoalbuminemia may accelerate the appearance of intravascular lesions, increasing the risk of HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
5. In a retrospective cohort study, hypoproteinemia during pregnancy was observed in the PE group before the onset of clinical symptoms, suggesting the possibility of preventing PE by maintaining adequate blood protein levels during early pregnancy.
6. In the study, 299 women with PE were enrolled, and hypoproteinemia was found to be a significant risk factor for poor maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with PE.
7. Women with severe hypoproteinemia (shp) PE were more likely to have cesarean sections, severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta, and their neonates were more likely to have fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries.

1. The past 20 years have seen the development of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase (ptk) inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A signaling pathway for cancer treatment. Avastin (bevacizumab), a VEGF-A mAb, has been successful in treating colorectal, lung, and renal cell carcinomas.
2. However, the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments, such as resistance and pre-existing refractoriness, have been highlighted. Alternative ligands for the angiogenic receptor VEGFR-2, like VEGF-C and VEGF-D, and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families are being explored as potential contributors to resistance.
3. PIGF, a ligand for VEGFR-1, has a dual role in cancer as a stimulator of angiogenesis and a promoter of tumor cell proliferation. Its role in cancer is context-dependent due to the presence of other VEGF family members and the diverse expression of VEGF receptors on various cell types.
4. Targeting the VEGF-D signaling pathway is a promising approach for inhibiting both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, which could restrict both solid tumor growth and metastatic spread. Agents targeting VEGF family members and their receptors are currently in development, including mAbs to VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, PIGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3.

2. In Iran, Plasmodium vivax is the most common malaria species, accounting for 90% of cases, while Plasmodium falciparum accounts for 10-15%. The country entered the malaria pre-elimination program in 2009 and has implemented prevention strategies, active case detection, and timely appropriate treatment.
3. Active surveillance using precise laboratory methods is crucial for early recognition of all parasite carriers, particularly those with asymptomatic infections containing low parasite densities. Light microscopy, chromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and molecular methods such as nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used for malaria diagnosis in Iran.
4. A study was conducted in a low transmission region of Bagh-e Malek in Minab District, Hormozgan Province, to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections using microscopy, RDT, and nested-PCR. The study found that microscopy and RDT missed three asymptomatic P. vivax carriers, while nested-PCR detected them. The results highlight the importance of using multiple malaria detection tools to improve sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for active case surveillance in endemic settings.

2. Some of these agents, such as infusional cytokine therapies for melanoma or renal cell cancer, intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer, and active cellular therapy targeting prostatic acid phosphatase (Sipuleucel-T, Provenge, Dendreon) for advanced metastatic prostate cancer, have been approved for standard clinical use.
3. Other agents have shown benefit in large clinical trials and are anticipated to be approved, such as a monoclonal antibody targeting a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor targeting CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for advanced melanoma.
4. However, evaluating these agents using traditional clinical development paradigms has been challenging due to their potential use in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies.
5. Biomarkers of biological response are needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of these agents, especially for broadly active immune modulating agents like T-cell checkpoint inhibitors or TLR agonists.
6. For antigen-specific vaccines, immune responses to the target antigen can be used as a biomarker of immunological efficacy, but few instances of target antigen immune response have been associated with clinical benefit.
7. For broadly active immune modulating agents, appropriate biomarkers of response have been more elusive. Studies with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have sought to identify amplification of other T-cell costimulatory molecules or antibodies to defined antigenic tumor-associated proteins as potential biomarkers.
8. For whole cell tumor vaccines, where there is not a specific, defined antigen being targeted, surrogate antigens known to be expressed by the tumor vaccine have been used as a means of monitoring immune responses from the vaccine.

2. Hindlimb unloading was accomplished by suspending the rats in a head-down tilted position to prevent weight bearing.
3. Empty lacunae and pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis, were used to define histopathological osteonecrosis.
4. Femoral head osteonecrosis was observed in 63.6% of weight-bearing (wb) rats and 54.5% of non-weight-bearing (nwb) rats, with no significant intergroup difference.
5. In wb rats, empty lacunae were seen at necrotic bone trabeculae, and the number of hematopoietic cells was decreased in the medullary space. In nwb rats, empty lacunae and necrotic cell debris were accumulated in the medullary space.
6. No humeral head osteonecrosis was observed in any of the wb or nwb rats.
7. The study adhered to the guidelines of the Ministry of Sports, Culture, Science and Technology of Japan and was approved by the animal ethics committee of Sapporo Medical University.
8. The results showed that weight bearing did not contribute to the development of non-traumatic onfh in rats.
9. The rat model may help elucidate the pathogenesis of onfh and devise prevention strategies, but may not be useful for observing the mechanism of femoral head collapse.
10. The study revealed that weight bearing is not related to the development of non-traumatic onfh in the rat model, but the etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of non-traumatic onfh remain unclear.

1. The text discusses the limited involvement of nurses in national health policy processes in Kenya and the reasons for their underengagement. It also suggests strategies to enhance nurses' participation in policy development.
2. The text applies a critical theory perspective to examine the historical hierarchies and gender-related issues affecting nurses' involvement in policy processes. It reveals that health systems hierarchies, interprofessional hierarchies, and intraprofessional hierarchies hinder nurses' active engagement in policy processes. The text suggests that policy-makers should address these hierarchies and establish mechanisms for nurses' views to reach national decision-makers during policy formulation. Additionally, nurses should be given opportunities to hold senior positions in the health care system and develop leadership and advocacy skills to carry out policy advocacy at all levels.

1. UTI is a common problem in infants and young children, with varying frequency, symptoms, and causative organisms depending on sex, age, and gender.
2. Neonates present with non-specific signs and symptoms, requiring a complete sepsis workup and a 7-14 day course of antibiotic therapy, typically with parenteral ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin.
3. Recent reports show emerging patterns of resistance toward empirical antibiotics, especially ampicillin, making the early choice of antibiotics a challenging decision.
4. Clinical manifestations of UTI in neonates are mostly non-specific and systemic, including fever, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, growth failure, abnormal urination, and jaundice.
5. UTI in newborns could lead to urosepsis or neonatal sepsis, so it is often managed as a case of sepsis.
6. Most UTIs in infants are caused by gram-negative bacilli, with e. coli being the most prevalent organism causing UTI in all ages, accounting for up to 80% of isolates.
7. The study aimed to determine the frequency of UTI causative organisms in neonates admitted to the neonatal division of Bahrami Children's Hospital in Tehran, Iran, over an eight-year period.
8. The study found that e. coli was the most prevalent organism causing UTI in neonates, with a relative frequency of 64.4%, and that it was mostly resistant to ampicillin, cefixime, and cephalexin, but susceptible to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders caused by a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion.
2. The most common CAH variant is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
3. CAH results in hyperplasia of the adrenal gland, diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens, and a chronic hyperandrogenic state.
4. CAH patients may present with different clinical forms, including classical CAH (salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms) and non-classical CAH, which may be asymptomatic or present with postnatal or adult onset hyperandrogenism.
5. CAH treatment involves replacement of glucocorticoids and, when necessary, mineralocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and suppress androgen secretion.
6. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have suggested white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in CAH patients due to hormonal imbalances during early development and exposure to excess exogenous glucocorticoids.
7. The present study investigated the frequency of white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in 26 CAH patients due to 21-OHD, and found evidence of increased frequency of these abnormalities in this population.

1. The human genome draft sequence holds great promise for biomedical advances this century, but navigating the vast genomic data requires universal vocabularies for gene annotation.
2. Two main ways of annotating genes are using empirical observations and predicted evolutionary relationships.
3. Websites like LocusLink, Genecards, Ensembl, etc., integrate diverse sources of information for individual human genes, including sequence data and molecular and cellular function information.
4. Homology-based annotation relies on evolutionary relationships, with homologs being genes derived from a common ancestor, paralogs being additional copies within a genome, and orthologs being corresponding genes in different species.
5. Homology assignment indicates an approximate direction for future empirical determination of function, but it's not always accurate as homologs may not share similar molecular mechanisms or functions.
6. Domains are homologous portions of sequences that have survived evolution without fragmentation and represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution.
7. Pfam, SMART, Prosite, and other domain resources detect domains using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments and provide a significant amount of redundancy.
8. InterPro combines the domain and motif sets of multiple resources to provide annotation for a large percentage of Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entries.
9. Gene annotation by domain content implies that a gene product's function is a synthesis of the generalized functions of its component parts.
10. Comparative proteomics and domain identification have played a major role in understanding the evolution of chordates and will continue to contribute to gene function prediction until reliable results from high-throughput studies on more closely related organisms are available.

1. The text describes a study comparing four commercially available online heart rate monitoring systems (Polar Team Pro, Acentas Team Monitoring System, Suunto Pro Team Pack, and Activio Sport System) in a field test. The study evaluated the systems' measurement, software, and hardware, with a focus on adequate online measurement of heart rate in team sports. The rating system was set in favor of measurement, with the remaining categories rated by an experienced person and an independent observer.
2. The study involved 12 participants, including 10 men from an amateur soccer team and one male and one female subject for validity testing. The tests were conducted during a soccer match and a laboratory session for comparison against an ECG. The systems were evaluated based on factors such as measurement accuracy, hardware quality, software usability, installation procedure, and failure ratio. The results showed that Acentas and Polar led in hardware, with Polar having an advantage in storage capacity but a disadvantage in wearing comfort. Activio offered the most harmonious concept and easiest software installation, but had a smaller range compared to the others. Suunto had a high failure ratio and a total breakdown during competition measurements. The study concluded that each system has its advantages and disadvantages, and cannot recommend a single system but rather provide insights for further improvements.

1. In the 1960s, McCulloch and Till identified stem cells based on their ability to self-renew and propagate in a hierarchical manner, supporting the hypothesis that a specific population of cells is responsible for growth and repair in a tissue.
2. Stem cells in the lung have been identified throughout the airway, including in proximal and distal regions, by their role in response to injury and their ability to self-renew, proliferate, and differentiate into various cell types.
3. Markers such as keratin-5 (k5) and keratin-14 (k14) have been used to isolate and characterize stem cells in the trachea and middle airways, respectively. These cells have been shown to give rise to diverse progeny after injury.
4. Recent studies have identified stem cell populations in the distal airway, specifically in the bronchoalveolar duct junction (BADJ), which can yield diverse populations of cells and have the ability to proliferate and self-renew in culture. However, the cell marker phenotype of representative lung stem cells remains under debate.
5. Lung cancer stem cells have been identified in various tumor types, including lung adenocarcinoma and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and have been shown to exhibit stem cell properties such as self-renewal, multidrug resistance, and increased telomerase expression. Targeting these cells or the pathways that confer stem cell-like properties to lung cancer cells may lead to major therapeutic advances in lung cancer treatment.

1. A study was conducted to evaluate the role of urethral plate characters, specifically shape and width, in the success of tip urethroplasty for primary anterior penile hypospadias in 100 children.
2. The study was carried out at Mayo Hospital in Hodeidah, Yemen, between January 2010 and December 2013.
3. The Snodgrass technique with modifications was used for the surgery.
4. The plates were categorized as flat, cleft, and deeply grooved based on their shape and measured at the widest area during surgery.
5. The study population was divided into two groups based on the width of the urethral plate: group A with plates wider than 8 mm and group B with plates narrower than 8 mm.
6. Group B patients had a statistically significant higher fistula rate (p = 0.004) and failed 8 fr calibration rate (p = 0.01) compared to group A.
7. Complications were also monitored based on the character of the urethral plate, with higher fistula rates and failed 8 fr calibrations observed in patients with flat plates, although not statistically significant.
8. Overall, 8% of patients developed fistulas, 12% had failed 8 fr calibration, and 1% had partial dehiscence. Redo surgery was indicated in 1 patient and fistulectomy in 8 patients.
9. The use of buccal mucosal grafts (BMG) with tip repair was recommended for patients with narrow and inelastic urethral plates to decrease fistula rate formation and meatal stenosis.
10. The tip urethroplasty offers advantages such as preservation and utilization of the urethral plate, a single suture line, creation of glandular and penile urethra, short operative time, and low complication rate.

2. The prototype was developed by modifying a polypropylene plier and adding a measurement and control circuit, a strain gauge, and a specific software to record the values of the bracket debonding force.
3. The accuracy and precision of the prototype were tested using weights, and the results showed no significant differences between the examiners. The mean bond strength obtained with the prototype and the tensile test in a universal testing machine were also statistically similar.
4. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores showed that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding, which is advantageous since it has the least probability of harming the enamel.
5. The study suggests that the prototype might be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo, as the bond strength did not differ statistically between the prototype and the tensile test on the universal testing machine.

1. Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common curable sexually transmitted infection with approximately 173 million new cases occurring annually. It is associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease, low infant birth weight, and premature delivery. Trichomoniasis also increases the transmission and acquisition of other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection.
2. The study was a cross-sectional analysis of behavioral and biological data from a cohort enrolled in the NIH collaborative HIV/STD prevention trial in Peru from 2003 to 2005. The study focused on socially marginalized women in low-income neighborhoods in Lima, Trujillo, and Chiclayo, who defied Peruvian social norms by having sex with poor unemployed men.
3. The study found that older women, those with less education, singles, and women who reported unprotected sex with a nonsteady partner or multiple sex partners were more likely to have trichomonal infection. The study also found that there was no association between any vaginal symptoms and trichomonal infection, suggesting that syndromic management may result in both over and under treatment.
4. The study highlights the importance of screening and treatment programs to control the spread of trichomonal infection due to its asymptomatic nature and potential long-term prevalence. The findings support the need for improved disease control activities to reduce adverse reproductive health outcomes associated with trichomoniasis, such as ectopic pregnancy, low infant birth weight, preterm labor, and non-HPV associated cervical neoplasia.

1. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a symptomatic generalized epilepsy syndrome characterized by tonic, atonic, and atypical absence seizures, slow spike wave discharges on EEG, and cognitive impairment.
2. LGS affects approximately 2-5% of childhood epilepsies and is more common in boys than girls.
3. The etiology of LGS includes various causes such as cortical maldevelopment, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, CNS infection, or neurometabolic disorders.
4. About 20% of children with LGS have a history of infantile spasms (West Syndrome) that evolves into LGS.
5. Valproic acid is considered the first-line medication for drop attacks, atypical absence, and myoclonic seizures in LGS, but caution is needed in children under 2 years old and when used with other anticonvulsants.
6. Felbamate, Lamotrigine, and Topiramate have shown some efficacy in reducing seizures in LGS, but their use should be carefully considered due to potential side effects and drug interactions.
7. Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, is an orphan drug granted for the adjunctive treatment of LGS and partial seizures in adults and adolescents.
8. Rufinamide's mechanism of action involves decreased firing of high-frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.
9. Rufinamide has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effectiveness in animals and a good safety profile in humans, with minimal cognitive side effects and behavioral toxicity.
10. Further research is needed to establish the role of rufinamide in the overall treatment algorithm for LGS and to define its relationship to prior drugs with reported effectiveness.

1. The study explores the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of iberian wall lizards in central Spain. The populations inhabit different environments without geographical barriers but maintain clear distinct morphotypes and differ genetically.
2. Morphological and chemical analyses revealed significant differences in morphology and chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions of males between the populations. Males and females discriminated by chemosensory cues alone between scents of lizards from different populations, suggesting the probable existence of reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation.
3. The study found that males and females from some populations recognized and preferred the scents of individuals from their own population, which may contribute to reduced gene flow. The results suggest that interpopulational differences in chemical signals and population recognition abilities could indicate the probable existence of reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation between these iberian wall lizard populations.

1. According to WHO experts, if rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, the potential of passing the virus to the fetus is about 90%. The most significant complication of rubella is Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS), which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.
2. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital infection with rubella virus and CRS. The most commonly used vaccine globally is derived from the RA27/3 virus strain, which makes more immunity and has a similar immune response to natural infection.
3. In Iran, a study was conducted on the immunity level of Kermanshahi girls at marriage before and after mass rubella vaccination. The study revealed a significant rise in seropositivity and immunity against rubella in vaccinated versus unvaccinated girls.
4. The study showed that mass vaccination of rubella caused a highly significant decrease in the rate of negative antibody from 20.42% to 0.7%. The findings are in line with reliable sources and extensive country studies.
5. The effectiveness of the RA27/3 vaccine has been demonstrated by the elimination of rubella and CRS from the western hemisphere and by several European countries that have achieved and maintained high vaccination coverage.
6. After the awareness of the lack of immunity of about 20% of the most vulnerable society members, i.e., pregnant women, the policy makers announced the rubella vaccine as the compulsory state vaccines. It is proposed to perform studies for the immunity status against other diseases like tetanus and diphtheria.
7. Due to the susceptibility of less than 1% of the Kermanshahi girls at marriage and the significant increase in anti-rubella antibodies and immunity in high-risk people, there is no more need to screen the vaccinated girls at marriage. However, it is recommended to perform studies every few years.

3. The results demonstrate that QDs can give highly specific staining of dig-labeled mRNA probes, even in deep tissues, and can be used to label alternative modified oligonucleotide probes through biotin-streptavidin and FITC-anti-FITC interactions. The study also shows that QDs can be used to detect two or more transcripts simultaneously, and the resolving ability of this method is better than that of amplified protocols.

2. The diagnosis and management of CLI were based on the Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) or its revised consensus (TASC II).
3. PTA was the first-choice procedure for revascularization, and its indication was determined by consensus among vascular specialists.
4. Major amputation was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control their foot lesions, and the indication was judged by consensus among plastic surgeons.
5. Preoperative variables considered in the analyses were sex, age, activities of daily living (ADLs), Fontaine stage, presence of infection, diabetic condition, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, receiving regular hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.
6. Diabetic patients had a significantly higher prevalence of Fontaine stage IV and hemodialysis than those without diabetes.
7. The follow-up period was 90-72 weeks (1.7-1.4 years), and 48 patients underwent major amputations and 89 died.
8. The leading cause of death was cardiac and vascular disease, and diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared with nondiabetic patients, but they had a similar life prognosis.

The study involved obtaining serum samples from 50 CE patients, 40 non-CE patients, and 20 healthy controls. The serum samples were analyzed using western blotting to detect specific antigenic bands for CE.
2. The results showed that the antigenic bands of 52, 24, 39, 46, 63, and 6061 kDa were specific for hydatid disease and had higher diagnostic value. The 39 kDa band reactivity decreased significantly in post-operative samples, but 24 kDa and 39 kDa persisted in two patients who had a relapse at two-year follow-up. The combination of antigenic fractions of 52, 46, 39, and 24 kDa may serve as useful diagnostic markers. The western blotting technique is a useful method for diagnosing hydatidosis and for post-surgical monitoring, as it can detect the appearance or disappearance of specific bands that cannot be observed with other immunologic techniques.

2. The study involved 66 patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) and excluded those with diabetes, pregnancy, cancer, acute diseases, psychiatric disorders, or a history of abdominal surgery. Patients were divided into three groups based on their obesity class.
3. The results showed that patients in obesity class III had lower mean serum TC and LDL-c levels compared to those in classes I and II, but this was not related to lipid-lowering treatment. Patients in classes II and III had greater mean wc, whtr, BMI, and BAI than those in class I.
4. Negative correlations were found between BMI, wc, and LDL-c, HDL-c, and VAI. Positive correlations were observed between wc, whtr, and TG/HDL-c ratio, and between VAI and TC, TG, TC/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c, and TG/HDL-c ratios. The study suggests that obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is associated with dyslipidemia, which is most evident with the VAI index.

2. Aspirin therapy is a prevention measure recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force to prevent heart attack and ischemic stroke. It can be used as a primary or secondary prevention measure.
3. A study was conducted to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations for aspirin therapy for CVD prevention using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012.
4. The study found that among the total sample eligible for aspirin as primary prevention, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin. Over three-quarters of primary prevention patients were classified as low risk, but less than half of high-risk primary prevention patients received a recommendation to take aspirin.
5. Among low-risk primary prevention patients, 54.6% were told to take aspirin, compared to 72.8% of intermediate-risk and 56.2% of high-risk diabetes patients. Among those told to take aspirin, the vast majority complied with the recommendation.
6. The study also found that among primary prevention patients, education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention. Among high-risk individuals, age, health insurance, and being of Asian/other descent were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention. Among low-risk individuals, age, health insurance status, education level, and obesity status were all predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin therapy.
7. The study suggests that there is a significant disconnect between who needs and who receives recommendations for aspirin use, and that improved clinical decision support systems could aid in making accurate decisions and providing other affiliated treatment recommendations such as use of gastric-protective agents in select patient populations.

1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate signaling through posttranslational modification of proteins, including oxidation of cysteine residues.
2. Oxidation of cysteine thiol groups by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) results in formation of sulphenic acid, disulfide bonds, or sulfenyl amide bonds, changing protein function. Thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms.
3. Mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generation is required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorigenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. mROS act as pro-differentiation signals and are key upstream regulators of stem cell fate decisions.
4. In the epidermis, mROS production promotes signaling through pathways required for differentiation of mammalian stem cell populations in vivo. Calcium uptake into mitochondria stimulates mROS production and promotes epidermal differentiation. Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, such as UCP2, may also regulate differentiation-dependent metabolism.
5. Mitochondrial metabolism promotes cellular differentiation by providing substrates for histone acetyltransferases and histone demethylases, which regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone acetylation is required for differentiation of various cell types, and its availability depends on the production of acetyl-CoA through the TCA cycle.

2. THs are synthesized in the thyroid gland and transported to target tissues, where they are converted from T4 to T3.
3. TH metabolism can be disrupted by various processes, including inhibition of iodide uptake, suppression of thyroidal peroxidase activity, and competitive binding to transport proteins.
4. Several enzymes, such as sulfotransferases and glucuronidases, play a role in TH metabolism and can be influenced by environmental contaminants.
5. The thyroid gland in amphibians undergoes significant changes during metamorphosis, making it a sensitive indicator of TH disruption.
6. Several studies have shown that exposure to certain chemicals can lead to morphological changes during metamorphosis, affecting TH synthesis and secretion.
7. The amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA) is a standardized test used by regulatory agencies to detect thyroid-active chemicals.
8. The AMA uses Xenopus laevis as a model organism and measures mortality, developmental stage, hind limb length, snout-vent length, wet body weight, and thyroid gland histology as primary endpoints.
9. Histopathological changes in the thyroid gland are the most valuable information for detecting thyroid toxicants, and normal developmental stages should be used for histological analyses to avoid misinterpretation.

1. The text discusses a study investigating the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health related quality of life (HRQOL).
2. The study was a prospective study conducted in Kashan City, Iran, involving 365 pregnant women who gave their informed consent.
3. Of these women, 175 (51.2%) had vaginal deliveries (VD) and 167 (48.8%) had cesarean sections (CS), with 150 women in each group completing HRQOL questionnaires at 2 and 4 months postpartum.
4. The study used the Iranian version of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) to measure HRQOL, which consists of 36 items organized into eight scales: physical functioning, role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation due to emotional problems, and emotional well-being.
5. The study found that women with VD had higher total physical health scores at 2 months postpartum (60.52 vs. 57.37, p = 0.034) and 4 months postpartum (61.37 vs. 58.36, p = 0.05), with statistically significant differences in physical function (p = 0.01) and emotional well-being (p = 0.042) at 4 months postpartum.
6. The study also found that women with VD showed more improvements in mental HRQOL from 2 to 4 months postpartum (mean score differences: 4.70 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), with statistically significant differences in social functioning (p = 0.03) and emotional well-being (p = 0.01) at 4 months postpartum.
7. The study also noted that nearly 80% of VD were performed with episiotomy or laceration, and that sexual health is perceived as an integral part of general health as it can affect postpartum depression. The study recommended future studies to include both general and specific questionnaires in assessing postpartum HRQOL among women with VD, elect",1

1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are involved in various physiological functions, including blood pressure regulation, nociception, adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory activity, organ regeneration, insulin potentiation, and podocyte integrity.
2. The most prominent EET isomer is 14,15-EET, which arises from the metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, particularly the 2c and 2j families.
3. The ratio and stereocomposition of EET isomers are isoform-dependent and species-specific.
4. EET is susceptible to aerial oxidation or auto-oxidation, requiring handling and storage under strict conditions to minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals.
5. Hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) is a major determinant in maintaining steady state levels of 14,15-EET, whose half-life is estimated to be no more than seconds to minutes.
6. Inhibition of SEH can elevate EET levels both in vitro and in vivo, offering an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes.
7. However, this strategy might be less efficacious than agonist replacement therapy when endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised.
8. To address stability limitations of natural EETs, researchers have prepared EET surrogates with improved stability.
9. The surrogates described herein modify the free carboxylic acid of previous generation EET mimics while retaining some key structural features.
10. The most effective analogue in the study is a urea derivative with a submicromolar ed50 and a low nanomolar ic50, making it a leading candidate for further development.

1. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model is an extension of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) aimed at providing quality, coordinated, and cost-effective care to patients, reducing healthcare costs, and increasing access to services. The implementation of PCMH has proven to be successful in reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care quality. The transition to PCMH involves creating written policies that adhere to PCMH principles and fit the specific practice structure, obtaining NCQA recognition, and addressing challenges such as physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records.
2. Primary care practices face several challenges in transitioning to PCMH, including promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records. Physicians may resist the change due to a lack of training, misaligned financial incentives, underreimbursement, and time-consuming procedures. Team-based care, care coordination, and population management require resources not currently reimbursed in most health insurance packages. Care coordinators and disease managers play a crucial role in population management and care coordination, but their time, salary, responsibilities, and workload are not defined in the cost or structure of a typical practice. Smaller practices may have a harder time transforming to a high-functioning PCMH due to resource constraints.

1. Approximately 40% of marital infertility is due to male factors, and varicocele is a common cause of male infertility.
2. Varicocele is characterized by enlargement and elongation of the pampiniform plexus, venous convolution, and sinus formation with backflow.
3. The etiology and pathomechanisms of varicoceles are not fully understood, but they are believed to cause testicular hyperemia and compromised oxygen concentration.
4. A diagnosis of varicocele is typically made through physical examination and confirmed with color doppler ultrasound.
5. Laparoscopic repair is a common treatment for varicocele, which involves dividing the testicular vein to prevent retrograde blood flow and venous stasis.
6. The results of a retrospective study of 68 adolescent patients with idiopathic varicocele and testicular hypotrophy showed that laparoscopic repair led to an increase in testicular volume on the affected side in 83.8% of cases.
7. Hormonal regulation of the reproductive system in adolescent boys and men of procreative age depends on the stimulation of sertoli and leydig cells in the testis by pituitary hormones, and postoperative follow-up after laparoscopic varicocele repair in young men has shown mostly normal sperm count, motility, and morphology.

1. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for localized prostate cancer, but the major long-term morbidity is erectile dysfunction.
2. The cause of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy is injury to the cavernosal nerves, which branch from the pelvic plexus and run within the neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate.
3. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, with 16-76% recovery of erectile function in those with bilateral neurovascular bundle preservation and 0-56% in those with unilateral preservation.
4. The present study aimed to describe periprostatic nerve distribution and construct a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution using male adult cadavers.
5. The study found that the number of periprostatic nerve fibers was evenly distributed to the dorsal and both lateral areas of the prostate, with no cord-like neurovascular bundle observed.
6. The distances from the prostatic capsule were almost the same in both the lateral and dorsal (rectal) parts of the base, middle, and apex levels of the prostate.

Additional Information:
- The study used five adult male human cadavers and sliced each specimen into eight whole-mount slides, which were stained with anti-s-100 protein antibody to delineate the precise location of neural tissue.
- Nerve fibers 100 micrometer or greater in diameter were counted in 200 magnification microscopically, along with the number, distance from the true prostate capsule, and nerve fiber diameter on each sector from representative slides.
- The three-dimensional periprostatic nerve distribution model was made by connecting the stained nerve fibers from the same location of the same sectors of the eight whole-mount slides from each prostate and reconstructing its image.
- The study found that the average number of nerve fibers in the ventral part of the prostate was significantly fewer in number and decreased in thickness compared to the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts at all levels.

3. SAA is also the precursor of amyloid A protein, a fibrillar, insoluble product deposited in major organs, which carries a risk of organ failure and premature death in the course of secondary amyloidosis.
4. The study aimed to assess the concentration of SAA in RA patients with different disease activity, as well as inflammatory, metabolic parameters, and cardiovascular and renal disease risk factors.
5. The study group consisted of 140 RA patients, and blood samples were collected for SAA, cystatin-C (Cys-C), and other laboratory tests.
6. The results showed that SAA was significantly higher in men than in women, in patients with high disease activity, currently treated versus not treated with glucocorticoids, and in patients with advanced atherosclerosis or increased Cys-C levels.

2. Perforin deficiency, which is a major mediator of cellular immunity, is associated with a selective defect in granulocyte production, which can be corrected by wild-type lymphocyte transfer.
3. In the absence of allergen sensitization and challenge, pfp mice have reduced granulocyte numbers both inside and outside of bone marrow, relative to wild-type controls.
4. Lymphocytes from the spleen of naive wild-type mice, but not pfp mice, are able to reconstitute in the short term the granulopoietic responses to dexamethasone, but different cells may be involved in reconstitution of lineage-specific responses.
5. The defect in response to dexamethasone in pfp animals could not be corrected by transfer of lymphocytes from pfp donors, suggesting that something was lacking in the recipient mice.
6. Neutrophils were reduced in bone marrow and blood of pfp mice relative to b6 controls, which argues against reduced numbers in bone marrow being due to an increased export of neutrophils to the periphery.
7. The lack of appropriate response to gm-csf, both in the absence and in the presence of dexamethasone, would predict that emergency granulopoiesis would be defective in pfp mice and might negatively influence the outcome of sepsis.

1. Over the past decade, various cell types have been studied for their potential in cardiac regeneration, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skeletal myoblasts, and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. More recent possibilities include induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and resident cardiac stem cells.
2. ESCs can be obtained from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation blastocyst and differentiated into cardiovascular lineages in vitro. iPSCs can be generated from adult somatic cells by overexpressing transcription factors and differentiated into functional cardiovascular lineages.
3. MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow and adipose tissues and differentiated into cardiomyocytes under special conditions. They can be rapidly expanded in culture and are less immunogenic than other cell populations, making them suitable for allogenic transplantation. However, their propensity to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues limits their use.
4. Skeletal myoblasts can be harvested from muscle biopsies, expanded in culture, and autologously reimplanted. They are less prone to teratoma formation and more resistant to ongoing ischemia than ESCs. However, true cardiomyocyte differentiation has not been observed in vivo, and their contractions are dyssynchronous due to failure of electromechanical coupling with the surrounding myocardium.
5. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, including hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, can be mobilized or harvested and differentiated into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in vitro. After transplant, they can supply a broad range of paracrine factors with proangiogenic, positive remodeling, and antiapoptotic properties. Clinical trials have shown improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct scar size, and left ventricular end-systolic volume after intracoronary infusion of adult bone marrow-derived stem cells.

2. It was first described in Austria in 1818 by the German chemist Stromeyer and has since been found in many salt deposits.
3. Polyhalite is associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.
4. The crystal structure was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria and later confirmed.
5. Polyhalite can be synthesised under laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C.
6. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C and reaches a maximum of 343°C. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements significantly changes dehydration reactions.
7. Polyhalite most commonly forms early diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact.
8. It is stable between room temperature and 255-343°C and is of interest for absolute age dating due to its potassium content.
9. In the Haselgebirge salt mine in Austria, polyhalite is a minor but widespread and important constituent and is accessible in several salt mines including the type locality of Bad Ischl, Hallstatt, Berchtesgaden, and Hall in Tirol.

3. Propofol, which is chemically similar to vitamin E, has been shown to have antioxidant effects in vitro and in vivo.
4. In this study, the effects of propofol on the lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant indices in rodents were investigated.
5. The study used propofol obtained from an anesthetist and chemicals purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The animals were male Wistar rats maintained on laboratory chow and water.
6. The rats were randomly distributed into three groups: a control group given corn oil, a group given a therapeutic dose of propofol (2 mg/kg), and a group given a double therapeutic dose of propofol (4 mg/kg).
7. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last dose of the drug, and blood and tissue samples were collected for analysis.

The results showed that propofol did not significantly affect the levels of serum and renal and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating that its metabolism is not linked to the generation of free radicals. However, it increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol, while decreasing HDL-cholesterol. The increased cholesterol level may be due to increased alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl co-A reductase activity or decreased fatty oxidation.

3. Debris extruded during retreatment can cause postoperative inflammation, flare-ups, and impaired healing.
4. The current study aimed to evaluate the extrusion of debris after using Protaper universal RFS and different finishing files for removing residual root canal fillings.
5. The finishing files used were Protaper Next (PTN), WaveOne (WO), and Self-Adjusting File (SAF). The null hypothesis was that the three files would exhibit no significant differences in debris extrusion.
6. The study used a model for evaluating apical extrusion of debris and an analytical balance to determine the initial weights of the tubes. Three consecutive weights were obtained for each tube, and the mean was computed.
7. The root fillings were removed using Protaper universal RFS (d1, d2, and d3) and then finishing files (PTN, WO, and SAF) were used to remove residual filling material.

3. A study was conducted to determine the success rates of pulpal anesthesia with the AMSA nerve block technique using a conventional syringe. Thirty patients received the anesthetic, and the results showed anesthetic success in all patients for palatal soft tissue anesthesia, but varying success rates for pulpal anesthesia, ranging from 16.7% to 66.6%.

2. TADs, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size, exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions.
3. TAD boundaries are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions, and are enriched for certain histone marks, CTCF, cohesin, and the timing of replication domains.
4. In Drosophila, the combinatorial binding of different types of insulators is associated with the strength of the TAD boundary.
5. TAD boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, and a strong TAD boundary limits interactions between adjacent TAD domains.
6. Brg1, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, contributes to TAD boundary strength and regulates nucleosome occupancy and higher order chromatin organization.
7. Brg1 regulates gene expression and lipid synthesis, and its knockdown results in the differential expression of many long non-coding RNAs.
8. Brg1 binds primarily to genic regions, including super-enhancers, and its knockdown reduces the strength of TAD boundaries, as assessed using the insulation method.
9. Brg1 loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and preclude the binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries, leading to decreased nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions and altered interactions with topoisomerases.

These models help identify specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.
3. An alternative approach to appetite control comes from the study of energy balance and the interrelationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI). Any increase in EE will be met with an equivalent increase in EI, but daily EE can fluctuate markedly, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of total daily EE and is quite uniform across the day and between days. RMR could provide a tonic signal of energy demand that could act as a driver of daily EI, while physical activity EE exerts a different type of control over appetite due to its intensity and sporadic nature.

1. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a widely used material in prosthetic dentistry for denture base fabrication, particularly heat-polymerized PMMA resin due to its excellent esthetics, low water sorption and solubility, relative lack of toxicity, repair ability, and simple processing technique.
2. Heat-polymerized PMMA resin has higher bond strength with denture teeth compared to chemically activated resins, and surface treatments of the denture teeth can improve their bond strength to both heat-polymerized and autopolymerized denture base resins.
3. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of surface treatments on shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat-polymerized and autopolymerized denture base resins using 60 maxillary central incisor acrylic teeth and six triangular shaped wax models.
4. The results showed that surface treatments of the denture teeth significantly improved their bond strength to both denture base resins, with no significant difference between monomer application and airborne particle abrasion. However, the bond strength of the denture teeth to heat-polymerized resin was higher than that to autopolymerized resin.
5. The failure mode was predominantly mixed in the heat-polymerized groups and adhesive in the autopolymerized groups, and monomer application provided a solvent effect on the tooth surface, favoring the formation of interpenetrating polymer networks across the tooth-denture base interface.
</summary>

Additionally, the study found that the use of mechanical retention and ridge lap surface contamination with wax or tinfoil substitute residues can also affect the bond strength between acrylic resin teeth and denture base resins. The study did not consider mechanical fatigue, thermal cycling, or chewing simulation, so the results should be interpreted with caution.",1

2. The UVR hazard during arc welding depends on the welding conditions, including the type of shielding gas and welding current.
3. The study measured the UVR emitted during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel using a digital inverter-type pulsed arc welding machine and assessed its acute health effects.
4. The study found that the UVR hazard increases with welding current and is dependent on the type of welding wire. The effective irradiance was highest during pulsed welding with an 80% ar + 20% co2 shielding gas.

1. Bacteria inhabiting freshwater reservoirs in glacier forefield areas were studied to determine their potential to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).
2. Five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream were sampled near the Polish Antarctic Station Arctowski.
3. Isolated strains belonged mainly to the phylum of proteobacteria, with 11 isolates from the betaproteobacteria class, 7 isolates from the gammaproteobacteria class, 2 isolates from the alphaproteobacteria class, and 2 isolates from the bacteroidetes phylum.
4. The most frequently recovered group of isolates was members of the pseudomonas genus (7 isolates), and the second numerous group was janthinobacterium genus (5 isolates).
5. Twelve of the isolates (six pseudomonads strains, four janthinobacterium strains, and two undefined betaproteobacteria) were found to possess genes responsible for mcl-pha synthesis using the first primer pair, and six pseudomonas strains and two janthinobacterium strains were confirmed to possess these genes using the second primer pair.
6. The phylogenetic analysis of phac and phac1 genes revealed high similarity between janthinobacterium sp. p39 and antarctic proteobacterium p21, and between janthinobacterium sp. p38 and zooglea ramigera. The second group of phac1 genes was dominated by members of the pseudomonas species.
7. The statistical analysis of principal components (CCA) showed a correlation between the presence of bacteria possessing particular pha synthase genes and environmental conditions, with bacteria having genetic potential to synthesize scl-pha inhabiting reservoirs with rather low trophy and high amounts of pheophytins.

1. Major depression (MD) is a leading cause of disability and is projected to become the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. Approximately 40% of patients with MD do not respond satisfactorily to antidepressant medications and psychotherapies, and up to 850,000 lives are lost each year due to suicide. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a challenge in mental health care despite the understanding of psychosocial and biological markers and the availability of multiple therapeutic options.
2. Neuromodulation therapies (NTs) are gaining increasing interest in the management of patients with TRD due to their ability to target specific brain circuits involved in the pathogenesis of MD and their limited side effect profile. Seizure therapies such as modified electroconvulsive therapy (MECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST), noninvasive therapies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and cranial electric stimulation (CES), neurosurgical approaches such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), epidural cortical stimulation (ECS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS), and new approaches such as focused ultrasound (FUS), near-infrared light therapy (NIR), and optogenetic stimulation (OS) are being explored for their efficacy in MD and TRD.

1. Small RNA molecules play a crucial role in regulating various molecular and biological activities in the cell, with short RNA sequences specifically regulating gene expression.
2. RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene regulatory mechanism that causes sequence-specific downregulation of mRNAs through double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
3. RNAi can also modulate gene transcription itself by regulating chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNAs.
4. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing.
5. In human cells, short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon called RNA activation (RNAa).
6. The present study focuses on the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating important target genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming using RNAa.
7. The study employs a genomic bioinformatic approach to design short activating RNAs (sarnas) for upregulation of specific cellular genes, specifically the transcription factors KLF4 and c-Myc.
8. The results indicate that sarnas show significant potential as a tool for studying stem cell biology and as a safe method to manipulate stem cell gene expression without altering the genome.
9. The study identifies and characterizes two sarnas, klf4-pr1 and myc-pr2, that specifically activate transcription of endogenous klf4 and myc genes, respectively, in primary human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

3. Taurine interacts with ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, renal vascular endothelial function, and antioxidant properties in the kidney.
4. Paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer, ameliorates fibrosis in UUO rat kidney model and mouse model of polycystic kidney disease.
5. The present study aimed to determine the effects of taurine and paclitaxel on tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preserving normal renal histology in a rat model of UUO.
6. The study used stereological methods to estimate the volume and length of various renal structures, including cortex, medulla, glomeruli, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, Henle's loop, collecting ducts, and vessels.
7. The results showed that UUO led to renal disruption, tubular atrophy, degeneration, necrosis, and fibrosis. Taxol and taurine treatments reduced the volume of necrotic and fibrotic tissue and preserved the length of various tubular structures.

1. Autophagy is a bulk degradation system that plays a critical role in host defense by enabling the reuse of cellular components and the clearance of unfavorable substances, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the prevention of disease.
2. Autophagy is induced after sensing various types of stress, such as nutrient starvation, the accumulation of protein aggregates, and invasion by microbes. Autophagosomes are formed by the coordinated action of essential components called autophagy-related proteins (atgs), which mediate membrane trafficking and define the site for lc3 conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine, an essential process for autophagosome elongation.
3. Autophagy plays an indispensable role in antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells by promoting the localization of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on autophagosomes and the presentation of viral and self-antigens to CD4 T cells.
4. Recent studies have shown that atgs are involved in the regulation of innate immune responses provoked by the engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) with microbial components. For instance, atg16l1, an essential component of autophagy, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses by modulating the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to endotoxin.

1. Betel quid chewing, a common cultural practice in India, became a health hazard when tobacco was introduced and mixed into the quid.
2. The association between chewing betel quid with tobacco and oral cancer was established in the second half of the 20th century.
3. Tobacco is the major culprit in oral cancer caused by betel quid chewing, but betel nut was erroneously thought to play a more significant role due to its exotic appeal.
4. Betel nut chewing is responsible for oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a precancerous condition with trismus.
5. The incidence of OSMF and oral cancer has increased in recent decades due to the industrial manufacturing and marketing of chewable mixtures like gutkha.
6. The mean age of oral cancer patients in the study was 59.92 years for females and 61.20 years for males. The mean duration of betel chewing was 18.56 years for males and 20 years for females.
7. Most patients in the study (63) were managed according to the oral cancer management protocol and all signed written informed consent.
8. The most common types of oral cancer in the study were carcinoma of the buccal mucosa (41 cases) and lip carcinoma (14 cases).
9. Betel nut contains carcinogenic alkaloids, and the lime in the quid enhances their extraction and promotes carcinogenesis.
10. Betel nut is the second most consumed carcinogen after tobacco in the Indian subcontinent and is chewed for various reasons, including stress relief and mouth freshening. Addiction withdrawal symptoms include mood swings, anxiety, irritability, loss of concentration, sleep disturbance, and craving.

1. The concept of patient blood management is gaining importance due to the risks and costs associated with allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, including increased morbidity and mortality, infection risk, and shortage of blood bank products. Postoperative severe bleeding is common in cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in older patients and those with long cardiopulmonary bypass.
2. Several studies have reported increased long-term mortality after RBC transfusions, but these reports are mainly from designated types of surgery or single-center studies. The use of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is common, and their use carries both benefits and risks, including increased bleeding and transfusion requirements.
3. The correlation between blood flow, oxygen delivery, and consumption, along with haemoglobin, can be visualized in Figure 4. Oxygen delivery is determined by cardiac output, haemoglobin level, and oxygenation. If oxygen delivery is out of balance with oxygen consumption, compensation mechanisms include a decrease in haemoglobin, an increase in cardiac index, or a combination. Oxygen is carried in the blood in two forms: primarily by haemoglobin and a small amount dissolved in the plasma. Patients with coexisting cardiac diseases may have a particular risk of developing impaired oxygenation at lower haemoglobin levels, but the documentation for this is not convincing. Studies of cardiac surgery patients have shown increased mortality after RBC transfusions, but lowering the haemoglobin threshold for transfusion in patients undergoing CABG from 9 to 8 g/dl was not followed by a higher mortality or increased adverse effects. Patients may even benefit from a restrictive transfusion regimen. The first priority of perioperative fluid therapy is to achieve optimal filling of the heart with crystalloids and colloids to optimize cardiovascular function, decrease postoperative morbidity, and shorten the length of hospitalization.

1. Microglia, first described by Pio del Rio-Hortega, are now known to play a crucial role in innate immunity within the central nervous system (CNS). They are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac that enter the brain during different developmental stages. Microglia are involved in immune surveillance, inflammatory response, phagocytosis, scavenging actions, neuroprotection, and angiogenesis.
2. The glymphatic system, an interstitial fluid/cerebrospinal fluid exchange system located in the perivascular space, facilitates immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid. Microglia and the glymphatic system enable communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes.
3. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of depolarization and electrical silence in the brain, accompanied by secondary changes in cerebral blood flow. CSD can be elicited by various stimuli and is associated with inflammatory activation of microglia, which can contribute to neuroprotection or neurodamage.
4. Microglia express voltage-sensitive ion channels and can sense electrical activity pertaining to CSD. They exhibit increased NMDA-dependent inward rectifying potassium conductance after CSD, which may be a compensatory mechanism for elevated extracellular K concentration. CSD induces microglial secretion of IL-1 and TNF, and these cytokines can lower the threshold for CSD induction, forming a positive feedback mechanism.

1. Transposable elements (TES), previously considered as selfish and junk elements, have been shown to serve as a genomic reservoir for new regulatory and coding sequences, allowing genetic innovation and organismal evolution.
2. Two major categories of TES are retroelements and DNA transposons. Retroelements use a ""copy-and-paste"" mechanism through reverse transcription, while DNA transposons use a ""cut-and-paste"" mechanism by excising and reintegrating into new locations.
3. Retroelements include retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons, with the latter lacking an envelope gene. Retrotransposition increases the copy number of the element, and the gain or loss of the envelope gene can transform a retrotransposon into a retrovirus and vice versa.
4. DNA transposons include transposases, which catalyze transposition, and noncoding nonautonomous elements using proteins encoded by autonomous sequences. TES have been molecularly domesticated to form new cellular protein-coding genes.
5. Several examples of vertebrate genes formed from TE-coding sequences include MART genes derived from the gag gene of Ty3/Gypsy elements and scan family proteins derived from gag proteins of GMR1-like gypsy/Ty3 retrotransposons.

1. Misfolded protein aggregates are the hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases.
2. These aggregates propagate and amplify through a prion-like mechanism, spreading from one cell to another and causing both loss of function and gain of pathologic function.
3. Misfolded protein aggregates can impair membrane integrity and permeability, affect membrane protein dynamics and distribution, create novel signaling platforms, and recruit soluble forms of the same protein, leading to toxicity.
4. The toxicity of misfolded protein assemblies is dependent on their ability to bind and permeabilize the cell membrane, impinge membrane curvature, and recruit membranous proteins, creating novel signaling platforms.
5. Once internalized, misfolded protein assemblies can leak out of the endosomal-lysosomal compartments, causing leakage of lysosomal content or rupture of lysosomes, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation.
6. Distinct strains of misfolded proteins, such as prion protein, synuclein, and tau, have been identified, which differ in their biochemical properties, surface properties, and seeding propensity.
7. Targeting early protein assemblies involved in disease formation and propagation represents a novel and effective preventive therapeutic avenue, and small molecules that interfere with protein aggregation, stimulate proteostasis, and counteract neuroinflammation are promising therapeutic agents.

2. Beta adrenergic receptors (2ar), which have a seven membrane spanning domain structure, are linked to atherogenesis through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Two common non-synonymous SNPs of 2ar have been identified at nucleotides 46 (rs1042713) and 79 (rs1042714), causing changes in amino acid residues at position 16 (arg > gly) and 27 (gln > glu) of the fourth intracellular loop.
3. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the association between 2ar polymorphisms and ischemic stroke using the keywords 'bar', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'cerebral infarction', and 'ischemic stroke'. Two studies were included for genotypic association meta-analysis and three studies for allelic association meta-analysis.
4. The meta-analysis results did not show a significant association between arg16gly polymorphism of 2ar and ischemic stroke under either recessive or dominant models of inheritance, nor did it show a statistically significant allelic association. However, a significant association was observed between gln27glu polymorphism of 2ar and ischemic stroke under both recessive and dominant models of inheritance, as well as a significant allelic association.

2. Chronic methadone use results in impaired cognitive abilities in aspects such as psychomotor performance, information processing, attention, problem solving, memory, decision making, reaction time, and emotional facial expression recognition.
3. The underlying mechanisms of methadone-induced cognitive impairment involve changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt), which can lead to mitochondrial calcium overload and ultimately contribute to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) formation and cell death.
4. In this study, the mechanisms underlying methadone-induced rises in [Ca]cyt in sh-sy5y cells were investigated. Four different types of calcium responses were observed: type 1 (no rise in [Ca]cyt), type 2 (continuous rise in [Ca]cyt), type 3 (delayed rise in [Ca]cyt), and type 4 (transient rise in [Ca]cyt). Methadone decreased type 4 cells and increased types 2 and 3, suggesting that methadone may induce a short or delayed calcium deregulation in sh-sy5y cells.

1. The present study aimed to investigate the expression patterns and regulatory roles of the interleukin-23/interleukin-17 (IL-23/IL-17) axis in oral lichen planus (OLP). The study found that both erosive and reticular OLP lesions had significantly increased immunostaining scores of IL-23p19 and the numbers of IL-17+ cells compared to normal oral mucosa. In reticular OLP subgroup, there was a positive correlation between IL-23p19 staining scores and the numbers of IL-17+ cells, as well as a positive correlation between the mRNA expressions of both IL-23 subunits (IL-23p19 and IL-12p40) and IL-17. These results suggest that overexpressions of IL-23 and IL-17 are positively correlated in the reticular OLP lesion, indicating a potential regulatory role of IL-23 to the expression of IL-17 in the early stage of OLP lesion.
2. The study also explored the potential role of IL-23 in the production of IL-17 in CD4+th cells from OLP patients. The results showed that the stimulation of IL-23 significantly increased the percentage of CD4+IL-17+ (th17) cells and the IL-17 content in the culture supernatant of CD4+th cells from OLP patients. These findings suggest that the overexpression of IL-23 in OLP lesions probably contributes to the induction of th17 and the production of IL-17.

The study used data from a prospective longitudinal study at the Hamilton Glaucoma Center, UCSD, and included 462 eyes of 305 glaucoma patients and 62 eyes of 49 healthy controls. The study used a statistically significant slope at p < 0.05 and also faster than the fifth percentile cutoff calculated from the healthy group to determine progression.
2. The study found that oct was able to detect more eyes as progressing in comparison to sap, except for eyes with moderate and severe disease and when a large number of tests were available. Each 1 db higher md was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of detecting progression by oct versus sap. The odds of detecting progression by oct were generally higher than the odds of detecting change by sap for eyes with less severe disease at baseline. However, for eyes with advanced disease and relatively large number of visits available during follow-up, the odds of detecting progression by sap were greater than by oct. The number of visits during follow-up also significantly influenced the ability to detect change, with a greater number of visits making detection of change easier for both structural and functional tests.

1. Anal incontinence (AI) is a common problem associated with various health issues, including hygienic problems, limitations in occupational and social life, sexual dysfunction, reduced quality of life, and altered self-esteem.
2. Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is a major cause of AI in nonpregnant women, and multiple vaginal deliveries increase the risk of AI regardless of anal sphincter injury. Other risk factors include age, obesity, and medical conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and gastrointestinal disorders.
3. The prevalence of AI among women varies widely, with a higher prevalence among women attending gynecological outpatient clinics and older women. Few studies have assessed AI in a female population of fertile age or included nulliparous women.
4. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for AI in an unselected female population across parity groups in second trimester pregnancy. The study was conducted as a survey of pregnant women attending routine ultrasound examinations at a large university hospital in Oslo, Norway.
5. The study found that previous obstetric anal sphincter injury was the strongest risk factor for self-reported AI among pregnant parous women. Among nulliparous women, a low educational level and comorbidity were significant risk factors. The group of women with previous cesarean deliveries only had the lowest prevalence of AI, indicating that pregnancy per se may not be a major risk factor for AI.

1. The text discusses a study comparing the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia in hypertensive patients under control by medical treatment and normotensive patients using hyperbaric bupivacaine.
2. The study included 60 patients with ASA scores I and II, aged 18-65, undergoing elective surgeries of the lower abdomen, lower limbs, and perineum. Blood pressures and heart rates were measured and recorded at various time points.
3. The study found no significant differences between the groups regarding age, sex, weight, height, maximal height of sensory block, incidences of hypotension and bradycardia, or the amount of fluids infused. However, the number of patients with ASA II physiologic scores was higher in the hypertensive group.
4. The study showed that hypertensive patients had significantly higher systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures than normotensive patients at all measurement times. Hypotension and bradycardia were treated with ephedrine and atropine, respectively. The study concluded that there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between hypertensive and normotensive patients, but the number of patients who developed hypotension was greater in the hypertensive group. The study also discussed the possible reasons for this, including the relationship between basal sympathetic activity and blood pressure, the effect of aging, and the role of antihypertensive treatment.

1. The study aimed to determine the usefulness of Dolotest as a screening tool for depression in primary care using a validated pain- and health-related quality of life assessment tool. The study included 715 patients, 34.4% of whom stated their visit was due to pain. Women had statistically significantly higher dolotest scores than men in all domains except for pain and problems with more strenuous activity. In the study population, 16.1% of all patients met criteria for depression using the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and 26.8% of those whose visit was due to pain also met depression criteria. The findings are clinically important as the coexistence of pain and depression is associated with increased healthcare costs, reduced function, and reduced work capacity.
2. The study found that a cut-off value of 65 on the Dolotest domain ""to what extent do you experience low spirits"" had a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.95 to detect persons meeting criteria for depression, with a predicted value on positive test at 0.74. Dolotest proved to be a valuable tool for screening both pain and depression, as the domain ""low spirits"" is associated with depression. The study concluded that it is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of the coexistence of pain and depression and to provide them with tools to screen and identify patients at risk for suboptimal treatment.

1. Delirium is a common complication among elderly patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stay, institutionalization, and dementia.
2. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium may help improve recognition and care.
3. Oxidative stress and disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission are involved in the pathophysiology of delirium.
4. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) functions as a cofactor in the production of serotonin and dopamine and for nitric oxide synthase (NOS).
5. In delirium patients, BH4 status has only been investigated after elective cardiac surgery.
6. The present study aimed to investigate BH4 status, potential disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and the production of nitric oxide in patients with and without delirium.
7. The study found that patients with delirium had lower arginine levels, higher phe/tyr ratios, and lower trp/lnaas ratios than patients without delirium.
8. These findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and an increased status of oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of delirium in older, acutely ill hospitalized patients. Confirmation in a larger, comparable population is recommended.

1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMIs) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, and approximately 25% of them have diabetes, which is 2-3 times the rate in the general population. Factors contributing to this include lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications.
2. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced health home programs to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions, including SMIs. A behavioral health home (BHH) was established within the Division of Community Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine to improve somatic care for individuals with SMIs.
3. The BHH provided a minimum of 2 services per month, coordinated by a nurse case manager, and offered care coordination, comprehensive transitional care, health promotion, and group services. A population-based health management program was created to target highly prevalent somatic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension.
4. Of the 120 patients enrolled in the BHH, 54 (45%) did not have their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels checked according to the recommended guidelines for individuals prescribed antipsychotic medications. Thirty-three patients were identified as having type 2 diabetes, and seven of these patients had improvements in HbA1c levels. However, six patients originally in the prediabetes range moved into the diabetic range, and another seven had higher HbA1c levels.
5. Preliminary results suggest that the use of a BHH may be beneficial in identifying gaps in care, such as missed diagnoses and laboratory monitoring, and delivering preventative and individualized proactive care. However, more research is needed to investigate the clinical and control samples and patient satisfaction with BHH and population-based health management services.

1. Osteoporosis in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by a combination of factors, including reduced mechanical stress due to immobility, long-term glucocorticoid (GCs) treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and increased risk of falling.
2. The process of bone remodeling is disrupted in MS patients, leading to bone loss, deterioration of bone quality, and increased frequency of fractures.
3. MS patients have a higher risk of falls due to impaired balance, muscle weakness, and slowed afferent proprioceptive conduction in the spinal cord. Disuse, inflammatory changes, and GCs treatment or vitamin D deficiency may also contribute to muscle weakness and falling.
4. GCs treatment increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in MS patients, with a rapid bone loss during the first year and a more gradual but continuous bone loss in subsequent years. However, the fracture risk returns towards baseline levels after discontinuation of oral GCs treatment.
5. Vitamin D deficiency is common in MS patients due to low intake and limited sunlight exposure, and may contribute to bone remodeling imbalance and bone loss. MS patients treated with GCs are also at greater risk for an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption due to vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency.
6. Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in MS patients should include assessment of clinical risk factors, such as motor disability and GCs treatment, as well as regular bone mineral density (BMD) testing and consideration of nonpharmacological therapies, such as weight-bearing exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle modifications.

1. The transobturator approach to treat female stress urinary incontinence using midurethral slings was first described by Delorme, and later modified by De Leval using an inside-out approach to reduce potential injuries to the urethra and bladder.
2. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator muscle procedures.
3. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective.
4. This study aimed to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT scan image analysis.
5. The study revealed that the mus tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior, and the out-in tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the in-out tapes.
6. The mean full inner angle in a strict antero-posterior view formed by the in-out mus measured 122 (95%ci: 107-136) degrees, versus 144 (95%ci: 131-151) degrees for the out-in mus (p = 0.02).
7. The differences in outcomes obtained in ultrasound studies investigating the angles formed by the two arms of mus tapes demonstrate the need for strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique.
8. The clinical implications from this cadaveric imaging study are that surgeons must pay more attention to the second half of the helical pass, whichever way they choose to go.
9. The advent of three-dimensional ultrasonography and in vivo visualization of mesh by magnetic resonance imaging will allow for correlation of findings to nuances in clinical outcomes and a better understanding of the mesh-tissue interaction.
