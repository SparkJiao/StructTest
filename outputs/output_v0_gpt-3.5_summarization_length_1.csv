9,"<summary>Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of galaxies with a highly disturbed intragroup medium, showing evidence of a large-scale intergalactic shock wave. The shock heating of the X-ray emitting gas is believed to be caused by the collision of an intruder galaxy with the intergalactic medium of the group.

66,"<summary> The majority of stars are formed in star clusters, with only a modest percentage of gas being turned into stars during the initial phases of a cluster's lifetime. The loss of gas from a cluster can lead to it being out of equilibrium, affecting the internal dynamics and mass estimates. Observations of young massive star clusters show excess light at large radii, indicating rapid gas loss and lack of dynamical equilibrium.

The hidden sector in AMSB models must be sequestered on a separate brane from the observable sector in an extra-dimensional universe. Hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMSB) is an alternative setup for AMSB, where SUSY breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region. HCAMSB models have a parameter space governed by a dimensionless quantity, leading to a mixed wino-higgsino neutralino state. The LHC reach for HCAMSB models is expected to be lower than for MAMSB models due to differences in the sparticle mass spectrum and event characteristics. HCAMSB models predict severe left-right splitting of scalar masses, high multiplicity of top and bottom quarks in final states, and a large mass gap in the neutralino sector.
