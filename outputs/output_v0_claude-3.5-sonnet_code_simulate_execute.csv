64_2,"Let's simulate the execution of the `subject_marks` function step by step:

1. The function receives the input `[('Physics',96),('Chemistry',97),('Biology',45)]` as the `subjectmarks` parameter.

2. The function then uses the `sort` method on `subjectmarks` with a key function. The key function is a lambda that returns the second element (index 1) of each tuple.

3. Let's see how the sorting works:
   - For ('Physics', 96), the key is 96
   - For ('Chemistry', 97), the key is 97
   - For ('Biology', 45), the key is 45

4. The list is sorted based on these keys in ascending order:
   - ('Biology', 45) comes first (lowest score)
   - ('Physics', 96) comes second
   - ('Chemistry', 97) comes last (highest score)

5. After sorting, the `subjectmarks` list becomes:
   [('Biology', 45), ('Physics', 96), ('Chemistry', 97)]

1. The function `get_equal` is called with the input `[(1, 2), (3, 4)]`.

2. Inside `get_equal`, it calls `find_equal_tuple` with the same input.

3. In `find_equal_tuple`:
   - `Input` is not empty, so `k = len(Input[0]) = 2`
   - `flag` is initialized to 1
   - It starts iterating through the tuples in `Input`:
     - For (1, 2): len(tuple) = 2, which equals k, so flag remains 1
     - For (3, 4): len(tuple) = 2, which equals k, so flag remains 1
   - The loop ends without changing the flag
   - The function returns `flag`, which is 1

4. Back in `get_equal`, it compares the result of `find_equal_tuple(Input)` with 1:
   `1 == 1` is True

5. The `get_equal` function returns this boolean result.
