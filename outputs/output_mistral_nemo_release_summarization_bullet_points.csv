0,"• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood.
• Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experiences directed transport.
• The interest in ratchet systems lies in the possibility of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems.
• Recent studies have focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.
• The behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is sensitive to system parameters.
• The transport properties of a chaotic ratchet are not as simple as initially conjectured by Mateos.
• However, a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture is supported: bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter are associated with abrupt changes in the current.
• The current may reverse direction if the abrupt change leads the net current to pass through zero, but not necessarily so.",1,"{'n_points': 8, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The source document discusses the discovery of highly eccentric extrasolar planets and the theories behind their origin.
* One such method is planet-planet scattering, where multiple jovian planets form several astronomical units from the host star and interact, leaving one in an eccentric orbit and often ejecting the other.
* This method has been proposed to explain the architecture of the Kepler-16 and planetary system, which contains a hot Jupiter as well as two jovian planets in moderately eccentric orbits.
* Interactions with stellar companions are another possible way to boost a planet's eccentricity.
* Of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity, six are also known to possess stellar-mass companions in wide binary orbits.
* If the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large, the Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the planet.
* The Kozai mechanism has been suggested to explain the high eccentricity of 16 Cyg BB and HD 80606b.
* The document also discusses the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and its use in searching for additional low-mass companions in known planetary systems.

2,"* The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Higgs boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Higgs decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand.
* The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the Higgs pole.
* Taking these achievements into account, the physics of the Higgs boson will again play the central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Higgs factory comes true with the generated Higgs events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP.

* Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with three main types: Bell-nonlocality, EPR steerability, and non-separability.
* Bell-nonlocality occurs when measurements violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality.
* EPR steerability is a weaker form of non-locality, where one party (Alice or Bob) can demonstrate steering by showing that correlations cannot be described by a local hidden state (LHS) model.
* Non-separability refers to states that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents.
* The paper focuses on EPR steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals (T-states) when Alice can make arbitrary projective measurements.
* The authors construct a local hidden variable (LHV) LHS model that describes measurable quantum correlations for separable and many non-separable T-states.
* This model is optimal for Werner states and conjectured to be optimal for T-states, with a small gap remaining between provably non-steerable and provably steerable states.
* The paper also derives two sufficient conditions for EPR steerability of T-states using steering inequalities.
* Future work includes extending the LHV LHS model to arbitrary two-qubit states and generalizing it to arbitrary positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs).

* A three-phase clock is required to enforce unidirectionality in spintronic devices, but it's not an attractive solution due to fabrication challenges and energy dissipation.

8,"• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
• The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors are the lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range (the so-called period gap) and the sharp cut-off of the distribution at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
• The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star, while thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius. The minimum period occurs where the two corresponding time scales, the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time, are about equal.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The first evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was found when supernovae type Ia were found to be fainter than expected.
* This fact has been confirmed by many independent observations such as temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), and gamma-ray bursts.
* Within the framework of general relativity (GR), the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, termed dark energy (DE).
* The nature of this unknown matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort in order to understand its properties.
* The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant (Λ) being the possible origin of the dark energy (DE) driving the present epoch of the accelerated expansion of our universe and a dark matter (DM) component giving rise to galaxies and their large-scale structures distributions.
* The DM is assumed to have negligible pressure and temperature and is termed cold. Thanks to the agreement with observations, the model is commonly known as ΛCDM.
* While favored by the observations, the model is not satisfactory from the theoretical point of view: the value of the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than what it was estimated in particle physics.
* It was suggested soon that DE could be dynamic, evolving with time.
* This new cosmological model also suffers from a severe fine-tune problem known as the coincidence problem: if the time variation of matter and DE are very different, why are their current values so similar?
* Cosmological models where DM and DE do not evolve separately but interact with each other were first introduced to justify the currently small value of the cosmological constant but they were found to be very useful to alleviate the coincidence problem.

• The first step is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second step uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
• Recent findings show that the fragmentation process is inadequate for producing particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions, and recombination of partons is a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.
• The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
• The shower parton distributions (SPDs) are determined by solving integral equations that relate them to the known fragmentation functions.

* The interplay between tunneling and classical chaos has been studied for a particle in a double-well potential with oscillatory driving force.
* Chaos-suppressed tunneling has been studied in the driven double-well model using the Floquet formalism.
* The additional effects caused by coupling the chaotic system to other degrees of freedom or an environment, such as decoherence and dissipation, have been studied rarely.
* Environment-induced quantum decoherence has been studied since the mid-eighties by coupling the quantum system to a reservoir.
* Quantum dissipation due to the interaction with chaotic degrees of freedom has also been studied recently.
* The paper numerically investigates the relation between quantum fluctuation, tunneling, and decoherence combined with the delocalization in wave packet dynamics in a one-dimensional double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field.
* The model is described by a Hamiltonian with a polychromatic external field, and the wave packet is initialized as a Gaussian wave packet in the right well.
* The transition probability of finding the wave packet in the left well is calculated as a function of time for various numbers of frequency components and perturbation strengths.

* The text discusses anomalies in quantum field theory, specifically gravitational anomalies, which occur when a symmetry of the action or the corresponding conservation law is violated in the quantized version.
* Physically, there is a difference between external and internal symmetries, with the breakdown of an external symmetry not dangerous for the consistency of the theory, while the breakdown of an internal symmetry (i.e., gauge symmetry) leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory.
* The gauges in gravity are general coordinate transformations (diffeomorphisms), rotations in the tangent frame (Lorentz transformations), or conformal transformations (Weyl transformations).
* In the quantum case, the classical conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor can be broken (Einstein anomaly) or an antisymmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor can exist (Lorentz anomaly) or the trace of the tensor is nonvanishing (Weyl anomaly).
* The anomalies have been found within perturbation theory, and they are local polynomials in the connection and curvature. Authors have calculated these anomalies by various methods, including the heat kernel method, fujikawa's path integral approach, modern mathematical techniques such as differential geometry and cohomology, and topology (index theorems).
* The anomalies are closely related to the so-called Schwinger terms, which show up as additional terms (extensions) in the canonical algebra of the equal-time commutators of the Gauss law operators.
* The text presents a calculation of the gravitational anomalies, specifically the Einstein anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, using the method of dispersion relations, which is a less familiar but very useful approach.
* The purpose of the work is to show that all these anomalous features are easily obtained by the method of dispersion relations, which is an independent and complementary view of the anomaly phenomenon compared to the ultraviolet regularization procedures.
* The paper is organized as follows: it presents the general structure of the considered (pseudo-)tensor amplitude and discusses the Ward identities that need to be studied. It then introduces the dispersion relations for the relevant formfactors of the amplitude and calculates their imaginary parts via the Cutkosky rule. It also works out the t'Hooft-Veltman regularization procedure in detail and compares the several amplitudes with the results of Tomiya and Alvarez-Gaum and Witten.

* The invention provides a system for compensating electromagnetic interfering fields using two real triaxial magnetic field sensors, three pairs of compensation coils, and a control unit.
* The control unit combines the output signals of the two real sensors into three output signals of a virtual sensor using a freely definable kind of averaging.
* The averaging is described by a matrix multiplication, where V is the 6×1 matrix of the output signals of the virtual sensor, M is the 6×6 matrix describing the averaging, and S is the 6×1 matrix of the output signals of the real sensors.
* The output signals of the virtual sensor are used as inputs for independent control loops operating in parallel, which transform the virtual input signals V into modified signals {circumflex over (V)} using a control algorithm described by an operator Ω.
* The matrix {circumflex over (V)} is multiplied by a 6×6 matrix L to obtain control signals for the six coils.
* The algorithm used by the control system is described as O=L·Ω(M·S).
* If the interference field is inhomogeneous, a single actuator coil instead of a pair of Helmholtz coils is used, and M is a 3×6 matrix, and L is a 6×3 matrix.
* If two compensation systems are operated directly beside each other, a 6×6 feedback, or crosscoupling matrix C is used to avoid interferences.

• The filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay, stopping most lawsuits, foreclosures, and other collection activities against the debtor.

* Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
* It consists of a pair of N-terminal motor domains (heads) connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain.
* MyoVa's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms, resulting in 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.
* Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs, stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains.
* Calcium is required to activate MyoVa's ATPase activity, but high calcium (>1 mM) reduces motor processivity and may cause calmodulin dissociation from the lever arms.
* MyoVa can maneuver through actin intersections and travel along actin bundles in vitro, requiring sufficient structural flexibility for the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search.
* The authors used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains.
* TPM involves anchoring a MyoVa-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor.
* The resulting motion of the tethered particle is measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered quantum dot to a stationary, reference quantum dot.

681,"• **Incidence and Importance of Melanoma**: The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing, with an estimated 76,250 new cases in the USA in 2012, and Australia having one of the highest rates in the world. Melanoma is dangerous due to its ability to spread widely via lymphatic and blood vessels.

• **Early Diagnosis**: Early diagnosis of melanoma is crucial for prognosis. Dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that enables visualization of morphological features not discernible by examination with the naked eye.

• **Dermoscopy Techniques**: Various techniques like solar scan, epiluminescence microscopy (ELM), cross-polarization ELM (CPM), and side transillumination (TLM) can enhance morphological details visualized by dermoscopy.

• **Dermoscopy Performance**: Dermoscopy improves diagnostic sensitivity by 10-30% compared to unaided eye examination, but may lower diagnostic accuracy in inexperienced dermatologists.

• **Scoring Systems and Algorithms**: Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve diagnostic performance, such as the ABCD-E rule, seven-point checklist, three-point checklist, and Menzies method. However, they have limitations in reproducibility and within- and between-observer concordance.

• **Automated Analysis of Dermoscopic Images**: There's growing interest in automated analysis of digitized images obtained by ELM techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions.

• **Feature Extraction and Selection**: Important features to extract from melanoma, melanoma in situ, and Clark nevus lesions need to be identified, and effective pattern-classification criteria and algorithms must be found. Feature selection is crucial to reduce the number of features used for classification while minimizing loss of significant information.

• **Classification Techniques**: Various classification techniques can be used for dermoscopic image analysis, including k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific study and its requirements.

• **Performance Evaluation**: Performance evaluation measures like accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) are used to analyze the performance of different classification methods. It's important to consider factors like class imbalance, train/test ratio, and cross-validation when evaluating performance.",1,"{'n_points': 9, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Homology can help predict gene functions, but it's not always accurate as homologs may not have similar functions or mechanisms.
• Domain architectures of proteins can provide clues about their functions, but they don't always predict cellular or phenotypic effects.
• Automated annotation using domains is a short-term measure until more reliable data from high-throughput studies on closely related organisms is available.
• The human genome is currently a relatively featureless landscape, but as more data becomes available, it will become more complex and require a common vocabulary to describe functional characteristics.",1,"{'n_points': 7, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The objective of the study was to develop a prototype to measure the bracket debonding force in vivo and evaluate its bond strength in vitro.
* A plier was modified by adding a strain gauge directly connected to the claw, which was read by an electronic circuit and recorded by software installed on a computer.
* The prototype was calibrated using weights ranging from 0.5 kg to 6 kg, with a simple linear regression analysis applied to adjust the data (r = 0.99).
* The accuracy and precision of the prototype were measured using weights of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 kg, with no significant differences found between two examiners.
* Maximillary central incisor brackets were bonded to bovine teeth using a specific procedure and stored in 100% relative humidity at 37°C for 24 hours.
* The specimens were divided into two groups: one for bracket debonding with the prototype and another for tensile testing in a universal testing machine.
* The mean bond strength obtained with the prototype (2.96 MPa) and the tensile test (3.08 MPa) were statistically similar.
* The adhesive remnant index (ARI) score 3 was predominant in both groups, indicating that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding.

* Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a non-enveloped DNA virus belonging to the family Papillomaviridae, with more than 130 genotypes that can infect mucosal areas of the human upper digestive tract and the anogenital region through sexual contact, leading to an increased risk of developing cancer.
* HPV infection is grouped into high-risk and low-risk types based on the degree of risk of developing cancer after infection. High-risk HPV types are associated with cervical cancer and other mucosal anogenital and head and neck cancers, while low-risk types cause benign or low-grade cervical tissue changes and genital warts.
* HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in sexually active adolescents and young women, with at least 50% of sexually active adults having had a genital HPV infection. Globally, 75% of individuals will experience an HPV infection at least once in their lifetime, with the highest rates occurring in those under the age of 25 years.
* The HPV prevalence in North America and Europe is estimated at 11.5% and 14.2%, respectively, while the prevalence in Africa is estimated at 21.1%, with sub-Saharan Africa topping the list at 24%.
* In Nigeria, the prevalence of HPV is high in all female age groups, with the highest prevalence in women aged 15-23 years. Studies have indicated that high-risk HPV genital infections in young females are transient and have little long-term significance, but when the infection persists, there is a high risk of developing a precancerous lesion of the cervix, which can progress to invasive cervical cancer 15-20 years later.
* Cervical cancer is an important health problem worldwide, being the second most common cancer among women and ranking first in many developing countries. Half a million women develop cervical cancer annually, and more than half die from the disease. In Nigeria, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women aged 15-44 years, with an incidence rate of 27/100,000.
* HPV infection is strongly related to sexual behavior, and the prevalence of HPV increases with increasing number of sexual partners and early sexual debut. In the study conducted in an area where the seroprevalence of HPV had not been reported, HPV IgG antibodies were detected in serum samples from 42.9% of women, indicating a high infection rate in the area.
