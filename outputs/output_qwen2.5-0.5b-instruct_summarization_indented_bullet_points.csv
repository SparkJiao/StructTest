In this paper, we explore the complex behavior of nonlinear statistical mechanical systems, specifically focusing on chaotic deterministic ratchets. We argue that it is crucial to factor out issues of size, location, spread, and transience in computing the ""current"" due to an ensemble before searching for general rules. We propose that bifurcations in single-trajectory behavior often correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system. Current reversals are a special case of this. However, not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation, nor vice versa. The open question is whether these rules are valid or violated near certain bifurcation points. We conclude that it is useful to find general rules of thumb, even if not universally valid, to understand the complicated behavior of non-equilibrium nonlinear statistical mechanical systems.

In the context of colliding plane waves in general relativity, the study of colliding plane waves (CPW) has been known to result in spacelike singularities (CS). These singularities are weakened when the waves are endowed with a relative cross polarization prior to collision. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) have shown that the solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) constitutes an example contrasting this category, namely, it possesses a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity. The stability conjecture proposed by Hellinger and Konkowski (HK) is based on the assumption that the cross polarization and the electromagnetic field are coupled. The stability conjecture correctly predicts that these CS are unstable. However, the same stability conjecture does not find the nature of the CS. The stability conjecture correctly predicts that the CS are unstable, but the same stability conjecture does not find the nature of the CS.

We search for the following particles summarized in Fig. [fig_particles]: axigluons from chiral QCD, excited states of composite quarks, color octet technirhos, new gauge bosons, scalar diquarks, and topgluons. We combine dijet mass spectra above a mass of 150 gev / c, 241 gev / c, 292 gev / c, and 388 gev / c with integrated luminosities of 7.5, 3.3, 3.3, and 69.8 pb, respectively. We use four triggers from run 1a and 1b to combine dijet mass spectra. We take the two highest jets and require that they have pseudorapidity and a CMS scattering angle < 2/3. We determine the qcd background by fitting the data to a smooth function of three parameters. We find upward fluctuations near 200 gev / c, 550 gev / c, and 850 gev / c for narrow resonances. We study the angular distribution of the fluctuation in the mass region 19 gev / c of run 1a data. We compare this to the cross section for axigluons (excluding 5 gev / c of run 1a data) and excited quarks (excluding 5 gev / c of run 1a data). We find that the topgluon is electroweakly produced and decays mainly to the third generation (statistical) with a narrow natural width. We search for the topgluon in the topcolor channel. We find that the topcolor cross section is nt large enough for us to set mass limits at this time. For topgluons, we find that the production cross section is larger, and we are able to exclude at 95% cl topgluons of width 57 gev / c of mass region 60 gev / c of run 1a data.

* The quiet solar corona is heated to temperatures of about 12 million kelvins, while the visible surface is roughly 250 times cooler. Magnetic fields or waves play a key role in heating the solar corona, converting convective energy in the photosphere to thermal energy via magnetic fields or wave energy. The primary energy source for this heating is in the convection zone below the solar photosphere, where there is 100 times as much energy available as required to heat the corona. The debate centers on whether the energy to heat the corona derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events. The coronal heating mechanisms can be classified as either wave or current heating, with wave heating being more likely due to the interaction of magnetic fields with convective flows. The coronal oscillations can be observed using the coronagraph, which is equipped with a fast optical automatic guide, to detect offsets of the actual pointing.

* The standard model of elementary particles (SM) has been very successful in describing the nature at the electroweak (EW) scale. Recently, the Atlas and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle that is consistent with the SM Higgs boson. This discovery strengthens the correctness of the SM. Currently, no explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM has been reported from the LHC. Several groups have reported an anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (μg-2), which has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions (e.g., see [xmath9] and references therein). The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than [xmath10], as listed in Table [tab: g-2]. Although it is too early to conclude that this anomaly is evidence of new physics beyond the SM, we expect new particles and interactions related with the muon sector once we regard it as a hint of new physics. Gauge interactions have been playing a central role in constructing fundamental models in particle physics history. Following this line, in this paper, we propose the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM. The measured μg-2 and the estimated differences from recent SM predictions in several references have been calculated. The most efficient interaction which induces the symmetry violation by the majorana masses is shown in Figure [fig: lambda]. Its rate is given by [xmath32], which is smaller than the hubble scale for [xmath38] gev. From the relation ( [eq: seesaw ] ), one can see that the condition ( [eq: constraint-m] ) is severer than the condition ( [eq: constraint-l] ). Therefore, it is enough to satisfy the condition ( [eq: constraint-l] ) in order for the washout not to occur. With the relation ( [eq: seesaw ] ), the condition is interpreted as [xmath43]. Since the right-handed neutrinos are light and weakly coupled, it is necessary to consider whether they are long-lived. If they are long-lived, they might over-close the universe or destroy the success of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The most important decay channel is given by the diagram shown in Figure [fig: decay of n]. Here, we assume that the [xmath33] is heavier than the right-handed neutrinos and hence",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '*'}"

In recent years, the study of entanglement in quantum multipartite systems has attracted significant attention due to its unique properties in quantum information processing. The essential features and dynamical behavior of entanglement under the ubiquitous decoherence of relevant quantum systems have been extensively investigated. For example, it was found that the entanglement of qubits under the markovian decoherence can be terminated in a finite time, while the entanglement can revive after some time of esd. This phenomenon is detrimental to the practical realization of quantum information processing using entanglement. Surprisingly, some further studies indicated that esd is not always the eventual fate of the qubit entanglement. It was found that the entanglement can revive again after some time of esd, which has been observed in optical systems. The revival entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols, even in some occasions where esd does not happen. The entanglement dynamics has been studied in a double j-c model, where it was found that the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions but an identity (see below) has been satisfied at any time. This result is not surprising since the double j-c model has no decoherence and any initial information can be preserved in the time evolution. However, it would be surprising if the identity is still valid in the presence of decoherence, in which a non-equilibrium relaxation process is involved. In this paper, we show that it is indeed true for such a system consisting of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs.

• The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) in either hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally framed in a two-step process that involves first a hard scattering of partons, followed by the fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron @xcite .
• The first part is calculable in perturbation qcd, while the second part makes use of fragmentation functions that are determined phenomenologically. 
• Such a production mechanism has recently been found to be inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate @xmath2 in heavy ion collisions @xcite . Instead, it is the recombination of partons that is shown to be the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when the soft partons are involved. 
• Although at extremely high @xmath2 fragmentation is still dominant, it is desirable to have a universal description that can be applied to any @xmath2, based on the same hadronization scheme. 
• To achieve that goal, it is necessary that the fragmentation process can be treated as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet. 
• The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and to determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. 
• The subject matter of this work is primarily of interest only to high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons. 
• Semi-hard shower partons initiated by a hard parton can either recombine among themselves or recombine with soft partons in the environment. In the former case, the fragmentation function is reproduced, and nothing new is achieved. 
• It is in the latter case that a very new component emerges in heavy ion collisions, one that has escaped theoretical attention thus far. 
• It should be an important hadronization process in the intermediate @xmath2 region. 
• Our main objective here is to quantify the properties of shower partons and to illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons. 
• The actual application of the shower parton distributions ( spd ) developed here to heavy ion collisions will be considered elsewhere @xcite . 
• The concept of shower partrons is not new, since attempts have been made to generate such partons in pqcd processes as far as is permitted by the validity of the procedure.

• The paper introduces a new method for solving nonconvex semidefinite programming problems, specifically focusing on the spectral abscissa and pseudospectral abscissa optimization problems. The method exploits the convex substructure of the problems and employs a regularization technique to ensure strict descent. The algorithm is shown to be very simple to implement using standard semidefinite programming software tools and no globalization strategy is required. The method is applied to solve several optimization problems arising in static output feedback controller design, including sparse linear static output feedback controller design, spectral abscissa and pseudospectral abscissa optimization, and mixed synthesis problems. The method is shown to be effective and efficient for these problems.

• Cognitive radio networks require efficient use of the scarce spectrum, leading to significant interest in the analysis of cognitive radio systems.
• One possible scheme for the operation of the cognitive radio network is to allow secondary users to transmit concurrently on the same frequency band with primary users as long as the resulting interference power at primary receivers is below the interference temperature limit.
• Note that interference to primary users is caused by the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions, which allows signals to be received by all users within the communication range.
• Note further that this broadcast nature also makes wireless communications vulnerable to eavesdropping.
• The problem of secure transmission in the presence of an eavesdropper was first studied from an information-theoretic perspective in Wyner's work, where he considered a wiretap channel model.
• In recent years, motivated by the importance of security in wireless applications, information-theoretic security has been investigated in fading multi-antenna and multiuser channels.
• For instance, cooperative relaying under secrecy constraints was studied in Pei et al.'s work.
• The collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints in the cognitive radio network is investigated.
• First, the secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (AF) cognitive relay channel is characterized.
• Then, the beamforming optimization problem is formulated as a quasiconvex optimization problem.
• Furthermore, two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes are proposed to reduce the computational complexity.
• The cognitive relay channel with a secondary user source, a primary user, a secondary user destination, an eavesdropper, and relays is depicted in figure [fig:channel].
• The secrecy rate of the destination and eavesdropper is expressed as a function of the interference temperature limit.

• The Maxwell equation was discovered by C. M. Cunningham and B. J. Bateman a century ago, but it was not quantized until the Lorenz gauge was introduced.
• The Lorenz gauge breaks the xmath0 invariance, but this breaking does not bother many people.
• The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the benefits of keeping the fundamental symmetry of xmath0 when quantizing the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces.
• The starting point is the following: a classical xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between two conformally flat spaces, so why not maintain the xmath0-invariance during the quantization process in a conformally flat space?
• Doing so, a free field living in a conformally flat space might behave like in a flat space and the corresponding wightman two-point functions can be related to their minkowski counterparts.
• The work confirms this assertion in the special case of the Maxwell field in de sitter space.
• Indeed, a new and simple two-point wightman function was found and which has the same physical content as the two-point function of Allen and Jacobson.
• This is because the faraday propagator is the same in both conformally flat spaces.
• The present work extends to general conformally flat spaces and clarifies the quantum structure of the formalism developed in C. X. .
• We use the dirac six-cone formalism and realize all conformally flat fields as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space.
• The introduction of auxiliary fields and the use of the gubta-beler quantization scheme are necessary to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field.
• Another important ingredient is the use of a well-suited coordinate system.

In this manuscript, we present analytic results for the triplet model, demonstrating that the dependence of the top quark mass on the top quark mass is logarithmic, while the dependence on scalar masses is quadratic. A dramatic change in the behavior of the top quark mass is observed in the left-right symmetric model, which illustrates the general feature that the scalar mass dependence in radiative corrections becomes logarithmic, contrary to the case of the SM where the scalar mass dependence is quadratic. Therefore, the prediction for the top quark mass in the SM is not consistent with experimental data. We summarize the results of the left-right symmetric model in Appendix [ lrmodel] and show that the prediction for the top quark mass in the SM depends on the top quark mass only logarithmically. In the left-right symmetric model, the prediction for the top quark mass in the SM is weakly dependent on the top quark mass, while in the SM, it is strongly dependent on the top quark mass. The results of the left-right symmetric model also illustrate a general feature that the scalar mass dependence in radiative corrections becomes logarithmic, contrary to the case of the SM where the scalar mass dependence is quadratic. This feature is crucial for the viability of the model.

It is not explicitly discussed in the model with a triplet higgs.

* The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies sets the rate at which galaxies grow and evolve, and is one of the most important measures for understanding the hierarchical build-up of our universe over cosmic time. Large-scale simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high-mass galaxies, and some processes must be stopped or ``quenched'' to prevent the galaxy from growing too big. The answer seems to lie in supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which nearly all massive galaxies harbor in their centers. SMBHs grow through accretion of cold material (AGN) and the huge loss of gravitational energy of the cold material is converted into radiation that is evident across the whole electromagnetic spectrum and manifests itself as a bright point source in the nucleus of galaxies. The AGN can deposit this energy into the ISM of its host galaxy through jets (e.g., * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; *",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"

• The image charge accumulated on the substrate in the vicinity of the molecule alters the addition or removal energy of charge carriers from the molecule.
• A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle ( qp ) description.
• Within the qp picture, one ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons and consequently takes the relative alignment of the metal fermi level, @xmath1 , with either the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) and highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of a molecule as removal energy.
• This effectively corresponds to associate the electron affinity and the ionization potential respectively to the lumo and homo of the molecule.

We have analyzed the total normal and lateral forces acting on one of the colloids, focusing on the universal scaling functions of the many-body contributions to these forces. We have found that the many-body contributions to the normal and lateral forces are significant and exhibit a change of sign at fixed lateral positions of the colloids. This change of sign is likely an artifact of numerical precision and is expected to be a result of substrate-induced changes in the colloids' behavior. We have also calculated the many-body contribution to the normal force acting on the colloids and found that it changes sign for a fixed lateral distance between the colloids. This change of sign implies that the total normal force is zero for a given temperature, suggesting that the sum of pairwise forces provides a reliable description of the interactions of the system. We have compared our results with corresponding ones for quantum electrodynamic casimir interactions and found that the many-body contribution to the total van der Waals force decays with the atom-atom distance for large atom-atom distances. This decay is faster than the decay of the many-body contribution to the normal force, which is slower than the one for the normal ccf. Furthermore, we have found that the many-body contribution to the lateral van der Waals force is repulsive while the corresponding many-body ccf is attractive regardless of the set of bcs. Finally, we have considered the configuration in which the two colloids are vertically aligned with respect to the substrate and have found that the many-body contribution to the normal force is between 10 and 15 times larger than the corresponding many-body contribution to the normal ccf. This suggests that the many-body contribution to the total force is significant and can be used to describe the interactions of the system.

* Spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkalies have benefitted from high precision experimental techniques, allowing for the interpretation of experimental results. Two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy is presented as a tool for studying atomic properties in higher excited states. The method consists of two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapour before being directed to the interaction region. The pump laser modulates the probe laser, creating sub-doppler peaks corresponding to atomic resonances. This technique overcomes the two main inconveniences of direct absorption of the probing laser, low signal-to-noise ratio, and non-availability of detectors at the desired wavelength. The summary concludes with the potential for this method to stimulate studies of atomic properties in excited states and push theoretical work in excited atomic states.

* The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has attracted significant attention in recent years. The main focus is on the central exclusive production (CEP) process, where the protons remain intact and the central system is separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap. Observations of any particle, such as a standard model Higgs boson, in the central exclusive channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers. Furthermore, by detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately, it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products. Because of these unique properties, forward proton detectors should be installed either side of the interaction points of Atlas and/or CMS. The FP420 collaboration has proposed to install detectors in the region 420 meters from the interaction points. These detectors would allow the detection of central systems in the approximate mass range 70 gev. The FP420 collaboration has also proposed to upgrade the capabilities of Atlas and CMS to detect protons in the 220 meters region. These detectors, when used in conjunction with 420 meters detectors, would extend the accessible mass range well beyond 70 gev. In this paper, we focus on the central exclusive production of the standard model Higgs boson and a supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson, with 70 gev. The CEP process is shown schematically in figure [centralexclusive]. For this mass region, the dominant decay channel of the Higgs boson is to decay to the SM Higgs boson, which is very difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches at the LHC because of the large QCD background. This is not the case in central exclusive production due to the selection rule that suppresses the leading order central exclusive cross section by a factor of 14, where m is the mass of the SM di-jet system. As we shall see, this renders the SM Higgs decay channel observable at the LHC in certain scenarios if appropriate proton tagging detectors are installed. The structure of the paper is as follows.

In the context of chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors, the zero-field Hall effect has been observed in the absence of magnetic fields. This effect arises from the spontaneous vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, where the Hall conductivity is nonzero. The vortex dynamics near the transition are characterized by a dip- recouping shape in the Hall conductivity tensor, which is essential for the asymmetry in the Hall effect. The dip- recouping shape is related to the sign change in the Hall conductivity, and the sign reversal in the dip- recouping shape is attributed to the asymmetric angular response of pairs to the driving field. The dip- recouping shape is also related to the convective term in the Fokker-Planck equation, which is essential for the asymmetry in the Hall effect. The sign reversal in the dip- recouping shape is observed in the bound pair dynamics, while the sign reversal in the dip- recouping shape is also observed in the free vortex dynamics.

These findings suggest that galaxy environments are not independent of their properties, with color and luminosity being more fundamental than surface brightness and concentration. The SDSS-2 version has also revealed that galaxy environments are not solely dependent on host halo properties, but also on the host galaxy's mass and environment. The results suggest that galaxy environments are difficult to measure and that their effects on galaxy formation are significant. The SDSS has also provided evidence for the halo model of galaxy formation and semi-analytic models that depend only on the properties of the host halo.

* Transverse spin fluctuations are gapless, low-energy excitations in the broken-symmetry state of magnetic systems possessing continuous spin-rotational symmetry. At low temperatures, they play an important role in diverse macroscopic properties such as the existence of long-range order, magnitude and temperature-dependence of the order parameter, nel temperature, spin correlations, etc. Specifically, in the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter to nearly 1/2 of the classical (HF) value. In two dimensions, the nel temperature is reduced to nearly 1/2 of the mean-field result, for the equivalent quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet (QHAF). Recently, spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies have also been studied in the quantum antiferromagnet. In the random-3 model, where the site density is set to zero on a fraction of sites, lattice-averaged AF order parameter appears to be enhanced for small values, as seen in QMC calculations. The problem of spin vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet is also relevant to electron-doped materials like the AF, where spin-dilution behavior is observed. The problem of magnon energy renormalization due to spin vacancies has been addressed recently, while the method of self-energy corrections has been limited to the low-concentration limit. The rpa approach has been demonstrated earlier to properly interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits for the spin wave velocity. The method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators and is illustrated here for transverse spin correlations. We write the time-ordered, transverse spin propagator for sites x and x' at the rpa level in frequency space as, \[\frac{\chi^0(\omega)}{1-u[\chi^0(\omega)]} = \sum_n \frac{\lambda_n(\omega)}{1-u\lambda_n(\omega)}\] and \[\phi_n^i(\omega_n) = \pm \sum_n \frac{\phi_n^i(\omega_n)\phi_n^j(\omega_n)}{u^2(\frac{d\lambda_n}{d\omega})_{\omega_n}}\] where the collective mode energies \(\phi_n^i(\omega_n)\) are obtained from \(\chi^0(\omega_n)\) and \(\",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '*'}"

In recent years, the study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory has received much attention in various areas of physics, particularly in cosmology. The work has been driven largely by inflation, the most successful known mechanism for explaining the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe and the small-scale inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the universe. The efforts in understanding inflation and its dynamics have redoubled. One area of particular interest is the dynamics of multi-field models of inflation in which the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation. These models can lead to a variety of features unavailable in the case of a single field. Such multi-field scenarios include the hybrid inflation models studied by A. D. Dolgov and A. D. Linde, which involve the coupling of two or more dynamical, interacting scalar fields (or higher spin fields). An important aspect of such systems is the possibility of mixing between the fields. In ref. , for example, the classical inflaton decay is investigated for a two-field model by solving the non-linear equations of motion on a grid. In ref. , the authors treat the problem of coupled quantum scalar and fermion fields at the tree level. Due to the small couplings involved in inflationary cosmology, such a tree level analysis is useful in a variety of physical situations. However, hybrid models as well as the dynamics of reheating typically include processes such as spinodal decomposition and parametric amplification which require one to go beyond the tree level by including quantum effects either in a perturbative expansion or by means of non-perturbative mean field techniques such as the Hartree approximation or a large- n expansion. Going beyond tree level brings in the issue of renormalization. The problem of renormalization of time evolution equations in single field models was understood several years ago. In one of the first papers in this field, cooper and mottola showed in 1987 ( ref. ) that it is possible to find a renormalization procedure which leads to counter terms independent of time and initial conditions of the mean field. They used a wkb expansion in order to extract the divergences of the theory. In a later paper cooper et al. also discussed a closely related adiabatic method in order to renormalize the large n approximation in the large n approximation.

In a recent paper, Li et al. presented a new design for an optomechanical system that consists of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide. The design has several attractive features, including the ability to study reactive effects in optomechanical coupling. The origin of reactive coupling is explained in ref., and the design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state. The paper is organized as follows: in sec. ii, the physical system is introduced and the time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators are given and solved. In sec. iii, the expectation value of the output fields is calculated, and the nonlinear susceptibilities for stokes and anti- stokes processes are obtained. In sec. iv, we discuss normal mode splitting in output fields with or without reactive coupling. We find that there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling, but normal mode splitting occurs in the presence of reactive coupling. We consider the system shown in fig. [ fig1 ] in which a microdisk cavity is coupled to a freestanding waveguide.

In recent years, the melting phase transition of two-dimensional (2D) systems has been extensively studied, with the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Yang (kthny) picture providing a clear understanding of the transition. The kthny theory, which describes the transition as a series of continuous transitions, has been widely accepted. However, recent investigations have shown that the theory is not entirely compatible with experimental observations, particularly in systems with different pair interactions. The kthny theory is criticized for assuming a dilute, unstructured lattice distribution of defects, which is inconsistent with the observed alignment and accumulation of dislocations into small angle domain walls. The kthny theory is also criticized for its inability to describe the thermodynamic equilibration of 2D systems, which is a key aspect of the melting phase transition. The study of the kthny theory has led to the realization that increasing the system size in particle simulations alone may not be sufficient to accurately describe the melting phase transition, as the length of the equilibration period also plays a crucial role in building up or destroying correlations. In conclusion, the melting phase transition of 2D systems remains a subject of ongoing debate, and further research is needed to fully understand this complex phenomenon.

They extend the spectral Liouville equation (SLE) to include colored noises, providing a simple yet general form of quantum dissipative dynamics. The authors also develop a generalized hierarchical equation (GHE) framework to solve the SLE, providing a deterministic simulation method. The GHE is shown to accurately capture the reduced density matrix of the system, and it is demonstrated that it can be used to simulate dissipative quantum dynamics in non-gaussian environments. The authors also consider various examples, including a 50-spin bath and a spin star model, to illustrate the potential of the GHE method.

* The transition from a liquid to an amorphous solid, often associated with a sharp increase in characteristic relaxation times, is a largely unresolved problem in statistical physics. At the experimental level, the so-called glass transition is generally associated with a sharp increase in the characteristic relaxation times of the system, and a concomitant departure from equilibrium. At the theoretical level, it has been proposed that the transition from a liquid to a glassy state is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic (equilibrium) transition. In recent years, alternative theoretical considerations have attempted to establish a connection between glass transition phenomena and the rapid increase in relaxation times that arises in the vicinity of a theoretical critical temperature (mode coupling temperature). In molecular simulations, the value of the nonergodicity parameter (nonergodicity parameters) has been estimated from the time evolution of the partial structure factors, which can be calculated once the partial structure factors and their temperature dependence are sufficiently well known. The estimated value of the nonergodicity parameter from the nonergodicity parameters of the idealized glass transition model is 1000 k, which is consistent with the full mct. The estimated value of the critical temperature from the nonergodicity parameters is 1120 k, which is lower by about 120 k compared to the estimated value from the ergodic liquid regime. The estimated value of the nonergodicity parameters from the diffusion coefficients is 1000 k, which is consistent with the full mct.

* Quantum fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that never vanishes, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources. In 1948, H. B. Casimir predicted that two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum should attract each other with a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation. The plates act as a cavity where only the electromagnetic modes with nodes on both walls can exist. The zero-point energy (per unit area) when the plates are kept at close distance is smaller than when the plates are at infinite separation. The plates thus attract each other to reduce the energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics is receiving considerable attention in the modern literature. The theory has been verified in several high precision experiments, although the investigation has been mainly focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum. Less precise measurements in liquids have been reported, and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids has also been reported.

• The passive p2p worm attack could be mitigated by current patching systems and reputation models.
• The p2p worms can be categorized into two types: passive p2p worms and active p2p worms.

• The passive p2p worm attack could be mitigated by current patching systems and reputation models.
• In this paper, we focus on another serious p2p worm: active p2p worms.
• The active p2p worms could utilize the p2p overlay applications to retrieve the information of a few vulnerable p2p hosts and then infect these hosts, or as an alternative, these worms are directly released in a hit list of p2p hosts to bootstrap the worm infection.
• Since the active p2p worms have the capacity of gaining control of the infected p2p hosts, they could perform rapid topological self-propagation by spreading themselves to neighboring hosts, and in turn, spreading throughout the whole network to affect the quality of overlay service and finally cause the overlay service to be unusable.
• The p2p overlay provides an accurate way for worms to find more vulnerable hosts easily without probing randomly selected ip addresses (i.e., low connection failure rate).
• Moreover, the worm attack traffic could easily blend into normal p2p traffic, so that the active p2p worms will be more deadly than scanning worms.

* The paper explores new methods to compute the couplings of single trace operators in cft at various values of the coupling constant, using integrability techniques and results from previous studies.
* The authors start by presenting generic arguments based on the renormalization of operators when a cft is deformed by a marginal or irrelevant operator.
* These arguments are independent of the value of the coupling at the cft fixed point (a fixed line in the case of cft4 sym).
* To linear order in the deformation parameter, the anomalous dimension matrix is expressed as a function of the coupling.
* The renormalization of operators is performed using the ope expansion between the undeformed theory and the deformed theory.
* The two-point function between operators is shown to be finite, and the coupling between the operators remains diagonal and with the same normalization.
* The renormalization scheme is related to a renormalization matrix with entries z_ab = _ ab + u 2 ^ 2 a_dab.
* The anomalous dimension matrix is the same for the marginal case presented at the end of section 2.
* The callan-symanzik equation is used to include the running of the coupling.
* The renormalized operators are defined starting from the undeformed bare theory.
* The renormalization matrix has entries _ ab = _ ab _ a+ u 2 ^ 2 a_dab.
* The anomalous dimension matrix again has entries given by ( [ deformedh ] ).
* The relation between the entries of the deformed anomalous dimension matrix and the couplings is as for the marginal case presented at the end of section 2.

The paper develops an embedding scheme for the Dirac equation, enabling the solution of the Dirac equation within a limited region i when this region forms part of a larger system, i@xmath102ii. Region ii is replaced by an additional term added to the hamiltonian for region i, and which acts on the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii. The embedding scheme is derived using a trial function in which continuity in the small component across @xmath1 is imposed variationally. Expanding the wave function in a basis set of separate large and small component spinors, the problem of variational collapse is avoided by using a basis satisfying kinetic balance. Calculating the spectrum of a confined hydrogen atom using this embedding scheme is shown to be stable and converge to the exact eigenvalues. The embedding potential is derived and illustrated using the continuum regime of the same confined hydrogen system and an au / ag / au sandwich structure. The non-relativistic embedding scheme has been most widely used, and the discontinuous trial function is not permitted in quantum theory. The embedding scheme places no greater emphasis on a discontinuity in the small amplitude at @xmath1 than on an incorrect ( but continuous ) amplitude elsewhere within the embedded region. It aims merely to optimise the energy of the state, and will retain a discontinuity in the small component if in doing so it can better ( in terms of energy ) approximate the solution inside the embedded region. The discontinuous derivative of the trial function implies a probability current ( and electric current ) that is discontinuous across the embedding surface. This is similarly unphysical, yet numerous applications such as those cited above have demonstrated the utility and accuracy of the method. The embedding potential should be determined at the correct energy, ensuring that the derivative of the wavefunction is continuous across @xmath1. In practice, there have been few calculations using the non-relativistic embedding scheme in which the energies did not coincide. There are a number of aspects of the method which are worthy of further consideration.

They compare the experimental length spectra with the trace formula obtained in ref. and find that the discrepancies between the measured and predicted length spectra are mainly due to systematic errors in the effective index of refraction. The authors propose a modified semiclassical trace formula that accounts for these systematic errors and show that it provides a more accurate description of the resonant frequencies of 3D dielectric cavities.

Numerical simulations using Monte Carlo techniques have been performed to estimate the occurrence of double neutron star (DNS) coalescences and the gravitational stochastic background produced by these events. The coalescence timescale obeys a well-defined probability distribution derived from simulations of massive binaries, indicating a time lag. The maximum probability to form a massive binary occurs at 670 hz (630 hz for DNS1), with an amplitude of about 100 hz (150 hz for DNS1). The low frequency cutoff around 1.2 khz corresponds to the gravitational redshifted wave frequency associated with the last stable orbit of sources located near the coalescence rate. The maximum probability to occur a DNS coalescence is around 96% (94% for DNS1), and the critical redshift corresponds to the condition @xmath8. Sources in the redshift interval @xmath113 (69 for DNS1) produce a popcorn "" noise. The computed signal is below the sensitivity of the first and second generation of detectors. Using the planned sensitivity of third generation interferometers, the cross-correlation of two ego-like coincident antennas gives an optimized signal-to-noise ratio of @xmath151. The popcorn "" contribution is one order of magnitude higher with a maximum of @xmath152 (153 khz) at @xmath153 khz. The spatial and temporal evolution of the events, as well as its signature, can be distinguished from the instrumental noise background and adequate data analysis strategies for its detection are currently under investigation.

1. The paper explores the implications of teleparallel gravity, a theory of gravity based on the Weingarten connection, for the formation of light elements in the early universe, particularly during the radiation-dominated era.
2. Teleparallel gravity, characterized by a Weingarten connection, is shown to be a viable alternative to inflationary models without the use of the inflaton, as well as to effective dark energy models that drive the universe's acceleration.
3. The paper presents three viable teleparallel gravity models, including the power-law, exponential, and square-root exponential models, and examines their implications for the formation of light elements in the early universe.
4. The models are considered viable in literature because they pass basic observational tests and are characterized by two free parameters.
5. The paper uses teleparallel gravity to derive field equations and constraints on the free parameters of the models, and presents results for the primordial abundance of matter and the bBN cosmological constraints.

* In a bidirectional relay network, two users exchange information via a relay node. Several protocols have been proposed for such a network under the practical half-duplex constraint. The simplest protocol is the traditional two-way relaying protocol, which achieves the maximum rate by combining the transmission modes of the relay and the user. The time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol exploits the broadcast capability of the wireless medium and combines the relay-to-user 1 and relay-to-user 2 phases into one phase. The multiple access broadcast (MAB) protocol inverts the transmit and receive phases of the relay and the user, achieving the maximum rate by combining the relay-to-user 1 and relay-to-user 2 phases. The adaptive mode selection and power allocation policy is used to select the transmission mode and transmit powers of the relay. The proposed optimal mode selection and power allocation policy achieves the maximum sum rate in the considered bidirectional network. The simulation results confirm that the proposed protocol outperforms existing protocols.

• The acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated based on measurements of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum at xmath0.
• It should then be possible to measure this ""standard ruler"" scale at low redshifts, for example in large galaxy redshift surveys, and thereby constrain the matter and energy content of the universe at xmath2.
• However, if the cmb measurements were misled by some new physics, e.g. a new undetected relativistic particle, then the misinterpretation could potentially spread to the low-redshift application and bias the inferences.
• Here, we show that the interpretation of the low-redshift acoustic oscillations are robust if the cmb correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
• The actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation; only their ratio matters.
• The result is that even if the physical matter density xmath1 is misinterpreted from the cmb due to undetected relativistic components, the inferences for dark energy from the combined cmb and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged.
• Knowledge of actual densities, e.g. xmath1, translates into improved constraints on the hubble constant xmath2.
• The acoustic peak method depends upon measuring the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination at xmath3.
• Nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination at xmath3.
• The sound horizon integral depends only on the hubble parameter xmath4 and the sound speed xmath5 in the baryon-photon plasma.
• If we assume dark energy is sub-dominant at xmath6, then xmath7 where xmath8 is epoch of matter-radiation equality.
• The sound speed depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and is xmath9 with xmath10.

In deterministic models, the transmission of infectious diseases is typically modeled using a contact rate function that depends on the contact pattern among individuals and the probability of disease transmission. However, network analysis methods can provide more precise insights into the structure of the contact network and its effects on disease spread. Scale-free networks, characterized by a power-law degree distribution, have been used to model the dynamics of epidemics in various contexts, including sexually transmitted diseases and vector-borne diseases. The results of simulations on scale-free networks have shown that the prevalence of diseases can vary significantly depending on the degree distribution and topological structure of the network. In particular, the mb algorithm, which generates directed networks, has been shown to present the lowest prevalence in spreading simulations. The results of simulations on undirected networks have also shown that the mb network has the lowest prevalence, which may be due to its composition and topology. The si and sis epidemic models have been used to simulate the spread of chronic diseases, and the results have shown that the prevalence can reach saturation levels. The results of simulations on directed networks have also shown that the prevalence can be stabilized at a lower level, which may be due to the limitations imposed by the direction of the movements. In summary, network analysis methods can provide valuable insights into the structure of contact networks and their effects on disease spread, and these insights can be applied to various contexts, including sanitary emergencies.

* The paper introduces a generalization of the one-dimensional (1D) parity-time symmetric (PT) nonlinear oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which may be used as fundamental building blocks for the construction of 1D PT-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. The authors propose four basic types of plaquettes, three of which in the form of four-site squares, and the final one in the form of the five-site cross, motivated by earlier work on cross-shaped vortex solitons in the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The analysis of the bifurcation responsible for the termination of the pair of branches was found to be complex, with the bifurcation responsible for the termination of the pair of branches taking a degenerate form. The difference of such modes from the considered 1D PT-symmetric ones was found to be the fact that modes with the unbroken symmetry form a continuous family of solutions with energy, see eq. (e). This feature is shared by 1D PT-symmetric ones, due to the automatic ""balance between the separated gain and loss"". The breaking of the symmetry gives rise to the typical behavior of systems with competing, but not explicitly balanced, gain and loss, which generate a single or several attractors, i.e., isolated solutions with a single or several values of the energy, rather than a continuous family. The difference between continuous families of solutions in conservative models and isolated attractors in their (weakly) dissipative counterparts is already addressed in the relevant literature, as in the very recent work of C. M. Bender and S. Boettcher. The present work may pave the way to further considerations of two-dimensional PT-symmetric lattice systems, and even three-dimensional ones. In this context, the natural generalization is to construct periodic two-dimensional lattices of the building blocks presented here, and to identify counterparts of the modes reported here in the infinite lattices, along with new modes which may exist in that case. The first step that needs to be completed would consist of the examination of a 1D PT-symmetric cube composed of eight sites, and the nonlinear modes that it can support. This, in turn, may be a preamble towards constructing full three-dimensional PT-symmetric lattices. These topics are under present consideration and will be reported elsewhere. </summary>",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"

• The experimental evidence of the theoretically predicted skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric compounds with dzyloshinskii-Moriya interaction has intrigued many scientists over the last years.
• The preparation of thin films of b20 type MnSi on silicon substrates has offered promising prospects with regard to possible applications in future spintronic devices.
• The benefit of thin films compared to bulk material is the existence of the skyrmion phase in an extended region of the magnetic phase diagram due to the uniaxial anisotropy.
• The magnetic ground state of MnGe is a helical spin structure with a helix length between 3 nm at lowest temperatures and 6 nm near 170K.
• The helix axis is due to magnetic anisotropy pinned along the x1001 axis, but rotates into the field direction in an applied field.
• Recent evidence for the existence of skyrmions was provided by small angle neutron scattering experiments.
• The use of Si(111) as substrate offers the opportunity to prepare a seedlayer of MnSi, which realizes the b20 crystal structure for MnGe growth.
• The lattice constant of MnGe within the (111) plane matches that of Si with a misfit of only 2, thus compressively strained MnGe films may be grown on Si(111) substrates.
• In this paper, we show a preparation method for MnGe thin films on Si substrates with the aid of a MnSi seedlayer.
• The structure and morphology of the films have been investigated by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (Rheed), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).
• The Rheed pattern of a 135 MnGe film observed along the x9 direction of the Si substrate indicates two-dimensional film growth.
• The arrangement of the streaks is very similar to the pattern of mnsi thin films, suggesting that MnGe sustains the b20 crystal structure provided by the mnsi seedlayer.
• The uniformity of the intensity of the detected streaks implies a flat surface of a size comparable to the area contributing to the Rheed pattern of around 100 nm in diameter.
• The thinest film of 45 thickness [fig : afm](a) consists of islands with a typical diameter of 100 nm separated by valleys of similar size.

In this study, we investigate the properties of the layered organic material 3 (AI3), which has been studied since the 1980s. The material exhibits low-energy Dirac fermions under hydrosatic pressure, which is different from graphene. The average fermi velocity is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that in graphene. The temperature dependence of the carrier densities, including thermopower measurements, corroborates the two-carrier scenario. The magneto-transport measurements reveal high mobility Dirac carriers and low mobility massive holes, indicating the relevance of electronic correlations. Additionally, the theoretical analysis suggests that both massive and Dirac carriers coexist in the pressure range of interest. The results suggest that both massive and Dirac carriers are present even at high pressures, with the coexistence of massive and Dirac carriers being a key feature of the material's behavior.

Massive stars play a fundamental role in driving the energy flow and material cycles that influence the physical and chemical evolution of galaxies. Despite receiving much attention, their formation process remains enigmatic. Observations have revealed that massive stars can form via accretion (similar to low-mass stars) or through mergers of intermediate-mass stars. Advances in instrumentation have enabled sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at wavelengths less affected by large column densities of material that obscure regions at shorter wavelengths. Recent observations have uncovered the environment surrounding individual massive protostellar systems, including the presence of keplerian disks around four massive young stellar objects. High-resolution observations point toward an accretion formation scenario for massive stars. Further discrimination between the two competing models is possible by examining the properties of young stellar populations and the morphology of hot molecular cores. The spatial resolution of the observations is too low to resolve the sources inside clumps. The astrometric uncertainty in the vla images is significant, and the standard deviation in the flux of standards is 7.4, 3.1, 4.4, 2.4, and 9% for the four n-band and 18.5 @xmath0 m filters, respectively.

• Modified gravity models, such as those involving curvature and matter coupling, have gained attention due to their potential to explain cosmic expansion and evolution.
• The basic ingredient responsible for this tremendous change in cosmic history is some mysterious type force dubbed as dark energy, which has motivated many researchers to unveil its hidden characteristics.
• Modified gravity approaches, established by adding or replacing curvature invariants and generic functions in the Einstein-Hilbert action, have been considered as promising and optimistic scenarios among other proposals.
• These modified theories are established by replacing curvature invariants with generic functions and adding or replacing them with curvature invariants.
• The modified theories are based on the concept of a Ricci scalar, which is a quadratic curvature invariant.

Quantum entanglement in the context of quantum information processing is a feature of quantum mechanics that has captured much recent interest due to its essential role in quantum information processing. It may be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization, and it obeys a set of conservation laws. It proves useful in making quantitative predictions to quantify entanglement. When one has complete information about a bipartite system, subsystems with a well-established measure of entanglement are pure and there exists a well-established measure of entanglement, evaluated as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix, with a unity for the bell states and a conserved under local operations and classical communication. Unfortunately, quantum systems in nature interact with their environment; states of practical concern are therefore mixed, in which case the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear. Given an ensemble of pure states, a natural generalization of the weighted average is its conditional average. A difficulty arises when one considers that a given density operator may be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for this average entanglement. Various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem, most of which evaluate a lower bound. One such measure, the entanglement of formation, is defined as the minimal amount of entanglement required to form the density operator, while the entanglement of distillation is the guaranteed amount of entanglement that can be extracted from the density operator. These measures satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure set out by Horodecki et al. They give the value zero for the bell states, which might be thought somewhat counterintuitive, since this state can be viewed as representing a sequence of random ""choices"" between two bell states, both of which are maximally entangled. This is unavoidable, however, because assigning a non-zero value of entanglement would imply that entanglement can be generated by local operations. The problem is fundamental, stemming from the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state: the state provides an incomplete description of the physical system, and in view of the lack of knowledge, definitive measures of entanglement cannot be given. An interacting system and environment inevitably become entangled. The problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system is one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment. Complicating the situation, the state of the environment is complex and unknown. Conventionally, the partial trace with respect to the environment is taken, yielding a mixed state",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

The study suggests that the jets could inflate bubbles of hi gas, which could then be blown out by the jets, creating superhot bubbles of neutral hydrogen gas. The study also suggests that the jets could be responsible for the formation of radio cores, which are expected to decay faster than the jets. The study concludes that the jets could be responsible for the formation of hi supershells, and that the jets could be responsible for the formation of radio cores.

The study examines the stellar population characteristics of Leo I, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, using high-resolution color images obtained with the HST. The analysis reveals that Leo I has a broad ms turnoff region and a wide rc, indicating extended star formation from at least 1015 Gyrs ago to less than 1 Gyrs ago. The absence of obvious discontinuities in the ms turnoff region suggests a continuous star formation activity with possible intensity variations over time, but no big time gaps between successive bursts. The presence of a conspicuous hb is not seen in the cmd, indicating that the fraction of stars older than 10 Gyrs is small, suggesting that star formation may have been delayed in Leo I compared to other dsph galaxies. The study also highlights the unique characteristics of Leo I, including its morphology and lack of detectable hi, classifying it as a dsph galaxy. The analysis of synthetic cmds will provide quantitative information about the strength of star formation at different epochs, and further observations are needed to characterize the variable star population in Leo I, particularly to search for rr lyrae variable stars. The determination of the strength of star formation in Leo I at different epochs is important to assess whether it is possible that during intervals of high star formation activity, Leo I would have been as bright as the faint blue galaxies observed at intermediate redshifts. Additionally, the duration of such a major event of star formation may be important in explaining the number counts of faint blue galaxies. The study aims to understand the formation and evolution of Leo I, as well as to address questions about the epoch of galaxy formation and the evolution of galaxies of different morphological types.

• The paper explores the use of unsupervised learning algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), to identify phase transitions in physical systems, particularly in condensed matter physics, by leveraging the nonlinearity induced by radial basis functions kernels. PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of data, while kPCA is used to capture nonlinear relationships between latent variables. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods by applying them to the ising model and the xy model, showing that they can accurately identify phase transitions without any knowledge of the underlying physical theory or order parameter. The results suggest that the latent parameters, which encode correlations on each input sample, are the most informative for distinguishing between ordered and unordered phases. The paper also explores the use of reconstruction loss as a universal parameter for phase transitions, which can be used to infer the position of phase transitions in models with continuous symmetries. The authors conclude that unsupervised learning can be a promising approach for identifying order parameters in systems where they are difficult to identify, and that the latent parameters can be used as a universal identifier for phase transitions. The paper also highlights the importance of understanding the latent parameters in the context of phase transitions, as they can provide insights into the underlying structure of the system.

Quantum cloning machines (QCMs) are a type of quantum computing device that can be used to clone quantum states. QCMs can produce identical copies of the initial state, non-identical copies, and can be used for eavesdropping on quantum channels. The main difference between QCMs and classical eavesdropping is that QCMs can only copy a specific part of the quantum state, while classical eavesdropping can copy the entire state. QCMs can be used for eavesdropping on quantum channels, but they are not suitable for classical eavesdropping. The main goal of QCMs is to produce states that are closest to the initial state, which can be used for eavesdropping on quantum channels. The fidelity of the QCMs is defined as the square of the difference between the initial and final states, and it is calculated for states on the real part of the Bloch sphere. The parameters of the QCMs are calculated using the average of the distance between the initial and output states, and the fidelity of the QCMs is calculated using the average of the distance between the initial and output states. The fidelity of the QCMs is calculated for different sets of states and is not unique, but the output state produced by the QCM does not depend on this non-uniqueness. The QCMs are used for eavesdropping on quantum channels, but they are not suitable for classical eavesdropping.

• The nature of dark matter remains one of the outstanding questions of modern astrophysics.
• The success of the cold dark matter cosmological model (with ""dark energy"" now required) argues strongly for a major component of the dark matter being in the form of an elementary particle.
• However, the inventory of baryons which we can observe locally falls far short of the total inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations, leaving open the possibility that there may be a significant baryonic component of dark matter.
• Furthermore, although the cold dark matter cosmological model is very successful in describing the growth of structure in the universe on large scales, we still lack a direct detection of any of the candidate dark matter particles.
• Lack of this decisive piece of observational evidence leaves some authors proposing models which include a large component of baryonic dark matter.
• In particular, there have been many papers dealing with the possibility that cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds constitute a major component of the dark matter.
• A variety of different forms, including isolated, clustered, and fractal, have been considered for the clouds, but all proposals involve dense gas of high column density, in contrast to the diffuse gas in the interstellar medium which is easily detected in emission and/or absorption.
• One of the fundamental predictions of a model featuring dense gas clouds is the gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray interactions within the clouds.
• Because of the potentially large total mass of gas involved, this process may yield a diffuse flux in the galactic plane comparable to the flux from known sources for photon energies around 1 gev.
• Considering the high quality data on diffuse emission acquired by the egret detector aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, it is worth considering this source of gamma-ray emission in detail as it is possible to use these data to constrain the dark matter models (see, e.g., @xcite; @xcite).
• Most previous investigations of this problem have neglected the self-shielding and cascade phenomena which can be important at high column densities.
• These effects alter the emergent gamma-ray spectrum, and we note that this could be relevant to the observed excess galactic flux above 1 gev.
• We have noted elsewhere @xcite that massive ( @xmath4 ) aggregates of dense gas clouds could potentially account for many of the unidentified discrete sources detected by the egret.
• Here we present detailed calculations of the gamma-ray spectra arising from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds.

* Colloidal suspensions present the possibility to develop novel materials via self-assembly. Colloidal crystals, whose optical properties can generate iridescent colours, provide a means by which photonic crystals may be produced. Further applications range from lasers to display devices, with recent advances demonstrating tunable colours through control of lattice spacing with an external field. Further to the practical importance of colloidal crystals, their well-defined thermodynamic temperature allows colloidal dispersions to be viewed as mesoscopic ` model atoms'. Recently, the ability to tune the colloid-colloid interactions has led to the observation of a wide variety of structures. Of particular interest here, to first order ac electric fields can induce dipolar interactions between the colloidal particles, leading to anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures, some of which are not observed in atomic and molecular systems. External control of the colloid-colloid interactions allows direct observation of phase transitions. Furthermore, direct microscopic observation at the single-particle level allows an unprecedented level of detail to be accessed. The introduction of a rotating ac field opens up even more possibilities. In this case, the dipolar interactions lead to an attraction in the plane of rotation and to repulsions above and below. Studies with a rotating magnetic field on granular matter indeed produced disc like patterns consistent with expectations. Unlike granular matter, since colloidal dispersions exhibit brownian motion, thermodynamic equilibrium structures (ie crystals) may be obtained. In previous work snoswell _ et_. _ _ showed that lattice spacing within quasi-2d colloidal crystals could be controlled in - situ. The interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field may be treated to first order as a circularly symmetric attraction, due to the time averaging effect of a rapidly rotating field (1000hz) on relatively large particles on the micron lengthscale, where the diffusive timescale is of the order of seconds. In considering the interactions between the particles, the asymmetry between the colloids (10nm-1@xmath0 m) and smaller molecular and ionic species must be addressed. A number of coarse-graining schemes have been developed where the smaller components are formally integrated out. This generates a one-component picture, where only the effective colloid-colloid interactions are considered, and the complexity of the description is vastly reduced. The equilibrium behaviour of the colloids in the original multi-component system may then be faithfully reproduced by appeal to liquid state theory and computer simulation.

In the 1970s, many-body theory flourished, with much attention paid to the many-body effects on xps spectra from deep core levels in metals. Related effects were singularities that appeared near edges in absorption and emission spectra. The cb electrons can have many different effects on the xps peak from the core level. If the excitation was considered adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by the cb electrons led to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy (lower binding energy of the core level). The cb electrons were shaken up and left in a nonequilibrium state. This is analogous to the case of a cork floating in a glass of water. The water waves correspond to plasmons, collective excitations of the cb electrons. The shake-up effects showed up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum.

3. The phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods.
4. The foundations of the phase-field method and its application to solidification have been the subject of several recent review articles @xcite .
5. Several topics are discussed where robust phase-field modelling tools are not yet available because some fundamental questions remain open.
6. In sec. 2, the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models is examined, and it is shown that the currently available approaches can not in general eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness.
7. In sec. 3, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification are discussed, and it is shown that the standard equation of motion usually written down for the orientation field is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
8. Finally, in sec. 4, the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is reviewed, and it is shown that the standard approach can not be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
9. The common point of these topics is that they pose challenges or limitations for straightforward computations.
10. Indeed, a characteristic feature of the phase-field method is that its equations can often be written down following simple rules or intuition, but that their detailed properties ( which have to be known if quantitative simulations are desired ) become only apparent through a mathematical analysis that can be quite involved.
11. Therefore, it is not always easy to perceive the limits of applicability of the method.

14. Phase-field models are rooted in the mean-field description of spatially diffuse interfaces by order parameters.

* The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied for several decades and recently has attracted renewed attention due to the particular importance in biology. DNA loops are crucial for genetic expression, replication, and recombination. The loop formation is a basic process that underlies genetic expression, replication, and recombination. The loop formation is influenced by various factors, including static and temporal fluctuations in tension. The study of semiflexible polymers using Brownian dynamics simulation provides detailed information on the loop formation. The results suggest that the static and temporally fluctuating tensions play a crucial role in regulating the loop formation. The study also indicates that the loop formation rate is not proportional to the loop size alone but depends on the free energy barrier for loop formation.

* The paper discusses the impact of stellar evolution on the dynamical interactions between a star and a point source, focusing on the tidal interactions and their effects on the orbital evolution of planets. The authors consider three types of stars with masses of one, one, and half a solar mass, and analyze the evolution of their stellar structures and properties. They find that the tidal interactions significantly affect the orbital evolution of planets, leading to the possibility of their falling onto the star. The authors also discuss the impact of stellar evolution on the dynamical tides and the formation of the stellar structure. The results are quantitatively analyzed and compared with previous studies.

The state is characterized by a triangular network of edge states, where each valley has two edge states per spin. The state is protected by no valley mixing, electron number conservation, and time reversal (T) symmetry. This discovery opens the possibility of topological quantum phase transitions in graphene, where the edge states are topologically protected and can be used for device applications.

* The problem of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2d) has attracted increasing interest in recent years. It is stimulated by the spectacular proposals for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases at the 3d free space. The recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in the confined geometry of optical traps has opened up ways to realize these phenomena. The method of developing a quantitative analysis of the 2d quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer has been proposed. The method is based on the method suggested in @xcite for the few-dimensional scattering which was successfully applied to the dipole-dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in the 3d free space. The key elements of the method are described in section ii. In section iii, the method is applied to the 2d scattering on the cylindrical potential with the elliptical base and the 2d dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles. The results of the analysis are presented in the form of the threshold formula for the scattering amplitude on the cylinder potential with the circular base and the results of the 2d scattering of polarized dipoles. The method has been found to be efficient in all problems considered. The last section contains the concluding remarks.

• The Kauffman model is a disordered dynamical system proposed by Kauffman in 1969, which attracted the interest of physicists in the 1980s due to its analogy with the disordered systems studied in statistical mechanics, such as the mean field spin glass.
• The dynamical phase transition was found and studied in the framework of mean field theory. In this and in the next paper, we deal with some structural properties of the networks that determine their attractors.
• The relevant elements of the networks were introduced by flyvbjerg and kjaer, and their probability distribution was studied.
• The modular organization of random boolean networks was already suggested by Kauffman, and it was used by flyvbjerg and kjaer to study the attractors in Kauffman networks.
• The interest of this approach is that some consequences about the statistical properties of the attractors can be directly drawn.
• The study of the relevant elements is complementary to this approach, and we sketch the lines of a new approximation scheme that works better in the frozen phase and on the critical line.
• This region in parameter space is the most interesting one, since, according to Kauffman, it reproduces some features of real cells, and is also the less understood, since neither approximate computations nor simulations give a precise picture of the properties of the attractors for systems of large size.
• The approach is complementary to the one used in Kauffman's paper, which computed the properties of the attractors in the annealed approximation.
• The results are postponed to our following paper, concerning the modular organization of the relevant elements on the critical line.
• The model is defined as follows: we consider a set of @xmath1 elements @xmath5 and we associate to each of them a binary variable @xmath6. In the biological interpretation proposed by Kauffman, each element of the network represents one gene and the binary variable @xmath7 represents its state of activation.
• The control elements are chosen in @xmath14 with uniform probability, and the response functions are extracted at random, and it is believed that the properties of the model do not depend on the details of their distribution.

Recently, a new trend in turbulence study in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates has been observed, which is turbulence in multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates. The spectrum of the kinetic energy in these systems shows a Kolmogorov spectrum, indicating the presence of nonlinear spin terms. The Kolmogorov spectrum in sst can be generated by nonlinear spin terms, suggesting that the Kolmogorov spectrum in sst is generated by nonlinear spin terms. The spectrum of the kinetic energy in sst can also be described by a spin-dependent interaction energy, indicating that the kinetic energy in sst can be described by a spin-dependent interaction energy.

* We address the above questions through an explicit calculation of the fermi surface topology in the framework of the kondo lattice model (klm). In its simplest form, the klm describes an array of localized magnetic moments of spin, arising from atomic orbitals coupled antiferromagnetically (af) via the exchange interaction (ex) to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons. We present detailed dynamical cluster approximation (dca) calculations aimed at investigating the klm ground state. For simulations within the magnetically ordered phase, we have extended the dca to allow for symmetry breaking antiferromagnetic order. The klm excludes charge fluctuations on the atomic orbitals and thus a strict constraint of one electron per localized atomic orbital is included. We introduce a next-nearest neighbor hopping with matrix element (ex) to give a modified dispersion (ex) -2 t ' \left [ \cos(k_{x}+k_{y} ) + \cos(k_{x}-k_{y})\right] . As we will see, the suppression of particle-hole symmetry due to a finite value of (ex) leads to dramatic changes in the scaling of the quasi-particle gap at low values of (x) and at half-band filling. We have considered the value (ex). This choice guarantees that the spin susceptibility of the host metallic state at small dopings away from half-band filling is peaked at wave vector (x). Thus, antiferromagnetic order as opposed to an incommensurate spin state is favored. To solve the model, we have used the dca approach which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the kondo effect but neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size. The standard formulation of dca is naturally translationally invariant. To measure orders beyond translation invariance, we have generalized to lattices with a supercell containing (x) unit cells of the original lattice. The reduced brillouin zone (rbz) is then spanned by (x) and (y) and we have set the lattice constant to unity. This supercell as well as the rbz (also coined magnetic brillouin zone (mbz)) are plotted in fig. (fig1). The self-energy and green function are to be understood as spin dependent matrix functions, with an index for the unit cell within the supercell as well as an orbital index for the x and y-orbitals in each unit cell.

• The discovery of a resonance at 125 gev compatible with the expectations for the Higgs particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) represents a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles.
• This discovery has implications for the other subfield in which mass has a pivotal role, specifically gravitation, and is particularly relevant in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
• Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature may be beneficial for having the Higgs responsible for inflation, and as a suppression mechanism for dark energy expected from quantum fields at the LHC.
• The analysis of the white dwarf BPM 27606 provides bounds on the gravitational interaction of the Higgs boson from the LHC experiments, and the results suggest that the presence of a strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles such as the electron.
• The analysis of the white dwarf Procyon B also provides bounds on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant, and the results suggest that the presence of nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature adds to the inertial mass of fundamental fermions, acting as a mass renormalization due to curved spacetime.
• The results from the analysis of the white dwarf BPM 27606 and Procyon B provide a reliable anchor to study possible shifts in the bandheads due to the electron mass shift induced by the Higgs field, and the stability of the vibrational transitions is further assured by their insensitivity to pressure-induced shifts.
• The stability of the vibrational transitions is further assured by their insensitivity to pressure-induced shifts, and the magnetic field on the surface of the white dwarf is estimated to be around 6.750 k and 3.000 m, which makes negligible any correction to the estimates above.

• The white dwarf (WD) stars represent the end points of stellar evolution for all low-mass stars, and are the fate of more than 97% of all stars in our galaxy.
• Roughly 80% of WDs belong to the spectral class DA, with atmospheres dominated by hydrogen @xcite.
• When DA WDs cool to the appropriate temperature to foster a hydrogen partial ionization zone, they begin their journey through the ZZ ceti instability strip, where global pulsations are driven to observable amplitudes and fundamental parameters can be determined using asteroseismology (see reviews by @xcite, @xcite, and @xcite).
• Aside from their variability, the ZZ ceti stars discovered to date appear to be otherwise normal WDs, and are therefore believed to be a natural phase in the evolution of all DA WDs.
• Higher-quality optical and UV spectra have also moved some of these non-variable interlopers out of the instability strip @xcite.
• Thus, it is currently believed that the ZZ ceti instability strip is pure, and that all DA WDs will at some point pass through it and pulsate.
• Much work has been devoted to observationally mapping the ZZ ceti instability strip, which runs in temperature from roughly @xmath11 k for standard @xmath4 = 8.0 wds @xcite.
• There is also a dependence on surface gravity, such that WDs with lower pulsation amplitudes at 1.1 @xmath1  and below 0.5 @xmath1  surface gravity pulsate at lower effective temperatures.

• The paper presents a fast and efficient method to calculate inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic fermi gas model (rfg). The method, called the frozen nucleon approximation, is based on the assumption that the momenta of the initial nucleons can be neglected for high enough values of the momentum transfer. This approximation is useful for computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators. The method is validated by comparing the results with exact calculations and numerical simulations.
• The paper also explores the validity of the frozen nucleon approximation by including the electroweak meson-exchange current ( mec ) model of @xcite. The authors find that the presence of virtual delta excitations requires the introduction of a ""frozen"" propagator, designed by a convenient average over the fermi sea. The main advantage of the frozen approximation is that it reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 (full calculation) to 1. This approach is well-suited for computing the 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux and can be of great help in implementing the 2p-2h models in the Monte Carlo codes currently available.
• The plan of this work is as follows: in section [sec_form], the formalism of neutrino scattering and the frozen approximation approach are reviewed. In section [sec_results], the nucleon frozen approximation is validated by computing the 2p-2h response functions and comparing with the exact calculation.

• The broad emission iron lines are well-known features in active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating from the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc. Spin plays a crucial role in their formation, especially for the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc. The relativistic disc spectral line models, including the laor model, have been used to evaluate the spin of black holes. The spin is estimated from the lower boundary of the broad line, and the comparison of the laor and model is shown in the right panel of Figure 1. The spin is overestimated for higher quality data, and the discrepancies in the overall shape of the line are more visible for lower values of the spin. The rebinning of data with respect to instrumental energy resolution is crucial for obtaining statistically relevant results.

* The ste-quest mission is a medium-sized mission candidate for launch in 2022/2024 in the cosmic vision programme of the European Space Agency. It aims to study the cornerstones of Einstein's equivalence principle, including the local position-invariance, local Lorentz-invariance, and weak equivalence principle, in a combined mission. The mission will use advanced atomic clocks and atom interferometers to measure the gravitational redshift of the Earth and the sun, respectively. The mission will also test the universality of free fall using cold atom interferometry. The ste-quest payload will include two atomic clocks and an atom interferometer, as well as equipment for precise orbit determination and microwave time and frequency links. The mission is designed to probe the foundations of Einstein's equivalence principle by performing measurements to test its three cornerstones, including local position-invariance, local Lorentz-invariance, and weak equivalence principle, in a combined mission. The mission is expected to provide valuable insights into the nature of gravity and the laws of physics.

In this study, we present a full-scale numerical simulation of the propagation of an electromagnetic wave into the ionosphere. The wave propagates through the neutral atmosphere, reaching the ionosphere at different altitudes. We observe reflection of the l-x and r-x modes at different altitudes, and the mode conversion of the l-x mode into electrostatic Langmuir / upper hybrid waves. We also observe nonlinear harmonic generation of the high-frequency waves. The simulation results suggest that these interactions are complex and involve weak and strong em turbulence, as well as harmonic generation. The results are quantitative and can be used to study hf-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level. The simulation is based on a full-scale model and uses a numerical technique with a high computational capacity. The results are presented in a detailed manner, with figures and tables to support the analysis. The study provides a valuable tool for understanding the complex behavior of plasma turbulence in the ionosphere.

* The mott-hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid mott-insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. Recent suggestions to experimentally observe this transition in optical lattices have rekindled interest in the mott-insulator transition and triggered a great deal of theoretical and experimental activity. Possible applications include the use of a mott state of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice as a starting point for creating controlled multiparticle entanglement as an essential ingredient for quantum computation. The mott-insulator quantum phase transition is driven by the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy. Perturbation theory has been used to study this model analytically and numerically, with the gutzwiller mean-field ansatz and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method being used to improve the wavefunction. The key parameter in the system is the ratio of the onsite energy and the bandwidth, which forms the key parameter in the system. In optical lattices, this parameter can be easily controlled and varied by several orders of magnitude, enabling detailed studies of the quantum phase transition. Probing the system by taking absorption pictures to image the expansion patterns yields information about the momentum distribution of the state. The essential physics of trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic mott-hubbard model describing the competition between hopping and on-site interaction. A number of approximation schemes have been used to study this model analytically and numerically, using approaches like the gutzwiller mean-field ansatz, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), exact diagonalization (ED), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). In this article, we study the short-range correlations, not included by the gutzwiller ansatz, by using perturbation theory. The main purpose is to find corrections to the short-range behavior of the one-particle density matrix, which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns. These patterns are important for determining the location of the insulator-superfluid transition. We note that in the insulating state, our perturbative approach is identical to that used in @xcite (see also @xcite ), although there the goal was different, viz., studying corrections to the phase diagram. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: in section [modsec], we will introduce the model and its mean-field solution. The",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '*'}"

In the context of cosmology, scalar field matter models have been studied extensively, particularly in the context of inflation and late-time acceleration. Scalar fields arise naturally from compactifications of higher-dimensional theories, such as string or M-theory. The type of scalar field potential obtained in these compactifications is sufficiently restrictive that until recently it was considered difficult to get accelerating cosmologies. However, the existence of an accelerating phase in a hyperbolic universe obtained by compactification has been noted, and non-perturbative effects in M-theory have shown that unstable de-sitter vacua can lead to transient acceleration. The transient acceleration in these models is easily understood as the positive scalar field potential that both hyperbolic and flux compactifications produce in the effective, lower-dimensional action. This perspective also makes clear the generic nature of transient acceleration. For any realistic application, the lower-dimensional spacetime must be four-dimensional, but for theoretical studies, it is useful to consider a general six-dimensional spacetime. Assuming that we have gravity, described by a metric, coupled to scalar fields with a riemannian target space with metric, the effective action must take the form * where * is the ricci scalar.

In the extensive search for very wide, common proper motion companions to nearby Hipparcos stars, we identified an optically faint and red star, lspm j2322 + 7847, which was subsequently identified as a candidate for a nearby low-mass dwarf. The original identification of this star as having significant proper motion traces to Luyten (1967), where it was reported as a magnitude 17 object with a mas  yr@xmath8  at a position angle of 10.5 and assigned the name lp12 - 90. The present paper presents new photometry of Hip 115147, its known visual companion Hip 115147b, and lspm j2322 + 7847, and obtains preliminary trigonometric parallax astrometry for the latter companion. The estimated uncertainties in the lspm j2322 + 7847 measures are 10 mag in the case of lspm j2322 + 7847 and 0.04 mag for Hip 115147 components, where the short exposure times introduced additional error from scintillation and shutter timing. The August 2005 photometry indicated that lspm j2322 + 7847 was most likely an m-dwarf at approximately the same distance as Hip 115147, which was added to the trigonometric parallax program at the USNO S Flagstaff Station.

In recent years, cosmological observations have provided strong evidence that the universe is flat and its energy density is dominated by dark energy, which is negative pressure and causes cosmic expansion to accelerate. To clarify the origin of dark energy, one has tried to understand the connection of dark energy with particle physics. In a dynamical model proposed by Fardon, Nelson, and Weiner (Mavans), relic neutrinos could form a negative pressure fluid and cause cosmic acceleration. The acceleron, which sits at the instantaneous minimum of its potential, interacts with neutrinos through a new scalar force. The neutrino mass is given by the acceleron, which depends on its number density and changes with the evolution of the universe. The neutrino mass evolves with the neutrino mass, and the equation of state parameter also evolves with the neutrino mass. Typical examples of the potential have been discussed in ref. and ref. The variable neutrino mass was considered at first in ref. and was discussed for neutrino clouds ref.

The quark gluon plasma (QGP) phase transition is characterized by the liberation of quarks and gluons from hadrons, typically occurring at low baryon densities. The phase transition is characterized by the formation of a new state of matter, the quark-gluon liquid (QGL), which is asymptotically free.

The paper presents a study of purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in three-dimensional space. It begins by reviewing the Jones polynomial and its properties, then defines a knot invariant called the lescop invariant for rational homology spheres. The lescop invariant satisfies a crossing change formula, which allows it to be extended to a finite type invariant. The paper then uses this invariant to prove the cosmetic surgery conjecture for all knots with no more than 3 crossings. The main results include a sufficient condition for a knot to admit no purely cosmetic surgery, which is based on the jones polynomial and its skein relation. The paper also provides explicit formulas for the invariant and applies the results to the cosmetic surgery problem for two-bridge knots and whitehead doubles. The cosmetic surgery conjecture is shown to be true for all knots with no more than 3 crossings, except possibly for genus 2 knots. The results are presented in a simplified way from a more natural perspective, making them easier to understand.

• Hypercharged anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (HCAMSB) models have been explored at the LHC, characterized by a well-recognized problem of slepton mass-squared parameters being negative, leading to tachyonic states. The HCAMSB model is a string motivated scenario that uses a similar setup to the Mamsb model, with a hidden sector localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, separated from the visible sector by a separate brane. The model's soft SUSY breaking terms arise from rescaling anomalies, and the parameter space is given by m_0, m_3/2, sign(x), where m_0 is the minimal amsb model's mass, m_3/2 is the hidden sector's mass, sign(x) is the sign of the gaugino mass, and x is the gaugino mass. The model is distinguished from the Mamsb model by the presence of a wino-like state, which is dominant in the visible sector. The model's mass ordering is such that the wino-like state is more likely to be dominant in the visible sector compared to the hidden sector.

Darboux transformations allow for the construction of exactly solvable potentials.

In the context of the survey described, the authors highlight significant discrepancies between the spectroscopic and radio observations of the submm sources. The spectroscopic redshift distribution is inconsistent with the redshifts predicted by the galform semi-analytic model, suggesting that the redshifts derived from the radio observations may be higher than those claimed by the survey. This raises questions about the reliability of the radio observations and the potential contamination of the data by spurious or artificially bright sources. The authors also note that the radio observations may be biased against sources with high redshifts, which could only be detected at 1.2 mm. The authors conclude that the radio observations are needed to identify the true far-IR luminous sources within these frequently morphologically complex and crowded fields, which are amenable to study via radio-selected samples. The survey's results support the conclusions of the authors, who model their incompleteness and estimate only a small shift in the median redshift as a result. The authors also note that the dual-wavelength extraction performed here could potentially bias the sample against very high redshift sources, which would only be detected at 1.2 mm.

The authors present a detailed analysis of the norris local and field galaxy lfs, comparing them to the lfs of the corona borealis and a background supercluster. They find that the evolution of the field galaxy lf is limited to the population of blue, star-forming galaxies, and that the population of blue galaxies becomes more luminous with increasing redshift. The authors also discuss the differences between the norris and lcrs local lfs, which are consistent with the results of previous surveys. They present evidence for the presence of a steep faint-end slope in the lcrs local lf, which is consistent with the results of previous studies.

In recent years, rapidity gaps, which are pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at the HERA and Tevatron colliders. These gaps are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state, and the survival probability of rapidity gaps. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without soft interactions between other partons in the scattering hadrons. The two- and three-gluon exchange models predict a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon initiated processes compared to the two- and three-gluon exchange approximation. The unitarized two- and three-gluon exchange models are capable of fitting the present Tevatron data, but the formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence and its ubiquity asks for a theoretical explanation within QCD. The unitarization of hard elastic quark and gluon scattering is not unique, but any acceptable method must preserve the successful description of hard dijet events by perturbative QCD. The phase shift approach used here fulfills this requirement: the unitarization does not change the born-level predictions for the color averaged differential cross sections. The situation is entirely different when considering the color singlet exchange component introduced by the exchange of two or more gluons or by unitarization. The color singlet exchange fractions can be described in terms of a single universal phase, which absorbs all non-perturbative effects. This suggests a unified phenomenological description of the rapidity gap data, via the gap survival probability and the phase. Such an analysis goes beyond the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of rapidity gap fractions which have just become available, and should best be performed directly by the experimental collaborations.

Numerous techniques for forecasting electric energy consumption have been proposed in the last few decades. For operators, energy consumption (load) forecast is useful in effectively managing power systems. Consumers can also benefit from the forecasted information in order to yield maximum satisfaction. Additionally, load forecasting has been used for system security purposes, such as detecting vulnerabilities in advance. The accuracy of the forecast depends on several factors, including historical load, mean atmospheric temperature, mean relative humidity, population, GDP per capita, and historical trends. Several algorithms have been proposed by researchers to tackle electric energy consumption forecasting problems. The time series approach, functional based approach, and soft computing based approach are three main approaches used in forecasting electric energy consumption. The time series approach uses time series analysis to handle trends and future consumption, while the functional based approach uses functional relationships between energy consumption and system load. The soft computing approach uses fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast energy consumption. The results of the proposed ANN model were compared with empirical data from the gaza strip, and the results showed good accuracy and relevance in forecasting electric energy consumption. Future works will consider other forecasting techniques, such as the time series approach and the ANN hybrid with invasive weed optimization (iwo) for short-term electricity prices forecasting.

The axial anomaly represents a fundamental issue for understanding the basic aspects of quantum field theory. It has been extensively analyzed using various methods, including the dispersive approach and the path integral formalism. The axial anomaly arises from the interaction between fermions and photons, and it has been shown to be related to the chiral limit and the infrared interpretation. The paper discusses the different mechanisms by which the axial anomaly can be related to the breaking of a given symmetry, including the presence of a term independent of the fermion mass in the divergence of the axial current. The paper also explores the implications of the axial anomaly for the radiative decays of charged leptons and the chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories.

• The nucleon in the low-energy regime is described by a unified chiral interaction that includes both the short-range interaction (giving rise to the spin-singlet states) and the long-range interaction (giving rise to the spin-orbit interactions). The short-range interaction is crucial for the nucleon's stability and is related to the fermi nature of constituent quarks and the specific interactions between them. The chiral interaction is responsible for the short-range repulsion in the nucleon, which is also responsible for the hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the long-range attraction in the nucleon, which is implied by the yukawa part of pion-exchange and correlated two-pion exchanges. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the tensor and spin-orbit forces, which come from the pseudoscalar- and vector-exchange yukawa tails.

* This application is a continuation of Ser. No. 849,446, filed 4/8/2021, now abandoned. The present invention relates to a skin reflectance measuring apparatus. The object of the invention is to propose a reflectance measurement apparatus that is specifically adapted for measuring the reflectance of the skin. The invention includes a probe comprising a casing with an aperture, a flexible connection in fiber optics, and a measuring device comprising light emitting means and light receiving means. The light emitting means is optically coupled to a second end of the first conductor, and the light receiving means is optically coupled to a second end of the second conductor to produce a first signal representing the specular reflection and a second signal representing part of the non-specular or diffuse reflection. The processing means is connected to the light emitting and receiving means, and provides correcting means to compensate for variations in the emitted light and ambient light, and produces a relative reflectance signal from the measured values of specular reflection and diffuse reflection. The display device receives the reflectance signal to indicate the amplitude of the signal. The invention is particularly useful for measuring the reflectance of greasy skin, particularly for making efficiency-aimed tests. The invention also finds an application in grading different types of skins. The invention is adaptable to various surfaces, including reduced surfaces and surfaces less than 1 cm². The correction of variations in light intensity and ambient light is achieved using a circuit for regulating a source of light, using servo-control means. The invention is also adaptable to different types of skin, including greasy skin, SSSM, and lichen. The invention is adaptable to different types of skin, including greasy skin, SSSM, and lichen.

• The packaging machine described in the disclosure is a deep-drawing packaging machine with a rotating shaft arranged in the production direction of the machine. The shaft is connected to a drive mechanism, such as an electric motor or a servomotor, which converts the rotational movement of the shaft into a lifting movement of a tool member. The shaft is provided with a transfer mechanism for converting the rotational movement of the shaft into the movement required to operate the tool member. The shaft is arranged in the production direction of the packaging machine, only requiring comparatively little installation space. The shaft is driven alternately in different directions of rotation, allowing for the synchronization of the tool members of different work stations. The shaft is supported by cross bars, which are arranged in the production direction of the packaging machine. The transfer mechanism is preferably a cam mechanism with a wear-reducing element to reduce wear-dependent load on the shaft. The shaft is driven in a continuous 360° rotation, which allows for a transmission between the shaft and the shaft driving unit, e.g., an electric motor or a servomotor. The packaging machine can be modified by providing additional work stations and/or tool members, such as a lifting device for the feed system. The vertical lifting device of the feed system can be provided in other areas as needed, such as for products projecting beyond the package edge.

No. 4,075,951, granted on Feb. 28, 1978, but has improved electrical properties. The disclosures in Wulff U.S. Pat. No. 4,241,667 and Chierici and Murphy U.S. Pat. No. 4,075,951, are incorporated by reference.
• The Chierici and Murphy patent referred to above discloses a special truck bolster bowl liner that was devised to replace the conventional and troublesome manganese steel liner. The Chierici and Murphy liner is in the form of a bowl shaped member or body formed from an ultra high molecular weight polymer of dry self lubricating characteristics. An ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) is preferred, and the bowl member is shaped to define a floor portion and an upstanding side wall portion which is in circumambient relation about the bowl liner floor portion. 
• The bowl liner side wall is proportioned to space the car body bolster center plate from the truck bolster bowl side wall, about the circumference of these components, and hold the body bolster center plate in such spaced relation against end of car impacts, whereby such impact forces transmitted between the car body bolster center plate and the truck bolster bowl side wall are spread over 180 degrees of the bolster components involved thereby avoiding overstressing of these components. In the flat horizontal liner, these side loads are borne by a separate liner, usually of steel, held in place in the truck bolster bowl. The problem with the previously disclosed liners are that they are nonconductive, necessitating the addition of some grounding apparatus such as that disclosed in the Wulff patent.
• Several alternative embodiments are also present to this bowl liner configuration, which can be adapted to the static dissipative characteristics of the instant invention. One option is to use a UHMW-PE flat horizontal disk formed liner to bear the car",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

The present invention provides a vehicular rearview mirror system that is tolerant of different protocols of an output of a vehicle control. The system includes a variable reflective element that assumes a partial reflectance level in response to a drive signal. The system also includes a mirror control that is responsive to the output of the vehicle control for generating at least one mirror control output. The at least one mirror control output includes a value for the drive signal. The mirror control determines the protocol of the output of the vehicle control including monitoring the output of the vehicle control in attempting to conclude a state of the output of the vehicle control. The output of the vehicle control may be gear status information, engine information, alarm information, or door status information. The protocol, also known as a handshake, is the relationship between the reverse-gear indication signals when the vehicle is in reverse gear versus when it is not in reverse gear. The protocol may be determined by monitoring the protocol of the reverse-gear indication upon starting of the vehicle and/or upon running of the vehicle. The protocol may also be determined by both monitoring the protocol of the reverse-gear indication upon starting of the vehicle and during running of the vehicle. The protocol may be stored in non-volatile memory, such as an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), which is capable of storing data even when the vehicle is turned off. The protocol may be maintained by a microcomputer having non-volatile memory, such as in the form of electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), which is capable of storing data even when the vehicle is turned off. The protocol may be programmed by a skilled artisan to carry out a control program having a power up sequence routine (FIG. 3) and/or a main sequence routine (FIG. 4).

• The inventor has designed a novel sanitizable rotary valve that combines elements previously found in the valve art but adds a unique feature of partial (sealed) separation of the rotor-stator faces to allow flushing across the process fluid-contacting surfaces. This partial separation would normally result in sanitizing fluid leaking out of the valve, leading to non-aseptic operation, but a novel diaphragm-like elastomeric seal has been invented which functions to both seal the two faces together in normal use and retain sanitizing process fluids when the faces are partially separated for cleaning. This design allows the unique sanitary operation of the valve that is disclosed herein, enabling the ability to sanitize in place (SIP) without disassembling the valve. 
• The unique operation of the valve is performed by a new type of slider (or rotary) valve shown specifically in a rotary carousel diaphragm valve which has a thermoplastic elastomeric diaphragm integrally molded to form the multiple sealing ports of the rotor face. Ports or grooves molded into the face of the elastomeric diaphragm are positioned to sealably engage grooves or ports in the stator face, and to form sanitary elastomeric tubular ducts leading through the body of the rotor, terminating as elastomeric flanges. These flanges permit direct connection to sanitary piping flanges within the carousel which lead to and from multiple columns or other solid phase bed segments. 
• To permit periodic sanitization and cleaning of the port sealing faces of the stator and rotor, the external limit of the elastomeric rotor diaphragm is molded to form a flexible wiping lip seal which maintains fluid-tight sealing engagement with the face of the stator even when the rotor is moved orthogonally away from the stator far enough to permit cross flushing of the port sealing faces. 
• In the preferred embodiment, the required sealing force is minimized by relieving material from either the surface of the stator or from the rotor diaphragm to form port-sealing ledges and adjoining gutters. The gutters may carry a barrier fluid stream which is used to capture and sweep away any process fluid which escapes from the port seals. This feature prevents accumulation of dried material which may damage the sealing faces, and ensures containment of material which might otherwise constitute an environmental hazard to workers in the area. 
• The invention is directed to a sliding multi-port diaphragm valve having at least two inner surfaces, comprising: a rotor having a body wherein the inner surface",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The present invention relates to gas-liquid contacting trays and improvements in valve-tray assemblies. More particularly, one aspect of the invention includes an improved tray valve assembly for a process column of the type wherein liquid flows downwardly from a downcomer onto a first tray and thereacross in a first direction upon the active area thereof through which vapor flows upwardly for interaction and mass transfer with the liquid before passing therefrom. The improvement comprises a plurality of apertures formed in the tray having a valve cover mounted thereon. The valve cover is mounted by first and second legs, the first leg being disposed to intercept the flow of liquid across the tray and being wider than the second leg. The legs are mounted to the tray in outwardly slotted portions thereof for defining the orientation of the valve relative to the liquid flow. A number of valve shapes are contemplated by the present invention. These include oval and triangular valves. The valve also includes means for selectively biasing the rear region of the valve upwardly against the flow of liquid for facilitating initial, directionalized vapor flow therethrough. 
* In another aspect, the invention includes the above described tray valve being formed of a round disc having the first and second legs depending downwardly therefrom. Each of the legs are formed with outwardly extending flange portions for underlying the tray and locking the disc in a floating relationship relative to the tray. The valve aperture is circular in shape and the valve legs are disposed in slotted regions disposed outwardly of the circular aperture to prevent the rotation of the valve plate for maintaining the orientation of the valve leg relative to the tray. The biasing means comprises a detent portion formed on the cover of the valve for preventing the surface thereof from resting flush against the tray surface. This design facilitates the initial passage of vapor through the valve. 
* In another aspect of the invention, the method described above includes the step of forming the first and second legs of the valve with flange portions outstanding from the disc and engaging the underside of the tray to prevent the lifting of the valve upwardly therethrough. The circular aperture may be formed with first and second notches therein, the first and second notches receiving the first and second legs therein and preventing the rotation of the disc relative to the tray.

Background of the Invention
Pyrazolotriazoles, such as those described herein, are useful magenta couplers for photographic products. However, they are difficult to synthesize. Only a few synthetic routes are known. One of the preferred synthetic routes involves preparation of the triazolothiadiazines 1 and subsequent desulfurization reaction to give the pyrazolotriazoles 2. The triazolothiadiazines 1 can be prepared in two ways; the first, by reaction of 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-substituted(R)-1,2,4-triazoles (4) with alpha-haloketones, or the second, by reaction of 2-hydrazino-5-substituted-(R&#39;)-1,3,4-thiadiazines (5) with acyl halides and subsequent dehydrative ring closure. Both the triazoles 4 and the thiadiazines 5 are readily available from thiocarbohydrazide; ##STR4## The desulfurization of these triazolothiadiazines 1 to the pyrazolotriazoles 2: ##STR5## is effected in two steps; the first, a ring contraction reaction of 1 by heating in acetic anhydride to give 1-acetyl-7-acetylthio-3,6-disubstituted-1H-pyrazolo[5,1-c]-1,2,4-triazoles (6) and, the second, hydrolysis of acetyl groups and desulfurization at the same time with hydrochloric acid to give the desired 2. ##STR6## Although this is the most attractive and practical method for desulfurization among those available, there are several drawbacks in using this as a manufacturing process. The first ring contraction reaction is usually clean and does not render any problem except long reaction time. In fact, the reaction mixture is clean enough to be used in the next step without isolation of 6. However,",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 2, 'symbol': '•'}"

The present invention relates to weft insertion in a multiple-color air jet loom, and more particularly to a method of and an apparatus for inserting a selected weft thread with a weft carrying force appropriate for the selected weft thread.
Background of the Invention
Multiple-color air jet looms have a plurality of different kinds of weft threads in readiness for weft insertion and successively insert them, one at a time, through warp sheds according to a fabric to be woven on the loom. Such different weft threads typically vary in thickness. They are subjected to slightly different resistances to being drawn for weft insertion and are slightly differently carried on jets of air.
Summary of the Invention
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus for inserting different weft threads in and through warp sheds in a multiple-color air jet loom, in which air under pressure is ejected from a main nozzle unit or a main nozzle unit and subnozzles to produce different weft carrying forces suited respectively for the different weft threads for thereby carrying the weft threads, one at a time, through the warp shed at the same speed under stable conditions and preventing undue consumption of pressurized air.
According to the present invention, the foregoing object can be achieved by ejecting the air from the main nozzle unit or the main nozzle unit and subnozzles under different pressures preset respectively to produce the weft carrying forces for carrying the weft threads, or supplying air under pressure from the main nozzle unit or the main nozzle unit and subnozzles for different intervals of time selected respectively for the weft threads to produce the weft carrying forces. To eject the air under different pressures, the subnozzles are divided into groups along the warp shed and spaced at different intervals for the groups to produce combined air streams of varying pressures, or an air pressure control means is connected between a source of air under pressure and the main nozzle and subnozzles for supplying the air under different pressures to the main nozzle and subnozzles. To eject the air under pressure for different intervals of time, a valve means is connected between the source of air under pressure and the main nozzle and subnozzles, and a control means is actuated in synchronism with operation of the air jet loom for opening the valve means selectively for the intervals of time. With this arrangement, the weft threads can be inserted and carried through the warp shed under stable conditions",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The present invention is directed to a method of forming a two-sided nonwoven fabric, which exhibits a pronounced three-dimensional image that is durable to both converting and end-use application. In particular, the present invention contemplates that a fabric is formed from a first precursor web comprising a fibrous matrix and a second precursor web comprising a second matrix. Between the first and second precursor web, a fluid-pervious support layer or scrim, is interposed and subjected to hydroentanglement on a moveable imaging surface having a three-dimensional image transfer device. By formation of a nonwoven fabric in this fashion, a three-dimensional image that is durable to abrasion and distortion due to elongation is imparted and a product formed which exhibits on its opposite surfaces the unique properties of the respective fibrous matrix used.

Field and Background of the Invention
The invention relates to a new and useful rotary hook arrangement for a lockstitch sewing machine. The rotary hook arrangement includes a bobbin housing with a bobbin capsule carrier and a spring-loaded holding finger. The spring-loaded holding finger is arranged on a support and extends radially to the hook axis. The front cam forms a support for the spring-loaded holding finger. The rear cam spans the spring-loaded holding finger. The front cam serves as a supporting element for the spring rod and comes in contact neither with the bobbin housing nor with the needle thread loop. The needle thread loop can be pulled through the thread passage gap by the thread feeder without being hindered by the spring rod. The capsule release device provides a rotational impulse counter to the direction of hook rotation, allowing the bobbin housing to rotate counter to the direction of hook rotation. The rotary hook arrangement is simple in design, rugged in construction, and economical to manufacture.

Incorporating a Spool Creel with a Tension Control System
The present invention provides an arrangement for controlling thread tension in a spool creel. The system includes a plurality of controllers, each of which is simultaneously settable by fluid pressure. Each controller is coupled to a different corresponding one of the spool holders. The controllers have a brake rotor and an adjustable, tension responsive braking element coupled to the brake rotor. The system also includes a tensioning lever coupled to the braking element for biasing it. The tensioning lever has a roller adapted to engage and be biased by the threads. This tensioning lever is operable to occupy an angular position dependent upon thread tension and weight. A biasing arrangement adapted to be activated by fluid pressure and connected to the tensioning lever, each of the tension levers being simultaneously settable by the fluid pressure, is also provided. The force generated by the preferred biasing arrangement operates in addition to the weight force on the tensioning lever, whereby the thread tension is also altered. The system can achieve improved tension control in a creel arrangement, where each spool holder is provided with a fluid pressure sensitive biasing arrangement, which influences the tensioning lever and where fluid pressure is controllable in common for all the biasing arrangements.

The present invention provides a simplified process for the continuous production of viscose rayon yarns with a high degree of whiteness (degree of white). The process comprises critical operations including coagulation, washing, drying, and finishing. The invention simplifies the spinning process by reducing the number of treatments and increasing the spinning speed, while maintaining an excellent degree of white. The process is carried out at a spinning speed not lower than 90 m/min and uses a weakly acid exchange resin for water treatment. The results show that the degree of white is improved significantly, with the traditional process requiring a higher number of treatments and higher spinning speeds, while the simplified process achieves the same degree of whiteness with fewer treatments and faster spinning speeds.

Field of the Invention: The invention relates to downhole vibratory tools and more specifically to tools that selectively allow passage through a fish or other object.
<summary>
Background: Vibratory tools are used to dislodge fish or other objects stuck in a downhole location. They have other applications such as allowing a pulling force to be transmitted from the surface to the fish or other object.
<summary>
Features: The tool described above has an outer body with a lower end that is attached to a stuck object or fish. It has a mandrel connected to the surface through a string and a passage in the string that allows pressure to be delivered to the fish or other object. The tool has a dump valve that is annularly shaped to keep the middle of the tool free and clear. This allows a central passage to exist to permit a wireline operation through the tool when the tool is not set up to be in vibratory mode. The tool can be simply put in vibratory mode by dropping a removable plug onto a seat. The dump valve opens and closes without getting slammed against a seat. The mandrel is powered by stacked pistons in the tool body to magnify the delivered power from the vibratory tool. The tool can be configured so that the pistons can travel their entire stroke without being banged against travel stops. The tool has the capability to tolerate continued downward mandrel movement to dissipate its momentum even after the dump valve opens. The components are then configured to apply power to the mandrel for a down cycle when the dump valve closes close to the point where the pistons reach their upward travel limit. The tool can be run to apply up oscillating forces with or without impacts depending on how the tool is operated by rig personnel.
<summary>
Advantages: The tool has a modular design that allows selection of the number of pistons and the power delivery from the dump valve. It can be operated with fewer moving parts than the previous design that involved dropping the critical tool components as part of the dart assembly. The tool can be used in stimulation or fishing operations and provides large amplitude vibrations in a tubing string. It relies on a single valve for operation.

Field of the Invention
The present invention pertains generally to retaining walls. Specifically, the invention relates to an apparatus and method of installation for a completely precast concrete retaining wall of the type typically used alongside highways and railways.
Background of the Invention
Various retaining wall systems have been developed for use in retaining soil on an embankment. In a conventional retaining wall design, one of the major design criteria that must be considered is the pressure exerted on the foundation at the front of the base (toe) of the wall system. This becomes particularly limiting in tall vertical walls with sloping backfill. Conventionally designed cantilevered walls reduce the pressure at the toe by providing a lever arm perpendicular to and behind the wall face upon which the vertical load of the backfill acts, creating a moment opposite in direction to the moment due to the horizontal force of the backfill material on the wall face. This moment is increased for design purposes by increasing the area of the moment arm until a suitable toe pressure is reached and a suitable factor of safety against overturning is reached.
Summary
The present invention provides an apparatus and method for constructing a retaining wall that allows for taller walls and shorter bases by pre-manufacturing parts of the wall to be transported to and assembled at the site. Using pre-manufactured assembly components will save both installation and transportation costs. Generally, a precast, substantially solid rectangular or trapezoidal base is set on grade at the job site, and a face panel with an integral counterfort is set upright on the base with a connection joining them together. Temporary shoring is not required with this assembly. As soon as the face panel and counterfort are set on the base, it can withstand temporary wind loads immediately. The invention is flexible in that the height or width of any of the individual components can vary over a wide range. All of the pieces of the assembly can easily be made to custom sizes.

Field of the Invention
This invention relates generally to down hole tools for conducting mechanical activities in wells and, more specifically, relates to a simply and efficiently operable mechanism for installing and removing objects in wells, including objects that might be stuck or lost within a well bore. 

Background of the Invention
The subject matter hereof is related to the subject matter of U.S. Pat. No. 4,061,389 and is directed specifically to the improvement that promotes effective connection of a pull tool to a down hole object or fish and simple and effective disconnection of the pull tool from the article if such is desired. 

Application of shocks to the pulling tool will sometimes result in disconnection, thereby enabling service personnel to remove the wire line pulling tool and substitute a tool and wire line of substantially heavier gauge. Application of mechanical shocks to the down hole equipment of the well and the wire line tool itself can easily cause failure or excessive wear of one or more of these mechanical components. It is desirable, therefore, to provide down hole service equipment, such as wire line controlled pulling tools, that will effectively become interconnected with down hole objects such as wire line tools, fish, etc., and, in the event disconnection is necessary, will readily become disconnected upon simple mechanical movement of a wire line controlled pulling tool. 

Summary of the Invention
The present invention may effectively take the form of an external pull tool or overshot that is adapted for use in well servicing operations or an internal pull tool or spear, depending upon the particular service operation that is involved. Although not restricted particularly to wire line service operations, the invention is effectively adapted to be provided on a wire line controlled pulling tool and run into the well casing or well bore for the purpose of establishing a mechanical connection with an object positioned in the well bore and applying sufficient force thereto to remove the object from the well. Whether the pulling tool takes the form of an external overshot or an internal spear, in each case, the tool structure takes the form of an outer tubular body having an inner body structure disposed in movable relation therein. Telescoping movement of the inner and outer body structures of the tool causes the overshot or spear to selectively move into gripping relationship with the object that is to be removed from the well bore. The tubular outer body is secured about the inner body by means of a catch mechanism having a locking position and an unlocking position, depending upon the relative positions of the inner and outer body structures.

* The invention relates to ladders, particularly to ladder attachments for positioning the ladder away from the work surface, preventing the ladder from defacing the work surface, and preventing the ladder from slipping or sliding.
* One problem with ladders, especially when painting or cleaning the exterior of a house, is that there is an amount of instability because the ladder rests on the side of the house with the only contact with the house being a small portion of the siderails of the ladder. When a person on the ladder reaches outside the rails, the center of gravity shifts causing one or both rails may slide along the work surface, thereby damaging the work surface.
* Another problem with typical ladders is that the siderails of the ladder rest on the work surface with a very small contact area which sometimes dents, scrapes, bruises or otherwise defaces the work surface. It is desirable to have a ladder that contacts the work surface with a broad surface area that does not deface the work surface.
* With typical ladders, a work surface with a corner presents a problem. The ladder has to be positioned on one of the two surfaces forming the corner to stabilize the ladder, but this makes the other surface difficult to reach. A typical ladder cannot straddle the corners because the rungs would rest against the corner with the siderails void of contact with the two surfaces creating an unstable condition. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that it would be highly desirable to have a ladder that can straddle a corner without losing stability.
* The invention provides a non-slip gripping portion for a ladder that grips the work surface without damaging the work surface.
* Another object of the invention is to provide ladder which effectively increases the contact area of the ladder with the work surface.
* Another object of the invention is to provide an attachment for a ladder to improve the lateral stability of the ladder.

It uses a heat exchanger to separate the dry and wet sides of the air, with evaporating water kept separate from the useful air to achieve sensible cooling. The major portion of the working air is drawn from the load, and the wet side of the heat exchanger operates by movement of the working air internally through conduits countercurrently to water flowing downwardly along the conduit inner surfaces, while the useful air passes through the dry side externally across the conduits. The system also includes a composite hybrid system where a portion of the cooled air stream is further cooled by heat exchange with the evaporator of a vapor compression refrigeration unit. The system has a capacity of 30,000 BTU per hour and is comparable to a vapor compression refrigeration unit of about 37.500-42,800 BTU per hour total capacity (3-3.5 tons). The system is highly efficient, operating more efficiently by a conjunction of features, with a lower energy cost and a lower dew point reduction. The condenser coil is located in the discharge path of the wet side of the heat exchanger, resulting in significant reductions in energy required to operate the vapor compression refrigeration unit, resulting in a power requirement of only 50% of normal.

The pin can prevent the relative translation of the female link and the male link after the pin is broken or released.
• The pin can serve as a fusible link, providing shear when a sufficiently strong shock or heavy load is applied. The pin can shear at a known load magnitude corresponding to the maximum structural capability of the gearbox assembly, the unfused mount components, and the engine mounting structure.
• The female link and the male link can translate generally axially, allowing the frictional radial interface between the female link and the male link to provide coulomb damping to dissipate energy created by the translation. The snap ring can limit the relative travel of the male link within the female link to prevent the mounting link from separating after the pin is sheared.

Summary
The disclosed concepts address the above stated situation by providing an efficient, clean burning burner and a system for removably attaching heat utilizing appliances thereto.
Summary
The burner has a combustion chamber enclosed by an outer wall surrounding a fuel holder. Air flows both through the fuel holder to support initial combustion, and also around the fuel holder, to be directed to flame and fumes just above the fuel holder to support secondary combustion. A shroud providing a second wall surrounds the outer wall, thereby establishing a flow path for tertiary combustion air also impinging on the flame and fumes, and also providing an external surface cool enough to avoid burns if casually contacted.
Summary
The burner has legs holding the combustion chamber well above ground level, and a pivotally coupled ash pan. A perforate food grate is pivotally coupled to the burner, and is movable to a deployed position above the flame, and to a stowed position to the side of the combustion chamber and associated outer walls. Opposite the perforate food grate, a cover is pivotally coupled to the burner, enabling the combustion chamber to be closed to prevent inadvertent ingress of dropped items, inadvertent exposure of the user to heat and exhaust fumes, and to suppress escape of live embers.
Summary

* The present invention is a method of minimizing flow disturbance caused by the closing and reopening of turbine control valves during periodic operational testing. It uses control valve positions as feedback to minimize flow disturbance caused by the closure and reopening of a turbine control valve during testing. The method minimizes steam boiler pressure changes or turbine power changes during turbine control valve operational safety testing by maintaining the total mass flow through several parallel turbine inlet control valves constant, minimizing turbine power changes during testing, and compensating for flow disturbance caused by the closure and reopening of the control valves. The flow is determined as a function of control valve position, and the flow change due to closure of one of the N parallel flow paths during valve testing results in a change to the system that is controlling pressure from N valves to N-1 valves. The flow characteristic for each valve of the system with N valves, and for the system with N-1 valves, is determined during the turbine design process. The flow characteristics thus determined are based on total flow and individual valve stem lift. For any given valve not under test, the difference in the flow-lift characteristic between the N and the N-1 condition is known. This difference is applied to the total flow demand to each of the N-1 valves on the basis of the total N valve demand derived from the position of the valve under test.

• The invention proposes a method of compressing gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method includes compressing the gas at least during individual intervals to a substantially higher pressure (excess pressure) than the desired exit pressure, cooling the compressed gas by the heat exchange to a temperature above the exit temperature, and obtaining the further cooling to the desired exit temperature by expanding the gas from the excess pressure to the desired exit pressure. A compressor station for a gas pipeline for carrying out the above-described method includes at least one compressor for compressing gas, at least one heat exchanger for cooling compressed gas, additionally valve-controlled pipelines for connecting the compressor and the heat exchanger to one another and to the gas pipeline, as well as control units for controlling the compressor and the valves. The invention starts from the fact that it is known to carry out the compression of a gas supplied at an entry pressure below the nominal pressure (rated pressure of the gas pipeline) to an increased pressure, wherein the compression can be carried out in a single stage or in multiple stages in compressors which are connected in series. Between the compressor stages and particularly after the last compressor stage, cooling by heat exchange takes place (usually air/gas heat exchange), in order to reach the required lower exit temperature of at most 0° C., preferably -5° C., for the re-entry of the compressed gas into the gas pipeline. During the warmer period of the year, in which the use of re-cooling units was necessary in the past for ensuring the required exit temperature, the present invention provides for a different type of cooling. The present invention utilizes the known physical effect according to which a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure, either by throttling or with the simultaneous performance of work. In order to ensure the required exit pressure or nominal pressure at the exit of the compressor station, the present invention provides that the gas to be transported is compressed to an excess pressure which is substantially above the exit pressure, for example, 10 to 50 bar above the exit pressure, to carry out at the end of the single-stage or multiple-stage compression a cooling by heat exchange, particularly by air/gas heat exchange, and subsequently to expand the compressed gas to the desired exit pressure. The excess pressure is selected in such a way that, taking into consideration the extent by which the gas compressed to excess pressure can be cooled by heat exchange, cooling during expansion is sufficient for obtaining a temperature reduction at least to",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The cooling fan assembly includes a motor that rotates a fan blade by way of a motor output shaft. The motor is electrically powered via power conductors. The motor carrier is integrally formed with the motor to form an integrated unit.
• In the majority of applications, it is most appropriate to establish the rotation of fan blade such that warm air moves from the interior of an enclosure to the exterior of the enclosure through enclosure exhaust portals. The enclosure is fitted with enclosure intake portals to allow ambient air to enter the enclosure interior to replace the air exhausted by cooling fan assembly 12.
• The height of turned-out portions is less than or equal to the height of recessed portions. This allows adjacent components to directly abut the exterior of the enclosure.
• The compression force of spring member 48 is applied to move turned-out portions fully into recessed portions, while rotating force 56 repositions resilient legs 36 into an intermediate sized opening of opening 42. Residual opening 60 is sized smaller than enlarged opening 44 but not as small as intermediate opening 58.
• The urging function of spring member 48 assists in preventing vibrational noise between motor carrier 32 and panel 14 and also prevents resilient leg portions 36 from ""backing out"" of their respective residual openings.

The two ring elements are of identical design and are axially profiled in such a manner that they form spherical cap pockets which are arranged in succession in the circumferential direction and which are connected in each case via bridge portions. The two ring elements are composed in such a manner that they contact one another via their bridge portions, wherein the in each case corresponding spherical cap pockets which face one another then jointly form ball guide pockets into which in each case a ball can be inserted. The two ring elements which contact one another via the bridge portions are welded to one another in the region of the bridge portions by spot weld points. In order to manufacture the ring elements, these are punched out from a sheet metal material and formed in a forming tool such that they obtain the axial profiling required to form the ball guide pockets.

Incorporating two real triaxial magnetic field sensors and three pairs of compensation coils into a digital system for compensating electromagnetic interfering fields, the system includes a control unit with six inputs and six outputs for six virtual sensor signals. The virtual sensor signals are combined to a 6×1 matrix S, which is processed by the control unit according to the algorithm described in the figure. The virtual sensor signals are then converted into real control signals O, which are used for controlling the six coils. The feedback part of the virtual sensor signals is expanded by the feedback matrix C, which eliminates crosstalk from the output signal O i to the virtual signal V i . The matrix M has the form:

* The present invention provides a design rule checking system and method that accurately reports appropriate errors for appropriate regions in a system that includes two different kinds of circuits, such as memory and logic. The method eliminates false errors caused by design rule checking tools examining regions that are not subject to the same design rules supported by the design rule-checking tool. It also creates customized rules appropriate for different types of memory regions that might be included on a chip, where such customized rules are based on modifying a standard logic rule by ""pushing"" more liberal memory based parameter onto stricter logic based parameter. The system and method is described below with reference to FIG. 4. A system 400 includes a conventional computer system and various software routines and libraries for performing a design rule check as now explained. In particular, system 400 includes a standard logic design rule (for logic areas) 410 that is supplemented by additional customized logic rules (for other types of areas such as specialized memory areas). One or more rules from this set are used to check a design in GDS form 430, depending on the types of regions presented in the IC. For example, if logic and (BDSP) SRAM were included in a design, both of these design rules would be used by design rule checker 440 (a software routine operating on the computer system) to check different areas of an IC layout as explained below. As seen in FIG. 4, each type of memory has its own set of customized rules to check against with.

* The present invention provides a novel implementation of a queue, particularly a FIFO-type queue (First In First Out), in a memory. The solution in accordance with the invention is intended for use specifically in connection with functional memories. By a functional memory is understood a memory in which updates, such as additions, are carried out in such a way that first the path from the root of a tree-shaped structure to the point of updating is copied, and thereafter the update is made in the copied data (i.e., the update is not directly made to the existing data). Such an updating procedure is also termed “copy-on-write”.  
* The invention is based on a tree-shaped data structure in which the nodes have a given maximum size and in which (1) additions of data units (to the queue) are directed in the tree-shaped data structure to the first non-full node, seen from below, on the first edge of the data structure and (2) deletions of data units (from the queue) are also directed to a leaf node on the edge of the tree, typically on the opposite edge. Furthermore, the invention is based on the idea of implementing the additions in such a way that the leaf nodes remain at the same hierarchy level of the tree-shaped data structure, which means that when such a non-full node is not present, new nodes are created to keep the leaf nodes at the same hierarchy level. The tree-shaped data structure will also be termed shortly a tree in the following.  
* When the solution in accordance with the invention is used, each update to be made in the functional environment requires a time and space that are logarithmically dependent on the length of the queue, since only the path leading from the root to the point of updating must be copied from the structure. The length of this path increases logarithmically in relation to the length of the queue. (When a FIFO queue contains N nodes, log N nodes shall be copied, where the base number of the logarithm is dependent on the maximum size of the node.)  
* Furthermore, in the solution in accordance with the invention the node to be updated is easy to access, since the search proceeds by following the edge of the tree until a leaf node is found. This leaf node provides the point of updating.

Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a collapsible light-shielding device for a screen. With this invention, a wide range of applications is intended, such as television sets, monitors, etc.
Background of the Invention
A known shielding device of this kind is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,465 and consists of an undeformable U-shaped shaft section of flanged plastic plate material. The shaft section is placed upside down over the housing of the screen, i.e. with the legs of the shaft section pointing downwards. Thus, the body of the shaft section rests on the upper side of the housing, while its legs are on either side of the screen. In the extended position, the shaft section projects from the housing beyond the displaying screen and prevents irritating reflections of natural light and/or artificial light on the glass of the screen, thereby rendering the image shown on the displaying screen clearer. The known shielding device is collapsible by pushing it over the housing into a position in which the shielding device does not project beyond the screen.
Summary of the Invention
The object of the invention is to provide an improved extendable shielding device. For this purpose, the light-shielding device according to the invention is characterized by a number of annular strips concentrically nested and essentially enclosing one another in a tight manner, which strips are suitable to be fixed in front of a displaying screen and in that case surround the screen, said strips furthermore being suitable to slide over one another between a pushed-in position, in which they essentially cover one another, and a pushed-out position, in which they are essentially uncovered.
Thus, it is possible to fold the light-shielding device around the displaying screen so that it is of very small size. In the folded-in state, the shielding device takes up relatively little space and therefore does not form an obstruction. Furthermore, the light-shielding device according to the invention can easily be fitted to a screen, for example using Velcro.

The present invention discloses a solution for automatically informing a speaker to decrease their speaking rate when that rate likely exceeds a rate that a listener can understand. This can be achieved by determining a speaking rate threshold for the listener and comparing it to the speaker's speaking rate. The speaking rate threshold can be based on a listening rate, estimated or known, of the listener. The speaker can be informed to slow down by an activation of a sensory mechanism of a wearable computing device that is designed to vibrate, beep, blink, speak a message, display a message, and the like, whenever the speaking rate of the speaker exceeds the speaking rate threshold.

Field of the Invention
This invention relates to network implemented shared workspace environments, and more specifically to an apparatus and method for spontaneously setting up, between physically distant individuals, a collaborative work-sharing environment. 

Background of the Invention
Well known examples of collaborative work-share environments include video conferencing; document sharing (read-only or write access); and shared ""whiteboard"" systems. The majority of videoconference meetings are currently implemented using expensive, dedicated equipment such as manufactured by PictureTel™. Typically, such equipment provides not only video conferencing, but also other virtual co-location tools. Because of its cost and size, this equipment is typically located in a dedicated ""videoconference room"", rather than at individual users' desktops. Such systems are used, primarily, as a means of reducing operating costs, such as air travel for the purpose of conducting face-to-face meetings. 

Recently, much more economical, PC-based products have been introduced to the market. Examples of current products that can be used to create a shared working environment include Intel Corporation's ProShare™ and Microsoft Corporation's NetMeeting™. These PC-based products are relatively low cost (in some cases free of charge) and are sufficiently small as to enable mass deployment on every networked PC of an enterprise LAN. Unlike dedicated conference room equipment, PC-based products can be viewed as workplace enhancements, providing added value to personal communications, rather than as tools for corporate cost reduction. 

Summary of the Invention
According to the present invention, a system is provided for initiating a collaborative work-share environment between two or more parties to a telephone call, without complex and time-consuming setup processes as are common in the prior art. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, each party to a telephone call is provided with a collaboration button and an indicator on their telephone set. When the indicator is illuminated, the system is capable of establishing a work-share environment. In response to one of the parties activating the collaboration button, the system causes network enabled applications to run on the individual users' desktop computers so that the parties are able to share information between themselves, conduct a video conference, etc., while maintaining their initial voice connection. 

Implementation Examples
In its broadest aspects, the present invention is a method and apparatus for simple spontaneous setup of a shared workspace.

The present invention relates to the insertion of clips or advertising sequences into a sequence of video pictures.
Background of the Invention
With the arrival of the distribution of video content over the Internet, advertising is considered a key element of growth for players such as Yahoo™, Google™ or Microsoft™. Different tools have been developed to increase the visual impact of the inserted advertising in the video, while avoiding inconveniencing the spectators.
Summary
The invention proposes a method for processing pictures intended to insert an advertising clip at a point, called insertion point, between two pictures of a sequence of video pictures. The method includes generating a salience map representing the salience of the video sequence before the insertion point, generating, for each advertising clip of a set of advertising clips, a salience map, determining, for each advertising clip of the set of advertising clips, a degree of similarity between the salience map of the video sequence and the salience map of the advertising clip, selecting, among the set of advertising clips, the advertising clip having the highest degree of similarity, and inserting the advertising clip selected into the video sequence at the insertion point.

* The Downconverting Digitizer of this invention utilizes predictive coding principles to implement a simple down converting A/D converter. By placing the sampler inside the predictive loop, the predictive loop filter can be implemented using DSP techniques, thus reducing the complexity of the overall converter plus adding flexibility in re-programming the predictive filter characteristics, which results in improvement in the converter dynamic range and noise performance.
* The dynamic range performance of the digital predictive encoder of this invention is further extended by utilizing the digital output of the loop to generate the signal for controlling a variable gain amplifier placed at the front of the predictive loop input.
* The DC offset performance of the converter is greatly enhanced through incorporation of an offset nuller digital signal processing element which provides an estimate of offsets introduced by the various circuits. This offset estimate is then introduced at the input of the sampler by combining it digitally with the output of the predictive filter.
* This invention is distinguished from prior art described in the references listed in the Prior Art section in four major aspects. First, the placement of the sampler inside the predictive loop allows the predictive filter to be implemented using DSP techniques, thus reducing the complexity of the overall converter plus adding flexibility in re-programming the predictive filter characteristics, which results in improvement in the converter dynamic range and noise performance. Second, operating the predictive encoder in a subharmonic mode allows the predictive loop to downconvert the signal and realize a further reduction in the complexity of the digital logic used in implementing the predicting digital filter. Third, using the digital predictive loop output to control the gain level applied to the input signal allows further increase of the dynamic range of the converter. Fourth, incorporating a built-in offset nuller which eliminates biases introduced by the implementation circuits' imperfections dramatically enhances the DC offset performance of the analog to digital conversion process.

• The U.S. government has been assessing strategic sourcing and the potential value of applying these techniques to federal acquisitions for over a decade. In 2002, GAO reported that leading companies committed to a strategic approach to acquiring services, moving away from numerous individual procurements to a broader aggregate approach. Strategic sourcing can encompass a range of tactics for acquiring products and services more effectively and efficiently. In 2005, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum implementing strategic sourcing practices. Agencies were directed to develop and implement strategic sourcing efforts based on the results of spend analyses. Strategic sourcing can address spending, leverage buying power, and reduce costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has recently taken actions to expand the use of strategic sourcing, with a September 2012 Cross-Agency Priority Goal Statement directing agencies to strategically source at least two new products or services in 2013 and 2014 that yielded at least 10 percent savings. Companies have shown that it is possible to save money by strategically managing services, not just by consolidating purchases of simple, commodity-like services. They have devised strategies and tactics to manage sophisticated services. Companies have also shown that savings come over a wide base and that results can be achieved with leadership, shared data, and a focus on strategic categories that is dynamic rather than static.

* Surface transportation programs are not addressing the nation's transportation challenges effectively. Post-interstate-era programs addressing highway, transit, and safety are an agglomeration that has been established over half a century without a well-defined vision of the national interest and federal role. Many surface transportation programs are not linked to performance of the transportation system or grantees, as most highway, transit, and safety funds are distributed through formulas that only indirectly relate to needs and may have no relationship to performance or outcomes. The programs often do not use the best tools or best approaches, such as using more rigorous economic analysis to select projects. Finally, the fiscal sustainability of the numerous highway, transit, and safety programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund is in doubt, as a result of increased spending from the fund without commensurate increases in revenues. Since the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 funded the modern federal highway program, the federal role in surface transportation has expanded to include broader goals, more programs, and a variety of program structures. Although most surface transportation funds remain dedicated to highway infrastructure, federal surface transportation programs have grown in number and complexity, incorporating additional transportation, environmental, and societal goals. While some of these goals have led to new grant programs in areas such as transit, highway safety, and motor carrier safety, others have led to additional procedural requirements for receiving federal aid, such as environmental review and transportation planning requirements. This expansion has also created a variety of grant structures and federal approaches for establishing priorities and distributing federal funds. Most highway infrastructure funds continue to be distributed to states in accordance with individual grant program formulas and eligibility requirements. However, broad program goals, eligibility requirements, and authority to transfer funds between highway programs give state and local governments broad discretion to allocate highway infrastructure funds according to their priorities. Although some transit formula grant programs also give grantees considerable discretion to allocate funds, a portion of transit assistance requires grantees to compete for funding based on specific criteria and goals. Similarly, basic safety formula grant programs are augmented by smaller programs that directly target federal funds to specific goals and actions using financial incentives and penalty provisions. We have found that many federal surface transportation programs are not effective at addressing key transportation challenges, such as increasing congestion and growing freight demand, because federal goals and roles are unclear, and many programs lack links to needs or performance. The goals of federal surface transportation programs are numerous and sometimes conflicting, which contributes to a corresponding lack of clarity in the federal role.

* DOD has identified over 60,000 servicemembers and civilians as potentially exposed to chemical or biological substances during tests conducted outside of Project 112. The report found that DOD has not exhausted all possibilities for identifying additional exposed individuals. The Defense Authorization Act for FY 2003 required DOD to review records and information necessary to identify members of the armed forces who were or may have been exposed to chemical or biological substances as a result of Project 112 tests. The report also found that DOD had not exhausted all possible sources of information during its investigation of Project 112 and its own research for that report resulted in the identification of 39 additional potentially exposed servicemembers. The report also found that DOD had not exhausted all possibilities for identifying additional exposed individuals and that DOD’s approach was hampered by a lack of clear and consistent objectives, scope of work, and information needs.

Service employees include craft employees, the largest group; EAS; the Postal Career Executive Service (PCES); and others, such as inspectors for the Postal Inspection Service. The Service structure includes headquarters, 11 areas, and 85 performance clusters, with cluster-level employees making up about 96 percent of the Service workforce. The Service’s Diversity Development Department created its Diversity Development Action Plan in 1992, which was to foster an all-inclusive business environment. The Department reports that women and minorities appeared to be experiencing problems advancing to management jobs at EAS 17 and above positions. The Board of Governors directed the Service to develop an action plan for dealing with the diversity issues raised by Aguirre. The Service developed an action plan and briefed the Board on the plan in April 1998. In our previous letter, we reviewed promotions to EAS 16 and above positions at four selected performance clusters. Documentation in the promotion files and our discussions with Service officials provided evidence that the Service’s required promotion procedures were followed for the 127 fiscal year 1997 promotions at these 4 sites. In addition, for 117 of these promotions, we provided statistical data on the distribution of the specific EEO groups throughout the promotion process stages—applications received, applicants considered best qualified, and applicants promoted.

• The DOD defines an MWD as a canine bred, procured, or acquired to meet DOD's requirements for explosive and illegal narcotic detection capabilities, patrol, tracking, and other operations. MWDs can be deployed to assist in operations outside their assigned military installation. MWDs are removed from service when they can no longer perform their duties due to medical or behavior problems, when they are no longer needed by the military, or in other circumstances, such as when a handler dies in action. The DOD uses a law called ""Robby's Law"" to promote the adoption of MWDs after their military service. The DOD maintains a veterinary care system for adopted MWDs, which includes a review board that decides on the disposition of MWDs. The DOD provides electronic medical records for MWDs, which include a checkbox for adoption, and a central repository for medical information. The DOD provides preventative care for MWDs, and owners of adopted MWDs can purchase veterinary services through the U.S. War Dogs Association. The DOD provides information about potential services provided by the American Humane organization, which covers medical costs for adopted MWDs when their owners are unable to pay for their care.

* The Comanche program was established in 1983 to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet. The contractor team of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Helicopter Company were expected to design a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing the primary missions of armed reconnaissance and attack. Critical to achieving these capabilities are the successful development of advanced technologies, including composite materials, advanced avionics and propulsion systems, and sophisticated software and hardware. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals in order to realize significantly lower operating and support costs predicted for this program and achieve a wartime operational availability for the Comanche of 6 hours per day. In December 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program as part of efforts to meet budgetary constraints. The Secretary’s restructure decision reduced funding for the program from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. In addition to extending the development phase by 3 years, it also called for two flyable prototypes to be produced and the Comanche production decision to be deferred. DOD approved the proposal in March 1995. The Army’s restructuring of the Comanche program continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required and of higher program costs. According to DOD’s April 1990 guidelines for determining degrees of concurrency, a program with high concurrency typically proceeds into low-rate initial production before significant initial operational test and evaluation is completed. Regarding the need to keep concurrency low, the guidelines note that establishing programs with no concurrency, or a low degree of concurrency, avoids the risks that (1) production items have to be retrofitted to make them work properly and (2) system design will not be thoroughly tested. As we recently reported, aircraft systems, including the T-45A and C-17, that entered low-rate initial production before successfully completing initial operational testing and evaluation experienced significant and sometimes costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance. Under the Army’s restructured program, operational testing will not begin until after the low-rate initial production decision is made, continuing the risks associated with the highly concurrent Comanche program. In responding to the Secretary’s restructure decision, the Army proposed, and was subsequently granted approval, to buy six “early operational capability” aircraft, in addition to the two prototypes that were to be acquired under the Secretary’s decision.

• The Food Stamp Program provides eligible low-income households with paper coupons or electronic benefits that can be redeemed for food in stores nationwide. FNS funds food stamp benefits and about half of the states' administrative costs and establishes regulations for implementing the Food Stamp Program. FNS regulations require that states certify household eligibility at least annually and establish requirements for households to report changes that occur after they are certified. Recently, FNS introduced several options and waivers to food stamp rules and regulations in order to increase program access and reduce the reporting burden on working families while minimizing the potential for payment errors. These include options and waivers related to program eligibility, reporting requirements, extending food stamp benefits to households leaving TANF, and options related to TANF recipients. To monitor program accountability, FNS’s quality control system measures states’ performance in accurately determining food stamp eligibility and calculating benefits. States implement the Food Stamp Program by determining whether households meet established limits on gross income and assets, calculating monthly benefits for eligible households, and issuing benefits to households. The actual amount of the food stamp benefit is based on household income after certain deductions—including shelter, dependent care, and child support. To be eligible for benefits, a household’s gross income may not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level and the value of its assets may not exceed $2,000. If the household owns a vehicle worth more than $4,650, the excess value is included in calculating the household’s assets. Recipients of TANF cash assistance are automatically eligible for food stamps—a provision referred to as “categorical eligibility” — and do not have to go through a separate food stamp eligibility determination process. In the wake of welfare reform, many needy families that are no longer receiving TANF cash assistance may receive other TANF-funded services or benefits. FNS gave states the option to extend categorical eligibility to families receiving TANF-funded benefits or services. States can determine which TANF-funded services or benefits confer categorical eligibility to food stamps. FNS offers two options that states can use to allow households to own a vehicle worth more than the amount allowed in current regulations and remain eligible for food stamp benefits. One option allows states to replace the federal food stamp vehicle asset rule with the vehicle asset rule from any TANF assistance program, as long as the rule is more liberal than the federal rule. States adopting the rule of a TANF-funded program must apply it to all applicants for food stamp benefits. States can also use the categorical",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

* Established in 1965, HUD is the principal federal agency responsible for programs in four areas—housing assistance, community development, housing finance, and regulatory issues related to lead-based paint abatement and fair housing. HUD has 9, 386 employees as of February 1999. Housing Assistance: HUD provides public housing assistance through allocations to public housing authorities and private-market housing assistance under section 8 of the U. S. Housing Act of 1937 for properties—referred to as project-based assistance—or for tenants—known as tenant-based assistance. HUD’s housing assistance programs are limited by budgetary constraints to only about one-fourth of those who are eligible. Community Development: Primarily through grants to the states, large metropolitan areas, small cities, towns, and counties, HUD provides community planning and development funds for local economic development under its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Programs (EZ/EC), housing development under its HOME Program, and assistance to the homeless under its McKinney Act Homeless Programs. HUD is responsible for regulating interstate land sales, home mortgage settlement services, manufactured housing, lead-based paint abatement, and home mortgage disclosures. HUD is also responsible for enforcing federal fair housing laws. The budget impact—a net increase of about 9 percent in new budget authority—of the new programs and increases to existing programs that HUD proposes is not overwhelming, but the proposed budget does raise questions about HUD’s capacity to manage such an increase. Questions arise for two reasons: First, HUD is currently going through a significant, complex, and time-consuming organizational reform in which many functions that it once managed in many field offices will be managed in one or more “centers” in various parts of the country. This reform is necessary to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HUD’s operations and to address long-standing yet basic problems in program management. To accommodate this reform, HUD is moving and retraining many of its staff. Second, new initiatives and programs require a certain amount of dedicated resources to plan, implement, and manage over the long term. It is questionable whether these resources are available at this point in the reinvention of HUD. Therefore, we are concerned about whether HUD has the capacity to effectively initiate and oversee the set of new programs it is proposing for fiscal year 2000 while it is also trying to develop for itself a new operating style and way of doing business.

The system provides medical services and support to the armed forces during contingency operations and offers medical services and support to members of the armed forces, their family members, and others eligible for DOD health care. DOD's health care mission is carried out directly through military medical centers, hospitals, and clinics throughout the United States and overseas, commonly referred to as military treatment facilities, as well as by civilian health care providers through TRICARE. Military treatment facilities make up DOD's direct care system for providing health care to beneficiaries. DOD's delivery of health care services includes inpatient and outpatient care. Inpatient care refers to care for a patient who is formally admitted to a hospital or an institution for treatment, or care. Outpatient care, also known as ambulatory care, refers to health care services for an actual or potential disease, injury, or lifestyle-related problem that does not require admission to a medical treatment facility for inpatient care. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is responsible for ensuring the effective execution of DOD's health care mission and exercises authority, direction, and control over medical personnel authorizations and policy, facilities, funding, and other resources within DOD. The TRICARE Management Activity operates under the authority, direction, and control of Health Affairs. In 2008, the TRICARE Management Activity approved plans to renovate LRMC and the 86th MDG clinic at their existing locations. The initial LRMC plans included renovation of the inpatient tower; construction of an additional tower for emergency medicine, inpatient nursing units, and other clinical and support activities; and demolition of older facilities. The initial plans for the 86th MDG clinic included construction of a single building to consolidate health care services provided at separate facilities that currently make up the 86th MDG clinic. In 2009, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment), together with Health Affairs, conducted a cost-benefit analysis that included consideration of alternative sites as well as consolidation of the two projects into a single medical center, and determined that consolidating the aging LRMC and 86th MDG clinic into one new facility that provides tertiary care in an area adjacent to Ramstein Air Base, known as the Weilerbach Storage Area, would be more efficient and cost-effective than pursuing two separate renovation or reconstruction",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

* IRS faces significant challenges in effectively scheduling staff that meet IRS' staffing requirements, including inaccurate demand forecasting and a complicated staff scheduling process. IRS has made substantial improvements to help meet these challenges, but further improvements are needed. IRS will have difficulty improving its telephone service without setting a long-term, desired service-level goal that is based on the needs of taxpayers, as well as annual goals aimed at making progress toward reaching that long-term goal over time. As the Government Performance and Results Act and SSA experience suggest, IRS will also need support for its long- and short-term goals from congressional stakeholders. IRS’ telephone customer service workforce represents a substantial human capital investment in providing assistance to taxpayers. To get the most from this investment, IRS must be able to target scarce training resources where they are most needed to optimize call center and network performance, minimize turnover of trained and experienced customer service representatives to avoid unnecessary recruiting and training expenditures, and determine how its individual or collective human capital policies and practices affect its ability to achieve customer service goals and how changes in one or more human capital management practices will affect other practices. However, until IRS establishes a system for assessing competency gaps to identify the refresher training needs of individual customer service representatives, it cannot effectively target scarce training resources to meet individual training needs. Without a system for monitoring attrition, identifying its causes, and using the information gathered from that system to develop, as appropriate, strategies for dealing with the attrition of customer service representatives, IRS cannot ensure that its recruiting and training resources are used efficiently. And, unless IRS considers its human capital management practices’ contribution to achieving overall service goals and considers the interrelationships among its toll-free service human capital practices, it lacks a good basis for assessing the soundness of those practices. We are recommending that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue take several steps to improve IRS’ human capital management practices related to providing telephone customer service. Specifically, the Commissioner should establish a long-term, desired service-level goal based on taxpayers' needs, together with annual goals designed to make progress toward that long-term goal over time, and work with congressional and other stakeholders to obtain their support and the resources needed to reach those goals; establish a system for assessing customer service representatives’ competency gaps and meeting the refresher training needs identified by the assessments; develop a system for monitoring call center attrition and identifying its causes and use the information gathered from that system to develop, as appropriate, strategies for dealing with the attrition of customer service representatives; and ensure that IRS’ evaluations of human capital management practices consider",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '*'}"

• The Internet, a critical resource supporting vital services, has grown increasingly important to American businesses and consumers, serving as the host for hundreds of billions of dollars of commerce each year. It is also a critical resource supporting vital services, such as power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense. The Internet relies upon a set of functions, called the domain name system, to ensure the uniqueness of each e-mail and Web site address. The rules that govern the domain name system determine which top-level domains (the string of text following the right-most period, such as .gov) are recognized by most computers connected to the Internet. The heart of this system is a set of 13 computers called “root servers,” which are responsible for coordinating the translation of domain names into Internet addresses. Appendix I provides more background on how this system works. The U.S. government supported the implementation of the domain name system for nearly a decade, largely through a Department of Defense contract. Following a 1997 presidential directive, the Department of Commerce began a process for transitioning the technical responsibility for the domain name system to the private sector. After requesting and reviewing public comments on how to implement this goal, in June 1998 the Department issued a general statement of policy, known as the “White Paper.” In this document, the Department stated that because the Internet was rapidly becoming an international medium for commerce, education, and communication, the traditional means of managing its technical functions needed to evolve as well. Moreover, the White Paper stated the U.S. government was committed to a transition that would allow the private sector to take leadership for the management of the domain name system. Accordingly the Department stated that the U.S. government was prepared to enter into an agreement to transition the Internet’s name and number process to a new not-for-profit organization. At the same time, the White Paper said that it would be irresponsible for the U.S. government to withdraw from its existing management role without taking steps to ensure the stability of the Internet during the transition. According to Department officials, the Department sees its role as the responsible steward of the transition process. Subsequently, the Department entered into an MOU with ICANN to guide the transition. ICANN has made significant progress in carrying out MOU tasks related to one of the guiding principles of the transition effort—increasing competition. However, progress has been much slower on activities designed to address the other guiding principles: increasing the stability and security of the Internet; ensuring representation of the Internet",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

In 1998, following a presidential call for VA and DOD to start developing a ""comprehensive, life-long medical record for each service member,"" the two departments began a joint course of action aimed at achieving the capability to share patient health information for active duty military personnel and veterans. Their first initiative, undertaken in that year, was the Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR) project, which aimed to create an electronic interface that would allow physicians and other authorized users at VA and DOD health facilities to access data from any of the other agency's health information systems. The interface was expected to compile requested patient information in a virtual record that could be displayed on a user's computer screen. In our reviews of the GCPR project, we determined that the lack of a lead entity, clear mission, and detailed planning to achieve that mission made it difficult to monitor progress, identify project risks, and develop appropriate contingency plans. In 2001, we recommended that the participating agencies (1) designate a lead entity with final decision-making authority and establish a clear line of authority for the GCPR project and (2) create comprehensive and coordinated plans that included an agreed-upon mission and clear goals, objectives, and performance measures, to ensure that the agencies could share comprehensive, meaningful, accurate, and secure patient health care data. In 2002, we recommended that the participating agencies revise the original goals and objectives of the project to align with their current strategy, commit the executive support necessary to adequately manage the project, and ensure that it followed sound project management principles. VA and DOD took specific measures in response to our recommendations for enhancing overall management and accountability of the project. By July 2002, VA and DOD had revised their strategy and had made progress toward being able to electronically share patient health data. The two departments had refocused the project and named it the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) program and, consistent with our prior recommendation, had finalized a memorandum of agreement designating VA as the lead entity for implementing the program. This agreement also established FHIE as a joint activity that would allow the exchange of health care information in two phases. ● The first phase, completed in mid-July 2002, enabled the one-way transfer of data from DOD’s existing health information system (the Composite Health Care System, CHCS) to a separate database that VA clinicians could access. ● A second phase, finalized in March 2004, completed",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses nine audit standards to evaluate the quality of audits, including the scope, techniques, technical conclusions, workpaper preparation, reports, and time management of audits. Each standard includes additional key elements that define specific components of quality audits.
• IRS uses the key element pass rate as one measure of audit quality. This measure computes the percentage of audits demonstrating the characteristics defined by the key element. The key element pass rate is useful for describing how an audit is flawed, establishing a baseline for improvement, and identifying systemic changes.
• The key element pass rate is computed by comparing the number of audits that demonstrate the key element characteristics to the total number of audits. The key element pass rate ranges from 0% to 100%, with higher pass rates indicating better quality.
• The key element pass rate is used to measure the quality of audits and to identify areas for improvement. It is also used to establish a baseline for audit quality and to identify systemic changes.
• The key element pass rate is calculated for audits conducted in fiscal years 1992 through 1997. The pass rates for the key elements of the workpaper standard for fiscal years 1992 through 1997 are as follows:

* The largest interagency contracting program is the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), also known as the Federal Supply Schedule or schedules program. GSA directs and manages the FSS program. MACs and GWACs are also interagency contracts. Government buyers usually pay a fee for using other agencies' GWACs, MACs, and schedule contracts. These fees are usually a percentage of the value of the procurement, which are paid to the sponsoring agency and are expected to cover the costs of administering the contract. Along with using interagency contracts to leverage their buying power, a number of large departments—DOD and DHS in particular—are turning to enterprisewide contracts as well to acquire goods and services. Enterprisewide contracts are similar to interagency contracts in that they can leverage the purchasing power of the federal agency but generally do not allow purchases from the contract outside of the original acquiring activity. Enterprisewide contracting programs can be used to reduce contracting administrative overhead, provide information on agency spending, support strategic sourcing initiatives, and avoid the fees charged for using interagency contracts. All of these contracts are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts. ID/IQ contracts are established to buy goods and services when the exact times and exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of award. Once the times and quantities are known, agencies place task and delivery orders against the contracts for goods and services. In fiscal year 2008, federal agencies spent at least $60 billion through GWACs, MACs, the FSS program, and enterprisewide contracts to buy goods and services to support their operations: about $46.8 billion was spent on the FSS program; about $5.3 billion was spent on GWACs; at least $2.5 billion was spent on MACs although the actual amount could be much higher; and at least $4.8 billion was spent on the three enterprisewide contracts we reviewed, although, like MACs, the actual amount spent on all enterprisewide contracts could be higher. Sales under the FSS program have been relatively flat in recent years, and obligations under GWACs have declined slightly in recent years.

* Investments in IT can enrich people's lives and improve organizational performance. During the last two decades, IT has matured from being a means for academics and scientists to communicate with each other to a national resource where citizens can interact with their government in many ways, such as by receiving services, supplying and obtaining information, asking questions, and providing comments on proposed rules. However, while these investments have the potential to improve lives and organizations, some federally funded IT projects can and have become risky, costly, unproductive mistakes. We have previously testified that the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and troubled IT investments, such as the Office of Personnel Management’s Retirement Systems Modernization program, which was canceled in February 2011, after spending approximately $231 million on the agency’s third attempt to automate the processing of federal employee retirement claims; the tri-agency National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which was stopped in February 2010 by the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy after the program spent 16 years and almost $5 billion; the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Scheduling Replacement Project, which was terminated in September 2009 after spending an estimated $127 million over 9 years; and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Healthcare.gov website and its supporting systems, which were to facilitate the establishment of a health insurance marketplace by January 2014, encountered significant cost increases, schedule slips, and delayed functionality. In a series of reports we identified numerous planning, oversight, security, and system development challenges faced by this program and made recommendations to address them. In light of these failures and other challenges, last year we introduced a new government-wide high-risk area, Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and Operations. 18F and USDS were formed in 2014 to help address the federal government’s troubled IT efforts. Both programs have similar missions of improving public-facing federal digital services. 18F was created in March 2014 by GSA with the mission of transforming the way the federal government builds and buys digital services. Agencies across the federal government have access to 18F services. Work is largely initiated by agencies seeking assistance from 18F and then the program decides how and if it will provide assistance.

2. The first wave of the baby boom generation will start turning age 65 in 2011 and the last of the boomers will be 65 in 2029.
3. This development will lead to significant changes in the ratio of the working age population to the population age 65 or older.
4. The aged dependency ratio, which is the ratio of workers to retirees, will rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% by 2030.
5. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is not only occurring because of the growing numbers of older persons but also due to the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers over the last decade.
6. Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives to work longer. Social Security provides monthly benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers and their dependents, and to survivors of insured workers. These benefits are the primary source of income (more than 50%) for nearly 57% of the population age 65 and older.
7. In April 2000, the practice of reducing Social Security benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age (currently 65 years and 4 months) was eliminated, at least in part to remove the disincentive to work.
8. Also, the delayed retirement credit for persons who first claim benefits after the normal retirement age is steadily being increased until it reaches 8% per year in 2008.
9. Prior to these increases, those who chose to work beyond normal retirement age might receive less Social Security over their lifetime because the start of their benefit receipt was delayed.
10. Some members of Congress have also put forward proposals that would raise normal retirement age for benefits beyond the current schedule of increases, as well as proposals that increase the early retirement age of 62.

* The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 established the VWP as a pilot program, and the Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act permanently established it in October 2000. The program's purpose is to facilitate the legitimate travel of visitors for business or tourism. By providing visa-free travel to the United States, the program is intended to boost international business and tourism, as well as airline revenues, and create substantial economic benefits to the United States. The program allows State to allocate more resources to visa-issuing posts in countries with higher risk applicant pools. In November 2002, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which established DHS and gave it responsibility for establishing visa policy, including policy for the VWP. Previously, Justice had overall responsibility for managing the program. In July 2004, DHS created the Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit within the Office of International Enforcement and directed that unit to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating VWP countries' adherence to the program's statutory and policy requirements. In September 2007, the office was renamed the Visa Waiver Program Office. To help fulfill its responsibilities, DHS established an interagency working group comprising representatives from State, Justice, and several DHS component agencies and offices, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, Congress has passed several other laws to strengthen border security policies and procedures. For example, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 increased the frequency—from once every 5 years to at least once every 2 years—of mandated assessments of the effect of each country's continued participation in the VWP on U.S. security, law enforcement, and immigration interests. The 9/11 Act also added security requirements for all VWP countries, such as the requirement that countries enter into an agreement with the United States to share information on whether citizens and nationals of that country traveling to the United States represent a threat to the security or welfare of the United States or U.S. citizens. When the Visa Waiver Pilot Program was established in 1986, participation was limited to eight countries. Since then, the VWP has expanded to 36 countries.

• The State Child Welfare System faces significant challenges in keeping pace with the needs of troubled children and their families, particularly in the face of growing caseloads and the need to provide services to families and children.
• The federal government plays a crucial role in financing foster care and establishing procedural requirements for the placement process. States must make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes.
• The foster care system has evolved over the years, with the introduction of case plans, hearings, and temporary placements. However, the state laws do not require a final decision at the first hearing.
• Increasingly, children are being placed with their own relatives, who then may sometimes receive foster care subsidies. The prolonged stays of children in foster care have prompted 26 states to enact laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing.
• Twenty-three states have enacted such laws, while three others have done so by administrative policy. A majority of these states require the hearing within 12 months.
• The state laws, like federal law, do not require a final decision at the first hearing. Ohio and Minnesota, however, do require that a permanency decision be determined after a limited extension period.
• The state data, in part, confirmed this observation. While long-term foster care placements for children supported with state funds dropped from 1,301 in 1990 to 779 in 1995, long-term placements for children from low-income families who are supported in part with federal funds rose from 1,657 to 2,057 in the same period.
• Some states are experimenting with concurrent planning. Under this approach, child welfare officials work toward reuniting a family while developing an alternate plan for permanently removing the child if reunification efforts fail.
• The permanency planning process requires concerted time and effort, coordination, and resources. These officials identified several critical factors required to meet these challenges, including long-term involvement of officials, key stakeholders, and resources.
• The availability of evaluation information from these initiatives would not only point to the relative success or failure of an effort but also help identify unintended outcomes. The lack of program and evaluation data will continue to hinder the ability of program officials and policymakers to fully understand the overall impact of these initiatives.

OSC, an office within Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt, has an agreement with ARC, an office within Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt, to provide contracting support for a fee. This type of fee-for-service procurement process generally involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services. The requiring agency officials determine the goods or services needed and, if applicable, prepare a statement of work, sometimes with the assistance of the ordering agency. The contracting officer at the ordering agency ensures that the contract or order is properly awarded or issued (including any required competition) and administered under applicable regulations and agency requirements. If contract performance will be ongoing, a contracting officer's representative—generally an official at the requiring agency with relevant technical expertise—is normally designated by the contracting officer to monitor the contractor's performance and serve as the liaison between the contracting officer and the contractor. While interagency contracting can offer the benefits of improved efficiency and timeliness, this approach needs to be effectively managed. Due to the challenges associated with interagency contracts, we recently designated interagency contracting as a governmentwide high-risk area. As authorized by OSC’s appropriation, OSC may use 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to hire intermittent consultants. Section 3109 permits agencies, when authorized by an appropriation or other statute, to acquire the temporary or intermittent services of experts or consultants. Under the statute, appointments of experts and consultants may be made without regard to competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements. Individuals appointed under this authority may not be paid in excess of the highest rate payable for a GS-15 unless a higher rate is expressly provided for by statute or an appropriation. Under section 3109, OPM is responsible for prescribing criteria governing circumstances in which it is appropriate to employ an expert or consultant and for prescribing criteria for setting pay. Section 3109 of title 5 and OPM’s implementing regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 304 provide for broad discretion in the appointment of experts and consultants. In promulgating its regulations, OPM recognized that agencies need to obtain outside opinion and expertise to improve federal programs, operations, and services and that by bringing in the talent and insights of experts and consultants, agencies can work more economically and effectively.

446,"* FAA's funding structure is primarily supported by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from a series of excise taxes paid by users of the NAS. The Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through the dedicated excise taxes. In most years, General Fund revenues have been used to fund FAA. The Trust Fund was established by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA's two capital accounts—the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account—which provide grants to airports and funds for modernizing the air traffic control system, respectively. The Trust Fund also provides funding for the Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account and supports part of FAA's Operations account. To fund these accounts, the Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through the dedicated excise taxes. In fiscal year 2006, the ticket tax was the largest single source of Trust Fund revenue, followed by the international departure and arrival tax, the passenger segment tax, and fuel taxes (see table 1 for a description of current taxes). The administration's reauthorization proposal would change FAA's financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges. Under the proposed system, funding for ATO would come primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft. In addition, contributions from the General Fund would be appropriated to FAA to cover ATO costs of providing services to military and other public aircraft, flight service stations, and a few other services. Funding for AIP, EAS, and part of RE&D would come from an equal fuel tax on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers. Funding for Safety and Operations would include some fees, but mostly General Fund contributions. The reauthorization proposal would also create an advisory board and give FAA limited borrowing authority. The proposal calls for changing FAA’s budget structure by establishing two new budget accounts—(1) Air Traffic Organization and (2) Safety and Operations—to align with FAA’s lines of business and proposed funding. These two new accounts would replace the Operations and F&E accounts. The proposal retains the AIP and RE&D accounts.

* GSA's Federal Technology Service (FTS) program for long-distance telecommunications services, including Networx, is responsible for ensuring that federal agencies have access to the telecommunications services and solutions needed to meet mission requirements. The program has two goals: to ensure the best service and price for government, and to maximize competition for services. GSA awarded two contracts for long-distance services in December 1998 and January 1999, with each firm guaranteed minimum revenues of $750 million over the life of the contracts. GSA has periodically reviewed the development and implementation of the FTS2001 program and assessed its progress. The Networx acquisition program, including the awarding of new governmentwide contracts for a broad range of long distance and international voice and data communications services, wireless services, and satellite telecommunications services, is planned to replace the existing FTS2001, Federal Wireless Telecommunications Service, and FTS Satellite Service contracts. GSA and the IMC have identified five goals for the Networx acquisition program: Meet agency needs for a comprehensive acquisition that provides continuity of current telecommunications services and solutions, obtain best value for all services and solutions, encourage strong competition for the initial contract award(s), ensure continuous competition throughout the life of the program, and provide agency access to a broad range of services and service providers. GSA has established program goals, but has not yet defined a comprehensive set of corresponding performance measures for the Networx acquisition program.

* The public faces a high risk that critical services provided by the government and the private sector could be severely disrupted by the Year 2000 computing crisis. Financial transactions could be delayed, flights grounded, power lost, and national defense affected. Moreover, America's infrastructures are a complex array of public and private enterprises with many interdependencies at all levels. These many interdependencies among governments and within key economic sectors could cause a single failure to have adverse repercussions. Key economic sectors that could be seriously affected if their systems are not Year 2000 compliant include information and telecommunications; banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; power and water; and manufacturing and small business. The information and telecommunications sector is especially important. In testimony in June, we reported that the Year 2000 readiness of the telecommunications sector is one of the most crucial concerns to our nation because telecommunications are critical to the operations of nearly every public-sector and private-sector organization. For example, the information and telecommunications sector (1) enables the electronic transfer of funds, the distribution of electrical power, and the control of gas and oil pipeline systems, (2) is essential to the service economy, manufacturing, and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods, and (3) is basic to responsive emergency services. Reliable telecommunications services are made possible by a complex web of highly interconnected networks supported by national and local carriers and service providers, equipment manufacturers and suppliers, and customers. In addition to the risks associated with the nation’s key economic sectors, one of the largest, and largely unknown, risks relates to the global nature of the problem. With the advent of electronic communication and international commerce, the United States and the rest of the world have become critically dependent on computers. However, there are indications of Year 2000 readiness problems in the international arena. For example, a June 1998 informal World Bank survey of foreign readiness found that only 18 of 127 countries (14 percent) had a national Year 2000 program, 28 countries (22 percent) reported working on the problem, and 16 countries (13 percent) reported only awareness of the problem. No conclusive data were received from the remaining 65 countries surveyed (51 percent).

The survey of large sponsors of DB pension plans revealed that they have made revisions to their benefit offerings over the last 10 years or so. Respondents reported that they modified benefit formulas, converted some plans to hybrid plans, or froze some plans. For example, 81% of responding sponsors reported that they modified the formulas of one or more of their DB plans. Respondents were asked to report changes for plans or benefits that covered only nonbargaining employees, as well as to report on plans or benefits that covered bargaining unit employees. Fifty-eight% of respondents who reported on plans for collective- bargaining employees indicated that they had generally increased the generosity of their DB plan formulas between January 1997 and the time of their response (see app. I, slide 12). In contrast, 48% of respondents reporting on plans for their nonbargaining employees had generally decreased the generosity of their DB plan formulas since 1997. “Unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements” was the key reason cited for having changed the benefit formulas of plans covering nonbargaining employees (see app. I, slide 14). “Global or domestic competitive pressures” in their industry was the key reason cited for the changes to the plans covering collectively bargained employees (see app. I, slide 13). With regard to plans for bargaining employees, a number of the sponsors who offered reasons for changes to bargaining unit plans also volunteered an additional reason for having modified their plans covering bargaining employees. Specifically, these sponsors wrote that inflation or a cost-of- living adjustment was a key reason for their increase to the formula. This suggests that such plans were flat-benefit plans that may have a benefit structure that was increased annually as part of a bargaining agreement. Meanwhile, sponsors were far more likely to report that they had converted a DB plan covering nonbargaining unit employees to a hybrid plan design than to have converted DB plans covering collectively bargained employees. For example, 52% of respondents who reported on plans for nonbargaining unit employees had converted one or more of their traditional plans to a cash balance or other hybrid arrangement (see app. I, slide 15).

* SEC oversees mutual funds primarily through its Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), Division of Investment Management, and Division of Enforcement. OCIE examines mutual funds to evaluate their compliance with federal securities laws, assess their effectiveness, and determine if they are operating in accordance with disclosures made to investors. The Division of Investment Management administers the securities laws affecting funds and advisers. It reviews disclosure documents that mutual funds are required to file with SEC and engages in other regulatory activities, such as rulemaking, responding to requests for exemptions from federal securities laws, and providing interpretation of those laws. Finally, SEC’s Division of Enforcement investigates and prosecutes violations of securities laws related to mutual funds. SEC regulates mutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Investment Company Act was passed specifically to regulate mutual funds and other types of investment companies. Under the act, mutual funds are required to register with SEC, subjecting their activities to SEC regulation. The act also imposes requirements on the operation and structure of mutual funds. Its core objectives are to ensure that investors receive adequate and accurate information about mutual funds, protect the integrity of fund assets, prohibit abusive forms of self-dealing, prevent the issuance of securities that have inequitable or ensure the fair valuation of investor purchases and redemptions. The Investment Advisers Act requires mutual fund advisers to register with SEC, imposes reporting requirements on them, and prohibits them from engaging in fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative practices. The Securities Act requires fund shares offered to the public to be registered with SEC and regulates mutual fund advertising. Under the Securities Act and Investment Company Act, SEC has adopted rules to require mutual funds to make extensive disclosures in their prospectuses. The Securities Exchange Act, among other things, regulates how funds are sold and requires persons distributing funds or executing fund transactions to be registered with SEC as broker-dealers.

• Medicare is a federal health insurance program designed to assist elderly and disabled beneficiaries. Hospital insurance, or part A, covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and certain home health services. Supplemental medical insurance, or part B, covers physician and outpatient hospital services, laboratory and other services. Claims are paid by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers. Intermediaries process claims from hospitals and other institutional providers under part A while carriers process part B claims. The intermediaries’ and carriers’ responsibilities include: reviewing and paying claims; maintaining program safeguards to prevent inappropriate payment; and educating and responding to provider and beneficiary concerns. Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from that of most federal programs. Most federal agencies, under the Competition in Contracting Act and its implementing regulations known as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), generally may contract with any qualified entity for any authorized purpose so long as that entity is not debarred from government contracting and the contract is not for what is essentially a government function. Agencies are to use contractors that have a track record of successful past performance or that demonstrate a current superior ability to perform. The FAR generally requires agencies to conduct full and open competition for contracts and allows contractors to earn profits. Medicare, however, is authorized to deviate from the FAR under provisions of the Social Security Act enacted in 1965. For example, there is no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts. Rather, intermediaries are selected in a process called nomination by provider associations, such as the American Hospital Association. When one of the local Blue plans declines to renew its subcontract, the Association nominates the replacement contractor. Carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers, and the number of such companies seeking Medicare claims-processing work has been dwindling in recent years. The Social Security Act also generally calls for the use of cost-based reimbursement contracts under which contractors are reimbursed for necessary and proper costs of carrying out Medicare activities but does not expressly provide for profit. Further, Medicare contractors cannot be terminated from the program unless they are first provided with an opportunity for a public hearing––a process not afforded under the FAR. Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms. Freeing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities able to perform needed tasks would enable Medicare to benefit from efficiency and performance improvements related to competition. It also could address concerns about the dwindling number of insurers",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The major requirements for the protection of personal privacy by federal agencies are specified in two laws, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) also addresses the protection of personal information in the context of securing federal agency information and information systems. The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies’ collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act describes a “record” as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her name or another personal identifier. It also defines “system of records” as a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public by a “system-of-records notice”: that is, a notice in the Federal Register identifying, among other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is collected, the intended “routine” uses of data, and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct personal information. Among other provisions, the act also requires agencies to define and limit themselves to specific predefined purposes. For example, the act requires that to the greatest extent practicable, personal information should be collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an individual’s rights or benefits under a federal program. The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee; these principles were intended to address what the committee termed a poor level of protection afforded to privacy under contemporary law. Since that time, the Fair Information Practices have been widely adopted as a standard benchmark for evaluating the adequacy of privacy protections. Attachment 2 contains a summary of the widely used version of the Fair Information Practices adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 1980. The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems and information collections by requiring that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA). A PIA is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system. More specifically, according",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

• While many estates are kept open for legitimate reasons, we found that FSA field offices do not systematically determine the eligibility of all estates kept open for more than 2 years, as regulations require. When they do conduct eligibility determinations, the quality of the determinations varies. Without performing annual determinations, an essential management control, FSA cannot identify estates being kept open primarily to receive these payments and be assured that the payments are proper. Generally, under the 1987 Act, once a person dies, farm program payments may continue to that person’s estate under certain conditions. For most farm program payments, USDA regulations allow an estate to receive payments for the first 2 years after the death of the individual if the estate meets certain eligibility requirements for active engagement in farming. However, FSA must annually determine that the estate is still active and that obtaining farm program payments is not the primary reason it remains open. Despite these limitations, FSA field offices in 16 of the 26 states we reviewed made less than one-half of the required determinations of their estates from 1999 to 2005. The percentage of estates reviewed by FSA ranged from 0 to 100 percent in the states we reviewed. FSA field officials also found that FSA lacked sufficient personnel and time, and competing priorities for carrying out farm programs, which explains why many determinations were either not conducted or not conducted thoroughly. Despite these shortcomings, officials told us that they would investigate these cases for potential receipt of improper payments and would start collection proceedings if they found improper payments. FSA cannot be assured that millions of dollars in farm program payments it made to thousands of deceased individuals from fiscal years 1999 through 2005 were proper because it does not have appropriate management controls, such as computer matching, to verify that it is not making payments to deceased individuals. In particular, FSA is not matching recipients listed in its payment databases with individuals listed as deceased in the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File. In addition, complex farming operations, such as corporations or general partnerships, make it difficult for FSA to prevent improper payments to deceased individuals. FSA paid $1.1 billion in farm program payments in the names of 172,801 deceased individuals—either as individuals or as members of entities, from fiscal years 1999 through 2005, according to our matching of FSA’s payment databases with the Social Security",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

During fiscal years 1993-98, the United States funded rule of law programs and related activities in countries throughout the world. Over this period, rule of law assistance totaled at least $970 million. Figure 1 illustrates the worldwide U.S. rule of law funding for fiscal years 1993-98. Over the period, the total annual rule of law funding increased from $128 million to $218 million. Although funding appears to have declined substantially in 1996, this may be largely explained by the fact that USAID could not readily provide rule of law funding information for fiscal year 1996 due to problems with its automated information system. On a regional basis, the Latin America and the Caribbean region received the largest share, with about 36 percent. Africa, Central Europe, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union received about 15 percent each. (See table 1.) From fiscal year 1993 to 1998, rule of law funding shifted primarily from the Latin America and the Caribbean region to other regions, mainly Central Europe. Funding for Central Europe grew from about $9 million in fiscal year 1993 to over $67 million in fiscal year 1998, accounting for 31 percent of the worldwide rule of law assistance that year. Over the same period, rule of law assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean declined from about $57 million (44 percent of the worldwide total) to $42 million (19 percent). Rule of law assistance to Africa also declined from $38 million (30 percent of the worldwide total) in 1993 to $29 million (13 percent) in 1998.

Over the last 2 decades, the number of school-aged children with limited English proficiency in the nation has grown dramatically, increasing from less than 1 million in 1980 to more than 3.5 million in 1998. Despite small rates of growth in the total enrollment of all K-12 children, the enrollment of school-aged children with limited English proficiency across the United States grew exponentially between school years 1989-90 and 1997-98 (see fig. 1). While California, Florida, New York, and Texas continue to have the largest number of children with limited English proficiency (see fig. 2), other states that previously had small populations of such children have experienced large increases in recent years. For example, in Alabama, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee, the number of children with limited English proficiency more than doubled between school years 1992-93 and 1997-98 (see fig. 3). In 1968, the Congress passed the Bilingual Education Act (BEA). The purpose of the BEA is to educate students with limited English proficiency so that they can reach the academic standards expected of all students. The 1994 reauthorization of BEA created the four bilingual education grant programs—Program Development and Implementation Grants (PDI), Program Enhancement Projects (Enhancement), Comprehensive School Grants (Comprehensive), and Systemwide Improvement Grants (Systemwide)—to distribute funds directly to school districts serving children with limited English proficiency. These are the only federal programs that specifically target instructional services to children with limited English proficiency. In addition to the four federally funded bilingual education programs authorized by the BEA, other federal programs also address the special needs of these children though they do not exclusively target this population. For example, Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which gave $8.7 billion in fiscal year 2000 to assist school districts educating disadvantaged students, is the largest federal program that includes support for children with limited English proficiency. However, most services for children with limited English proficiency are funded with local and state—not federal—dollars. Education’s Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs (OBEMLA) administers the four competitive bilingual education grant programs. The cost of administering these programs is funded through Education’s program administration account, while funding for the program grants is included in OBEMLA’s",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '*'}"

To achieve this, the report validated the results of 1 service center's test of the accuracy and timeliness of refunds by reviewing 853 randomly selected refunds; analyzing filing season-related data from IRS' Management Information System for Top Level Executives and IRS data on processing errors, including those involving the EIC; reviewed IRS reports on refund fraud; reviewed computer system availability reports and attended weekly operational meetings held by IRS' National Office Command Center; assessed the availability of tax materials by visiting 10 walk-in sites; tested taxpayers' access to ordering forms and publications from IRS' 3 tax material distribution centers by placing phone calls to those centers; analyzed IRS' toll-free telephone system accessibility data, telephone activity data for area distribution centers, and telephone accessibility reports for the TeleFile system; compiled trend data for various indicators of IRS' filing season performance; and interviewed IRS National Office officials and IRS officials in the Atlanta; Cincinnati; Fresno, CA; and Kansas City, MO, Service Centers responsible for the various activities we assessed.

• The rapid and widespread increase in the use of crack—a smokable form of cocaine—has been referred to as a drug epidemic. To identify emerging drug use problems, researchers and government agencies look for changes in drug use patterns. <br>
• Primary among these patterns are the use of a new illicit drug; a change in how a drug is taken, such as smoking rather than inhaling or ""snorting""—cocaine; a change in the level of use of an existing drug among populations that routinely abuse drugs; and the use of a new population group or in a different geographic area. Some experts argue that national drug epidemics are rare, while others agree that local areas more frequently experience emerging drug crises or epidemics before they spread. <br>
• Many federal agencies fund activities and programs that implement the nation's drug control strategy (see app. II). <br>
• About two-thirds of federal drug control funds are channeled into efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs; the remaining one-third supports efforts to reduce drug demand. <br>
• The Department of Justice obtains the largest proportion—about 45 percent—and HHS gets about 16 percent. <br>
• Within HHS, NIDA and SAMHSA currently have primary responsibility for health-related drug control problems. <br>
• SAMHSA also assumes primary responsibility for the service programs and some drug use detection functions. <br>
• SAMHSA also assumed responsibility for overseeing state administration of the block grant programs. <br>
• In the 1970s, NIDA sponsored several surveys and convened a work group of epidemiologists from cities around the country to help identify and monitor changes in drug use patterns. Through these mechanisms, NIDA was able to detect that cocaine was being smoked as well as snorted—the more common method of cocaine use up to that time. This change was later associated with the emergence of the crack epidemic. <br>
• From DAWN data, NIDA found that, between 1976 and 1982, cocaine smoking accounted for about 2 percent of cocaine-related emergency department episodes; however, by 1985, cocaine smoking accounted for 8 percent of such episodes.

These programs, including the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT), and Manufacturing Technology Program (MANTECH), aim to speed up the transition of technologies developed by DOD's S&T programs into acquisition programs. The programs have been implemented in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, with the ACTD program receiving $64 million in funding. The programs have demonstrated benefits in terms of improved performance, cost savings, and operational capability for the warfighter.

• The MAF is a data file that contains a list of all known living quarters in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Bureau uses the MAF to support the decennial census as well as the American Community Survey and other ongoing demographic surveys. The MAF contains address information, census geographic location codes, and source and history data. In conjunction with the MAF, the TIGER contains spatial geographical information that allows information from the MAF to be mapped. For the 2010 Census, the Bureau updated the MAF through a complete address canvassing that verified virtually every existing MAF address and added new addresses and deleted those that no longer exist. While full address canvassing helped ensure the accuracy of the address list, we believe it was also very costly. According to Bureau decision documents leading up to the 2010 Census, the Bureau canceled planned research on the feasibility of targeting its canvassing when prioritizing its research agenda early in the decade given its funding levels. As part of the Bureau’s effort to conduct the 2020 Census at a cost lower than the 2010 Census, the Bureau is researching the feasibility of conducting targeted address canvassing, verifying addresses in only select areas that are more likely to require updates to the address list. To support targeted address canvassing, the Bureau plans to increase its reliance on other previously used sources of updates, including U.S. Postal Service files, commercial database files, and significant input from state and local governments. For example, GSS-I is working to allow government agencies at all levels to more regularly share and update their address lists with the Bureau throughout the decade (rather than solely 2 years prior to the decennial, as had been the case in prior decennial censuses) so that fewer areas need to be fully canvassed. The life cycle for 2020 Census preparation is divided into five phases, as illustrated in figure 1. The Bureau intends to use the early research and testing phase through fiscal year 2015 to develop a proposal for conducting targeted address canvassing that considers both cost and quality implications. By the end of the early research and testing phase, the Bureau plans to complete decisions about preliminary operational designs rather than continuing critical research and testing until the end of the decade as it did for the 2010 Census. The Bureau faces legally mandated deadlines for delivering census tabulations. Effective scheduling is critical for ensuring that the Bureau adheres to a timeline that meets these deadlines.",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_subpoints': 2, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The Clean Air Act, a federal law, has been implemented to improve and protect the quality of the nation's air. The act was substantially overhauled in 1970, and EPA has set national ambient air quality standards for pollutants at levels that are necessary to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety and to protect public welfare from adverse effects. EPA has established standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. In addition, the act directed the states to specify how they would achieve and maintain compliance with the national standard for each pollutant. The Congress amended the act again in 1990. The major provisions of the 1990 amendments are contained in the first six titles. As requested, this report addresses EPA’s actions related to Titles I, III, and IV: Title I establishes a detailed and graduated program for the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards; Title III expands and modifies regulations of hazardous air pollutant emissions and establishes a list of 189 hazardous air pollutants to be regulated; Title IV establishes the acid deposition control program to reduce the adverse effects of acid rain by reducing the annual emissions of pollutants that contribute to it. Although the Clean Air Act is a federal law, states and local governments are responsible for carrying out certain portions of the statute. For example, states are responsible for developing implementation plans that describe how they will come into compliance with national standards set by EPA. EPA must approve each state’s plan, and if an implementation plan is not acceptable, EPA may assume enforcement of the Clean Air Act in that state. Once EPA sets a national standard, it is generally up to state and local air pollution control agencies to enforce the standard, with oversight from EPA. For example, state air pollution control agencies may hold hearings on permit applications by power or chemical plants. States may also fine companies for violating air pollution limits. According to EPA, by many measures, the quality of the nation’s air has improved in recent years. Each year EPA estimates emissions that impact the ambient concentrations of the six major air pollutants for which EPA sets national ambient air quality standards. EPA uses these annual emissions estimates as one indicator of the effectiveness of its air programs. As shown in figure 1, between 1970 and 2004, gross domestic product, vehicle miles traveled, energy consumption, and U.S. population all grew; however, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by ",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

The U.S.-Oman FTA is the fifth U.S. bilateral free trade agreement with a country in the proposed Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA). MEFTA would consist of 16 entities in the Middle East and four in North Africa. The entire proposed MEFTA is included in the map in Figure 1, with Oman, heavily shaded, in the lower right hand corner. Completion of a MEFTA by 2013 was proposed by President George W. Bush in 2003, as part of a plan to fight terrorism by supporting Middle East economic growth and democracy through trade. To date, besides Oman, the Administration has negotiated and Congress has implemented free trade agreements with four other MEFTA political entities: Israel and Jordan (before MEFTA was announced), Morocco, and Bahrain. A sixth FTA is being negotiated with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Congressional consideration of the U.S.-Oman FTA is governed by the timeline set forth in the Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210). Under this law, which lays out the President's trade promotion authority (TPA), the President must give Congress a 90-day prenotification of his intent to enter into the trade agreement. After that, the President must submit to Congress—under no particular time constraints, but on a day when both houses of Congress are in session—both the agreement itself and the implementing legislation. Any House or Senate committees to which the legislation is referred will have 45 days to report (or not report) the bill; and each house has 15 days after the bill is reported (or the 45 days expire) to consider the legislation. If the House passes its bill to the Senate, the Senate has an additional 15 days to consider the legislation. Floor debate in either house is limited to 20 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. For final passage, both houses must vote the legislation up or down by a simple majority, and neither the implementing legislation nor the agreement itself may be amended. Figure 1.

* Increasing the net capital loss deduction would increase the rewards of gaming the system. The empirical evidence indicates that capital gains income is heavily concentrated in the upper income ranges. It is probable that large capital losses are also concentrated in the same income ranges. Taxpayers in the middle income ranges tend to hold capital gains producing assets as part of tax favored retirement savings plans. The benefits of increasing the net capital loss deduction would tend to accrue to taxpayers in the upper income ranges. It is also unclear whether increasing the net loss deduction would stimulate the economy. Economic analysis suggests that measures to stimulate the economy should focus on spending or on tax cuts likely to be spent, that will directly increase aggregate demand. An expanded deduction for capital losses has a tenuous connection to expanded spending; thus, presumably, the argument is that such a tax benefit will benefit the stock market. However, it is not at all certain that an increase in loss deduction would increase the stock market; it might increase sales of poorly performing stocks and depress these markets further. This report provides an overview of these issues related to the tax treatment of capital losses. It explains the current income tax treatment of losses, describes the historical treatment of losses, provides examples of the tax gaming opportunities associated with the net loss deduction, examines the distributional issues, and discusses the possible stimulative effects of an increase in the net loss deduction. Under current income tax law, a capital gain or loss is the result of a sale or exchange of a capital asset (such as corporate stock or real estate). If the asset is sold for a higher price than its acquisition price, then the sale produces a capital gain. If the asset is sold for a lower price than its acquisition price, then the sale produces a capital loss. Capital assets held longer than 12 months are considered long-term assets while assets held 12 months or less are considered short-term assets. Capital gains on short-term assets are taxed at regular income tax rates. Gains on long-term assets sold or exchanged on or after May 6, 2003, and before January 1, 2013, are taxed at a maximum tax rate of 15%. For these assets, the maximum long-term capital gains tax rate is 0% for individuals in the 10% and 15% regular marginal income tax rate brackets. Losses on the sales of capital assets are fully deductible against the gains from the sales of capital assets.

* The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) recognizes the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing. By ""encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining,"" the Act attempts to mitigate and eliminate labor-related obstructions to the free flow of commerce. Although union membership has declined dramatically since the 1950s, congressional interest in the NLRA remains significant. In the 112th Congress, over 30 bills have been introduced to amend the NLRA. Some of these bills address the timing of union representation elections, while others are concerned with varying aspects of the NLRA, such as the activities of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which implements and administers the Act. Since the NLRA's enactment in 1935, the NLRB and the courts have considered a variety of issues arising under the Act. This report reviews selected decisions of the NLRB and the courts that involve topics that continue to be relevant for employers and unions during the collective bargaining process. The right to engage in collective bargaining under the NLRA does not apply to all individuals employed by an employer. Rather, the right extends only to ""employees."" Section 2(3) of the NLRA states that an employee ""shall include any employee ... but shall not include any individual ... employed as a supervisor."" An employee's job title does not determine whether an individual is a supervisor for purposes of the NLRA. Instead, the term ""supervisor"" is defined by the Act to include any individual with the authority to perform any one of 12 specified functions, if the exercise of such authority requires the use of independent judgment and is not merely routine or clerical. Section 2(11) of the NLRA states: The term ""supervisor"" means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment. Because the 12 functions and the term ""independent judgment"" are not further defined, the NLRB and U.S. Supreme Court have sought to provide meaning to this language. In NLRB v.

Although it usually readsopts most provisions of its rules from the previous Congress, the House also changes some aspects of its procedures for each new Congress. Rules X-XIII are the primary House rules that govern the authority and operations of House committees and subcommittees. Because the committees are the agents of the House, they are obligated to comply with all House directives that apply to them. However, in some respects the House allows each of its committees to decide for itself how to conduct its business. For this purpose, each committee is required to adopt written rules that ""may not be inconsistent"" with House rules and applicable rule-making provisions of law. For convenience, the committee's rules are to incorporate applicable provisions of clause 2 of Rule XI. The meeting at which the committee adopts its rules is to be open to the public unless in open session the committee votes, by roll call and with a quorum present, to close part or all of the meeting. The rules that a committee adopts are to be published in the Congressional Record not later than thirty days after the committee members are elected at the beginning of a Congress.

• The AMT provides an alternative tax calculation on a broader tax base than the regular tax. Individuals add back various provisions, including not only business provisions but also certain itemized deductions (mainly state and local taxes, some medical expenses, and miscellaneous deductions). After an exemption of $45,000 for joint returns and $33,750 for single returns, the first $175,000 is taxed at 26% and the remainder at 28%. Exemptions are phased out. The AMT base is broader than the regular tax base, but there are many provisions that are not included in its base, notably the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds. The elimination of the capital gains exclusion in 1986 caused a significant contraction in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT; the current rate preferences are not part of the AMT. Credits are automatically included in the base (i.e., effectively disallowed), although under provisions adopted as part of H.R. 1836 , this rule does not apply to the most important credit, the child credit. • The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation. The result has been an increase in the number of taxpayers who are covered by the AMT. • In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, constituting 1/10 of one percent of all returns filed. This number was below the 4/10 of a percent of returns that paid the tax in 1984 and fell largely because the deduction for capital gains was eliminated by the 1986 tax act and therefore automatically affected coverage under the AMT. • The AMT coverage has increased over time, with the AMT covering 823,000 returns, constituting 6/10 of a percent of all returns filed, an increase in percentage share of 600% between 1987 and 1999. This effect occurred eventhough the exemptions were increased in 1990. • The AMT would probably constitute a larger share of joint returns filed, since incomes are higher for these returns than for single returns. The AMT would also constitute a larger portion of returns with tax liability; since typically about a quarter of returns filed pay no tax, taxpayers on the AMT would constitute over 8% of",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 2, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate are tasked with drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six small related agencies. Title I of the annual THUD appropriations bill generally funds DOT. The department is primarily a grant-making and regulatory organization. Its programs are organized roughly by mode of transportation, providing grants to state and local government agencies to support the construction of highways, transit, airport, and intercity passenger rail infrastructure, while overseeing safety in all modes of transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is exceptional among DOT's large sub-agencies in that the largest portion of its budget is not for grants but for operating the U.S. air traffic control system. In support of that task, it employs over 80% of DOT's total workforce, roughly 46,000 of DOT's approximately 56,000 employees. Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill generally funds HUD. The department's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs—Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance—account for the majority of the department's funding. Two block grant programs—the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)—help communities finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families. Other, more specialized grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons, including those with AIDS. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by lenders to homebuyers with low down payments, often first-time homebuyers, and to buyers and developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill generally funds a collection of agencies involved in transportation or housing and community development. They include the Access Board, the Federal Maritime Commission, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Amtrak Office of Inspector General (IG), the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (often referred to as NeighborWorks), the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the costs associated with the government conservatorship and regulation of the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

* India-Iran relations have traditionally been positive and, in January 2003, the two countries launched a ""strategic partnership"" with the signing of the ""New Delhi Declaration"" and seven other substantive agreements. Indian leaders regularly speak of ""civilizational ties"" between the two countries, a reference to the interactions of Persian and Indus Valley civilizations over a period of millennia. As U.S. relations with India grow deeper and more expansive in the new century, some in Washington believe that New Delhi's friendship with Tehran could become a significant obstacle to further development of U.S.-India ties. However, India-Iran relations have not evolved into a strategic alliance and are unlikely to derail the further development of a U.S.-India global partnership. At the same time, given a clear Indian interest in maintaining positive ties with Iran, especially in the area of energy commerce, New Delhi is unlikely to abandon its relationship with Tehran, or accept dictation on the topic from external powers. Many in Congress voice concern about India's relations with Iran and their relevance to U.S. interests. Some worry about New Delhi's defense relations with Tehran and have sought to link this with congressional approval of U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation. There are further U.S. concerns that India plans to seek energy resources from Iran, thus benefiting financially a country the United States seeks to isolate. Indian firms have in recent years taken long-term contracts for purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and India supports proposed construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan. The Bush Administration expresses strong opposition to any pipeline projects involving Iran, but top Indian officials insist the project is in India's national interest.

Of immediate interest to some Member of Congress are press reports on Iranian naval ships visiting India's Kochi port for ""training.""

Such concerns include the proposed gas pipeline. Secretary of Energy Sam Bodman, visiting New Delhi in March 2007, reiterated U.S. opposition to the pipeline project.

550,"* The federal government first supported a program for energy storage and electric power system technology during the 1970s, before the establishment of the Department of Energy (DOE). In those early days, the program was focused mainly on energy storage—especially to even out the variable power production from rapidly growing use of wind and solar technologies—but also to support large coal and nuclear power plants. The advancement of computer capacity, miniaturization, and industrial controls has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows. The subsequent increase in networking of computerized devices for grid data collection and control advanced the ability of operators to anticipate, avoid, and otherwise mitigate potential power crises, such as blackouts. However, in more recent years, Internet-connected networks have become vulnerable to unwanted computer-driven intrusions and disruptions, revealing a new cybersecurity challenge for electric power systems. The nation's energy infrastructure is diverse. It includes a variety of transmission and distribution system network structures (electricity, oil, and natural gas), an array of operating models (public and private), and a variety of hardware and software. The energy sector consists of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically. Thus, interdependency within the sector and across the nation's critical energy infrastructure sectors is significant. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the virtually borderless nature of energy use and the reliance on predominantly privately-owned infrastructure. Key challenges and opportunities facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure (transmission, storage, distribution, and generation); modernizing and securing communication networks (e.g., analog to digital); accommodating new end-use technologies (for solar and other distributed resources); planning for increased interdependencies of natural gas, water, and electricity systems; and devising business models to manage the challenges while providing reliable and affordable electricity. These activities are constrained by the need for cost control, physical security, cybersecurity, improved system resiliency, and the flexibility to adapt to weather and market uncertainties. Further opportunities arise from growing use of shale gas production and decreasing costs for information technologies which allow improved grid control and more opportunities for customer management of power use. The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is charged with a mission to support more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure. To achieve that mission, OE supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through research and development (R&D), demonstration projects, partnerships, facilitation",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '*'}"

• The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) that serves as the executive branch's principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology policies. It frequently works with other executive branch agencies to develop and present the Administration's position on key policy matters. It represents the executive branch in both domestic and international telecommunications and information policy activities. The NTIA acts as the representative of the Administration in both domestic and international spectrum management negotiations. It oversees the transfer of some radio frequencies from the federal domain to the commercial domain. Many of these frequencies have subsequently been auctioned to the commercial sector and the proceeds paid into the U.S. Treasury. The NTIA administers some grants programs, including—Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) grant program. As required by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96), the NTIA is in the process of establishing requirements for a $135 million grant program to help states plan for participation in a new, nationwide public safety broadband network. To deploy the new network, the act established the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) within the NTIA and assigned the agency various responsibilities to support FirstNet. The NTIA fulfills many responsibilities for different constituencies. Its role in federal spectrum management includes acting as a facilitator and mediator in negotiations among the various federal agencies regarding usage, priority access, causes of interference, and other radio spectrum questions. As the agency responsible for managing spectrum used by federal agencies, the NTIA often works in consultation with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on matters concerning spectrum access, technology, and policy. The NTIA leads and participates in interagency efforts to develop Internet policy. It plays a lead role in the DOC's Internet Policy Task Force. The NTIA and the National Institute of Standards (NIST) have adjoining facilities on the Department of Commerce campus in Boulder, CO, where they collaborate on research projects with each other and with other federal agencies, such as the FCC. The NTIA works with the Rural Utilities Service in coordinating loans and grants made through BTOP and with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in overseeing grants made through the PSIC grants program. The NTIA collaborates with NIST, DHS, and the FCC in providing expertise and guidance to public safety agencies who are using PSIC or",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The Robinson-Patman Act, enacted in 1936, was designed to create a market atmosphere in which small business could compete effectively, at least in the purchase of commodities, with its larger rivals. The immediate impetus for the Depression-era legislation was concern for smaller grocery store operators who complained that their businesses were suffering as the activities of chain grocery stores generally and the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P) particularly. The Act prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality,"" where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or sale within the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with the customers of either of them. The Act was enacted to remedy injury to competitors rather than a generalized injury to competition itself. The Act was not beneficial to consumers, and was not widely viewed by the Department of Justice. The Act was entrusted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce it, and the FTC has consistently enforced the Act inconsistently. The Act was not repealed in its entirety, but was amended in 1977 to include the Nonprofit Institutions Act, which created a broad exemption from the general price-discrimination prohibition.

* The Obama Administration has faced significant scrutiny following a series of determinations in which the relevant federal agency charged with the implementation of a given statute chose to limit or delay the enforcement of specific provisions of federal law. These nonenforcement, under enforcement, or delayed enforcement decisions have generally been implemented through stated agency policies directing officials not to take action to ensure compliance with statutory requirements that federal law imposes upon a third party. Notably, these policies have been grounded in practical or policy considerations, and have not been based on any argument that the statutory provisions themselves are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Instead, the Administration has largely justified its inaction as consistent with a proper exercise of enforcement discretion, a legal doctrine that generally shields executive branch enforcement decisions, including the determination of whether to initiate a criminal, civil, or administrative enforcement action, from judicial review. This report focuses on two distinct forms of enforcement discretion: prosecutorial discretion, exercised in the criminal context; and administrative enforcement discretion, exercised in the administrative context. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has cited prosecutorial discretion as the basis for its efforts to curtail the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in states that have adopted both medical and recreational marijuana legalization initiatives. Although the possession, cultivation, or distribution of marijuana remains a clear federal crime, the DOJ has directed federal prosecutors to ""not focus federal resources [] on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana."" Rather, U.S. Attorneys have been directed to prioritize investigative and prosecutorial resources on persons whose actions relate to identified federal priorities such as distribution to minors, the participation of criminal enterprises and cartels, or the use of marijuana on federal property. In 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security relied on the doctrine of administrative enforcement discretion in a memorandum setting forth guidelines on how to ""enforce the Nation's immigration laws against certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home."" The directive provided that, rather than use limited agency removal resources on low priority deportation cases, immigration officers should exercise their discretion to forego enforcement actions, for at least a period of time, against a specific class of individuals who unlawfully entered the United States as children, have not committed certain crimes, and meet other key requirements. In 2013 and 2014, the Administration utilized enforcement discretion to justify delays in the enforcement of a number of provisions of the Affordable care act (ACA",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '*'}"

561,"• Campus-based financial aid programs, including FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loan, were created under the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide supplemental financial aid to students who demonstrated financial need. These programs operate alongside other federal aid programs and benefit students with varying degrees of need. The campus-based programs are unique in that they are designed to provide aid to students who are eligible for other federal aid programs, such as Pell Grants and Direct Loans. The campus-based programs are considered campus-based because federal funds are awarded directly to participating institutions, rather than being allocated to individual IHEs. The campus-based programs' authorizations of appropriations, along with many other provisions under the HEA, expired at the end of FY2015. The FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, most recently through the Continuing Appropriations Act 2018 (P.L. 115-56), which extended funding for the programs through December 8, 2017. The Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 (Extension Act; P.L. 114-105 ). The Extension Act prohibits future appropriations for the Perkins Loan program and prohibits an automatic extension of it under the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA; P.L. 90-247, as amended). The campus-based programs are among the oldest of the federal financial aid programs. As federal aid has largely transitioned to a system that allows for ""portability"" in receipt of student aid, meaning that most forms of aid are made available to students at whichever participating institution a student chooses to attend, the campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort. For example, of the approximately $125 billion of federal aid that was made available to students through programs authorized under the HEA in FY2016, 76% was through the Direct Loan program, 21% through the Pell Grant program, and 2% through the campus-based aid programs. The HEA authorizes most of the federal programs that provide direct financial aid to postsecondary students. As lawmakers consider reauthorization of the HEA, several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered. These include the extent to which the campus-based programs provide types of aid that are not provided via other postsecondary aid programs, whether",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

* Perkins IV, the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006, amends and revises the Perkins Act. It authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for FY2007-FY2012 for Perkins Act programs and activities. The act refers to career and technical education (CTE) rather than vocational and technical education. Perkins IV retains the overall purpose of the act, making technical changes. It retains the overall structure of the Perkins Act. Sections 1 through 9 deal with certain overarching provisions, such as purposes of the act (Section 2), definitions that apply throughout the act (Section 3), and authorization of appropriations (Section 9). Title I of the act authorizes and specifies the central provisions of the act dealing with assistance to states for career and technical education. Title I-A deals with allotments and allocations. Title I-B specifies state provisions. Title I-C details local provisions. Title II of the act authorizes the tech-prep program. Title III contains general provisions related to federal administration of the program (Part A) and state administration (Part B). Section 9 of P.L. 109-270 authorizes appropriations for Title I of the act, except for three sections that have separate authorizations: Section 114, dealing with national activities; Section 117, authorizing funding for tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institutions; and Section 118, authorizing funds for occupational and employment information. Perkins IV, like previous versions of the act, requires the Secretary of Education (Secretary) to reserve amounts for certain purposes from funds appropriated under Section 9. However, as shown in Table 2, Perkins IV makes several changes in these reservations to reflect certain changes in the act. The amount reserved for assistance for outlying areas has been reduced from 0.2% of funds appropriated under Section 9 to 0.13%. This reduced percentage reflects the fact that two freely associated states (FASs)—Micronesia and the Marshall Islands—are no longer eligible for Perkins funding because the United States and these FASs have signed an agreement to extend their Compacts of Free Association. In addition, P.L. 109-270 increases the amount of direct grants to outlying areas (Section 115).

• The United States and New Zealand have returned to a high level of security cooperation, forging a new security partnership between the two countries. The two nations, which fought together in many of America's wars and established the Australia-New Zealand-United States (ANZUS) alliance in 1951, are once again close security partners in the Asia Pacific and beyond. New Zealand's nuclear policies in the mid-1980s that prohibited nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered ships from entering New Zealand ports led the United States to restrict bilateral defense cooperation with New Zealand. For many years this difference largely defined the relationship between the two nations. Recent developments, while not restoring the formal alliance relationship, have greatly bolstered practical aspects of the two nation's bilateral defense and security cooperation as well as reaffirmed an overall close United States bilateral relationship with New Zealand. The extent to which the nuclear issue had been put into the past was demonstrated when President Obama invited Prime Minister John Key to attend the Nuclear Summit in April 2010 and stated that New Zealand had ""well and truly earned a place at the table. "" New Zealand was the only non-nuclear state invited to the conference. Several organizations and groups, some involving Members of Congress, help promote bilateral ties between the United States and New Zealand, including the United States-New Zealand Council in Washington, DC, and its counterpart, the New Zealand-United States Council in Wellington; the Friends of New Zealand Congressional Caucus and its New Zealand parliamentary counterpart; and the more recent Pacific Partnership Forum. The U.S.-N.Z. Council was established in 1986 to promote cooperation between the two countries and works with government agencies and business groups to this end.

* The U.S. Constitution establishes two methods by which Presidents may appoint officers of the United States: either with the advice and consent of the Senate, or unilaterally ""during the Recess of the Senate."" These two constitutional provisions have long served as sources of political tension between Presidents and Congresses, and the same has held true since President Obama took office. This tension is illuminated by President Obama's difficulty in obtaining Senate confirmation of nominations for the Directorship of the newly-established Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB or Bureau) and Members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board). President Obama formally nominated Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the CFPB on July 18, 2011. In May 2011, 44 Senators signed a letter to the President stating that they would oppose the confirmation of any nominee to serve as CFPB Director until substantive changes to the structure of the Bureau were enacted into law. On October 6, 2011, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (Senate Banking Committee) approved Cordray's nomination for a full vote of the Senate. However, on December 8, 2011, the Senate fell seven votes shy of the 60-vote threshold necessary to reach cloture and move to a vote on the nomination. The NLRB, an agency with certain powers to investigate and adjudicate unfair labor practices, consists of up to five officials who are to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, there have been periods during the presidencies of both George W.

574,"• Social Security coverage is extended to state and local government employees through ""Section 218 Agreements"" between a state and the Social Security Administration (SSA). All states, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have a voluntary Section 218 Agreement with SSA. A state's Section 218 Agreement details which state and local government positions are covered by Social Security and Medicare. Each state, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, designates a State Social Security Administrator who is responsible for administering, preparing modifications for, and monitoring coverage of its subdivisions under the state's Section 218 Agreement. The Administrator, who is a state employee, serves as a bridge between state and local public employers and SSA. Coverage under Section 218 Agreements differs greatly from state to state. For example, within a state, teachers in one county may be covered under Social Security, whereas teachers in the neighboring county may not be covered. The State Social Security Administrator is the main resource for information about Social Security and Medicare coverage and reporting issues for state and local government employers and employees. • Social Security coverage is extended to groups of employee positions known as ""coverage groups;"" coverage may not be extended on an individual basis. Various laws and regulations govern how coverage may be extended via employee referendums. All states are authorized to use a majority vote referendum process, and 23 states also are authorized to use a divided vote referendum process created in 1956 (see below). • Most often, state governments allow their subdivisions (e.g., a school board) to decide whether to hold a referendum on coverage. Generally, a Section 218 Agreement may be modified to increase, but not reduce, the extent of coverage. With certain exceptions, once Social Security coverage is provided, it cannot be terminated, and all future employees in covered positions are required to participate in Social Security. • The 1935 Social Security Act did not extend Social Security coverage to state and local government workers. In 1950, Congress added Section 218 to the Social Security Act to allow all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands to elect Social Security coverage for certain state and local government employees. In 1954, Congress extended voluntary coverage to employees who were already covered by pension plans, effective starting in 1955, if a majority of employees who were members of a pension system voted in favor of Social Security coverage.

* TAA is a federal program designed to provide readjustment assistance to workers who have lost their jobs due to foreign competition or offshoring. Eligible workers may receive training and reemployment services, as well as income support while enrolled in training. TAA eligibility is limited to workers who have been adversely affected by reduced trade barriers and increased trade. The program was reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA, Title IV of P.L. 114-27). TAA was created in 1962 and, historically, has been reauthorized alongside expansionary trade policies. A detailed legislative history of the program is in the Appendix. In June 2015, TAA was reauthorized by TAARA. The eligibility and benefit provisions of TAARA are authorized to continue through June 30, 2021. TAARA was part of a bill that extended other trade-related policies. TAARA was also passed in conjunction with a separate bill that reauthorized the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA, Title I of P.L. 114-26). TPA (also known as ""fast track"") grants the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, which are then subject to an ""up or down"" vote in Congress. Since the reauthorization of TPA in 2015, Congress has not voted on any presidentially negotiated trade agreements. This report focuses on the eligibility and benefit provisions of TAA as enacted by TAARA. These provisions apply to all workers certified for TAA after the law's enactment. The law also had retroactivity provisions and, in some cases, workers who were parts of groups certified prior to the 2015 reauthorization may be covered under the TAARA provisions. In other cases, however, a worker who was certified under pre-2015 provisions may continue to receive benefits under the prior provisions. As such, while the version of the program described in this report will apply to all new program participants certified through June 30, 2021, it may not apply to some participants who are covered by a TAA petition that was certified prior to the enactment of TAARA. In these cases, states may operate multiple TAA programs to concurrently serve workers certified under the TAARA provisions and workers certified under other provisions.

* Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 established the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) with coverage first available on December 31, 2006. Individuals are responsible for 100% of the premiums, and OPM does not review disputed claims. Employees who are eligible to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, whether or not they are actually enrolled, may enroll in FEDVIP. Annuitants, survivor annuitants, and compensationers (someone receiving monthly compensation from the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation program) may also enroll in FEDVIP. Eligible family members include a spouse, unmarried dependent children under age 22, and continued coverage for qualified disabled children 22 years or older. Former spouses receiving an apportionment of an annuity, deferred annuitants, and those in FEHB temporary continuation of coverage are not eligible to enroll in FEDVIP. There are four nationwide dental plans, and three additional dental plans that are only available regionally. The nationwide plans also provide coverage overseas. There are three vision plans, which all provide both nationwide and overseas coverage. Eligible individuals may enroll in a FEDVIP plan during the standard open season for FEHB plans (for 2008 coverage, open season is from November 12 through December 10, 2007). Individuals may change plans during open season each year, or following a qualifying life event. As with FEHB, new employees have 60 days to enroll. FEDVIP enrollment can be done through the Internet at http://www.BENEFEDS.com , or, for those without Internet access, by calling 1-877-888-FEDS. Individuals may choose a self-only, self + 1, or a family plan. This set of options differs from the FEHB plans, which only allow for two choices: a self-only or a family plan. Individuals who choose to enroll in FEDVIP are not required to enroll in both a dental and a vision plan; they may choose only one type of coverage or both. Individuals are not required to enroll in the dental plan offered by their FEHB plan; for example, an individual whose health insurance is provided by GEHA may enroll in MetLife's dental plan and in Blue Cross Blue Shield's vision plan.

Of the total amount of funding provided, $300 million is allocated to AHRQ to invest in CER activities, $400 million was transferred to NIH, and $400 million is allocated at the discretion of the Secretary. ARRA also stipulated that AHRQ could use no more than 1% of the $300 million under its own discretion for additional FTEs. According to the agency, that amount (i.e., $3 million) provides sufficient funding to hire approximately 15 FTEs (two-year appointments). The $1.1 billion that ARRA provided for CER represents a substantial increase in federal research funding in this area. In its regular appropriations, AHRQ received $50 million in FY2009 for CER, and $21 million in FY2010. The agency's FY2011 budget request includes $286 million for CER (see Table 4). AHRQ's research on comparative effectiveness is authorized by Section 1013 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173) and is part of the agency's Effective Health Care Program. ARRA instructed the Secretary to contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to produce a report with recommendations on national CER priorities. IOM released its report on June 30, 2009. Reflecting broad stakeholder input, the IOM report identified 100 health topics as high-priority areas for CER. Almost one-quarter of the priority topics address the health care delivery system. They include topics related to dissemination of CER study results; patient decision making; health behavior and care management; comparing settings of care; and utilization of surgical, radiological, and medical procedures.

• Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (P.L. 106-78, Title IX; LMR) requires meat packers to report prices and other information on purchases of cattle, hogs, lamb, boxed beef, wholesale pork, and lamb carcasses and boxed lamb to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The law requires mandatory reporting to expire on September 30, 2015. Livestock industry stakeholders supported the reauthorization of the act, and producer groups put forward proposals amending mandatory reporting. The House passed a reauthorization bill (H.R. 2051) in June 2015. In September 2015, the Senate amended the House-passed bill, and Congress reauthorized LMR until September 30, 2020, in the enacted Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54). Before mandatory price reporting was enacted by Congress in 1999, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price and related market information from meat packers on a voluntary basis under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. §1621 et seq.). AMS market reporters collected and reported prices from livestock auctions, feedlots, and packing plants. The information was disseminated through hundreds of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual written and electronic USDA reports on sales of live cattle, hogs, and sheep and wholesale meat products from these animals. The goal was to provide all buyers and sellers with accurate and objective market information. By the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone many sweeping changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, more production specialization, and more vertical integration (firms controlling more than one aspect of production). Fewer animals were sold through negotiated (cash; or ""spot"") sales, and more frequently sold under alternative marketing arrangements (e.g., formula sales based on a negotiated price established in the future) with prices not publicly disclosed or reported. Some livestock producers, believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine ""fair"" market prices for livestock going to slaughter, called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat. USDA had estimated in 2000 that the former voluntary system was not reporting 35%-40% of cattle, ",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The United States Senate is not directly affected by federal statutes, constitutional provisions, or Rule of the Senate when a sitting Member is indicted for or convicted of a felony. No rights or privileges are forfeited under the Constitution, statutory law, or the Rules of the Senate. Internal party rules in the Senate may be relevant, but Members of Congress do not automatically forfeit their offices even upon conviction of a crime that constitutes a felony. There is no express constitutional disability or ""disqualification"" from Congress for the conviction of a crime, other than under the Fourteenth Amendment for certain treasonous conduct after having taken an oath of office. Members of Congress do not automatically forfeit their offices even upon conviction of a crime that constitutes a felony. There is no specific or formal Rule of the Senate concerning the status of a Senator who has been indicted with respect to chairmanships or ranking Member status on committees of the Senate. However, the political parties in the Senate may adopt internal conference and caucus rules that may affect a Senator's leadership and committee positions and assignments. For example, Senate Republican Conference Rules have provided for the temporary loss of one's position as the chairman or ranking Member of a committee, and the temporary loss of one's leadership position, if the Senator has been indicted for a felony; and if the Senator is convicted, the replacement of the chair/ranking Member on the committee. The Senate has demonstrated that in cases of conviction of a Member of crimes that relate to official misconduct that the institution need not wait until all the Senator's appeals are exhausted, but that the Senate may independently investigate and adjudicate the underlying factual circumstances involved in the judicial proceedings, regardless of the potential legal or procedural issues that may be raised and resolved on appeal. No specific guidelines exist regarding actionable grounds for congressional discipline under the constitutional authority of each house to punish its own Members. Each house of Congress has significant discretion to discipline misconduct that the membership finds to be worthy of censure, reprimand, or expulsion from Congress. A censure by the Senate, whereby the full Senate adopts by majority vote a formal resolution of disapproval of a Member, may encompass conduct that does not violate any express state or federal law, nor any specific Rule of the Senate. The Senate, in a similar manner as the House of Representatives in relation to its Members, has expressed reticence to exercise the power of expulsion (but not censure) for conduct in a prior Congress when a Senator has been elected or reelected to the Senate after the Member's conviction,",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '*'}"

* Burma, a major drug-producing state, is subject to sanctions, barring the country from U.S. foreign assistance and loss of U.S. support for loans from international financial institutions. The State Department has designated Burma as a Tier 3 state engaged in the most severe forms of trafficking in persons. The U.S. Department of Treasury has imposed special measures to regulate and monitor financial flows, including Department of Treasury advisories for enhanced scrutiny over financial transactions and five special measures listed under 31 U.S.C. 5318A. The United States does not apply sanctions against Burma in specific response to its activity in other illicit trades, including wildlife. The Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2007 (H.R. 3890) would prohibit the importation of gems and hardwoods from Burma, among other restrictions. After more than a decade of applying sanctions against Burma, many analysts conclude that the sanctions have done little to change the situation. The effectiveness of U.S. sanctions is limited by several factors, including unevenly applied sanctions against Burma by other countries and international organizations, a booming natural gas production and export industry, continued unwillingness of Burma's fellow members in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to impose economic sanctions against Burma, historical isolation from the global economy, and China's continued economic and military assistance to Burma. In addition, some analysts suggest that sanctions are, in part, culpable for the flourishing black markets in Burma, including trafficking in humans, gems, and drugs, because legal exports are barred. The United States is assisting neighboring countries with stemming the flow of trafficked contraband from Burma into their territories. The United States is working to train law enforcement and border control officials in neighboring countries through anti-crime assistance programs. The bulk of funding to Burma's neighbors remains concentrated in counter-narcotics and anti-human trafficking projects; no funding is allocated to the State Department for combating ""organized and gang-related crime"" in the region. Overall funding to combat trafficking has been in decline for several years; the Administration's FY2008 appropriations request for Foreign Operations in the region represents a 24.2% decrease from FY2006 actual funding. Despite Burma's recent progress in reducing opium poppy cultivation, most experts believe U.S. policies have not yielded substantial leverage in combating transnational crime emanating from Burma.

* The 112th Congress is considering an omnibus farm bill that will establish the direction of agricultural policy for the next several years. The Senate Agriculture Committee approved its version of the 2012 omnibus farm bill on April 26, 2012 (Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012), and officially filed the measure, S. 3240, on May 24, 2012. After the bill was filed, more than 300 amendments were proposed for consideration on the Senate floor. By mid-June, an agreement was reached to limit the debate to 77 of the proposed amendments, of which 45 were adopted between June 19 and June 21. The full Senate approved S. 3240, as amended, by a vote of 64-35 on June 21. The House Agriculture Committee completed markup of its version of the farm bill (H.R. 6083), on July 11, 2012, and approved the amended measure by a 35-11 vote. Nearly 100 amendments were offered for committee consideration, of which nearly half were adopted by the committee. The House bill was officially filed and reported by the committee on September 13, 2012. Within their 12 titles, the five-year House and Senate farm bills would reshape the structure of farm commodity support, expand crop insurance coverage, consolidate conservation programs, revise the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps), and extend authority to appropriate funds for many U.

* The Lacey Act was enacted in 1900 to address game poaching and wildlife laundering, among other issues. The Lacey Act regulates the trade of wildlife and plants and creates penalties for violations. The Lacey Act was amended in 2008 to include nonindigenous plants and violations of foreign laws pertaining to certain conservation actions and other activities involving plants and plant products. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act (2008 amendments) also expand the definition of a plant to include any plants (including foreign plants), whereas before it referred only to plants indigenous to any state or associated commonwealths, territories, or possessions of the United States. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act affect all industries that import plant and plant products, including musical instrument makers, furniture manufacturers, flooring companies, toy manufacturers, the auto industry, and some textile manufacturers that use fabrics that contain plant fibers. The 2008 amendments are expected to reduce illegal logging, which will reduce corrupt practices and increase biodiversity and conservation in timber-supplying countries, and increase revenues for foreign and domestic companies that sell and process wood. The 113 th Congress has addressed the 2008 amendments with proposed legislation.

597,"* The 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) provides new long-term counter-cyclical support for grains and cotton, replacing target prices and deficiencypayments with fixed, ""direct payments"" to farmers. Both types of payments will be available to producers with annual agreements with USDA. The measure maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiencypayments as they are now, with changes in most loan rates. The new law, which covers the 2002-2007 crop years, brings soybeans and the minor oilseeds (e.g., sunflowers, etc.) fully under the support program rules that apply to grains and cotton. In a major departure from the past, FSRIA redrew the support system to operate like that for grains, oilseeds, and cotton, instead of the traditional system of peanut marketing quotas and nonrecourse price support loans. The new counter-cyclical program will be decoupled from current output, with producer payments not tied to prices or current production. However, the program is expected to cause U.S. spending to exceed $19.1 billion, raising concerns about the U.S. commitment to open trade. The new program also would increase federal costs, or reduce assistance levels for major commodities.

The expression of mir-145 and mir-206 is negatively correlated with breast tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Mir-145 and mir-206 are related to the expression of target genes, such as c-myc, irs-1, oct4, sox2, and klf4, which can inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Mir-145 and mir-206 are also associated with the expression of top 2a, which can affect the treatment of breast cancer.

• Fungi, chemoorganotrophic eukaryotic microorganisms, may play a key part in periradicular diseases.
• Failure of some endodontic treatments may therefore be explained by the presence of candida albicans in the oral flora.
• Candida species, which have a tendency to invade dentin, are regarded as dentinophilic microorganisms.
• The presence of c. albicans in endodontic treatment failures may be the result of coronal leakage after or contamination during the endodontic treatment.
• Several factors, such as an ability to survive despite a lack of nutrients or resistance to intracanalicular treatment materials, may result in c. albicans remaining in the root canal system.
• C. albicans has been found in some failed endodontic treatments; a phenomenon that might be explained by the invasive nature of this fungus or its resistance to some intracanalicular medications, e.g., calcium hydroxide.
• If repeated treatment has either failed or is unfeasible, the only alternative is a root-end resection.
• Apical sealing, avoiding contamination, and reducing the number of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, influence the success rate of such treatment.

• Recently, we described how ph-triggered, pegylated sirna nanoparticles (also known as ph-triggered sirna-abc nanoparticles according to our recently described abcd nanoparticle structural paradigm) were used to mediate the passive targeting of sirna to liver cells in vivo, thereby providing proof of concept for an effective RNA therapeutic approach to the treatment of hepatitis B virus infections (Kenny et al., 2011).

The prevalence of RA is highest in Italy, with rates of 0.45% and 0.66% reported in the two areas, respectively. The annual incidence of RA is also lower in Italy than in other European countries. The introduction of newer costly drugs for RA is expected to further contribute to the expected increase in the economic burden of RA in Italy.

In prosthodontic practice, limited mouth opening in patients is a common occurrence. Prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with restricted mouth opening due to various causative factors presents significant challenges at all stages, from preliminary impressions to the insertion of prosthesis. Limited oral opening itself is not a disease but manifests as a consequence of certain conditions, including surgical treatments of orofacial carcinoma, cleft lip, trauma, burns, plummer vinson syndrome, scleroderma, trismus, rheumatism, temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome, oral submucous fibrosis, and any damage to masticatory muscles. A 71-year-old male patient reported to the department of prosthodontics, Rama Dental College and Hospital Kanpur, India, with the chief complaint of missing teeth and the desire to replace them with a complete denture. On examination, the patient had oral submucous fibrosis with heavy vertical fibrous bands and homogenous leukoplakia on both sides of the buccal mucosa, leading to a reduced mouth opening of 2.5 cm. The patient was also diagnosed with bilateral angular cheilitis, which often bleeds on opening the mouth wide. Treatment plan included sectional maxillary and mandibular final impression procedures, followed by fabricating a maxillary hinged and mandibular sectional and hinged complete denture. The primary impression for maxillary arch was taken using the smallest size edentulous stock tray with impression compound (Y Dents; MDM Corp.), and after proper disinfection (1:213 iodophore), the primary cast was poured in type II dental plaster (Dentico; Neelkanth Mine Chem.). Two autopolymerizing acrylic resin special trays (Trevelon; Dentsply India Pvt. Ltd.) were trimmed one side short of the maxillary tuberosity, and a final impression was made with light body polyvinyl siloxane addition silicon impression material (Examix &nds; GC Company). One sectional impression tray was poured with dental stone (Denstone, Grade III). Over that cast, a second sectional impression tray was assembled and the remaining part of the cast was poured. The same procedure was followed for the mandibular primary impression. A conventional special tray was fabricated over the primary cast and that was later sectioned from the midline into two halves. One hole was drilled in the center of the tray handle and a brass dowel pin was passed through",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third most common cause of global cancer-related mortality.
• HCC burden disproportionately impacts developing countries and males; as of 2008, 85% of cases occurred in Africa and Asia, with worldwide male:female sex ratio of 2.4.
• Risk factors for HCC include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens such as aflatoxin B, and genetic metabolic diseases like hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
• HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy, likely due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products such as heat shock 70 and p-glycoprotein, and p53 mutations.
• Currently, systemic therapeutic options in the locally advanced or metastatic setting are limited to sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting raf kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.
• Dysplastic nodules subsequently progress to early HCC through cumulative genetic alterations, while advanced HCC often involves intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein invasion.
• Molecular alterations implicated in HCC development include mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (p53 and p16), epigenetic alterations, chromosomal changes, and aberrant activation of signaling cascades necessary for proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.
• HCC is multifactorial and is reliant upon dysregulation of multiple pathways including Wnt/b-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR, VEGF, PDGF, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), TGF-beta, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).
• The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, cellular met (Cmet), promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.
• HGF is a ligand for the met receptor, also known as cellular met or Cmet.

The association between diabetes and cancer has been a subject of debate for over a century. The length of this debate suggests that any such associations are relatively weak, and most practicing diabetologists do not view cancer as a specific, diabetes-associated risk. The study of glargine, a newer form of insulin, has raised concerns about its potential to promote cancer growth. The evidence from the Swedish study, which found an increased risk of breast cancer with glargine, has been controversial. The meta-analysis comparing cancer risk associated with another new, long-acting insulin, insulin detemir, versus nph and glargine, has also raised concerns about the long-term effects of diabetes itself, insulin treatment, and specifically, glargine, on cancer development. The evidence presented in this set of papers is sufficient to establish that there is a case to answer, but is entirely insufficient to bring a verdict. The overall benefit-risk ratio of good glycemic control is likely to support extensive use of insulin. All are agreed that the current evidence does not warrant any change in clinical practice, specifically with regard to the use of glargine. Further research will need to address the relationship between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues, and secretagogues, and cancer. It will also explore potentially protective effects of metformin and perhaps the most tantalizing question: why is diabetes not more strongly associated with cancer? </summary>",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '*'}"

In this study, researchers explored the use of zirconium nitride (ZnN) nanowires as antireflective layers in high-efficiency solar cells. The key findings include:

1. ZnN nanowires exhibit superior antireflective properties compared to other oxide compounds, with a reflectance of 6.6% in the broadband range from 400 to 1,200 nm. This efficiency improvement is achieved through a seeding and growth two-step process in a zinc salt and amide mixed solution.

2. The znno nanowires were grown using a seeding and growth two-step process, with the length and density optimized for improved solar cell performances.

3. The results show that the efficiency of CZSi solar cells can be improved by 3% using znno nanowires as the antireflective layer.

4. The starting samples were p-type CZSi solar cells fabricated using surface texturization, phosphorus diffusion, sixny film deposition, screen printing, and metallization.

5. The znno nanowires were grown using a seeding and growth two-step process, with the length and density optimized for improved solar cell performances.

6. The znno nanowires exhibit lower reflectance than the reference CZSi solar cells, with a reflectivity of 6.6% in the broadband range from 400 to 1,200 nm.

7. The reflectivity of znno nanowire-coated solar cells decreases with increasing growth time.

8. The znno nanowires grown for 45 min have the lowest reflectivity among all tested samples.

9. The reflectivity of znno nanowire-coated solar cells increases with increasing growth time.

10. The decrease in reflectivity is mainly attributed to the absorption of light by the znno nanowires, themselves, which does not contribute to the improvement of solar cell performance.

Schistosomidae, a diverse group of parasitic flatworms, includes several species with complex life cycles. The development of schistosomiasis, a chronic and debilitating disease, is considered one of the most serious public health issues and a major cause of morbidity in the world. Schistosomiasis is endemic in 77 countries and its transmission is dependent on intermediate hosts. The study of schistosome research has advanced through sequencing projects of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, transcriptomic analyses, and the use of genomic data to improve understanding of the evolutionary history of schistosoma. The availability of schistosome genome and transcriptome data has provided a framework for the identification of gene functions and the development of new vaccines and drugs. The study of schistosome transcriptomic data has revealed conserved features in the overall gc content, sequence identity, presence of repetitive elements, and synteny, which corroborates previous genetic studies and supports the evolutionary hypothesis of schistosoma. The use of genomic data is valuable for reconstructing the evolutionary relationships of schistosoma and other platyhelminthes. The refinement of the genomics and transcriptomics data through next-generation sequencing platforms has allowed the identification of gene functions and the development of new vaccines and drugs.

• Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that deserve considerable interest for their use as natural and nontoxic food preservatives, as well as for their potential use in human and veterinary applications. In 1976, tagg et al. defined bacteriocins as proteinaceous compounds that kill closely related bacteria but are now recognized to have broad-spectrum activity across genera. The classification of gram-positive bacteriocins is challenging due to their heterogeneity and the continuous evolution of classification schemes. Enterococcal strains isolated from various ecosystems have been characterized as antagonists of broad-range foodborne pathogens. Enterocin s37, a peptide produced by e. faecalis, was isolated from chicken feces and has been studied for its antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Enterocin s37 has been shown to have a molecular weight between 4 and 6 kDa, and its activity increased several folds during purification. The spectrum of partially purified enterocin s37 was the same as that of cfs, but with stronger activities. The effect of k channel modulators on enterocin activity was revealed in this study. Enterocin s37 is responsible for uncontrolled efflux of intracellular k and affecting sensitive cells growth. The resistant variant was able to grow but was slightly affected by the combination of enterocin s37/k modulators, except for pinacidil, where the inhibitory effect has reached 49.79% 3.36, instead of 23.84% 7.73 and 24.11% 7.07 when cromakalim and glipizide were added, respectively.

Intrathecal delivery of nusinersen is feasible, safe, and well tolerated in children with spinal muscular atrophy. The study demonstrated that lumbar punctures were performed using either intravenous (midazolam, ketamine, fentanyl, remifentanil, and/or propofol) or inhaled anesthesia/sedation (sevoflurane, nitrous oxide) with no complications reported. The use of a 24-gauge or smaller needle was successful in children with spinal muscular atrophy to perform lumbar puncture with lower incidence of complications, suggesting that using a 24-gauge or smaller needle would likely reduce the chance of adverse events. Bed rest, adequate hydration, oral caffeine, and/or analgesics were sufficient to resolve post- lumbar puncture headache/syndrome without the need of a therapeutic blood patch in all patients.

* The main concern is to ensure the highest possible standard for the services provided and to meet the needs of individual service users and communities. In 1997, the UK Department of Health introduced clinical governance (CG) as a strategy for improving quality of health care services. The classic definition of CG is provided by Scally and Donaldson as a system through which health organizations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish. The IRAN Ministry of Health and Medical Education (Mohme) has applied CG as a framework for improving quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009. The CG model consists of seven interlocking components, including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information. The system awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication are considered as a foundation of this model. The IRAN Medical Universities have developed a qualitative research method to explore senior managers' viewpoints on CG implementation barriers and facilitators. The study found that sufficient knowledge and clear understanding about the principles and practice of CG have major roles in achieving desired improvement in service quality and patient safety. The study also highlighted the importance of supporting culture, appropriate organizational structure, and managerial commitment as perceived facilitators in CG implementation. The findings are parallel with the findings of many other studies. The model developed by O'Brien et al outlines four dimensions in successfully implementing clinical governance: cultural, technical, structural, and strategic. The cultural dimension related to beliefs, values, norms, and behaviors in the organization that either suppress or support quality improvement activities. The organizational factors include strong and clear vision and goals, stable managerial leadership, supportive structures for team work, effective interactions and interprofessional relationships, and continuous learning culture. The barriers include lack of adequate managerial support, resource, structural, and cultural issues, and professional boundaries. The study found that senior managers' perception about the important factors in implementing clinical governance were classified in five main domains: knowledge and attitude, culture, organizational factors, managerial factors, and barriers.

1. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common reason behind functional disability in old age people of India, affecting 117 males and 134 females.
2. Physiotherapy uses both self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to assess prognosis in OA knee rehabilitation.
3. Self-reported questionnaires provide subjective information without examiner bias, while performance-based tests objectively measure patient ability in daily activities.
4. Examples of self-reported questionnaires include WOMAC, SF-36, KOOS, and others.
5. Performance-based tests, such as timed up and go (TUG) test and six-minute walk test (6-MWT), are affected by motivation and not by psychogenic factors.
6. The correlation between self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests in OA knee rehabilitation is weak, with the strongest correlation between KOOS and 6-MWT being 0.733.

• Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease with a multifactorial etiology, including sedentary lifestyles, high-fat diets, and genetic predisposition.
• The administration of a high-fat diet in rodents promotes metabolic changes, inducing the production of proinflammatory interleukins and a chronic inflammatory process.
• The presence of large concentrations of endotoxins and saturated fatty acids in the diet promotes the activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which triggers the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
• The hormonal changes that occur during menopause are responsible for specific physical and metabolic remodeling that, when associated with weight gain and obesity, have a negative impact on women's health.
• The physiological actions of estrogens in the body are mediated by two distinct estrogen receptors (ERS): er and er. These receptors are nuclear transcription factors involved in the regulation of several complex physiological processes.
• The hormonal changes that occur during menopause are responsible for specific physical and metabolic remodeling that, when associated with weight gain and obesity, have a negative impact on women's health.

In recent years, the demand for herbal remedies in Nigeria has been on the rise. However, there is limited scientific data to support medicinal claims of these herbal formulations. Herbal remedies are commonly used in many Nigerian homes, and the increasing commercial promotion of herbal remedies necessitates the need for assessment of safety and validity of medicinal claims. The toxic effects of indiscriminate use of packaged herbal remedies have been recognized, and the general belief that herbal medicines are natural, effective, and without adverse effects has contributed to the upsurge in the patronage of herbal formulations. The study aimed to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to fijk herbal mixture on rat biochemical indices and liver morphology. The oral administration of fijk herbal mixture did not produce significant changes to average body weights of animals, but the relative organ to body weight ratio showed no significant difference among the various treatment groups. However, repeated administration of fijk herbal mixture caused significant reduction in rat plasma protein level compared to the control group. The study also revealed that repeated exposure to fijk herbal mixture caused hepatic alterations including hypochromic, haemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, and hyperemia. The study also found that the levels of alt and ast were elevated by repeated administration of fijk mixture relative to control. The alt and ast are normally found in the red blood cells, liver, heart, and kidney tissues. The levels of alt and ast have long been used to assess the functions of liver. The levels of alt and ast have been linked to tissue toxicity [21, 22]. The study also found that the ratio of ast to alt in plasma was less than one ( < 1 ), which may indicate ensuing acute or chronic liver injury. The study revealed elevated atherogenic index caused by oral and repeated exposure to fijk mixture in rats. The study also found that oral and repeated exposure to fijk herbal mixture caused lipid peroxidation and potentiated hepatic lesion.

* Identifying Carriers of Autosomal Recessive or X-Linked Disorders Before Pregnancy: Potential Benefits for Prospective Parents
  * Couples can become aware of the possible genetic risks to future offspring and of the reproductive options available.
  * These options include not only prenatal diagnosis followed (or not ) by termination of the pregnancy in case of an affected fetus or by coming to terms with the risk, but also the choices of using preimplantation genetic diagnosis, using donor sperm or oocytes, seeking adoption or refraining from having children.
  * In some culturally related marriage practices, there are two approaches to the identification of carriers: carrier screening and carrier testing.
  * Carrier screening can be offered on an individual basis, but also as an organized screening programme, either during or before pregnancy.
  * While most screening programmes in health care aim to prevent, treat and alleviate disease, above and beyond these aims, the particular goal of preconceptional carrier screening is to strengthen reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making.
  * If offered preconceptionally, this can mean less time constraints, less pressure, and less emotional stress than when a test is performed during pregnancy (International Conference on Human Genetics, 2010).
  * Carrier testing for disorders such as CF is still usually restricted to families and partners of CF patients and carriers.
  * Commercial companies have been offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers.
  * These direct-to-consumer (dtc) tests provide information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring.
  * The availability of dtc genetic testing services in general has created a debate about the desirability of these activities (Hunter et al., 2008; Kaye, 2008).
  * The current offer of preconceptional carrier tests through online providers can be seen as a cause, a campaign to finally end the needless suffering of preventable genetic disease.
  * The dtc genetic tests providers do not make a distinction between screening individuals with an a priori low population risk or testing individuals with a high a priori probability of having an affected child.
  * The universal carrier test offered by counsyl is whether dtc carrier testing should be seen as an activity for which these screening criteria are applicable.

* Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable adjunct to ultrasound for diagnosing fetal anomalies, particularly ventriculomegaly. The imaging technique offers a high level of detail and sensitivity to detect small deposits of intraventricular blood, which may suggest intraventricular hemorrhage as the cause of hydrocephalus. MRI has a high accuracy to detect corpus callosum dysgenesis and additional malformations such as cortical anomalies, periventricular of subependymal nodular heteropia, and interhemispheric cysts. It also allows a good evaluation of the vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, pedunculi, brainstem, 4th ventricle, tentorium cerebelli, and retrocerebellar space. However, the added value of MRI is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to the lack of postnatal / postmortem (imaging) correlates, uncertainty between ultrasound and MRI exam time, and lack of information on ultrasound findings by the fetal MRI specialist. Fetal MRI has a limited role over ultrasound in assessing the size of the cerebral ventricles, except for cases where fetal position and calvarial ossification cause problems. In the second trimester, in the 20-24 weeks group, fetal MRI is useful to detect small foci of brain hemorrhage or callosal anomalies in fetuses diagnosed with cerebral ventriculomegaly. In the third trimester, in the 25-30 weeks group, fetal MRI adds information about normal and pathological cortical development and maturation, depicts fossa posterior anomalies, and is a more sensitive imaging modality to detect white matter pathology. However, the added value of MRI is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to the lack of postnatal / postmortem (imaging) correlates, uncertainty between ultrasound and MRI exam time, and lack of information on ultrasound findings by the fetal MRI specialist.

* Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nail, characterized by nail discoloration, thickening, and defect. The involved pathogens are dermatophytes, yeasts (candida), and nondermatophytic molds. The most common agents are dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, accounting for 50% to 90% of cases. The infection is more prevalent in toenails than in fingernails. Aging and reduced peripheral circulation are major risk factors for onychomycosis. Onychomycosis can be associated with nail psoriasis, which is favored by abnormal capillary units and onychodystrophy. The treatment of onychomycosis is difficult due to the predisposing factors not influenced by therapy. Tazarotene, a topical antifungal medication, is used for the treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis. It is effective in reducing fungal growth and inhibiting the infective process. The results of our preliminary study suggest that tazarotene can be useful in treating onychomycosis-resistant forms or in patients with evident nail thickening, where the retinoid can be beneficial.

It affects between 1 in every 500 and 1 in every 1000 individuals, and is found in all racial and ethnic groups. The disease may not be clinically apparent until the third or fourth decade of life, and only about half of the patients will progress to renal failure. Complications associated with pregnant subjects with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis include maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, infected renal and hepatic cysts, pyelonephritis, and cerebral artery aneurysm during labor with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The patient presented with symptoms of renal insufficiency only in the seventh month of gestation, and the diagnosis was missed earlier. The blood erythrocyte count and hematocrit may be increased above normal, and the patient had a history of hypertension.

* The study examines the relationship between lactation curve parameters and milk yield in cows, including heritability estimates and trends. The gamma type function was used to model the lactation curve, and the results indicate that the gamma function is a good model for predicting milk yield in cows. The gamma function has a small error variance and high determination coefficient, making it a suitable choice for selection schemes. The gamma function also shows similar accuracy in predicting milk yield in normal and mastitis infected cows. The gamma function is validated by the similar values of r and rmse in normal and mastitis cows during different parities. The gamma function is also validated by the similar values of r and rmse in normal and mastitis cows during different parities.

* Mouse lifespan, weight, and food consumption were monitored as described in detail previously (15). Briefly, male b6c3f1 mice (harlan breeders; indianapolis) were randomly assigned to treatment groups at 12 months of age. Two hundred ninety-seven control mice were shifted from ad libitum chow feeding (diet # 5001, purina mills, richmond, in) to daily feeding with 13.3 kcal/day/mouse of control diet [american institute of nutrition (ain)-93 m diet; diet no]. Four groups of 18 mice each were shifted to daily feeding with an identical quantity of control diet supplemented with ndga at either 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, or 4.5 g per kg diet (approximately 1.59, 2.65, 3.71, 4.77mg/kg body weight/day, respectively). Food consumption and health were monitored at the time of feeding, and any uneaten food noted. ndga was mixed with the powdered diet and cold-pressed into 1 g pellets by bio-serve. The mice had ad libitum access to tap water, which was acidified (ph 4.0) to reduce colonization by pseudomonas (16,17). The health of the mice was examined twice daily by laboratory staff and weekly by a veterinarian. This study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of california, riverside. These lifespan studies utilized an unbalanced statistical design to minimize the number of mice per test group while maintaining statistical power (18). Unbalanced designs have economic and logistic advantages for comparing multiple treatments to a common control (18). The group sizes in this study are similar to those required for a weibull survival analyses with a 75% probability of detecting an 10% increase in mean lifespan with a 1% probability of a false positive (0.01). The weibull analysis is more stringent than the comparison of kaplan-meier survival curves using the mantel-cox or gehan-breslow-wilcoxon tests, implemented in graphpad prism 5.01, which are used here. The significance of the differences in body weights between the treated and control groups was judged using a linear mixed effects model (19,20) as described previously (15).

* Genetic variation contributes to both disease susceptibility and treatment response through the discovery of genetic variants contributing to the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases (Manolio 2010). 
* Genome-wide association studies (GWA) have enabled rapid discovery of genetic variants contributing to the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases (Link et al. 2010). 
* The driving hope of these major advances in genetic epidemiology is that promotion of personalized medicine will improve medical decision-making. 
* Although use of the term personalized medicine is often limited to the identification of the optimal drug and the optimal dosage for a subgroup of patients, current personalized medicine applications are far more broad, and might include situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients. 
* In prostate cancer, for example, dna biomarker tests may be used to determine whether treatment may be safely delayed for a period of watchful waiting. 
* In contrast, in other instances, genetic profiles may be used to determine preventive interventions. 
* This approach is already used for some forms of hereditary cancer, in which individual genetic testing is the basis for deciding upon specific, sometimes very radical interventions such as preventive surgery (Kroll 2008). 
* Beyond treatment schemes that are applied identically across large subgroups of patients, to which some authors have applied the distinct term stratified medicine (Trusheim et al. 2007). 
* Other personalized medicine applications offer targeted treatment options for individual patients. 
* Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as anti-tnf, anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-1, are thought to be effective in inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease (Bucher et al. 2008). 
* Other molecules seem suitable for use as anti-inflammatory therapy as well. 
* To choose one or a combination of different anti-inflammatory therapies, the physician might first obtain the genetic profile of a patient by sequencing. 
* Depending on the individual DNA profile, the physician might select the anti-inflammatory combination therapy, which may include many different molecules. 
* Though foundational to personalized medicine, biological markers, biomarkers for short, are diversely defined in the literature. 
* Gallo et al. (2011) summarize some of the definitions, and observe that the most commonly adopted definition states that a biomarker is any substance or biological structure that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain or predict the incidence or outcome",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '*'}"

• Myosin Va (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n- terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain. Myova's directed movement is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in the motor's processive motion as each head takes 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required to activate the atpase activity of myova; however, in the presence of high calcium ( > 1 m), motor processivity is reduced and one or more calmodulins may dissociate from each lever arm. Single myova are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. Myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusion search. The structural domains that are critical to myova's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction. Here, we used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains. In addition, we hypothesized that calmodulin disassociation from the myova lever arm decreases the lever arm's flexural stiffness, thus contributing to the motor's compromised processivity in the presence of calcium. Various myova constructs, listed as follows, were expressed in the baculovirus/SF9 cell system and purified as described previously. These constructs allowed the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains to be defined by TPM (figure 2). Full-length murine myova (myova-fl) was expressed as was a double-headed short construct (myova-hmm), engineered by truncating the myova-fl heavy chain at residue 1098, followed by a biotin tag and a flag epitope tag at the c-terminal end to facilitate purification. Double-headed myova constructs were coexpressed with calcium-insensitive calmodulin (camall) as described previously. Single-headed myova (myova-s1) was truncated at amino acid 908 with a biotin tag at the c-terminal end and coexpressed with wild-type calmodulin and purified as",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

1. The study aimed to determine whether clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (eac) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in different proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
2. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aurka (rs2273535), erbb2 (rs1136201), mdm2 (rs2279744), cdh1 (rs5030625), cdkn2a (rs11515), and tp73 (rs2273953) were genotyped in a consecutive cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
3. The association with disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
4. Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the tested polymorphisms and DFS in patients with eac or escc.
5. However, in a multivariate analysis, patients with eac carrying the heterozygous mdm2 (rs2279744) t / g genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.450.88], p < 0.007).
6. Patients with eac harboring the homozygous cdh1 (rs5030625) ga / ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 4.0, 95% CI [1.411], p < 0.008).
7. In a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients, the mdm2 t / g and cdh1 ga / ga genotype confer risk of death in patients with eac.
8. These data suggest that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with eac.
9. Many therapeutic options are used to treat esophageal cancer, but traditionally, surgery is used most frequently to obtain loco-regional control and long-term survival.

• Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with approximately 1.67 million new patients diagnosed annually worldwide and accounting for 25% of all cancer cases.
• Breast cancer predominantly spreads via the lymphatic system to locoregional lymph nodes, meaning that the status of these lymph nodes is important for staging of the disease and determining prognosis.
• Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with the combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla.
• The tracers are then detected within the SLNs by the surgeon using a handheld scintillation counter (gamma probe) and/or visually.
• The gamma probe is first used to transcutaneously localize the SLNs and determine the optimal incision site.
• Postincision both the blue dye and gamma probe guide the surgeon to the SLNs.
• After identification, the SLNs are removed and sent for histopathological examination.
• With an identification rate of 96% and a false-negative rate of 5%, it is an effective procedure with low morbidity.
• Although the currently used technique performs well, it has drawbacks.
• The use of radioisotopes is subject to stringent regulations on training of staff and handling and disposal of radioactive material.
• Most importantly, many hospitals in the world do not have access to radioisotopes.
• Consequently, only approximately 60% of the patients in the western world and negligible numbers in the rest of the world have access to SLNB.
• This has led to the search for other techniques, not reliant on the use of radioisotopes.

* Vaspin is identified in visceral adipose tissue of oletf rats, an animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Vaspin is also expressed in skin, hypothalamus, pancreatic islets, and stomach. Circulating levels of adiponectin, a hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are highly heritable and are inversely associated with T2DM and other metabolic traits. Some studies have shown that plasma vaspin concentrations are significantly higher in men with T2DM compared to those without T2DM. The serum vaspin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes have been demonstrated to be higher than [5,6] or similar to those observed in subjects with normal glucose tolerance. In our study, we measured serum vaspin and adiponectin levels in 416 subjects with normal renal function and renal insufficiency with or without T2DM and compared various clinical parameters. The results showed that serum vaspin levels were significantly lower in 169 patients with T2DM than in 247 individuals without T2DM. However, no significant difference was observed between 50 patients with T2DM and 366 individuals without T2DM. The serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in 50 individuals with T2DM than in 366 individuals without T2DM.

It is a common disorder affecting young adults and is diagnosed in approximately 85% to 90% of cases. MS is characterized by cognitive and physical impairments, and it is a significant factor in asthenic diseases. The IL-25 gene is involved in the regulation of immune responses, and its polymorphisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. The study evaluated the association between the c424c / a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in an Iranian population. The results showed that 1 to 2% of patients had the aa genotype, while 16 to 47% had the ac and cc genotypes.

• The study population included high-risk individuals, but blood pressure and serum lipids were well controlled in most patients, as indicated by blood pressure and laboratory test results. However, prevalence of taa was considerably high and taa was associated with various clinical factors, including older age, larger bsa, and higher diastolic blood pressure. 
• The study found that taa was associated with the absence of dyslipidemia, while aaa was significantly associated with the presence of dyslipidemia. 
• One possible explanation for the conflicting results might be that the mean values of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C were almost within normal limits, suggesting well-controlled serum lipids in most patients. 
• Additionally, since the current study was performed at a tertiary referral hospital, many of the patients were taking statins for the primary or secondary prevention for coronary artery disease, not for the treatment of dyslipidemia. 
• The results of the study high-light the need to clearly define the usefulness of routine screening for AAA among Asian non-smokers. 
• The primary limitation of this study is that a CT scan with axial images could not properly evaluate the very proximal portion of the ascending aorta including the aortic root. 
• Even in the sagittal and coronal planes, aortic root diameter could not be accurately measured using non-contrast CT due to the complexity of the structures surrounding the aortic root.

Schwannomas are rare tumors of the nerve sheath that arise from the primary glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Although benign and slow-growing, schwannomas can cause significant morbidity due to direct involvement of nerves or by local mass effect that poses particular challenges for treatment. Approximately 25 to 45% of all schwannomas are found in the head and neck, where they can originate from virtually any cranial nerve. The most common schwannoma is the vestibular schwannoma, which arises from the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve and accounts for 51% of all schwannomas found anywhere in the body. The vidian canal, also referred to as the pterygoid canal, extends from the pterygopalatine fossa to the foramen lacerum in the floor of the sphenoid sinus. The vidian nerve arises from the joining of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and the deep petrosal nerve. The greater superficial petrosal nerve consists of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. The deep petrosal nerve consists of postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the carotid sympathetic plexus. The parasympathetic fibers of the vidian nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, whereas the sympathetic fibers innervate the lacrimal gland and secretory pathways of the nasopalatine glands. The vidian canal can present with a variety of clinical symptoms, including decreased or absent lacrimation, corneal desiccation as well as dryness of the nasal mucosa, and cluster headaches. The vidian nerve schwannoma can present with a variety of clinical symptoms, including headache and facial palsy, oculomotor palsy and cerebrospinal fluid leak, unilateral hearing loss secondary to obstructive serous otitis media, and facial paresthesias. The traditional and curative management of peripheral nerve tumors is surgical; recent advancements in transnasal endoscopic skull base approaches frequently enable complete resection. Radiation therapy by either srs or multiple fraction radiotherapy is also an alternative option for treatment. Conservative management through observation with serial imaging is reasonable when surgical resection is either not feasible or involves a disproportionate risk of postsurgical morbidity and/or mortality. The ultimate goal of both surgery and radiotherapy is to maximize tumor control while also optimizing preservation of surrounding structures.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for obtaining photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering typically needed for nanoparticulate TiO₂ electrodes, which prevents the use of conductive plastic substrates. We have previously demonstrated the use of esa with the ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes. Minor addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to ZnO surface brought about a significant impact on the crystal growth for evolution of various nanostructures and alteration of the crystallographic orientation of the film. The coprecipitation of dye molecules does not necessarily deteriorate the crystallinity of ZnO. In the case of ZnO/EOSIN hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed. The space between the ZnO nanowire is filled with aggregates of eosin. The solid eosin can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline such as dilute KOH. Thus, prepared ZnO thin films, consisting of large single-crystalline grains with internal porous structure, to be called porous ZnO, have large surface area for adsorption of photosensitizer dye in a large amount and high crystallinity for efficient transport of electrons; therefore, it can achieve high incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of around 90% with the dSSC application. Recently, Powar et al. have succeeded in achieving 1.3% conversion efficiency for a dSSC in an inverted structure employing a porous p-nio electrode sensitized with a specially designed dye to achieve a high rectification with kinetically reversible co(ii/iii) ethylene diamine complex electrolyte. We have been seeking to perform cathodic electrodeposition of cuscn, a p-type wide-bandgap semiconductor, into highly crystallized thin films at low temperature. Cuscn has been frequently used as a hole conductor in nanostructured solar cells and also as a sensitized photocathode in combination with hole-injecting dyes. Therefore, esa of cuscn-based hybrid thin films could serve nicely as a counterpart to the well-established ZnO-based hybrid systems. Our first attempt for esa of cuscn hybrid system was to employ dye molecules having soft le",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing over the past few decades. Estimated 76,250 new cases of invasive melanoma were diagnosed in the USA in 2012, with an estimated number of 9,180 that result in death. The most dangerous characteristic of melanoma is that it can spread widely via the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that links clinical dermatology and dermatopathology by enabling the visualization of morphological features which are not discernible by examination with the naked eye. Dermoscopy enables better diagnosis as compared to unaided eye with an improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of 1030%. However, it has also been demonstrated that dermoscopy may actually lower the diagnostic accuracy in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists due to this method requiring great deal of experience to differentiate skin lesions. Only experts have arrived at 90% sensitivity and 59% specificity in skin lesion diagnosis, while for less trained doctors these figures show significant drop till around 62%-63% for general practitioners. The main problem is that the diagnosis is highly dependent on subjective judgement and is scarcely reproducible. Several scoring systems and algorithms such as the abcd-e rule, the seven-point checklist, three-point checklist, and the menzies method have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of less experienced clinicians. Although this simplification has enabled the development of these diagnostic algorithms with good accuracy, still they showed problems that have not yet been solved. The most important shortcoming is that the purpose for which they were designed was not achieved, because the within- and between- observer concordance is very low, even for expert observers. Despite extensive research in investigating the varied presentations and physical characteristics of melanoma, a growing interest has developed in the automated analysis of digitized images obtained by elm techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions. Application of computational intelligence methods helps physicians as well as dermatologists in faster data processing to give better and more reliable diagnoses. Studies related to the automated classification of pigmented skin lesion images have appeared in the literature as early as 1987. After some successful experiments on automatic diagnostic systems for melanoma diagnosis [36,42], utility of machine vision and computerized analysis is getting more important every year. The importance of the topic is patent if we analyse the enormous quantity of research works related with the melanoma diagnosis.

• Chondroblastoma is a rare, osseous tumor that affects the epiphyseal regions of tubular bones, particularly the ends of tibia, femur, and humerus. It is characterized by localized tumors in the head and neck region, which are uncommon but can occur in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The tumor is characterized by various symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, clicking of the TMJ, hearing impairments, dizziness, and otorrhea. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma are rare, but can be observed after irradiation [3,4]. The diagnosis is challenging due to the inherent risk of malignant progression, and incomplete resection carries a high risk of recurrence. Therefore, it is advisable to attempt a complete surgical removal for the curative treatment of chondroblastoma. The study presents methods for diagnosing chondroblastoma and suitable surgical procedures for maintaining postoperative functionality. A 41-year-old male with TMJ disorder initially diagnosed with otitis media presented with chronic hearing loss on the right side. He underwent several attempts at antibiotic therapy and eustachian tube blockage but his symptoms were unresponsive to both systemic antibiotics and tubing therapy. His initial diagnosis was based on physical assessment of malocclusion and complaints of subsequently developed trismus. After 2 years, endoscopic surgery, followed by several attempts to correct malocclusion for the TMJ disorder, was implemented but resulted in no significant improvement in clinical manifestations. The patient was further assessed and a CT scan and pathologic examination showed the presence of a giant cell tumor in the temporal bone. The patient harbored the primary disease and consulted us for persistent restriction of the mouth opening as well as hearing loss and dizziness, which he had noticed 5 years earlier. The re-examination of the CT scan revealed that the tumor mass had progressively enlarged and had widely destroyed the middle cranial fossa in the temporal lobe (Fig. 1). MRI showed the presence of a poorly defined mass, with predominantly low signal and relatively high signal intensities, on T1 and T2-weighted sequences, respectively, involving the right middle cranial fossa and infratemporal fossa floor.

The prevalence of Sch varies according to population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement. The relationship between pathological thyroid dysfunction and body weight is well established. Cross-sectional studies using population cohorts have demonstrated that variations in thyroid function within the population reference range have a substantial impact on weight and body mass index (BMI). Higher levels of TSH are associated with an increased BMI and rising TSH levels which, in turn, are associated with enhanced weight gain. Additionally, an increasing amount of evidence indicates that higher levels of TSH are associated with worsening blood pressure (BP) and altered lipid levels. A cross-sectional study demonstrated that subjects with Sch exhibit increased BP and a population-based study observed positive linear associations between TSH levels and systolic and diastolic BP. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis found that Sch is associated with higher systolic BP. Thyroid hormones exert multiple effects on the regulation, absorption, and metabolism of lipid synthesis as well. Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that elevated levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), and possibly triglycerides (TG) are reversed in individuals with overt hypothyroidism following levothyroxine (T4) therapy. A number of studies have reported significant increases in serum TC, LDL-C, and TG in patients with Sch and the findings of a meta-analysis found that the TC, LDL-C, and TG levels of Sch subjects are significantly increased relative to euthyroid individuals. Similarly, a Korean study demonstrated that Sch subjects with an intermediate-to-high risk of CVD had higher coronary calcium scores than euthyroid subjects. Sch can also lead to vascular problems characterized by increased vascular stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. Studies of euthyroid individuals have shown that FT4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, even within the normal range, are inversely associated with the",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"

* The dream trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with ifg or igt, metabolic states that indicate very high risk for eventual progression to diabetes. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of ifg, igt, or both ifg and igt based on a screening 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT). Participants were randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two-by-two factorial design and followed for a median of 3 years after randomization. Participants were assessed at regular intervals to ascertain the occurrence of the primary outcome, which included new-onset diabetes or all-cause mortality. The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow-up. -cell function was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration. Both indexes have previously been validated against gold-standard measures of insulin secretion (18,19) and have been shown to be significant predictors of incident diabetes in large epidemiological studies. To account for the compensatory response of insulin secretion in relation to background insulin resistance, igi was divided by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (defined as fasting glucose / fasting insulin / 22.5) for univariate analysis or adjusted for HOMA-IR in multivariate analysis. Similarly, PI concentration was divided by c-peptide concentration (i.e., the PI / c ratio [PI / c]) for univariate analysis or adjusted for insulin secretion using c-peptide as a covariate in multivariate analysis. Although the PI-to-insulin ratio is often used to identify disproportionate elevations in PI, c-peptide offers advantages over insulin as a denominator for PI because it is cosecreted with insulin in an equimolar ratio, but unlike insulin it is not extracted by the liver and thus it has a constant peripheral clearance. The insulin assay had a sensitivity of 1.39 pmol / l, an interassay coefficient of variation (CV) of < 4.6% at all levels, and < 0.05% cross-reactivity with human c-peptide and PI.

• Brooke Spiegel's syndrome (BSS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the progressive formation of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, primarily trichoepiteliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas. It is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CYLD on chromosome 16q12q13. The study of CYLD gene mutations in patients and their relatives can provide molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling. BSS is associated with a low risk of malignancy and patients require long-term follow-up. The genetic study in the patient's daughter confirmed the presence of a heterozygous mutation in CYLD, leading to the diagnosis of BSS. The syndrome is characterized by the progressive development of adnexal skin tumors in scalp and face. Clinical manifestations start since puberty and incidence is higher in females without race. BSS has been associated with increased risk of salivary gland neoplasms and other tumors, although with little evidence. The syndrome is due to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CYLD localized on chromosome 16q12q13. It is a tumor suppressor gene that codes for a protein of the deubiquitinating enzymes family. It negatively regulates activation of factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B, JNK, and Wnt, involved in inflammation and cellular division. Loss of deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis (apoptosis resistance, uncontrolled cell division).

• Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths and its incidence is still increasing.
• Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
• The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufas) were proved in several observational and experimental studies.
• The lipid lowering action of n-3 pufas was detected at the beginning, so these nutrients were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.
• Their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects were observed later.
• Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.
• The induction of inflammation may well provide a link between hyperlipidemia and atherogenesis [2,3].
• Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease, featuring low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through disease progression.
• In physiological conditions, endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide (no) and prostaglandins (such as pge2 and pge3) and maintain a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules.
• However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts leading towards an increase production of proinflammatory cytokines as interleukins 1, 2, and 6 (il-1, 2, and 6) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf-), with further progression of the disease.

• The past 20 years have provided a rich tapestry of research into targeting the VegF signaling pathway, offering a diverse array of molecules that can modulate this pathway in cancer. This includes the development of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that inhibit VegF receptors and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) to the cytoplasmic regions of the VegF receptors. These studies have highlighted the importance of understanding the complex signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and resistance to anti-angiogenic treatments.
• The development of anti-angiogenic drugs, such as Avastin (bevacizumab), has been a cornerstone of cancer treatment. However, recent withdrawals of Avastin for breast cancer have underscored the need for alternative therapies, such as PTK inhibitors, to ensure that scarce healthcare resources are well spent in the treatment of cancer.
• Other growth factors, such as VegF-c and VegF-d, have also been identified as potential targets for promoting resistance to Avastin. These ligands can modulate the effect of VegF-a by displacing it from its receptors on endothelial cells.
• The development of mabs specific to the VegF-d vhd domain, capable of inhibiting binding to Vegfr-2 and Vegfr-3, could be a viable target for anti-cancer therapy.
• The growth factor VegF-c is closely related to VegF-d, and it includes a central VegF homology domain (vhd) related to other VegF family members. This suggests that VegF-c may be a potential alternative ligand to VegF-a for Vegfr-2 binding, which could promote tumor angiogenesis.
• The development of PTK inhibitors that block VegF receptors (not highly specific) could interfere with VegF-d-mediated signal transduction.
• The use of mabs to target VegF family members and their receptors is currently in various stages of development. These mabs could be employed to prevent binding of VegF-d to its receptors or to sequester both VegF-c and VegF-d.

* The study aimed to assess the frequency of gram-negative bacteria (GNBs) causing neonatal urinary tract infections (UTIs) over an eight-year period in neonatal division of Bahrami Children's Hospital, Iran. The study included 73 cases, with 69.9% boys and a boys-to-girl ratio of 2.32. The most common GNBs were E. coli (64.4%) and Klebsiella (19.2%). The study found that E. coli was resistant to ampicillin (93.6%) and cephalosporins (77.3%), while Klebsiella was resistant to ampicillin (92.8%) and cephalosporins (100%). The study also found that the most common susceptibility patterns toward neonatal empirical therapy antibiotics were gentamycin (59.5%) and amikacin (56.7%), with less frequent isolates showing different but consistent susceptibility patterns: enterobacter (92.9%) to ampicillin, 69.2-100% to aminoglycosides (gentamycin and amikacin), and 0-28.6% to third-generation cephalosporins. The study's strengths include its large sample size, low prevalence of urinary tract infections in term neonates, and the ability to recruit larger numbers of cases. However, the study's retrospective nature made it difficult to accurately assess the prevalence of GNBs in neonates.

• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion.
• The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-ohd), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
• CAH is divided into two main forms: classical CAH and non-classical CAH (nc CAH). Classical CAH is the most severe form, comprising both salt-wasting (sw) and simple virilizing (sv) forms, while nc CAH may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of postnatal or even adult onset hyperandrogenism.
• CAH patients experience different clinical forms, including classical CAH, the most severe form, and nc CAH, which may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of postnatal or even adult onset hyperandrogenism.
• CAH patients may experience white matter abnormalities and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis, including hyperintensities in the periventricular regions and cerebellar white matter.
• CAH patients may also exhibit cognitive deficits, including memory impairment, anxiety, and depression, due to hormonal imbalance and overproduction of 17-ohd and androgens.

• The human genome draft sequence, publicly funded and corporate projects, promises significant biomedical advances this century. Biologists must become adept at navigating the vast genomic data landscape, which may appear uniform but harbors rich knowledge. Surveying and signposting this apparently bland genomic landscape should guide investigators towards experiments addressing specific hypotheses about gene function. If the genome is to offer its secrets to all scientific communities, its surveyors need to adopt universal vocabularies. Proteins annotated by homology should be guided by comparisons of hmms or gps with protein sequence databases and implementation of an upper threshold value for e, the number of unrelated sequences expected by chance that are aligned with a particular score, or higher, in the search. The first completely sequenced genomes, such as that of haemophilus influenzae, were annotated following searches of all available sequence databases with each predicted gene product. This approach assumes that matters are straightforward, but encounters sequence similar, homologous portions of genes embedded in otherwise sequence dissimilar, non-homologous contexts. The importance of annotating genes by homology is that protein homologs invariably have similar tertiary structures and frequently also have similar functions. Domain architectures of the lbc oncogene product, and the experimentally uncharacterized protein kiaa1415, as predicted using smart, demonstrate that domain invention in the chordate lineage has made only a minor contribution to proteome diversity, whereas expansions and contractions of domain families, and domain additions and deletions, have all added greatly to proteome innovation. The animal genome sequencing projects already underway will proceed in the same manner as the publicly funded human project, through numerous draft stages and on towards completion. Proteome annotation by domain content implies that a gene product's function is a synthesis of the generalized functions of its component parts. The contribution of domain identification to gene-function prediction will remain until such a time as reliable results from high-throughput studies on a more closely related organism, such as the mouse, are available. The gene ontology project (go) has created an initial hierarchy of defined terms that encompasses many of the flavors of ' function ' commonly described in biology. Orthology is a valuable concept from which to infer functional information between species, and orthologs from the genomes of 30 bacteria, archaea and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae can be predicted directly using the cogs database. Pairs of orthologs from animal genomes are also available on the web (for example from the jackson laboratory). A more",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The study aimed to develop a prototype for measuring the debonding force of orthodontic brackets in vivo, using a strain gauge connected directly to the extremity of the pliers where the bracket debonding occurs. The prototype was compared to a prototype developed using a universal testing machine, which used a 0.40 mm diameter stainless steel claw. The prototype showed statistically significant results, with debonding performed with the universal testing machine not dependent on operator variation, and the tensile test on the universal testing machine reproducing the same conditions as the prototype. The prototype was found to be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo, with a bond strength of 2.96 mpa and 3.08 mpa, respectively, in vitro. The results suggest that the prototype might be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo, with a bond strength of 2.96 mpa and 3.08 mpa, respectively, in vitro.

• Rubella is a viral infection that can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in pregnant women, which can affect up to 110, 000 infants annually in developing countries. Rubella vaccination is crucial for preventing CRS and its serious complications in pregnant women and their fetuses. The most common rubella vaccine is derived from the Ra27/3 virus strain, which is more effective than other vaccines and induces similar immune responses. The study found that rubella vaccination significantly reduced the rate of negative antibody from 20. 42% to 0. 7% in 2006, which is in line with reliable sources and extensive country studies. The results also agree with research conducted in Mashhad, Iran, and other countries in the west of Iran. Mass rubella vaccination in 5 to 25 years old Iranian population during 2003, and continued thereafter as MMR in the national vaccination program, has significantly increased the anti-rubella antibodies and immunity in high-risk people, as premarriage Kermanshahi girls, and compared to many of the results specified in local and international sources.

• The advent of cell type specific molecular markers has made it possible to visualize gene expression patterns in a number of biological systems, including drosophila, xenopus, quail, dictyostelium, and zebrafish. Gene-specific RNA probes are now extensively used as they enable visualization of gene expression patterns and provide valuable information about the role of specific genes during development, as well as positioning and movement of a particular cell type at different stages of development.
• Whole mount in situ hybridization (wish) was initially performed using radioactive probes but was radically simplified when nonradioactive probes were used successfully [24]. It is now widely used in several biological systems, including drosophila, xenopus, quail, dictyostelium, and zebrafish. In situ hybridization (ish) is a common technique among developmental research labs, yet its uses are quite diverse and include medical and prenatal diagnostics [916]. Not long after its introduction, protocols using two different labels for the RNA probes and two color substrates were described, allowing the detection of more than one transcript simultaneously. However, a major limitation of these chromogenic multilabeling techniques is that the overlapping regions of expression are very difficult to discern.
• The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts may overcome this limitation; yet fluorophores for single- as well as double-transcript visualization in whole mounts have only been used extensively in the fly and to some extent in the zebrafish. More recently, simultaneous fluorescent detection of three transcripts was reported in the chick, and multiplexing has been used to detect up to seven transcripts in the fly [1921]. However, successful implementation of current fluorescent protocols is very rare, especially in the mouse or xenopus embryos, and even then the fluorescent images are of insufficient quality and thus cannot rival the staining obtained with normal chromogenic substrates. Additionally, imaging the signal is complicated due to the strong autofluorescence of the embryos, which interferes with fluorescent detection of RNA and makes the use of enzymatic amplification necessary in the mouse, xenopus, chick, and other embryos.
• The amplification step is also necessary in the case of chromogenic protocols; however, this step undermines the resolving ability of both methods. Amplification reactions create a precipitate which is deposited in the area surrounding the RNA and then diffuses out. Therefore, it does not remain localized within the particular intracellular region or compartment where the RNA in question is localized.",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The pancreatic cancer dataset is a heterogeneous disease classified by cancer subtypes according to their cell type of origin, structure, and behavior. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential among pancreatic cancer histopathologic subtypes. The survival of patients diagnosed with pdac may vary significantly depending on many factors, including demographic characteristics and the pathologic nature of the tumor, as well as the type of performed treatment. The most dramatic influence on the survival of patients diagnosed with pdac is a surgical resection of the tumor (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation). The estimated parameters (values of the relative impact of risk factors on the survival of cancer patients) obtained by the cox proportional regression models are largely varied, depending on the quantity and quality of data used, the set of the considered variables, and the technical approaches utilized in developing these models. The obtained estimates depend on the underlying cox models, the credibility of which can be estimated by values of their concordance indexes (c - indexes), which present the probability that for any pair of randomly drawn patients, the patient with the worst outcome estimated by this model dies earlier than one with the better estimated outcome. The reliability and generalizability of a model are essential when a model's predictions are considered for clinical practice. The reproducibility and transportability of these models were checked, and the reproducibility is defined as the performance of a model on a sample of similar patients not included in the development of the model, while transportability reflects a model's ability to predict among patients from different but plausible related populations. The models were developed using univariate models with the kaplan-meier method and multivariate cox proportional hazards models, and the models were validated using cross-validation with 10 iterations.

• Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same set-up, with the drive electrode disconnected.
• Measurements were taken with a lock-in amplifier, which also generated the drive and bias signals.
• The Allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
• The phase of the measured signal (t) was monitored for a certain amount of time and then transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.
• Close to the resonance frequency, this phase response was linear, f2qf0.
• Using the complete phase response of the resonator instead of this linearization does not significantly alter the Allan deviation.
• Harmonics appearing at the frequency of the electricity supply (multiples of 50 Hz) were filtered out of data during post-processing.
• Using this method, we obtained n samples of the resonance frequency of the resonator f1fn, each averaged over an integration time, 0.
• The Allan deviation for this integration time could then be defined as: (2)a(0)=12(n1)1n1(fi+1fif0)2.
• The correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within the resonator's bandwidth.
• The measurement set-up was based on the one described in supplementary section 3, but here each signal was doubled, using two drive signals at different frequencies, two bias signals, and two measurement signals (supplementary figure S9 shows a detailed measurement scheme).
• Care was taken when choosing the drive signal amplitudes so that the resonator remained in the linear regime.

Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) through single-electron reduction of molecular oxygen (O2). ROS are converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by cellular superoxide dismutases (SODs). Similar to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, oxidation of cysteine residues represents a reversible posttranslational protein modification that regulates signaling. Mitochondrial ROS generation is essential for the propagation of cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs. The epidermis contains increased mitochondrial and oxidant content when induced to differentiate, and increased ROS levels correlate with differentiation of escs and ipscs. The results show that mros generation is required for activation of notch and -catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth, and that mros acts as pro-differentiation signals. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial metabolism promotes cellular differentiation remain poorly understood, and more studies are needed to determine how mitochondrial metabolism regulates differentiation. The interaction between cellular metabolism and differentiation programs will be increasingly studied in years to come.

* The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the flaviviridae family. It was first identified by Cho et al. in 1982. The study of HCV has primarily focused on functional analysis and therapeutic implications. Pathologists often detect viral pathogens within routinely prepared biopsy tissue samples, and simple and reliable histochemical techniques are needed. In situ hybridization (ISH) is a reliable technique for detecting HCV RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues, particularly for routine diagnostic purposes. The lna-based ish technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAII) has been established for detecting HCV RNA in FFPE tissue sections. The lna-based ish technique has been applied to detect HCV RNA in human liver biopsy specimens, and the sensitivity is comparable to in situ RT-PCR. The lna-based ish technique is relatively simple and requires no special equipment to perform. It has been approved by the institutional ethical review board for clinical and epidemiological investigations at Fujita Health University, Tokyo, Japan. The study was approved by the institutional ethical review board for clinical and epidemiological investigations at Fukuoka University, Toyoake, Japan.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals can alter the thyroid system in amphibians, leading to changes in thyroid hormone levels and morphology. The oecd and epa established guidelines for investigating frog metamorphosis, focusing on thyroid toxicity. Amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to certain contaminants, such as halogenated phenols and p-nitrophenols, which can disrupt thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine (T4) and converts it to 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3), which is crucial for the development of aquatic larvae into tetrapods. The thyroid hormone balance is influenced by sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation processes, which can be affected by various chemicals. The thyroid gland's structure and function are conserved between vertebrates, and its production and secretion are similar in amphibians and mammals. Chemicals interfering with T3 binding to T4 can directly affect the free concentration of plasma T3 and its plasma clearance rate. Chemical compounds including des, phenolic and phenol compounds, and pentachlorophenol and ioxynil can bind to TTR, and yamauchi et al. reported that des inhibits T3 binding to TTR, while phenolic and phenol compounds can reduce circulating levels of T3 through biliary elimination. The sulfation activity of TTR in amphibians is higher than in mammals, and it is closely related to metamorphosis.

It is commonly associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides. The crystal structure of polyhalite is first determined in samples from altaussee in Austria and later confirmed by laboratory conditions. Polyhalite can be synthesised under laboratory conditions by a reaction of gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system k2so4mgso4h2o at temperatures above 70°C. It is stable between room temperature (0°C) and 255°C or 285°C. Polyhalite is most commonly formed early-diagenetically (e.g., holser, 1966; busson and Perthuisot, 1977; pierre, 1985; khn and mller - schmitz, 1987) by brine-back reactions of kmg so4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite or glauberite (e.g., braitsch, 1962; schauberger, 1986; warren, 2006). For example, all alpine polyhalites are of secondary origin (leitner, 2011; leitner et al., 2011). Polyhalite is stable between room temperature (0°C) and 255°C or 285°C.

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and characteristics of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHh), a rare condition characterized by gonadal dysgenesis due to insufficient gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus. The prevalence of IHh is about 1/10,000 in men and 1/50,000 in women. The number of IHh patients is small in any one geographical area, and it is difficult for a single clinical center to perform comprehensive assessment due to the limited number of cases. The Internet has become a new modality of medical research, which can cover large populations with low investigation costs, especially for rare diseases in a particular network social group. The study utilized a web-based disease-specific social networking group for investigation, which can collect large numbers of clinical cases within a short period for the research purpose. The results showed that hormone replacement therapy could effectively improve the conditions of IHh patients, and the commonly used gonadotropin + androgen therapy appears to be superior to androgen replacement alone, although the actual clinical significance needs to be confirmed in prospective randomized control studies.

• Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome, including the dynamic nature of chromatin and the regulation of gene expression and replication.
• The genome is folded hierarchically into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), with specific long-range looping interactions occurring.
• Each of these structures can be dynamically regulated during development and perturbations in these folding units are associated with multiple diseases and cancer.
• One interesting feature revealed by fine mapping of the genome folding is the tad structures, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size.
• Tads are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions.
• The replication timing, presence of histone modifications, and expression of genes inside a tad are highly correlated.
• However, the underlying features that generate invariant tad boundaries remain unknown.
• In human cells, tad boundaries are associated with the enrichment of ctcf, cohesin, dnase I hypersensitivity, and certain histone marks.
• In Drosophila, the combinatorial binding of insulators (also known as architectural proteins) is associated with the strength of tad boundaries.
• The boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, thus the most likely interaction partner for a genomic region is another region within the same tad.
• A strong tad boundary limits interactions between the two adjacent tad domains, whereas a weak tad boundary allows a higher frequency of inter-tad interactions.
• Although a relationship between tad boundaries and the binding of insulators has been demonstrated, the effects of enzymes that modify or remodel chromatin are largely unknown.
• The major atpase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1 (also known as SMARCA4), is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions as well as for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions.
• The relationship between BRG1 loss and reduced tad boundary strength was demonstrated in human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells.
• The results suggest that BRG1 plays a role in tad boundaries by regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly ctcf localization.
• The model proposed by Dixon et al. is reinforced by accumulating evidence that highlights the role of topoisomerase II beta (top2b) in regulating tad boundaries.
• Recent results from bacteria and yeast suggest that top2b binding overlaps with almost",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

In the study, the authors investigated the relationship between count data, specifically the number of failed courses and semesters, using Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models. The Poisson regression model was preferred when the mean and variance of the distribution were the same, while Negative Binomial regression was used when the variance was larger than the mean. The authors also considered zero-inflated Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models, which were used to model the number of failed courses and semesters, respectively. The results showed that the university average and quota system had inverse relationships with the response variable, and the increase in the number of failed courses resulted in the number of failed semesters. The authors concluded that the use of zero-inflated Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models can reduce the number of failed courses.

* Resovist, a promising new superparamagnetic iron oxide tracer, is not suitable for applications requiring a long circulation time of the mpi tracer in blood. The study highlights a difference in the blood half-life of the mpi tracer between resovist sourced from Bayer Pharma AG and resovist sourced from Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. The study also indicates that the mpi signal of resovist in blood lacks the second, slower elimination phase observed in mri and rapidly decays below noise level, making it unsuitable for applications requiring long circulating or even blood pool tracers. The study suggests that resovist should be used as a bolus tracer for vascular applications, and that two issues have to be considered: the distribution of resovist by Bayer Pharma AG in Europe has been discontinued and resovist distributed by Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd may be the standard of reference until a dedicated spio tracer is marketed.

• The control of appetite is complex and involves inputs from both physiological and environmental sources.
• Early theoretical approaches focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue.
• More recent models emphasise inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, with hormonal signals from specialised cells in the gut or associated organs.
• The major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, pyy, glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1), cholecystokinin (cck), amylin, and insulin from specialised cells in the gastrointestinal tract or associated organs.
• Such models account for the regulation of appetite and contribute to the regulation of body weight, through the identification of specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.
• Interest in this type of formulation has strengthened during the period when molecular biology began to take over from integrative physiology as an explanatory approach in biological sciences.
• The major task facing any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat, with intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signalling and tonic inhibition.
• An alternative to the molecular approach to appetite control has arisen from the study of energy balance, with the inter-relationships between ee and energy intake.
• The new formulation based on psychobiological research and a multi-level experimental platform accounts for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat, with intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signalling and tonic inhibition.
• The new formulation suggests that the relationship between rmr and daily ee is positive, with rmr being positively associated with meal size and daily ee.
• The new formulation also suggests that rmr is positively associated with fasting levels of hunger and influences the profile of hunger across the day.
• The new formulation implies that rmr is a measure of ee, reflecting a physiological demand for energy that acts as a driver of food intake.
• The new formulation suggests that the relationship between rmr and daily ee is consistent with the amino-static hypothesis put forward more than 50 years ago by mellinkoff et al.
• The new formulation also draws attention to other aspects of body composition as determinants of appetite.
• The new formulation can incorporate an extended role for leptin and is in keeping with a widening ergostatic function of additional adipokinetic hormones in energy homeostasis.
• The new formulation can help to promote research to clarify the relative strength of biological and environmental variables that contribute to ee",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

The study evaluates the establishment of native perennial warm-season grasses in southern Arizona, focusing on the germination and establishment periods. It finds that successful establishment requires sufficient rainfall, which is typically below 300 mm, and that the timing of rainfall events is crucial for germination and establishment. The study also highlights the variability in rainfall patterns across different regions, which may affect the establishment success of native grasses. The findings suggest that while warm-season perennial grasses may not be at risk from climate change scenarios, the study indicates that funding for reseeding is necessary to ensure a second year of reseeding if a reclamation failure occurs the year before.

* The olfactory epithelium is a unique niche for neural stem cells, containing both olfactory sensory neurons and olfactory epithelial cells. Recent studies have identified several neurogenic stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, including globose basal cells (gbcs) and horizontal basal cells (hbcs). These cells have the potential to differentiate into neurons and non-neuronal cells, including olfactory sensory neurons and olfactory epithelial cells. The study found that gbcs are the primary source of neural stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, and their differentiation into neurons and non-neuronal cells is essential for the ongoing neurogenesis in the oe throughout adult life. The study also demonstrated that gbcs are highly sensitive to changes in the extracellular matrix, such as the presence of fibronectin and laminin, which may play a role in their differentiation and proliferation.

• Progressive diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affect a significant number of people worldwide. These diseases cause a dramatic loss in life expectancy and quality of life.
• These diseases are caused by misfolding and/or incorrect elimination of distinct polypeptides. Misfolding is the aggregation of proteins after misfolding, while incorrect elimination leads to the spread of misfolded proteins.
• Misfolding and incorrect elimination are driven by the aggregation of soluble forms of homologous proteins. These soluble forms are recruited to cells and spread from one cell to another.
• The aggregation of misfolded proteins creates a self-sustaining, exponential vicious circle leading to disease. This process is driven by the template-driven misfolding of similar proteins over time.
• Molecular chaperones play a central role in maintaining normal cellular proteostasis. They can either promote or inhibit the propagation and amplification of misfolded proteins.
• The ubiquitin proteasome system degrades misfolded proteins efficiently, but it is limited to prion-like aggregation. High molecular weight irreversible assemblies are cleared by autophagy.
• Misfolded proteins can aggregate into intra- or extracellular protein deposits, depending on whether they are within the cytosol or the extracellular space. These deposits can trigger heat shock response.
• The aggregation of misfolded proteins can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function. This is due to either i) misfolded protein aggregates mediated permeabilization of the plasma membrane or membranous compartments, ii) errors during translation and iii) incorrect processing and elimination of proteins targeted to degradation.
• The aggregation of misfolded proteins can lead to the formation of intracellular protein deposits, such as alpha-synuclein deposits in Parkinson's disease. These deposits can trigger heat shock response.

1. Methadone is frequently used in different therapies, including opioid addiction, long-lasting analgesics in cancer, and neuropathic pain syndromes.
2. Methadone exposure has been shown to cause cognitive impairment, including impaired psychomotor performance, information processing, attention, problem solving, memory, decision making, reaction time, and emotional facial expression recognition.
3. Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration (Ca) are involved in controlling cellular processes such as neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and gene transcription.
4. However, the physiological Ca signal can switch to a death signal when Ca levels increase dramatically.
5. Mitochondrial Ca overload can contribute to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation and ultimately lead to cell death.
6. Methadone-induced cognitive impairment is associated with changes in mitochondrial Ca levels, which can be influenced by the presence or absence of extracellular Ca.
7. The mechanisms underlying these changes in mitochondrial Ca levels are unknown, and further studies are needed to understand the specific factors involved.
8. The observed changes in mitochondrial Ca levels in sh - sy5y cells may be related to the involvement of mitochondrial Ca transport and the mitochondrial uncoupling mechanism.
9. The findings suggest that methadone-induced cognitive impairment may be caused by improper functioning of mechanisms that directly control mitochondrial activity.
10. The study indicates that methadone-induced cognitive impairment is not a direct result of plasma membrane Ca channels or opioid receptors, but rather a role of mitochondrial Ca transport.

1. Risk-reducing salpingo-ovarianectomy (rrso) is a cancer prevention strategy used by many women with germline mutations in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes.
2. The magnitude of the risk reductions in women with BRCA1/2 mutations who have undergone rrso compared with those who have not is unclear.
3. A fixed-effects meta-analysis of pooled results from 10 published reports of rrso and the risks of breast and/or ovarian or fallopian tube cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
4. The summary risk reduction estimates should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies.
5. Data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with rrso.
6. To identify all reports of rrso in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, we searched the PubMed database using the search terms ""oophorectomy"" and ""brca1"" or ""brca2"".
7. This search yielded 346 studies that were published between January 1999 and December 2007.
8. We then evaluated the full text of these citations to identify articles presenting primary data that provided estimates of risk reduction due to rrso.
9. No publications were excluded based on quality, sample size, language of publication, or other objective criteria related to study design and analysis.
10. However, some publications that reported rrso in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were not included because they did not estimate risk reduction.
11. These included case reports, psychosocial or behavioral studies, commentaries, and clinical recommendations.
12. Because the number of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is relatively limited and most research groups studying these women are in routine communication and collaborate with one another, we also undertook personal communications with all of the researchers or consortia that have large series of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and were known to have data that could have been used to report data on this topic.
13. We undertook a fixed-effects meta-analysis using the hazard ratios (hrs) and/or odds ratios (as published in the original reports) to estimate the pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (cis).

* The isolation of pure populations of cells from heterogeneous cell suspensions is essential for clinical and basic research. Microfluidic devices offer advantages over conventional separation techniques, such as small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential for integration with analytical techniques. Examples include the magnetic separation of leukocytes from erythrocytes, the isolation of fluorescent and non-fluorescent escherichia coli cells, and the separation of immunogenic t cells from whole blood. Microfluidic systems can also be used to separate rare cells, such as metastatic cancer cells, from peripheral blood. The development of microfluidic systems with integrated waveguides and cell culture chambers has the potential to reduce sample loss due to external handling or dead volumes, making them particularly relevant for the isolation of rare cells. The combination of magnetic microbeads and external magnetic field has been used in a y-shaped microfluidic device to separate immunogenic t cells from whole blood, achieving high throughput (up to 40%) with a purity of >90%. The use of magnetic microbeads and external magnetic field has also been demonstrated in a static microfabricated system, providing a method to extract useful proteomic or genomic data from selected cells. The development of microfluidic systems with integrated waveguides and cell culture chambers has the potential to improve the efficiency of cell separation and sorting, making them suitable for applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, drug discovery, and chemical biological agent detection.

* Chronic pain and depression are common health problems reported by patients attending primary care. Pain and its coexistence with depression are associated with significant limitations in daily activities, physical activities, and poor self-rated health. Studies have shown that 2240% of all primary care contacts are due to pain. Persistent pain is often comorbid with depression both in general pain conditions and in disease-specific conditions. Pain is the most prevalent somatic symptom in patients with depression. Dolotest, a validated pain- and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment tool, has been developed to provide a shared understanding of patients' situations. It is a visual profile of pain intensity with assessment of impact on eight 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS). The study found that dolotest is useful as a screening tool for depression in primary care, and the sensitivity and specificity for dolotest used for screening for depression were 78% and 95%, respectively. Dolotest has been validated for both pain and depression, and it has been used as a screening tool for patients meeting criteria for depression and the coexistence of pain and depression. The study contributes to the growing knowledge about coexistence of pain and depression, finding that 16.1% of all patients met criteria for depression, and 26.8% whose visit was due to pain, met depression criteria. The visual dolotest profiles can facilitate both awareness and communication about depression and pain, and a coexistence leading to increased risk of reduced function, reduced work capacity, increased risk of opioid misuse, reduced HRQOL, and other related problems.

• Behavioral Health Home Services (BHH) was designed to provide services to reduce barriers to care for individuals with chronic conditions. These services include population-based care to identify abnormal hemoglobin A1c levels and clarify the severity of findings, allowing for enhanced, individualized interventions for individuals with SMI.
• The BHH was embedded in the division of community psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The division consists of 2 large outpatient mental health clinics, adult and child assertive community treatment (ACT) teams, and an adult psychiatric rehabilitation program (PRP). These settings serve 2000 individuals annually.

• Oppenheimer's theory on marriage formation and timing has been re-examined in the European context, showing that employment and income effects on union formation are weaker in more egalitarian societies compared to traditional ones. The article also suggests that men's economic status matters more for marriage in more traditional societies. The employment interaction effect is weaker in more traditional societies, while the other interaction effects are not affected. The article concludes that the employment effects on union formation are more than just a matter of financial resources, in line with the uncertainty hypothesis. The income interaction effects are sensitive to outliers, but the pattern is weaker. The article also suggests that the transition from cohabitation to marriage is more sensitive to men's economic position than to their employment status.

Summary: The study evaluated the frequency of symptoms commonly observed in untreated malaria before and after treatment with chloroquine and primaquine in patients with vivax malaria in Brazil. The study found that symptoms such as fever, chills, sweating, and pain symptoms were common in untreated malaria, with a significant increase in the frequency of nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, and abdominal pain after treatment. The study also found that chloroquine can cause side effects or intensify symptoms already present, such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The study recommends that primaquine use should be monitored for hemolytic anemia, which can also occur in people without g6pd deficiency when using primaquine. The study also found that severe hemolysis can occur in patients with g6pd deficiency, which can be associated with weakness and malaise. The study suggests that the use of primaquine in vivax malaria should be monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms and hemolysis, and that patients with g6pd deficiency should be monitored for severe hemolysis. The study also found that the use of primaquine in malaria control policies should be monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms and hemolysis, and that patients with g6pd deficiency should be monitored for severe hemolysis.

1. The life span of humans has been prolonged, and the proportion of elderly people in the total population has increased.
2. Various changes occur in the human body with age, including lower urinary tract symptoms (luts), erectile dysfunction (ed), and decreased libido.
3. Several community-based studies have shown a strong correlation among sexual dysfunction, increasing age, and the severity of luts.
4. The coexistence of sexual problems with luts and benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) further affects quality of life (qol).
5. The continuous efforts have been made to disclose the common pathophysiology between luts and ed.
6. No definite explanations have been given to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of the correlation between luts and ed.
7. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.
8. One possible cause is overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.
9. According to this hypothesis, luts increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which induces the occurrence of urinary storage symptoms due to the contraction of smooth muscles in the prostate gland and urinary bladder.
10. Ed occurs as the result of smooth muscle contractions in the corpus spongiosum, and the myosin light chain is phosphorylated because of increased rho - kinase activity, which can cause smooth muscle layer contraction.
11. It has been proposed that endothelial dysfunction in the prostate gland and corpus spongiosum and hormonal imbalance are physiological causes for the correlation between luts and erectile dysfunction.
12. Changes in lifestyle due to nocturia and rapid eye movement sleep disorder may affect the occurrence of erectile dysfunction.
13. The result of our preliminary study showed that age, international prostate symptom score (ipss), nocturia, and the uroflow rate correlated significantly with the 5-item version of the international index of erectile function (iief-5).
14. The prostate gland volume was not significantly correlated with sexual function, implying that erectile function is not affected by subjective luts even with a relatively greater prostate size.
15. Irwin et al reported that overactive bladder (oab) was significantly associated with increased prevalence of ed and that sexual activity, sexual enjoyment, and sexual satisfaction were reduced as a result of urinary symptoms.
16. These findings suggest that rudimentary treatments of luts, a risk factor for erectile dysfunction, would be mandatory to effectively improve sexual function in",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '*'}"

1. Loss of mir-200c is a marker for chemoresistance and aggressiveness in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers.
2. The double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1 allows for plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal states.
3. Restoration of mir-200c in cancer cells that do not express it causes a decrease in invasion and migration, even in the absence of e- cadherin.
4. Restoration of mir-200c in ovarian cancer cells results in a dramatic decrease in migration and invasion, even though e- cadherin is not restored.
5. The ability of ovarian cancer cells to spread and adhere to the peritoneal cavity is related to the expression of tubb3, which is a direct target of mir-200c.
6. The increase in chemosensitivity to paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells is associated with the restoration of mir-200c, indicating that mir-200c plays a role in the development of resistance to microtubule targeting agents.

1. The transobturator approach to treating female stress urinary incontinence involves using a midurethral sling (mus) placement to prevent complications associated with the retropubic mus placement originally described by Delorme.
2. The inside-out approach, which uses an inside-out mus device, was later described by de Leval to further reduce the potential injury to the urethra and bladder.
3. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence, namely the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator mus procedures.
4. Multiple studies have discussed the anatomical trajectories of both obturator approaches and confirmed their anatomical safety from a neurovascular perspective.
5. Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the mus s configuration in relation to the urethra, as a progressive dissection of the entire tape s trajectory would be required, leading to a distortion of relevant anatomy.
6. The large body of clinical evidence supports these findings.
7. To date, anatomical studies have focused on the mus s trajectory in relation to the obturator foramen, the muscles, and especially the neurovascular structures.
8. Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the mus s configuration in relation to the urethra, as a progressive dissection of the entire tape s trajectory would be required, leading to a distortion of relevant anatomy.
9. The aim of this cadaveric study was to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach.

• The committee discussed the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, which aims to clarify the legislation and remove a little-used defence. Sally Jenkins, a social services representative, highlighted the importance of awareness raising and training for professionals, and the need for a clear duty on Welsh Government to raise awareness of the impact of the legislation. The committee also discussed the costs and resources involved in implementing the legislation, and the need for additional investment in front-line services. The motion to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting was proposed, and the committee agreed to do so.

The programme includes interim measures and permanent measures, with interim measures focusing on improving the performance of children and schools, while permanent measures aim to address broader issues within the system. The programme has been in place for several years, with a focus on improving the performance of disadvantaged children and schools. The Welsh Government has committed to using PISA data to inform the programme's performance measures, with a goal of achieving a score of 500 on the PISA 2022 scale by 2025. The programme has been successful in improving the performance of disadvantaged children and schools, but there is still work to be done to close the attainment gap between eligible and non-eligible children.
