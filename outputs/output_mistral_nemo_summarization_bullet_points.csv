0,"• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood.
• Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport.
• The interest in ratchets lies in the possibility of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems.
• Recent studies have focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.
• The behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is sensitive to system parameters.
• Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in trajectory dynamics.
• Barbieri and Salerno argued against Mateos' conjecture, showing current reversals without bifurcations and proposing an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.
• The authors of the given document investigate the impact of different ensembles of particles on the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet and find that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.",1,"{'n_points': 8, 'symbol': '•'}"
1,"* The source document discusses the discovery of extrasolar planets with wide range of eccentricities.
* One method proposed to explain the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets is planet-planet scattering.
* This method has been proposed to explain the architecture of the HD 20782 and planetary system, which contains a hot Jupiter as well as two jovian planets in moderately eccentric orbits.
* Interactions with stellar companions are another possible way to boost a planet's eccentricity.
* The Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of a planet if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large.
* This mechanism has been suggested to explain the high eccentricity of 16 Cyg BB and HD 80606b.
* The Kozai mechanism is most effective in systems with a single planet in an orbit within 5.1 AU from the host star.
* Of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity, six are also known to possess stellar-mass companions in wide binary orbits.
* The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) is a joint project of several universities and is named in honor of its principal benefactors, William P. Hobby and Robert E. Eberly.
* The document presents updated orbital fits, dynamical simulations, and detection limit computations for six highly eccentric planetary systems: HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B.",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'symbol': '*'}"
2,"* The LEP experiments at the Z pole tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousands.
* The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the Z pole.
* Taking these achievements into account, the physics of the Z boson will again play the central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Z factory comes true with the generated Z events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP.
* This factory can be realized in the GigaZ option of the International Linear Collider (ILC) by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
* Given the high luminosity, the cross section at the Z resonance of about 10^-34, and the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of Z decay can be improved from 10^-8 at the LEP to 10^-9 at the GigaZ.

* Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with three main types: Bell-nonlocality, EPR steerability, and non-separability.
* Bell-nonlocality is the strongest type, where measurement correlations violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality.
* EPR steerability is a weaker type, where one party (Alice or Bob) can demonstrate steering by measuring their local observables, while the other party's reduced state depends on the choice of measurement made by the first party.
* Non-separability is the weakest type, where the state cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents.
* The set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non-EPR steerable states, which is a strict subset of the set of Bell-local states.
* EPR steerability is the only way to verify the existence of entanglement if one party (Alice or her detectors) cannot be trusted.
* The paper investigates EPR steerability of a class of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals (T-states) using the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism.
* The paper develops a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for projective measurements on T-states and conjectures that this model is optimal.
* The paper also derives two sufficient conditions for EPR steerability of T-states via EPR steering inequalities, including a new asymmetric steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix.

* The use of spin polarization of a single electron to encode binary information was first mentioned by Richard Feynman in casual conversations around 1985, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates were not proposed until the mid-1990s.
* Encoding information in spin has potential advantages, such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation compared to charge-based devices.
* In 1994, a scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed.
* The scheme uses exchange interaction between nearest neighbor spins and anti-ferromagnetic ordering to achieve the desired logic functionality.
* However, the scheme has a severe shortcoming that precludes its use in pipelined architectures due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction.
* A solution to this problem was proposed in 1996, involving the use of a three-phase clock to enforce unidirectional flow of logic signals.
* Despite the interesting physics involved, these devices are not currently practical due to lithography challenges and energy dissipation.

8,"• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
• The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors are the lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the so-called period gap) and the sharp cut-off of the distribution at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
• The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star, while thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius. The minimum period occurs where the two corresponding time scales, the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time, are about equal.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"
9,"• The mid-infrared spectral mapping of Stephan's Quintet using the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed a large-scale distribution of warm molecular hydrogen (H2) emission, with a lower limit luminosity of 1.0 x 10^42 erg s^-1 spread over 30 kpc.
• Another shock-excited feature, the ""H2 bridge,"" was discovered between the main shock and NGC 7319, likely a remnant of past tidal interactions within the group.
• The spatial variation in the distribution of H2 0-0 line ratios suggests differences in temperature and excitation in the shocked system, which will be explored in detail in a follow-up paper.
• The global L(H2)/L(X-ray) ratio in the main shock is ~92, and ~62.5 in the new ""bridge"" feature, indicating that mid-infrared H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-ray emission over the shock structures.
• This modifies the traditional view that X-ray emission always dominates cooling in the later stages of evolution in compact groups of galaxies.
• The observations suggest that molecular hydrogen cooling cannot be assumed to be negligible in high-redshift environments, especially in situations where strong shocks propagate into a clumpy, multiphase medium.
• The enhanced cooling due to molecular hydrogen, which has so far been neglected, will depend on the distribution and nature of the first dust grains, in concert with the formation, temperature, and abundance of gas, and the feedback effects from the first stars and AGN.",1,"{'n_points': 7, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during early planet formation.
* UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula is the leading explanation for generating oxygen anomalies.
* Marginally gravitationally unstable (MGUI) disks can lead to rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains.
* The models presented show that a phase of MGUI in disks and stars with a variety of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid mixing and transport of disk gas and small grains.

* The first observational evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was found when supernovae type Ia were found to be fainter than expected.
* This fact has been confirmed by many independent observations such as temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), and gamma-ray bursts.
* Within the framework of general relativity, the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, termed dark energy (DE).
* The nature of this unknown matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort in order to understand its properties.
* The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of the dark energy (DE) driving the present epoch of the accelerated expansion of our universe and a dark matter (DM) component giving rise to galaxies and their large-scale structures distributions.
* The DM is assumed to have negligible pressure and temperature and is termed cold.
* Thanks to the agreement with observations, the model is commonly known as LambdaCDM, to indicate the nature of its main components.
* While favored by the observations, the model is not satisfactory from the theoretical point of view: the value of the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than what it was estimated in particle physics.
* It was suggested soon that DE could be dynamic, evolving with time.
* This new cosmological model also suffers from a severe fine-tune problem known as the coincidence problem: if the time variation of matter and DE are very different, why are their current values so similar?

* The solar corona is heated to about 12 million kelvins, while the visible surface is roughly 250 times cooler.
* Magnetic fields or waves play a key role in the heating of the solar corona.
* The primary energy source for coronal heating lies in the convection zone below the solar photosphere.
* The debate centers on whether the energy to heat the corona derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events giving rise to nanoflares.
* Interaction of the magnetic field with convective flows in or below the photosphere can produce two types of magnetic disturbances in coronal structures: MHD waves and field-aligned electric currents.
* These types of magnetic heating mechanisms can be crudely classified as either wave-heating or current-heating mechanisms.
* Theoretical arguments exist for both mechanisms, but observational evidence for nano-flare heating is less convincing.
* High-frequency MHD waves are capable of significant heating and have been sought using the Fe XIV green ""line at 530.3 nm and the Fe X red ""line at 637.5 nm.

• The entanglement distribution over the subsystems when the reservoirs are photonic band gap (PBG) media is studied explicitly, and a stable entanglement distribution configuration is found in the non-Markovian dynamics.
• The entanglement dynamics and its distributions in the bipartite partitions are completely determined by the time-dependent factor of single-qubit excited-state population.
• Population trapping is responsible for the suppression of spontaneous emission and the formation of bound states between the qubit and its amplitude damping reservoir.

* Alternative DE models have been proposed, such as quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic DE, new agegraphic DE, and Ricci DE.
* Modifications to the gravitational sector can also induce effective dark energy, such as f(R) gravity, gravity with higher curvature invariants, scalar-tensor theories, vector field contributions, and higher-dimensional spacetimes.

* The actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation, only their ratio matters.
* Even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, inferences for dark energy from combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged.
* The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance a sound wave travels between the end of inflation and recombination, is the key quantity measured.
* The sound speed depends only on the baryon-photon ratio, and the sound horizon depends only on this ratio and the redshift of equality.
* The epoch of recombination is very insensitive to cosmology, and the baryon-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB.
* The acoustic peak method depends upon measuring the sound horizon, which translates into knowledge of the wavelength of baryonic features in the mass power spectrum.
* Measuring this scale at lower redshifts in large galaxy surveys constrains the matter and energy content of the universe, with the prefactors of the sound horizon canceling out between the CMB and low-redshift distances.

140,"• Many-body theory flourished in the 1970s, with much attention given to many-body effects on XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra from deep core levels in metals.
• Related effects were singularities that appeared near edges in absorption and emission spectra.
• The CB (conduction band) electrons can have many different effects on the XPS peak from the core level.
• If the excitation could be considered adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by the CB electrons would lead to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy (lower binding energy of the core level).
• The excitation is not adiabatic; it is swift. The excitation frequency is large compared to the frequency components taking part in the screening of the core hole.
• This has the effect that the CB electrons are shaken up and are left in a non-equilibrium state.
• This is analogous to removing a cork from a glass of water slowly or briskly.
• In a metal, the water waves correspond to plasmons, collective excitations of the CB electrons.
• The shake-up effects will show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum; the main peak will be at the adiabatic position; the first replica, a smaller copy of the main peak, will be at a shifted position to lower kinetic energy where the shift is equal to the plasma frequency; the second replica is even smaller and shifted with two plasma frequencies; this goes on until further peaks are absorbed by the background.",1,"{'n_points': 9, 'symbol': '•'}"

* RCRA's requirements for managing hazardous waste can hinder cleanups, particularly of remediation waste.
* EPA has identified three key requirements that create disincentives for cleanup: land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and permit requirements.
* Land disposal restrictions require waste to be treated to stringent standards before it can be disposed of on land.
* Minimum technological requirements set design and operating specifications for facilities that treat or dispose of hazardous waste.
* Permit requirements prohibit the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste without a permit.
* EPA has developed policy and regulatory alternatives to mitigate the impact of these requirements on cleanups.
* The contained-in policy allows contaminated media to be excluded from RCRA's regulation if they no longer pose a hazard.
* The Superfund waiver exempts on-site cleanups from the requirement to obtain a RCRA permit.
* The source of contamination presumption allows cleanup managers to presume that waste is not a listed hazardous waste if no records exist to document its source.
* The area of contamination policy allows waste to be consolidated and treated or left in place and capped without triggering land disposal restrictions.
* The corrective action management unit (CAMU) rule allows waste to be managed within a strictly defined area on-site without meeting RCRA's land disposal restrictions or minimum technological requirements.
* EPA proposed a comprehensive rule in 1996 to reform RCRA's requirements for managing remediation waste, but plans to withdraw it due to stakeholder disagreements and legal uncertainties.
* EPA is pursuing final rulemaking on four narrower portions of the proposal by June 1998.
* EPA believes that comprehensive reform of remediation waste management can best be achieved through legislative revision of RCRA.
* GAO recommends that EPA take steps to ensure that regulators overseeing cleanups have a more consistent understanding of how to apply EPA's existing policy and regulatory alternatives to RCRA's requirements for managing remediation waste.

The procurement process provides for acquiring supplies and services from nonfederal sources and administering the related contractual instruments. It also provides for administering grants, cooperative agreements, and other transactions executed by contracting offices. The procurement process begins with the receipt of a requirement and ends at the contract closeout. In November 1994, DOD’s Director of Defense Procurement (DDP) initiated the SPS program to acquire and deploy a single automated system to perform all contract management-related functions within DOD’s procurement process for all DOD organizations and activities. From 1994 to 1996, DOD defined SPS requirements and solicited commercially available vendor products for satisfying these requirements. DOD subsequently awarded a contract to American Management Systems (AMS), Incorporated, in April 1997, to use its commercially available contract management system as the foundation for SPS, modify this commercial product as necessary to meet the requirements, and perform related services. DOD also directed the contractor to deliver SPS functionality in four incremental releases. The department later increased the number of releases across which this functionality would be delivered to seven; reduced the size of the increments; and allowed certain, more critical functionality to be delivered sooner. Over the last 4 years, DOD and AMS have deployed four releases to 773 locations in support of 21,900 users. The fifth release was delivered in February 2001 for acceptance testing; however, due to software deficiencies, this release was sent back to the vendor for rework and has not been deployed.
