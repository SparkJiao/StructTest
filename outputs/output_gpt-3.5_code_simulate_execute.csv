1. Import the `sys` module.
2. Define the function `next_smallest_palindrome` that takes an integer `num` as input.
3. Convert the integer `num` to a string `numstr`.
4. Iterate over the range starting from `num+1` to `sys.maxsize`:
    - In the first iteration, check if the current number is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If it is a palindrome, return the number.
5. If no palindrome number is found, the function will not return anything.

### Inputs

```
99
```

### Response

Let's simulate the function execution:

1. `num = 99`
2. Convert `num` to a string: `numstr = ""99""`
3. Iterate over the range starting from `num+1` to `sys.maxsize`:
    - In the first iteration, `i = 100`
        - Check if `str(i) == str(i)[::-1]`. Since `str(100) != str(100)[::-1]`, continue to the next iteration.
    - In the second iteration, `i = 101`
        - Check if `str(i) == str(i)[::-1]`. Since `str(101) == str(101)[::-1]`, return `101`.

3. Return `total`.

Let's calculate `div_sum(36)`:

- `i = 2`: 36 is divisible by 2, so `total = 1 + 2 + 36 // 2 = 1 + 2 + 18 = 21`
- `i = 3`: 36 is not divisible by 3
- `i = 4`: 36 is divisible by 4, so `total = 21 + 4 + 36 // 4 = 21 + 4 + 9 = 34`
- `i = 5`: 36 is not divisible by 5
- `i = 6`: 36 is divisible by 6, so `total = 34 + 6 + 36 // 6 = 34 + 6 + 6 = 46`
- `i = 7`: 36 is not divisible by 7
- `i = 8`: 36 is not divisible by 8
- `i = 9`: 36 is divisible by 9, so `total = 46 + 9 + 36 // 9 = 46 + 9 + 4 = 59`
- `i = 10`: 36 is not divisible by 10
- `i = 11`: 36 is not divisible by 11
- `i = 12`: 36 is divisible by 12, so `total = 59 + 12 + 36 // 12 = 59 + 12 + 3 = 74`
- `i = 13`: 36 is not divisible by 13
- `i = 14`: 36 is not divisible by 14
- `i = 15`: 36 is not divisible by 15
- `i = 16`: 36 is not divisible by 16
- `i = 17`: 36 is not divisible by 17
- `i = 18`: 36 is divisible by 18, so `total = 74 + 18 + 36 // 18 = 74 + 18 + 2 = 94`
- `i = 19`: 36 is not divisible by 19
- `i = 20`: 36 is not divisible by 20
- `i = 21`: 36 is not divisible by 21

- `i = 25`: 36 is not divisible by 25
- `i = 26`: 36 is not divisible by 26
- `i = 27`: 36 is divisible by 27, so `total = 94 + 27 + 36 // 27 = 94 + 27 + 1 = 122`
- `i = 28`: 36 is not divisible by 28
- `i = 29`: 36 is not divisible by 29
- `i = 30`: 36 is not divisible by 30

- `i = 32`: 36 is not divisible by 32
- `i = 33`: 36 is not divisible by 33
- `i = 34`: 36 is not divisible by 34
- `i = 35`: 36 is not divisible by 35
- `i = 36`: 36 is divisible by 36, so `total = 122 + 36 + 36 // 36 = 122 + 36 + 1 = 159`
- `i = 37`: 36 is not divisible by 37

Therefore, `div_sum(36) = 159`.

Let's calculate `div_sum(57)`:
- `total = 1`, `i = 2`
- `i = 2`: 57 is not divisible by 2
- `i = 3`: 57 is divisible by 3, so `total = 1 + 3 + 57 // 3 = 1 + 3 + 19 = 23`
- `i = 4`: 57 is not divisible by 4
- `i = 5`: 57 is not divisible by 5
- `i = 6`: 57 is not divisible by 6
- `i = 7`: 57 is not divisible by 7
- `i = 8`: 57 is not divisible by 8
- `i = 9`: 57 is divisible by 9, so `total = 23 + 9 + 57 // 9 = 23 + 9 + 6 = 38`
- `i = 10`: 57 is not divisible by 10
- `i = 11`: 57 is not divisible by 11
- `i = 12`: 57 is not divisible by 12

- `i = 17`: 57 is not divisible by 17
- `i = 18`: 57 is not divisible by 18
- `i = 19`: 57 is not divisible by 19
- `i = 20`: 57 is not divisible by 20
- `i = 21`: 57 is not divisible by 21
- `i = 22`: 57 is not divisible by 22
- `i = 23`: 57 is not divisible by 23
- `i = 24`: 57 is not divisible by 24
- `i = 25`: 57 is not divisible by 25
- `i = 26`: 57 is not divisible by 26
- `i = 27`: 57 is not divisible by 27
- `i = 28`: 57 is not divisible by 28
- `i = 29`: 57 is not divisible by 29
- `i = 30`: 57 is not divisible by 30
- `i = 31`: 57 is not divisible by 31

Therefore, `div_sum(57) = 38`.

Now, let's check if `div_sum(36)` is equivalent to `div_sum(57)`:
- `div_sum(36) = 159`
- `div_sum(57) = 38`

Therefore, `are_equivalent(36, 57)` returns `False`.

### Execution
1. The input list is `[[9,8,1],[1,2]]`.
2. The function `Extract` will extract the first element of each sublist.
3. For the first sublist `[9,8,1]`, the first element is `9`.
