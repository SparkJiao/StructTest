0,"• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport. This phenomenon is of interest because it seems to occur in biological systems, where useful work is extracted from unbiased noisy fluctuations.

• Recently, there has been focus on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets. Chaotic systems are defined by their sensitivity to initial conditions. The behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is generally sensitive to the system's parameters. The phase-space structure of these systems can be complex, consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas or of simultaneously coexisting attractors. This structure can change significantly as parameters change.

• A few years ago, Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle. Mateos looked at an ensemble of particles and found that the velocity, averaged over time and the entire ensemble, could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between these two phenomena, suggesting that the reversal of current direction was correlated with a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics.

• However, a later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that this was not a valid rule, even in the specific system considered by Mateos. They proposed an alternative origin for current reversal, suggesting it was related to the different stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system.

• The paper by Barbi and Salerno, however, based its arguments about currents on the behavior of a single particle, implicitly assuming that the system is ergodic. This is not true in general for chaotic systems of the type being considered. In particular, there can be extreme dependence of the result on the statistics of the ensemble being considered.

• The paper reports studies on the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the same system as considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno. The studies consider the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.

2. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets, including planet-planet scattering and merger scenarios.
3. Interactions with stellar companions can also boost a planet's eccentricity, and the Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in a planet's eccentricity.
4. Of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity, six also have stellar-mass companions in wide binary orbits.
5. The Kozai mechanism has been suggested to explain the high eccentricity of certain planets, such as 16 Cyg Bb and HD 80606b.
6. Test particle simulations have been performed to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six planetary systems.
7. The simulations show that there are regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits, and protected resonances are present in some systems.
8. Combining these simulations with detection limits computed using new high-precision HET data and all available published data can help rule out additional short-period planets in the dynamically stable regions of certain systems.

* The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z-boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z-decay into fermion pairs with high precision. The agreement between LEP data and SM predictions has constrained new physics at the Z-pole.
* The physics of the Z-boson is expected to play a central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Z-factory is realized, which can generate Z events several orders of magnitude higher than that of LEP. This factory can be realized in the GigaZ option of the International Linear Collider (ILC).
* The rare Z-decays, such as flavor changing processes and decays into light Higgs bosons, have been studied in various new physics models. These decays can have significantly enhanced rates in new physics models, which can be tested in the GigaZ.
* The nmSSM and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model (nmSSM) are non-minimal supersymmetric models that can avoid the muon problem and alleviate the little hierarchy problem by having a light CP-odd Higgs boson with a singlet-dominant component. These models can also accommodate a light CP-odd Higgs boson, which can lead to new decay modes of the Z-boson.
* The properties of the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson, such as its mass and couplings, are limited by the relic density of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and the phenomenology of the nmSSM. The LSP in the nmSSM is a singlino-dominated neutralino, which is difficult to annihilate sufficiently to get the correct density in the current universe.
* The rare Z-decays into a pair of light CP-odd Higgs bosons, a pair of light scalar bosons, or a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons can proceed via the Feynman diagrams shown in Fig.1, Fig.2, and Fig.3, respectively. The intermediate state in these diagrams represents all possible CP-even Higgs bosons in the corresponding model, and the width effect is properly included in the propagator of the intermediate state.

3,"1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartners of the SM particles, with their masses expected to be below the TeV range. Mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology, and if SUSY breaking is mediated by gravity, the structure of SUSY breaking masses of scalars is determined by the Kähler potential.
2. The no-scale type Kähler potential is a highly predictive scenario in which all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes, leaving only gaugino masses as the source of SUSY breaking. This scenario is also interesting from the viewpoint of the SUSY flavor problem, as the separation of the hidden sector and the observable sector implies that couplings between the two sectors are flavor blind, suppressing contributions of SUSY particles to FCNC.
3. The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and the sequestered sector scenario in a five-dimensional setting with two branes. In the sequestered sector scenario, the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other, and the form of the Kähler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed given by eq. ([eq : noscalekahler]).
4. In the no-scale scenario, the degrees of freedom of SUSY particle mass spectrum are limited, as only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given. Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, with direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint (i.e., a charged particle cannot be the LSP if R-parity is conserved) considered to identify the allowed region in the parameter space. The constraints are more severe when universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, but are less severe when the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale or when non-universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale.",0

* Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but this strength is weakened by relative cross polarization prior to collision.
* A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) possesses a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity, which led to a literature devoted to the stability of horizons formed in CPW spacetimes.
* CH formed in CPW spacetimes was shown to be unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and any such perturbation applied to a CPW spacetime will turn the CH into an essential singularity.
* The electromagnetic (EM) field itself weakens the strength of a singularity in CPW, and collision of pure EM waves must have a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned.
* A solution describing the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves was given by Bell and Szekeres (BS), where the singularity (a CH) formed in the interaction region is removable by a coordinate transformation, but essential curvature singularities exist on the null boundaries.
* A cross polarized version of the BS (CPBS) solution was found, which has the nice feature that the Weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region, but it does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries.
* The paper chooses the CPBS solution as a test ground to justify the validity of a CH stability conjecture proposed by Helliwell and Konkowski (HK).
* The paper looks at the spacetimes of single plane waves with added colliding test fields and colliding plane waves having non-singular interaction regions with test field added.
* The terminology of singularities should be followed from the classification presented by Ellis and Schmidt, and the CH stability conjecture due to HK is defined.

5,"1. X-ray studies of ""normal"" galaxies have been extended to cosmologically interesting distances through deep field surveys, which have now reached 1 ms of exposure. These surveys have detected significant numbers of normal galaxies among the population of X-ray sources contributing to the diffuse X-ray background (XRB).
2. Normal galaxies are likely to be the most numerous extragalactic X-ray sources in the universe and are expected to dominate the number counts at 0.52 keV fluxes of ~10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2. They contribute as much as 50-100% of the XRB flux in the 0.52 keV band.
3. The study of normal galaxies in deep X-ray surveys can help constrain models of X-ray binary production in galaxies and investigate the typical galaxy's X-ray emission, whether it is dominated by X-ray binaries, hot interstellar gas, or a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN).
4. Statistical methods such as stacking can be used to estimate the emission at extremely faint flux levels for individual galaxies. This technique has been successfully implemented in previous studies to detect X-ray emission from the average bright galaxy in the Hubble Deep Field-North and a study of Lyman break galaxies.
5. This study extends the analysis to the entire plus flanking fields region, focusing on galaxies at z~1 due to extensive spectroscopic redshift coverage and superb imaging for galaxy morphology studies. The Chandra Deep Field-North data provide extremely deep X-ray coverage over this area, allowing for the detection of x-ray emission from normal galaxies and the placement of observational constraints on the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to K-band luminosity for normal spiral galaxies up to z~1.",0

- The concept of using an electron's spin to encode binary information was first proposed by an unidentified individual and later popularized by Feynman.
- Spintronic logic gates, which use spin to encode information, were first proposed in the mid-1990s and have the potential for lower power dissipation, reduced noise, and faster operation compared to traditional charge-based devices.
- In a spin-based NAND gate, the spin orientation of confined electrons in quantum dots is used to represent binary information, with the ground state of the array encoding the logic 1 state.
- The use of spin in classical irreversible logic gates results in a minimum amount of energy dissipation per bit flip, which can be significant for high-density quantum dot arrays.
- Reversible logic gates, which do not have the same energy dissipation constraints, have been proposed as a solution to the heat dissipation challenge.
- The use of spin to encode qubits in solids has gained popularity due to the longer coherence times of spin compared to charge coherence times.
- Optical readout of qubits in quantum dots has advantages over electrical readout, as it does not require contacts and can be performed using circularly polarized light.

8,"1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary that transfers mass to the white dwarf. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors has a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes. However, theoretical models have been unable to accurately reproduce the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
2. The minimum period of CVs occurs where the mass transfer time scale and the thermal time scale are about equal. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the rate of orbital angular momentum losses. The paper investigates ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population. The study considers a form of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) where the angular momentum is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary.
3. The orbital angular momentum loss rate of a CV can be written as the sum of the systemic angular momentum loss rate and an explicit function of the mass transfer rate. The paper considers the general case in which the CAML mechanism, along with nova mass ejections, causes a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the system. The angular momentum is assumed to be lost via mass loss that is axis-symmetrical with respect to an axis fixed at the white dwarf center but perpendicular to the orbital plane. The paper calculates the long-term evolution of CVs as they approach and evolve beyond the period minimum, and compares the observed short-period CV period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions.",0

- The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, suggesting that at least some of the solar system's SLRIs may have been injected by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
- The isotopic heterogeneity introduced by the SLRI injection could have been substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and small particles.
- The stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation, possibly due to UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula.
- MGU disks can accomplish early large-scale transport of refractory particles from the inner to the outer solar nebula, and are likely involved in FU Orionis outbursts experienced by young solar-type stars.
- MGU models can explain the high mass accretion rates needed to explain FU Orionis events and offer an alternative mechanism for gas giant planet formation.
- The numerical models used in the study were computed with a three-dimensional gravitational hydrodynamics code and show that MGU disk masses assumed in the models may be achieved in some fraction of protoplanetary disks, and perhaps in the solar nebula as well.

Broad emission lines, like Hβ, are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk acting as the fuel reservoir for the central supermassive black hole. The text highlights the concept of two Type 1 AGN populations, A and B, with different broad-line widths and profile shifts and asymmetries.

The text discusses the use of narrow emission lines, such as [OIII]5007, as a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame, except in the case of ""blue outliers"" found in sources with specific properties. The text also mentions the correlation between FWHM Hβ and FWHM FeII, and the effect of FeII emission on the Hβ emission line. Systematic line shifts, such as the blueshift of high ionization lines relative to low ionization lines, are known to place important constraints on models for the geometry and kinematics of the broad line region.
3. The text presents evidence for a systematic redshift of FeII relative to [OIII]5007 in a majority of Type 1 quasars, which has been ascribed to FeII emission arising in a region with dynamics dominated by infall and located at a larger radius than the region producing the bulk of Hβ. The text also discusses the potential importance of such a kinematic signature and the different interpretations that have been proposed.
4. The text presents the authors' skepticism towards the claims of a systematic FeII redshift and their analysis of a sample of quasars, which showed no evidence for a systematic shift of FeII lines relative to Hβ. The authors suggest that the accuracy of FeII shift measures depends on the FeII strength and profile widths, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and the presence of strong HeII 4686 emission. The authors also suggest that low spectral signal-to-noise ratio and above-average HeII strength are the culprits for the large FeII redshifts reported by other studies.",0

The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles has been successful in describing nature at the electroweak scale, and the recent discovery of a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) strengthens its correctness. However, there is still no explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM reported from the LHC. An anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) has been observed, with estimated discrepancies consistently more than expected, which could potentially hint at new physics beyond the SM.

The mass terms of the leptons in the Lagrangian are given by Yukawa couplings, with the neutrino mass determined by Yukawa couplings and Majorana masses. The neutrino mixing is obtained through mixing among the right-handed neutrinos. The seesaw mechanism provides the observed order one neutrino mixing if the Majorana masses are of the same order.
3. The interactions that break the lepton symmetry and the anomaly against the gauge interaction can wash out the baryon asymmetry in the early universe. A condition is calculated to prevent the washout, and it is found that if the baryon asymmetry is generated below the electroweak scale, the washout does not occur. If the baryon asymmetry is produced above the electroweak scale, the constraint on the parameters in the mass terms is calculated, and two possibilities are considered to prevent the washout.",0

23,"1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful flashes of gamma rays that lack a definitive explanation, but are believed to be associated with huge energy releases from the collapse of a very massive star or the coalescence of a compact binary system.
2. Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to be emitted during these events, with a duration of a few milliseconds and an amplitude that can be detected by present resonant detectors.
3. A program was launched to study the presence of correlations between GRB events detected with the BEPPOSAX satellite and the output signals from gravitational antennas NAUTILUS and EXPLORER.
4. An algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors is used to cope with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts and unmodelled noise.
5. The analysis resulted in new experimental upper limits for the burst intensity causing correlations of GWs with GRBs, with a 95% probability of excluding signals of amplitude 10^-22 Hz^(-1/2) for a time window of 100 ms.
6. The results are given in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound, which are considered the most complete and unbiased way of providing experimental information.",0

25,"1. Hadron production at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions is traditionally described in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.
2. The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically. However, this production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for particle production at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions.
3. A new hadronization process, recombination of partons, is shown to be more appropriate, especially when soft partons are involved. At extremely high transverse momentum, fragmentation is still dominant.
4. The goal is to have a universal description of hadronization based on the same scheme for any transverse momentum. To achieve this, the fragmentation process should be treated as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet.
5. The paper aims to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
6. The subject matter is primarily of interest in high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons.
7. The concept of shower partons is not new, but previous attempts to generate such partons in pQCD processes cannot be easily related to shower partons and their hadronization due to the limitation of pQCD.
8. The paper will discuss the similarities and differences in various approaches and demonstrate the importance of recombination of shower partons with thermal partons in heavy-ion collisions.",0

27,"1. The Dirac-Kähler formulation of fermionic field theory is a valuable tool in extracting the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories, but regularizing calculations requires the introduction of a discrete differential geometry scheme with the same properties as the continuum and a correct continuum limit. Several discrete schemes have been proposed, but defining such a scheme has proven challenging due to difficulties with the Hodge star and the wedge product between forms.
2. Adams proposed a local, discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space using two parallel lattices to maintain the locality of the Hodge star and a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product. This proposal has been thoroughly studied and can potentially offer insight into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice. In this paper, the authors show how this proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Kähler formulation and extend the idea to describe exact flavour projection.
3. In lattice quantum chromodynamics (Lattice QCD) calculations, the staggered fermion formulation is commonly used to describe fermions and address the problem of fermion doubling by reducing the number of degenerate fermions in the theory. The continuous Dirac-Kähler formulation is regarded as providing the continuum limit for the staggered fermion formulation, so a discrete Dirac-Kähler formulation with continuum properties can offer insight into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice.
4. The authors show how the two lattices of Adams' proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Kähler formulation and extend the idea to describe exact flavour projection. This necessitates the introduction of two new structures of lattice and a new operator. The authors also evaluate the path integral for this formulation, considering the effects of chiral and flavour projection.",0

Cognitive radio networks allow secondary users to transmit on the same frequency band as primary users, as long as the interference power at the primary receivers is kept below a certain limit. Information-theoretic security involves using the secrecy capacity to transmit messages while keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the transmitted information. The text also discusses the use of cooperative relaying and beamforming to improve the secrecy rates in cognitive radio networks.
2. The text also presents the collaborative relay beamforming problem in cognitive radio networks under secrecy constraints. The authors formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a quasiconvex optimization problem, which can be solved through convex semidefinite programming. They also propose two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes to reduce the computational complexity. The authors consider a cognitive relay channel with a source, a destination, an eavesdropper, and multiple relays, and assume that there is no direct link between the source and the destination, and that the relays work synchronously to perform beamforming. They derive the optimal beamforming solution that maximizes the secrecy rate in the cognitive relay channel using semidefinite programming with a two-dimensional search for both total and individual power constraints.",0
29,"1. The paper discusses the benefits of maintaining conformal invariance when quantizing the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFSs). It shows that a classical conformally invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFSs, and maintaining this symmetry during quantization allows for a free field in a CFS to behave like it does in flat space. This results in Wightman two-point functions that can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts.
2. The paper uses Dirac's six-cone formalism and realizes all CFSs as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. Auxiliary fields and the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme are used to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field. A well-suited coordinate system is also used to write down the two-point functions in a Minkowskian form.
3. The paper provides the Wightman two-point functions for Maxwell and auxiliary fields in CFSs. It also shows how to obtain the conformally invariant Maxwell field in a CFS from a six-dimensional one-form using the extended Weyl transformation. The dynamical equations for the Maxwell field are transported from Minkowski space to the CFS using the extended Weyl transformation.

The game has been shown to have deep connections to number theory, algebra, and combinatorics, and has the ability to simulate classical computer functions and solve theoretically solvable computational problems.
2. The game has been studied on the complete bipartite graph, with lemmas established to limit the number of chips on each vertex in a game with nontrivial period and to find a necessary and sufficient condition for a period to occur. Every possible period for the complete bipartite graph has been found.
3. The game can be used to simulate a pile of particles that falls whenever there are too many particles stacked at any point, a problem in statistical physics known as the deterministic fixed-energy sandpile. This is a subset of the more general study of spatially extended dynamical systems, which display the phenomenon of self-organized criticality and tend towards a critical state.
4. The study of the parallel chip-firing game has implications in various fields, including biology and social science. It is an example of a cellular automaton, and the study of such systems have been used to model real-life systems and display properties such as noise, fractal patterns, and power law distribution.

3. The theoretical analysis of the broadband emission of GRB 090510 within the synchrotron/self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) and traditional afterglow models has been applied to other distinct sources, suggesting that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be subdivided into various classes and sub-classes with specific progenitors.
4. The identification of different episodes in GRB 090510, such as a new structure in the thermal emission of the precursor (p-GRB) and the onset of the gev emission linked to BH formation, illustrates the formation process of a BH.
5. The discovery of a vast amount of baryon plasma, energetics of GRBs being of the order of 10^52 erg, and additional ultra-high energy cosmic rays with energy up to 10^20 eV originating from such extreme processes supports the possible relation of GRBs with the vacuum polarization process around a Kerr-Newman BH.

The authors use the example of predicting the W boson mass in the SM, which is strongly correlated with the experimentally measured value of the top quark mass and increases quadratically as the top quark mass is increased. This correlation is used to limit the allowed region for the Higgs boson mass.
2. The authors also discuss the possibility of a heavy Higgs boson that is consistent with precision electroweak data in the context of oblique corrections. They note that a large contribution to isospin violation from new physics can offset the contribution of a heavy Higgs boson to electroweak observables such as the W boson mass.
3. The text also discusses two examples where the new physics does not decouple from the SM at one loop. The first example is a model with a real scalar triplet, and the second example is a left-right symmetric model. The authors show that a correct renormalization scheme gives very different results from the SM result in these models.

A log-Riemann surface of finite type is a generalized branched covering of a punctured compact Riemann surface given by certain transcendental functions of infinite degree. It is shown in [xcite] that a log-Riemann surface of finite type is given by a pair (X0, f) where X0 is a compact Riemann surface and f is a meromorphic function on the punctured surface X16 with essential singularities at the punctures of a specific type.
2. An exp-algebraic curve is a compact Riemann surface together with equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions modulo germs of holomorphic functions, with poles of orders at points. The relevant spaces of functions and 1-forms with exponential singularities at the points can be defined, giving rise to a de Rham cohomology group. The integrals of the 1-forms considered along curves in the Riemann surface joining the infinite ramification points converge, giving rise to a pairing between the cohomology group and the space of 1-forms, which was shown to be nondegenerate in [xcite].
3. Exp-algebraic curves appear in the algebro-geometric integration of integrable systems, where certain functions with exponential singularities, namely the Baker-Akhiezer functions, are used. These functions satisfy certain properties related to their divisors of zeroes and poles and are shown to have dimension equal to the degree of the divisor for non-special divisors of degree at least a certain number. Functions and differentials with exponential singularities on compact Riemann surfaces have also been studied in the solution of the Weierstrass problem and in the context of entire functions with structural finiteness conditions.",0

The text discusses the use of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and local density approximation (LDA) to understand the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems and their electronic structure near a localization-delocalization transition. A method called LDA+DMFT has been developed, which merges the computationally tractable many-body technique of DMFT with realistic LDA-based electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated solids. This method has been applied to various systems, including transition metal oxides, and has shown promising results.
2. The text also discusses the need for fast scans of the entire parameter space to determine the interaction for a given doping, degeneracy, and bandwidth via the solution of the general multiorbital Anderson impurity model (AIM). However, present approaches based on non-crossing approximation (NCA) or iterative perturbation theory (IPT) are unable to provide the solution to this problem due to a limited number of regimes where these methods can be applied. The quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique in DMFT is accurate but has limitations in terms of its applicability to multiorbital situations and unphysically large temperatures.
3. The paper proposes an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation, which is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem, but rather a follow-up of the ideology of LDA theory where approximations were designed by analytical fits to QMC simulations for homogeneous electron gas. The authors suggest that even crude evaluations of the self-energy shapes on the imaginary axis may be sufficient for solving many realistic total energy problems. They also stress the need for a numerically stable algorithm that smoothly connects various regions of the parameter space.",0

5. The relationship between the Albanese metric, introduced in the Euclidean space and associated with the standard realization, and the central limit theorem for random walks on the crystal lattice is discussed.
6. The exclusion process on the crystal lattice is considered, with interactions depending on local structures. The problem of the hydrodynamic limit is to capture the collective behavior of particles via the scaling limit.
7. A crystal lattice is defined as an infinite graph with a free action of a free abelian group with a finite quotient graph. A scaling limit of a crystal lattice is constructed by taking a quotient of the lattice by a finite index subgroup of the free abelian group.

5. Dust in the ISM plays a key role in galaxy physics, contributing little to overall mass but significantly to the radiative output, mainly in the infrared (IR) regime.
6. Dust efficiently absorbs optical and UV emission and re-radiates it in the mid- and far-IR, depending on temperature and grain size.
7. Measuring the total IR light from dust provides insights into the current SFR, although for passive galaxies, IR emission can overestimate the SFR due to dust heating by older stellar populations.

• These devices typically consist of both organic and inorganic components, with the organic part being the active component and the inorganic part providing electrical contact to external circuitry.
• The interface electronic structure between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance, particularly in charge transfer and the energies at which the transfer occurs.
• Upon adsorption on a substrate, a molecule's electron addition and removal energies change due to image charge accumulation on the substrate, affecting the addition or removal energy of charge carriers from the molecule.
• A quasiparticle (qp) description is often used to calculate addition and removal energies, associating electron affinity and ionization potential with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a molecule, respectively.
• The adequacy of the qp description depends on the level of theory used to calculate energy levels, with density functional theory (DFT) being a common choice. However, DFT has limitations, especially for molecules, and hybrid functionals or self-interaction corrected functionals may be needed for accurate results.
• The energy levels alignment of a molecule in the proximity of a metal presents additional problems, as the formation of the image charge is a non-local phenomenon not easily captured by most functionals.
• Constrained density functional theory (CDFT) can be used to evaluate charge transfer energies of an organic molecule physisorbed on an inorganic substrate more efficiently than qp calculations.
• CDFT avoids qp spectrum calculation by replacing it with total energy calculations for different charge distributions, and it is computationally no more demanding than a standard DFT calculation.

The authors suggest that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy, under the assumption that classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively. This idea is studied in the framework of effective field theory.
3. The vacuum energy density can have various sources, including the zero point energy of each particle, the energy density from the Higgs potential after the breakdown of electroweak symmetry, and the energy density accompanied with the chiral symmetry breaking due to quark condensations. The vacuum energy density can also receive large radiative corrections, and the experimental value of the cosmological constant is much smaller than these theoretical values.

49,"1. * Spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkali metals have been aided by the high precision of experimental techniques and the straightforward interpretation of results due to their hydrogen-like structure.
2. * Recent precise measurements in higher excited states accessible through two-step transitions have renewed interest in improving calculations in other states where theoretical methods such as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) have yet to be tested.
3. * Standard spectroscopic techniques rely on a high population of atoms in the ground state, but this is no longer the case in two-step transitions, leading to low signal-to-noise ratios and potential non-availability of detectors at desired frequencies.
4. * The paper presents two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studying atomic properties of higher excited states, which uses two counter-propagating lasers through a thermal vapor, with one laser modulated, to monitor the absorption of the pump laser as a function of probe laser detuning.
5. * The technique overcomes the main experimental complications of low signal-to-noise ratios and non-availability of detectors by generating sub-Doppler peaks and sidebands corresponding to atomic resonances.
6. * The method has been demonstrated on two ladder systems in rubidium, with different applications of amplitude and frequency modulation, allowing for the locking of the probe laser to the excited atomic resonance without electronic modulation side effects.
7. * The theoretical model uses a density matrix formalism to describe a three-level atom in ladder configuration interacting with two lasers, one with sidebands, and is solved using a Floquet basis expansion of the density matrix.
8. * The three-level model reproduces the resonance features of absorption observed in the second excitation for both amplitude and frequency modulated pump systems.
9. * The paper concludes that two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy is a reliable and simple method for studies of atomic properties in excited states, with the characteristic sidebands providing an _in situ_ ruler for measurements of energy separations or to lock the frequency of a laser to an excited transition.",0
50,"1. * The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has been a topic of interest, particularly for the central exclusive production (CEP) process where protons remain intact and are separated from the central system by a large rapidity gap. Observation of any particle in the CEP channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers and allow for mass measurement regardless of decay products. Proposals exist to install forward proton detectors at 220 m and 420 m from the interaction points of ATLAS and/or CMS.
2. * The CEP process is proposed for the central exclusive production of the Standard Model (SM) and supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs bosons with a mass of 120 GeV. The dominant decay channel for this mass region is H -> bb, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches at the LHC due to the large QCD background. However, the CEP process suppresses the leading order background for this decay channel, making it observable in certain scenarios with appropriate proton tagging detectors.
3. * The proposed forward detectors aim to associate particular protons with the Higgs candidate event by measuring the outgoing proton time-of-flight (TOF) from the interaction vertex to the detectors. The difference in arrival times of the protons on opposite sides of the central detector allows for a vertex measurement, which can then be matched with the vertex of a candidate Higgs event reconstructed using the central detector alone.
4. * The acceptance of the forward detectors is critical for this analysis, as it is governed by the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam and the aperture of the LHC beam elements between the interaction point and the forward detectors. Previous estimates have assumed a closest distance of 3 mm for detectors at 420 m and 1.5 mm for detectors at 220 m. The acceptance for a 120 GeV Higgs boson is independent of the distance of approach of the detectors from the beam up to approximately 7 mm in the case where both protons are detected at 420 m. However, the acceptance is increased when either detector is moved closer to the beam for events with one proton tagged at 220 m and the other at 420 m.",0
51,"1. The zero-field Hall effect in chiral p-wave superconductors (SCs) has been studied extensively due to the broken time-reversal symmetry, which allows for a nonzero Hall conductivity. This can arise from the intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs and spontaneous surface current, as well as impurity effects or multiband SC structure.
2. In this work, the authors investigate another mechanism for the zero-field Hall effect in a chiral p-wave SC: vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition. In 2D superfluid or SC films, quantized vortices are topological defects in the condensates, and their dynamics are key to understanding phase transition phenomena.
3. The KT transition is a phase transition observed in superfluid helium films, where vortex-antivortex pair unbinding occurs across a transition temperature. This is described by a static theory that relates the phase transition to the vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process, with a logarithmic vortex-antivortex interaction that is screened by smaller pairs and renormalized for temperature.
4. The renormalization process in the static theory is truncated by vortex dynamics with a characteristic length, resulting in a broadening transition observed in superfluid helium films and charged fermi systems such as high-temperature SCs.
5. The authors explore the physical consequences of this KT transition in a broken time-reversal symmetry state, such as in superconducting Sr2RuO4 or helium-A phase thin films. They consider a 2D p-wave pairing state with a 2-vector, and derive the response functions for vortex-antivortex bound pair dynamics.
6. The frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor are investigated, and the authors discuss the contribution of free vortex motion and the resulting total conductivity tensor. The paper is organized into sections that describe the generalization of AHNS vortex dynamics in the chiral p-wave context, the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor, and a summary and remark. Additionally, an appendix provides analytic expressions for certain quantities in the opposite limit of the convective ratio.",0
52,"1. The measurement of rotation curves (RCs) of disk galaxies is a useful tool to study the nature of dark matter (DM), including its distribution and content relative to baryonic components. Dwarf galaxies are good candidates for this purpose as their kinematics are dominated by DM down to small galactocentric radii.
2. Recent studies have shown that DM halos around galaxies have shallow density profiles due to baryonic infall and stellar disk formation, which is different from the density profiles obtained from pure N-body DM simulations like the NFW profile.
3. The Orion dwarf galaxy is an important test case to check if DM density profiles from CDM numerical simulations are compatible with those detected in actual DM halos around galaxies.
4. Recent kinematic data suggest that a DM halo with a constant density core fits the velocity field of dwarf galaxies better than one that is centrally peaked. For example, DDO 47 shows a clear best fit if the DM halo is cored, and its small non-circular motions cannot account for the discrepancy between data and NFW predictions.
5. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a useful laboratory to determine the underlying gravitational potential of the galaxy as it has a simple stellar mass distribution, a well-behaved exponential stellar disk, and a large mass discrepancy at all radii.
6. The distance to the Orion dwarf galaxy is estimated to be 5.4±1.0 Mpc, but there is a significant source of uncertainty in this estimate. The stellar mass of the Orion dwarf is estimated to be (3.7±1.5)×10^7 M\_odot, and the gas mass is estimated to be (4.7±0.7)×10^7 M\_odot.
7. The Orion dwarf galaxy shows a well-ordered rotation disk, and the intensity-weighted mean velocity field exhibits symmetric structure in the outer disk. The rotation curve (RC) of the galaxy was derived by fitting a tilted ring model to the intensity-weighted mean velocity field.
8. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a decisive benchmark for the MOND formalism and a promising target for further detailed studies, particularly a direct measurement of the distance.",0

4. Shoucri and Darling, as well as Hernndes and Carb, revisited the question of the ion's existence through theoretical calculations, but no bound state was determined.
5. Ackermann et al. used the finite element method to study the existence of the trihydrogen dication, finding critical values of charges for stable or metastable equilateral triangular configurations.
6. The authors of the study excluded the possibility of a stable trihydrogen dication in the electronic ground state.
7. The study of the trihydrogen dication is being revisited to explore the possibility of its existence as a metastable state in a magnetic field.
8. The system being studied consists of one electron and three protons forming an equilateral triangle.
9. Two methods are used to explore the system: a specialized variational method with physically relevant trial functions and a standard variational method using standard Gaussian trial functions.
10. Both methods lead to highly accurate quantitative results for the total energy versus the size of the triangle.",0

55,"1. Transverse spin fluctuations are important low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, and play a crucial role in various macroscopic properties such as long-range order, order parameter magnitude, Néel temperature, and spin correlations.
2. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in two dimensions and the Néel temperature in three dimensions.
3. Recent interest has focused on spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in quantum antiferromagnets. In the random-t model, where the interaction is set to zero on a fraction of sites, the lattice-averaged AF order parameter is enhanced for small fractions due to suppressed quantum spin fluctuations.
4. A new method has been developed to evaluate transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state, using magnon mode energies and spectral functions from the random phase approximation (RPA).
5. This method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and has been demonstrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: the pure model, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-concentration impurities.
6. The RPA approach has been shown to interpolate between weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity and yield identical results as the spin-wave theory (SWT) approach in the strong coupling limit for the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
7. A renormalized RPA approach has been devised to obtain the magnetic phase diagram for the three-dimensional Hubbard model, and the behavior of the Néel temperature as a function of interaction strength and electron concentration interpolates between weak and strong coupling limits.

The dynamics of multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation, has been a focus of recent research. These models can lead to a variety of features unavailable in the case of a single field, such as the well-known hybrid inflation models.*
2. *The subsequent phase of energy transfer between the inflaton and other degrees of freedom leading to the standard picture of big bang cosmology has also been intensely studied. The inflaton may decay through perturbative processes as well as non-perturbative parametric amplification, which can lead to explosive particle production and efficient reheating of the universe. Hybrid inflation and reheating models share an important common thread: they both involve the coupling of two or more dynamical, interacting scalar fields.*
3. *Going beyond tree level in these models brings in the issue of renormalization. The problem of renormalization of time evolution equations in single field models was understood several years ago, but the renormalization of time evolution equations in multi-field models is more complex and has been the subject of recent research. The paper uses a closed time path formalism and dimensional regularization to formulate a finite theory and properly renormalize the system.*",0

3. Neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses, and their different flavor structure from quarks and leptons suggests Majorana-type masses.
4. The seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) are popular models for generating tiny neutrino masses, but they do not contain a DM candidate.

59,"1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided valuable information on subatomic physics, including the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the renormalizable theory of QED. A charged particle with spin has a magnetic moment, which is calculated using the gyromagnetic ratio and the anomaly. The Dirac equation predicts that for spin-1/2 point-like particles, the gyromagnetic ratio is 2 and the anomaly is zero. However, for baryons, the internal quark structure gives them large anomalies.
2. The electron anomaly is now measured to a precision of about four parts in a billion, while the muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million. The relative contributions of heavier particles to the muon anomaly scale as the mass of the particles to the fourth power, making the muon sensitive to higher mass scale radiative corrections. The standard model value of the muon anomaly has measurable contributions from QED loops containing leptons and photons, hadronic loops containing hadrons in vacuum polarization loops, and weak loops involving the W and Z weak gauge bosons.
3. The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomaly has been the topic of much theoretical investigation and is likely to provide the ultimate limit to the precision of the standard model value. Measurements of the muon anomaly have placed serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model. With the development of supersymmetric theories as a favored scheme of physics beyond the standard model, interest in the experimental and theoretical value of the muon anomaly has grown substantially.
4. The method used in the third CERN experiment and the BNL experiment to measure the muon anomaly involves the use of direct muon injection into the storage ring. A precision measurement of the muon spin precession frequency and the magnetic field is required to measure the muon anomaly accurately. The experimental signal is the time spectrum of positrons (electrons) from muon decay, which is modulated by the precession. The expected form for the positron time spectrum is an exponential from muon decay modulated by the precession.",0
60,"• A new design for an optomechanical system consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide is presented in a recent paper by Li et al.
• This design allows for the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling, which arises from the dependence of the resonator's extrinsic losses on mechanical motion and phase-dependent gradient forces.
• The design is also shown to be more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, which is desirable for studying quantum effects at the macroscopic scale.
• However, the paper also explores other possibilities for investigating the effects of strong reactive coupling that do not depend on cooling the system.
• The nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields is examined, and reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting is reported.
• This is in contrast to previous works that only used dispersive coupling to achieve normal mode splitting.
• The system is analyzed using the Hamiltonian in a rotating frame at the pump frequency, which includes the energy of the cavity field, the energy of the waveguide, interactions between the waveguide and incident fields, and the coupling of the cavity field to the pump and stokes fields.
• The time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators are given and solved, and the expectation value of the output fields is calculated to obtain the nonlinear susceptibilities for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes.
• Normal mode splitting in output fields with or without reactive coupling is discussed, and it is found that there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling, but it occurs in the presence of reactive coupling.",1
61,"1. * The text discusses the behavior of a quantum Ising chain in the presence of an external transverse field and a specific initial configuration. The initial configuration is chosen such that it results in inhomogeneity in the transverse magnetization, which in turn leads to transport of magnetization from one site to another. This results in spatial and temporal variations in the transverse magnetization.
2. * The text also discusses the analytical treatment of transverse magnetization and its dynamics. It is shown that the magnetization evolves in an oscillatory manner with the envelope decaying algebraically. However, the odd-occupation states have zero energy and their coefficients remain nonzero forever, which prevents the magnetization from becoming homogeneous. The frequency of oscillation and the final magnetization at each site show different behavior in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases.
3. * The text highlights the fact that the scenario may be thought of as a quench from an initial state and the preceding works on quench dynamics report the change of the exponent of decay in different phases. However, in this case, the presence of odd-occupation states becomes an important factor in the dynamics. The observations are valid for arbitrary phases of these quantities and arbitrary modulus of the coefficients.
4. * The text raises questions about the behavior of other observables in the system. It is noted that integrable systems have non-local observables that show typically different behaviors, including even thermalization in course of quench dynamics. The text suggests that investigating the behavior of non-local observables and non-integrable systems starting from such inhomogeneity may be interesting open questions to explore in the future.",0

2. * Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is known to be in the color superconducting phase. This phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the constraint of charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium can lead to a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks, which can eventually destroy the Cooper pairing.
3. * The chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase remains an unsolved puzzle, but it has been suggested that a LOFF state might be the true ground state. A charge neutral LOFF state cannot cure the instability of off-diagonal 4-7th gluons, but a gluon condensate state can.

63,"1. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is the most widely accepted theory for the melting phase transition of two-dimensional systems, which involves two separate, continuous transitions as a solid transforms into a liquid in quasi-equilibrium steps. The first stage involves the loss of translational (positional) order, while the second stage involves the decay of orientational order, mediated by the unbinding of dislocation pairs and dislocations into point defects. The strength of this theory is its compatibility with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids the existence of exact long-range positional order in 2d for a wide range of pair potentials at finite temperatures. However, the theory assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which contradicts observations of alignment and accumulation of dislocations into small angle domain walls.
2. Recent developments in the fabrication of 2d materials seek to clarify the details of the transition. The KTHNY theory has been examined for its validity in systems with different pair interactions, including hard-sphere (disk), Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, dipole-dipole, and Debye-Hückel (screened Coulomb or Yukawa) inter-particle interactions. These systems have become important due to advances in the field of colloid suspensions and dusty plasmas.
3. Experimental and simulation results have shown incongruities regarding the order of the phase transition in classical single-layer (2d) many-body systems.

Second-order (or single-step continuous) transitions have been found in dusty plasma experiments, hard-disk systems, electro-hydrodynamically excited colloidal suspensions, and Coulomb and Yukawa systems. KTHNY-like transitions have been reported in dusty plasma experiments and related numerical simulations, as well as in experiments and",0

2. Accurate planetary radii are crucial for understanding the distribution of planetary structures, including the relative occurrence rates of ""rocky"" and ""non-rocky"" planets and the relationship between radius, mass, and bulk density. However, only about half of the Kepler candidate stars have been observed due to their brightness distribution.
3. The presence of stellar companions can change observed transit depths and planetary radii, potentially introducing systematic uncertainties in occurrence rate distributions. Recent work suggests that a non-negligible fraction of Kepler host stars may be multiple stars, which could affect planetary radius estimates.
4. The transit depth is the observable quantity, and the true planetary radius depends on the brightness ratio of the transited star to the total brightness of the system and the stellar radius. If the planet orbits a companion star, the planet size is underestimated by the flux dilution factor and the ratio of the primary star radius to the radius of the companion star being transited.
5. The cumulative Kepler candidate list and stellar parameters table were used to assess possible bound stellar companions for each koi. Possible gravitationally bound companions are assumed to lie along the same isochrone as the primary star. The correction factor for planetary radii underestimation varies depending on the particular system and which star the planet may orbit.
6. The mean correction factor for any one multiplicity scenario must be calculated by taking into account the probability the star may be a multiple star, the distribution of mass ratios if the star is a multiple, the probability that the planet orbits any one star if the stellar system has multiple stars, and whether or not the star has been vetted for stellar companions. The mean correction factor depends on the stellar temperature of the host star, with lower temperature stars having a smaller range of possible stellar companions.",0

2. Mapping the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission and measuring their total gas mass, gas disk extent, and dynamics would provide a direct observational link between DLAs and local galaxies, but it's currently impossible with existing technology.
3. The identification of DLAs as absorbers in background quasar spectra is not distance-dependent, and the lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground due to the Earth's atmosphere's opacity to UV wavelengths.
4. Due to the expansion of the universe, the redshift number density of DLAs decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts, making it difficult to find DLAs whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present-day radio telescopes.
5. There are now over 100 DLA galaxies known at various redshifts, with properties ranging from inconspicuous low surface brightness dwarfs to giant spirals and even early-type galaxies.

7. High-resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope can be used to constrain the column density distribution function of HI.
8. The metallicity distribution for HI column densities peaks around [o/h]=-0.5 to -0.4, much lower than the mean value of a typical galaxy, suggesting that DLAs arise in the HI disks of galaxies.",0

- The majority of stars are formed in star clusters. During the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud into a star cluster, only a modest percentage of the gas is turned into stars. A star cluster will initially be made up of a combination of gas and stars.
- At the onset of stellar winds and supernovae explosions, enough energy is injected into the gas within the embedded cluster to remove the gas on timescales shorter than a crossing time. This results in a cluster devoid of gas, which is far out of equilibrium due to the rapid change in gravitational potential energy caused by the loss of a significant fraction of its mass.
- Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters. However, there is disagreement in the results, with some studies reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs.
- Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, with all clusters older than 110 Myr being well fit by Kroupa or Salpeter IMFs, while the youngest clusters showed a significant scatter. They suggest that this is due to the youngest (tens of Myr) clusters being out of equilibrium, hence undercutting the underlying assumption of virial equilibrium needed for such studies.
- The paper provides evidence that the young massive clusters M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1 are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss, thus calling into question claims of a varying stellar IMF.
- The authors suggest that the excess light at large radii seen in many massive young star clusters is a signature of violent relaxation after gas expulsion, indicating that these clusters have effective star formation efficiencies of around 25-35%, such that they show a significant effect but do not destroy themselves rapidly.
- Gas expulsion can also cause virial mass estimates to be significantly wrong for several 10s of Myr. These signatures are also seen in many other young star clusters and suggest that gas expulsion is an important phase in the evolution of young clusters that cannot be ignored.

70,"1. * Dyadic data, which involve two individuals in a relationship, are common in psychosocial and behavioral studies. These data often exhibit interdependence, where the attributes and behaviors of one individual affect the other.
2. * Analyzing longitudinal dyadic data can be complicated by two issues: within-dyad and within-subject correlations, and nonignorable dropouts. The latter can lead to biased estimates if not properly accounted for.
3. * There are two main classes of likelihood-based nonignorable models for handling missing data: selection models and pattern mixture models. These models can be used to account for the correlation within dyads and the nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal dyadic data.
4. * The interdependence structure within dyads brings new challenges to the missing data problem. For example, the outcome of one member often depends on his/her own covariates as well as the other member's outcome and covariates.
5. * The authors propose a fully Bayesian approach to deal with longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts based on a selection model. They model each subject's longitudinal measurement process using a transition model and account for the within-dyad correlation by introducing dyad-specific random effects. They also use a discrete time survival model to account for the nonignorable dropouts.",0
71,"1. Quantum fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that never vanishes, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources. This concept was used by H. B. G. Casimir in 1948 to predict that two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other due to a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation.
2. E. M. Lifshitz, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii, and L. P. Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics, deriving an analytical formula for the force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions. This theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force at very short distances and retardation effects at larger separations.
3. The force between two plates made out of the same material is always attractive, but for slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed. A torque develops between two parallel birefringent slabs placed in an isotropic medium, causing them to spontaneously rotate towards the configuration in which their principal axes are aligned.
4. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been verified in several high precision experiments, mainly focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum. However, less precise measurements in liquids have been reported, and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids has also been reported.
5. The torque between anisotropic materials predicted by Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash has received essentially no attention, with no experimental attempts to demonstrate the effect and no numerical calculations to estimate its magnitude. This paper calculates the magnitude of the torque induced by quantum fluctuations for specific materials and discusses possible experimental validations of the effect.",0

- Debris disk systems, such as the one surrounding HD32297, provide a glimpse into the intermediate stage of stellar system evolution, representing the transition between the early formation of stars and planets and the mature stage of an evolved system.
- The debris disk surrounding HD32297 has an edge-on orientation, making it an ideal target for gas phase absorption measurements. Observations of the D doublet toward HD32297 revealed two absorption components, one of which is likely caused by circumstellar material. The ism absorption is similar among HD32297 and its two closest neighbors, indicating absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the local bubble.
- Radial velocities of HD32297, BD+07 777s, and BD+07 778 differ significantly, indicating that they are likely not physically associated. Some indication of temporal variability is detected over several epochs of observations, but instrumental resolution variations and masking by the strong ism absorption make a definitive detection of circumstellar variability difficult.
- The measured circumstellar feature toward HD32297 is the strongest such absorption measured toward any nearby main sequence debris disk, 45 times greater than the column density of the prototypical edge-on debris disk, Beta Pictoris. If the morphology and abundances of the stable gas component around HD32297 are assumed to be similar to Beta Pictoris, the estimated upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding HD32297 is 40.3 Mearth.

77,"1. The text discusses a relativistic embedding scheme for solving the Dirac equation in a limited region of a larger system. The scheme involves replacing the surrounding region with an additional term in the Hamiltonian for the region of interest, which acts on the surface separating the two regions. The method is derived using a trial function with enforced continuity in the small component across the surface, and is shown to be stable and convergent for a confined hydrogen atom. The green function for the embedded Hamiltonian is also derived and illustrated in the continuum regime. Future applications are likely to be in the area of defects and surfaces of materials containing heavier elements, within the framework of density functional theory.
2. The embedding scheme allows for the use of a trial function that is discontinuous in the small component, which would normally be dismissed in quantum theory due to the resulting discontinuous probability density. However, the Dirac equation is first order, and a perfectly regular expectation value of the Hamiltonian can still result. When the embedding potential is evaluated at the same energy as the energy in the Dirac equation, the relationship between small and large components on either side of the surface coincide, and the solutions are continuous in both large and small components. When the energies do not coincide, the solutions will retain small components that are discontinuous across the surface, but can still provide estimates of the energies of the solutions of the Dirac equation.
3. The non-relativistic embedding scheme, which has been widely used in numerous applications, is mentioned as a comparison. The relativistic embedding scheme is shown to correctly reproduce relativistic effects on the electronic structure, as demonstrated by a comparison of the local density of states for an embedded Ag monolayer using embedding potentials corresponding to Au(001) with that found for an Au(001)/Ag/Au(001) sandwich geometry using relativistic scattering theory. The embedding potential is shown to impose the correct variational constraint upon wave functions for the embedded Ag monolayer, replicating the behavior of an extended Au(001)/Ag/Au(001) sandwich structure.",0

• Semiclassical methods have been successful in treating wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength. These methods provide approximate solutions in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system.
• The corresponding classical system for dielectric cavities is an open dielectric billiard, where rays travel freely and are partially reflected and refracted when impinging on the boundary.
• The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics.
• Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are being investigated for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.

80,"1. The merger of neutron stars and/or black holes are important sources of gravitational waves (GW) due to the large amount of energy released during the process. The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) can radiate about 10^6 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.4-1.6 kHz. The rate at which these mergers occur in the local universe is another crucial factor in determining their potential as GW sources.
2. A stochastic background of GW is produced by the superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts. Different astrophysical processes can generate this stochastic background, including distorted black holes, bar mode emission from young neutron stars, supernovae or hypernovas, and tri-axial rotating neutron stars, including magnetars. Populations of compact binaries, such as cataclysmic variables, can also contribute to the galactic background of GW in the mHz domain.
3. Using the DNS merging rate estimated in a precedent study, the authors have estimated the GW background spectrum produced by these coalescences. Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods were performed to determine the critical redshift beyond which the duty cycle condition required to have a continuous background is satisfied. The study focuses on the few thousand seconds before the last stable orbit is reached, when more than 96% of the GW energy is released.
4. The simulations were conducted using the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) history derived directly from observations and including the contribution of elliptical galaxies when estimating the mean merging rate in the local universe. The authors predict a detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo, respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations.
5. The study also discusses the detection possibility with laser beam interferometers and the signal frequency range, which is in the range 10-1500 Hz, covered by ground-based interferometers. The authors emphasize that the uncertainties in their simulations are formal and depend on the adopted evolutionary scenario for the progenitors.",0

3. Three approaches exist to account for backreaction: numerical simulations, fluid approach treating cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, and analytical methods.

* Over the past decade, several DE models have been proposed, such as quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic DE, new agegraphic DE, and Ricci DE.
* Alternatively, modifications of the gravitational sector itself can induce an effective DE, such as f(T) gravity, f(R) gravity, scalar-tensor gravity, vector-tensor gravity, and higher-dimensional gravity.
* A teleparallel gravity approach, based on the Weitzenböck connection instead of the Levi-Civita one, describes the gravitational field by the torsion instead of the curvature tensor.
* Teleparallel gravity is equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but has attractive features related to geometrical and physical aspects.
* Modifications of teleparallel gravity, such as f(T) gravity, can represent an alternative to inflationary models and effective DE models, with the advantage of having 2nd-order field equations.
* The paper explores the implications of f(T) gravity for big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and aims to constrain f(T) gravity by BBN observational data.
* BBN describes the sequence of nuclear reactions that yielded the synthesis of light elements and drove the observed universe. It provides stringent constraints on a given cosmological model.

Several protocols have been proposed for this network, including the traditional two-way relaying protocol, time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol, and multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocol. The TDBC protocol combines the relay-to-user phases into one broadcast phase, while the MABC protocol combines the user-to-relay phases into one multiple-access phase. The achievable rates of most existing protocols are limited by the instantaneous capacity of the weakest link associated with the relay.

The goal is to utilize all available degrees of freedom to maximize the sum rate, given a joint power budget for all nodes. The proposed protocol considers all possible transmission modes and allocates optimal powers to the nodes based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and the channel gains of the involved links. The advantages of buffering come at the expense of increased end-to-end delay, but the average delay can be bounded with some modifications.

3. However, if CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, low-redshift applications could be biased.
4. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB accurately provides the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.

2. The LC metric has two essential constants: one related to the topology of spacetime (deficit angle) and another, denoted by @xmath0, which presents the most serious obstacles to interpretation.
3. For small @xmath0, LC describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass, while for certain values of @xmath0, the spacetime is flat and admits an extra killing vector corresponding to plane symmetry.
4. The absence of circular test particle orbits for certain values of @xmath0 and the fact that most known material sources for LC require @xmath17, led to the interpretation that LC describes the field of a cylinder only if @xmath0 ranges within the (0,@xmath10) interval.
5. However, interior solutions matching to LC exist with @xmath16, and the absence of circular test particle orbits may be due to the fact that the centrifugal force required to balance the gravitational attraction implies velocities of the test particle larger than 1 (speed of light).
6. The kretschmann scalar decreases as @xmath0 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11, suggesting that the gravitational field becomes weaker, but this may not be a good measure of the strength of the gravitational field.
7. On the basis of these arguments and the study of a specific interior solution matched to LC, Bonnor proposes to interpret LC as the spacetime generated by a cylinder whose radius increases with @xmath0 and tends to infinity as @xmath0 approaches @xmath11.

For low-disordered m stacks and wavelengths several orders of magnitude greater than the grating period, the localization length depends linearly on the wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers. The localization length saturates for low wavelengths, and the saturation constant is proportional to the inverse of the reflection coefficient between alternating layers.</summary>
4. <summary>The study also found that the localization length is practically independent of the disorder at the first gap, indicating a very low tendency in this region. The localization length was characterized in terms of the reflection coefficient of alternating layers and the optical path across one grating period, and it was shown that the localization length is enhanced at the center of each allowed band. When left-handed metamaterials are introduced in the system, the localization length behavior presents some differences compared to traditional stacks",0

* The concordance cosmological model, which is consistent with various observational data, suggests that only 4% of the total mass-energy is ordinary matter (made up mostly of baryonic matter like stars, gas, galaxies, etc.).
* The remaining 96% is made up of 23% dark matter, which is non-baryonic and of unknown nature, and 73% dark energy, whose origin is also unknown.
* Dark matter is crucial for explaining the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters (derived from the motion of galaxies) and the luminous mass (which includes galaxies and hot intergalactic gas).
* Dark matter also plays a significant role in the formation of large structures by pulling in ordinary matter through gravitational collapse.
* Dark matter must have been non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation and is therefore referred to as cold dark matter (CDM).
* The particle associated with CDM is known as a WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle).
* There is no explanation for dark matter or dark energy in the standard model of particle physics, but extensions to the model provide promising candidates for dark matter particles.
* Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a recipe for modifying the laws of motion to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies without requiring dark matter.
* The success of MOND in fitting galaxy rotation curves has led to speculation that there may be a connection between dark matter and the cosmological constant.

2. From a biologist's perspective, the specific properties of a particular molecule are of interest, as genetic information is coded by specific sequences of nucleic acids that are translated into chains of amino acids. The energy and shape of a protein are determined by various interactions between its constituent amino acids.
3. Physicists, on the other hand, often sacrifice specificity in favor of studying simplified models of heteropolymers. There are several statistical descriptions of ensembles of molecules composed of a random linear sequence of elements with various interactions that determine their final shapes. These simple models of heteropolymers are also of interest as examples of disordered systems with connections to spin glasses.
4. The overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups are most likely controlled by the coulomb interactions that are the strongest and with the longest range. A typical model polyampholyte (PA) is a flexible chain in which each of the monomers has a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches.
5. The long range nature of the coulomb interactions, combined with the randomness of the charge sequence, produces effects quite distinct from systems with short range interactions. The behavior of PAs is different in different space dimensions, and there is a critical charge such that PAs with certain charges cannot form a compact state.
6. The text also discusses the instability of charged drops, which can occur when the electrostatic and surface energies are comparable. A drop can lower its energy by splitting into smaller droplets, and the optimal number of droplets is proportional to the typical persistence length of the polymer.
7. The text also mentions the use of complete enumeration studies to obtain detailed results regarding the energetics and spatial conformations of short PAs, which can provide information that cannot be measured by Monte Carlo studies.",0

The force density due to gravity and radiation pressure depends on the plasma density. The heat conduction term in the energy balance equation can be neglected in thermally stable regions, allowing for local determination of the temperature. The dependence of the force on the plasma density is included explicitly through the hydrogen density.
2. The thermal instability allows the gas to coexist at different phases, resulting in enormous temperature gradients and heat conduction. The heat conduction in the energy balance equation should be included in transition layers between stable phases. The thicknesses of these transition layers are usually smaller than the pressure scale height, allowing for the treatment of gas pressure as constant in these regions.
3. The vertical structure of the transition regions is determined by the energy balance equation with heat conduction. The thomson optical depth of such regions can be estimated using the thomson scattering cross section. The transition layer solution is not arbitrary under steady-state conditions, and a unique ionization parameter can be determined for the transition layer in question.
4. The temperature profiles and optical depths of the transition layers and possible intermediate stable layer depend on the shape of the ""s-curve"" and the force factors. The existence of an intermediate stable layer enhances the emission in the energy band of 0.5-1.5 keV. The equivalent widths of the emission lines are less than 1.0 eV, with the strongest lines being the hydrogen-like and helium-like lines of oxygen and iron.
5. The emission equivalent width is independent of the density of the medium and the incident flux, and is a unique function of the structure deduced in section [sec\_structure]. The recombination emission is not the only line formation process in the transition layers and the intermediate stable layer. The reflected flux in these lines may be significant due to very large cross sections in resonance line scattering. The resonance scattering optical depth for a line from ion X can be estimated using the column density of the ion and the temperature at which the ion abundance peaks.",0

The authors use the exact solution for the Green's function of the wormlike chain and find that the distribution function for intermediate chain lengths possesses a bimodal shape with maxima at a finite value of the transverse displacement. This is consistent with recent studies for the two-dimensional chain. However, the transverse one-dimensional distribution function of the 3d chain shows only a tiny peak at a certain value of the transverse displacement, which disappears for larger chain lengths. The authors also present results of analytical considerations for short and large polymers which are in complete agreement with classical works. The computation of the three-dimensional distribution function of a free polymer is in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.
2. The text also discusses the short chain expansion of the distribution function of the free Kratky-Porod chain, which was studied recently in [xcite]. The authors succeeded in computing the anisotropic moments for small chain persistence length within the short chain expansion, with the first-order correction coinciding with that obtained in [xcite] using the WKB method, and the second-order correction being new. The higher-order terms in the short chain expansion can be established in a straightforward way using the present method. The authors also discuss the end-to-end distribution function for large chain persistence length and present the results of computations for various chain lengths. The distribution function possesses the bimodal shape at intermediate chain lengths within a certain interval and becomes Gaussian for very short and very long chains. The authors interpret a tiny maximum at a certain value of the transverse displacement for the three-dimensional chain as a remnant of the Gaussian behavior of short chains.",0

* The family of iron pnictides is an important prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with various sub-families and a wide structural variety.

* XB158 exhibited strong intensity modulation on a 10017@xmath050 s (12.78 hr) period during the 2002 January XMM-Newton observation. Similar variation was found in folded lightcurves from 1991 June ROSAT and 2000 June XMM-Newton observations.
* The amplitude of modulation decreased with increasing source intensity. No such modulation was found in the 2001 June XMM-Newton observation, setting a 2@xmath3 upper limit of 10% modulation.
* The analysis of the unfolded 2000 June XMM-Newton lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, with no evidence for dips in the two previous orbital cycles.
* Three proprietary XMM-Newton observations in 2004 July 17-19 showed @xmath1100% dipping for one orbital cycle and zero evidence for dips in other cycles. This behavior is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon observed in accreting binaries.
* Superhumps were first identified in the superoutbursts of the SU UMa subclass of cataclysmic variables, manifesting as a periodic increase in the optical brightness on a period that is slightly longer than the orbital period.
* SU UMa stars are a subclass of dwarf novae with orbital periods @xmath72 hr, that exhibit occasional superoutbursts that last @xmath85 times as long as the normal outbursts.
* The superoutbursts are enhanced by a tidal instability that occurs when the outer disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the secondary, causing the disk to elongate and precess, and greatly enhancing the loss of angular momentum.
* The disk precession is prograde in the rest frame, and the secondary repeats its motion with respect to the disk on the beat period",1

The finite size scaling arguments are used to analyze the properties of the DOS when the size of the hamiltonian changes, and the resonance energy and lifetime are obtained using the scaling properties of the DOS. However, the feasibility of the method to calculate the resonance lifetime lays on the availability of a known value of the lifetime, making the whole method dependent on results not provided by itself.",1

However, the low magnetic ordering temperature is a drawback. A suitable candidate for higher temperature spin order is the b20 compound MnGe, which has a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K and a helical spin structure. A large topological Hall effect and small angle neutron scattering experiments suggest the existence of skyrmions in MnGe.

The structure and morphology of the films have been investigated using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements have been performed to determine the physical properties of the samples. The MnGe films have been found to consist of islands with a flat surface that enlarge during growth, and the b20 structure has been confirmed by XRD. The lattice parameter is 1% smaller than in bulk MnGe due to compressive strain imposed by the Si substrate.

107,"1. The core entropy of a polynomial is a concept introduced by W. Thurston that generalizes the entropy theory of real quadratic maps to complex polynomials. It is defined as the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its hubbard tree, which is a forward invariant, finite topological tree contained in the filled Julia set. The core entropy function can be extended to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers, which answers a question posed by W. Thurston. This function displays a rich fractal structure that reflects the underlying geometry of the Mandelbrot set.
2. The core entropy function can be defined purely combinatorially, but it is closely related to the geometry of the Mandelbrot set. It can be used to study the parameter space of polynomials, and its restriction to non-real veins of the Mandelbrot set is monotone. The entropy of a polynomial on its Julia set is constant and independent of the external angle, so it does not give information on the parameter. The value of the core entropy is equal, up to a constant factor, to the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for the polynomial, and for dendritic Julia sets, it is equal to the asymptotic stretch factor of the polynomial as a rational map.
3. The core entropy of a polynomial can be computed using Thurston's algorithm, which considers pairs of postcritical angles instead of the topology of the hubbard tree. This algorithm can be extended to an infinite version that works for any angle, and it can be used to prove that the entropy function is Hölder continuous at certain angles. The proof of this result involves developing general combinatorial tools to deal with growth rates of countable graphs and defining a labeled wedge object that is associated with an infinite graph.
4. The core entropy of polynomials has been studied by several people, and most of the theory is yet unpublished. The validity of Thurston's algorithm has been proven by Tan L., Gao Y., and W. Jung, and the continuity of the core entropy along principal veins in the Mandelbrot set is proven by the author of the document and W. Jung. The previous methods used for veins do not easily generalize, and after the document, alternative proofs of monotonicity and continuity of entropy for real maps are",0

However, each method has its limitations and is not conclusive.

* MFs obey non-Abelian statistics, which is important for realizing potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.
* The possibility of hosting MFs in exotic solid-state systems has focused on topological superconductors. Various realistic platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains, have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect.
* Experimentally observing the unique Majorana signatures is still a challenging task. MFs are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs). However, ZBPs can also appear due to other mechanisms, such as the zero-bias anomaly caused by the Kondo resonance and disorder or band bending in the semiconductor nanowire.
* To obtain definitive signatures of MFs, alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFs are necessary. Here, an alternative all-optical scheme to detect MFs is proposed.
* Quantum dots (QDs) and nanomechanical resonators (NRS) have been obtained with significant progress in modern nanoscience and nanotechnology. QDs, as simple stationary atoms with well-defined optical properties, lay the foundation for numerous possible applications. If QDs are coupled to NRS to form hybrid systems, the coherent optical properties will be enhanced remarkably, providing an alternative ultrasensitive detection means.
* The proposed optical measurement scheme aims to detect the existence of MFs in iron chains on the superconducting Pb surface via a coupled hybrid QD-NR system with an optical pump-probe scheme. The interaction between MFs in iron chains and the QD in the hybrid QD-NR system is mainly due to the dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted by several tens of nanometers, ensuring that the tunneling between the QD and MFs can be neglected safely.

118,"1. * The kaon system has provided the first evidence of time reversal symmetry violation, but no other signals have been found to date. Studying time reversal symmetry is important for understanding physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles. Various alternatives or extensions of the Standard Model, such as grand unified theories and supersymmetric theories, imply specific ways of time reversal symmetry violation.
2. * To compare hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom, effective hadronic nucleon-nucleon potentials or mesonic exchange potentials are introduced. These potentials have been useful in treating the nuclear structure part involved and extracting effective hadronic coupling constants. However, relating hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom is hampered by the absence of a complete solution of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at the energies considered. In the context of time reversal violation, concepts such as PCAC and current algebra have been utilized to improve the evaluation of hadronic structure effects.",0
119,"1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by the absence of hydrogen and strong silicon lines in their spectra at maximum brightness. They are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies due to their uniform light curves and high luminosity.
2. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia. In this model, a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion star, increasing its mass until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes.
3. The accreting WD model has made significant progress since the introduction of stellar wind from the WD. This model has been successful in sustaining stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
4. The accreting WD model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. These paths determine the type of companion stars that lead to SNe Ia.
5. The companion star of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) has not been confirmed by observations. However, a group has argued that they identified a G2IV star as the companion by measuring the velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the SNR.
6. A direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta has been proposed. Observations of a star called S-M star near SNR 1006 suggest that it is located behind the SN ejecta, as evidenced by the broad wings observed in both blue and red sides of the absorption lines.
7. The presence of broad wings in the blue side of absorption lines can be used to identify companion stars of SNe Ia. The corresponding transitions need to be from the ground state, which can be produced by Fe I in the ejecta. The amount of Fe I in the ejecta of Tycho's SNR has been estimated, and calculations suggest that it is possible to identify the feature of Fe I absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star.",0
120,"1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource that can be manipulated and characterized independently of its physical realization, and obeys a set of conservation laws. It is useful in making quantitative predictions and is regarded as a physical resource. The entropy of entanglement is a well-established measure of entanglement for pure bipartite systems, evaluated as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix. However, the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear for mixed quantum systems that interact with their environment.
2. A difficulty arises when quantifying entanglement for mixed quantum systems, as a given density operator may be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for the average entanglement. To circumvent this problem, various measures have been proposed, such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation, which satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure set out by Horodecki et al.
3. Nha and Carmichael recently introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based on quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics. This approach considers the way in which information about the system is read from the environment by making measurements, and follows the evolution of the system conditioned on the measurement record. The entanglement measure is then contextual, depending on the kind of measurements made.
4. The authors of this paper follow the lead of Nha and Carmichael to examine the entanglement dynamics of a cascaded qubit system coupled through the one-way exchange of photons. The system considered has been shown to produce unconditional entangled states as the steady-state solution to a master equation. The authors analyze the conditional evolution of the qubit system to illuminate the dynamical creation of entanglement in the general case and to explain the infinitely slow approach to steady-state in the special case. They demonstrate that in the special case, the conditional dynamics exhibit a distinct bimodality, where the approach to the bell state is only one of two possibilities for the asymptotic evolution.",0

2. * The dust in the torus absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the energy in the infrared. Type 1 AGN show more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity, consistent with the face-on view of the torus exposing the innermost hot dust to the observer.
3. * High-spatial resolution observations or using high luminosity objects can help resolve the host galaxy's contribution to the IR, making it possible to isolate the AGN emission.
4. * The paper aims to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars.
5. * The authors use host-galaxy subtraction for the radio galaxies and clumpy torus models for interpretation, showing the average SEDs of each of the subsamples representing obscured (Type 2) and unobscured (Type 1) AGN.",0

* Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has achieved advancements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, with practical implementation systems demonstrating unconditional security. However, the traditional security analysis of the equivalent entanglement-based (EB) scheme only includes the signal beam and not the local oscillator (LO), leaving security loopholes.
* The fluctuation of LO intensity in practical CVQKD implementation can compromise the secret keys severely if not properly monitored and scaled with the instantaneous LO intensity values. This fluctuation can be exploited by an eavesdropper (Eve) to intercept partial or full secret keys.
* The paper investigates the secret key rate for direct reconciliation and the effect of LO intensity attack by Eve on CVQKD. The secret key rate estimated by Bob with and without LO monitoring is given, and the difference between the pseudosecret key rate with Bob not monitoring LO and the truly secret one is still increasing with the channel transmission becoming smaller.
* The paper concludes that LO intensity fluctuation opens a loophole for Eve to attack the practical system, especially in the case of communication with low channel transmission or over long distance. Consequently, in the practical implementation of CVQKD, monitoring the LO fluctuation carefully and scaling the measurements with instantaneous intensity values of LO is necessary.

123,"1. The code in question is a tool for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models, with a focus on accuracy and flexibility in integration method and frequency range. It was inspired by @xcite's extensive review of adiabatic stellar oscillations and careful tests on polytropic models.
2. The equilibrium model is defined in terms of a set of dimensionless variables, as well as mass, radius, and other properties in dimensional units. The code provides relations between these variables and more ""physical"" variables such as the buoyancy frequency, Lamb frequency, acoustical cut-off frequency, adiabatic sound speed, pressure scale height, and gravitational acceleration.
3. The code solves the equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations on a given interval, with boundary conditions obtained from a series expansion or a vanishing Lagrangian pressure perturbation at the surface. It has options for a shooting method or a relaxation technique to find the eigenvalues, and can handle both radial and nonradial oscillations.
4. The code includes techniques for improving the precision of the computed frequencies, such as a variational principle and Richardson extrapolation. It also has options for redistributing the mesh in a way that takes into account the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions, and for computing rotational splittings and kernels for first-order rotational splitting. A version of the code has been established for computing first-order rotational splitting for a given rotation profile, and is being extended to cover second-order effects of rotation.",0
124,"1. Highly structured HI distribution, including cavities, shells, and supershells, is a common manifestation of gas-rich galaxies' activity.
2. Supershells, first discovered in the Milky Way, have been identified in several spiral galaxies and are interpreted as expanding due to their loop-like or circular appearance and velocity range or expansion evidence in position-velocity space.
3. The two main classes of explanations for supershells' kinetic energy source are internal (starbursts, stellar winds, and supernova explosions) and external (infalling massive gas clouds) to the parent galaxy.
4. The internal source model, such as the chimney model, suggests that starbursts drive stellar winds and supernova explosions, which produce disk-halo features and halo gas via underlying star formation processes.
5. The external source hypothesis proposes that infalling massive gas clouds on the galactic plane, due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies, resolve the energy problem since input energy depends on the mass and velocity of the infalling cloud.
6. Recent observations reveal galaxies with extremely large HI supershells but no evidence of interaction or nearby companions, suggesting a new explanation for HI supershells.
7. The proposed explanation is that radio jets plow through the interstellar medium, accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles, providing an internal energy source for the HI shells, explaining any spatial symmetries, and resolving the energy problem.
8. The jet-inflated HI bubbles model is supported by the presence of radio jets in several classes of disk galaxies, including Seyferts and normal spiral galaxies, and the discovery of radio bubbles and shells of synchrotron plasma within the lobes of a few radio galaxies.",0

2. * It has a young stellar population, with a lack of a conspicuous old population and a larger fraction of intermediate-age and young population than other dSphs.
3. * Star formation seems to have proceeded until almost the present time, without evidence of intense, distinct bursts of star formation.
4. * The analysis of the data using synthetic command lines (cmds) will give quantitative information about the strength of the star formation at different epochs.
5. * Further observations are needed to characterize the variable-star population in Leo I, and in particular, to search for rr Lyrae variable stars.

7. * It would be interesting to check for variations of the star formation across the galaxy and to determine whether the horizontal branch (HB) is also missing in the outer parts of Leo I.
8. * Answering these questions is important not only to understand the formation and evolution of Leo I but also in relation to general questions about the epoch of galaxy formation and the evolution of galaxies of different morphological types.
9. * The determination of the strength of the star formation in Leo I at different epochs is important to assess whether it is possible that during intervals of high star formation activity, Leo I would have been as bright as the faint blue galaxies observed at intermediate redshift.

2. The authors define the set of nonzero first integrals in a Sobolev space equipped with a norm coming from the Dirichlet form of the fractional Laplacian.
3. The main difficulty in the development is the roughness of general elements of the Sobolev space and the non-locality of the fractional Laplacian.

5. The paper proves that the domains of the fractional Laplacian and the perturbed operator coincide.
6. The authors use the bilinear form of the perturbed operator to estimate the principal eigenvalue.
7. The paper assumes sufficient differentiability of functions appearing in variational formulas and uses the Green function to handle cases where this assumption is not met.

127,"• Inferring macroscopic properties of physical systems from their microscopic description is an active area of research in various fields of physics.
• Phase transitions, often involving symmetry breaking, are characterized by drastic changes in macroscopic properties.
• The theory of phase transitions was formulated by Landau and later refined using the renormalization group. Order parameters are used to identify phases.
• In some systems, order parameters can only be defined in a complicated non-local way, such as in topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin Hall states, or quantum spin liquids.

2. QCMs can produce identical or non-identical copies, and their quality can be state-dependent or universal.
3. One application of QCMs is eavesdropping on quantum channels, where the goal is to copy part of the quantum state.
4. Partial QCMs can be used to clone one constituent of two-partite states, allowing for consideration of mixed states as well.
5. Mixed states can be purified into pure states, and cloning mixed states can be seen as partial cloning of the purification.

3. Some authors have proposed models with a large component of baryonic dark matter, including the possibility of cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds.
4. A major prediction of a model with dense gas clouds is gamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray interactions, potentially comparable to known sources in the galactic plane.
5. The quality of data on diffuse emission from the EGRET detector aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory allows for detailed consideration of this source of gamma-ray emission.
6. Previous investigations have neglected self-shielding and cascade phenomena, which can be important at high column densities and alter the emergent gamma-ray spectrum.
7. These effects could be relevant to the observed excess galactic flux above 1 GeV.
8. Massive aggregates of dense gas clouds could potentially account for many unidentified discrete sources detected by EGRET.
9. The gamma-ray spectra arising from cosmic-ray interactions with gas clouds have been calculated using a Monte Carlo event simulator, geant4.

These structures can be directly observed, allowing for the study of phase transitions and the tackling of long-standing problems in condensed matter physics.

131,"1. AQL X-1 is a soft X-ray transient (SXRT) that shows properties similar to persistent low mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star (LMXRBs) when in outburst. The large variations in accretion rate in SXRTs allow for the investigation of regimes for neutron stars that are inaccessible to persistent LMXRBs. The origin of the low luminosity X-ray emission detected in the quiescent state of several SXRTs is unclear, but it is suggested that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) may turn on during this time, providing a link between LMXRBs and recycled MSps.
2. The outbursts of AQL X-1 are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with the X-ray spectrum becoming softer as the luminosity decreases. During the decay phase, the spectrum changes from a soft blackbody to a power law with a harder photon index. The BEPPOSAX observations of the 1997 outburst allowed for the evolution of the outburst to be followed down to quiescence, revealing a sharp flux decay that is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts.
3. The steepening in the X-ray flux decrease of AQL X-1 has no clear parallel in low mass X-ray transients containing black hole candidates (BHCS), which display a larger luminosity range between outburst peak and quiescence. This difference is attributed to the different nature of the underlying object, with neutron stars possessing a surface and magnetosphere, while BHCS do not.
4. The discovery of a nearly coherent modulation at 450 Hz during a type I X-ray burst and a single QPO peak at two different flux levels suggests that accretion onto the neutron star surface may still be taking place in the quiescent state of AQL X-1. However, this is faced with difficulties as a low magnetic field would be required, which would make it unlikely for AQL X-1 and other LMXRBs with kHz QPOs to be the progenitors of recycled MSps. The marked steepening in the outburst decay and accompanying spectral hardening is suggestive of a transition to the propeller regime, where most of the",0

The extinction curve describes how extinction changes with wavelength and is necessary for dereddening magnitudes and colors of astronomical objects and understanding the physical properties of dust grains. Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (CCM) derived a mean extinction law that depends on one parameter, which they called @xmath0. They obtained a one-parameter family of curves that represents the UV to IR extinction law in terms of @xmath0, where @xmath0 characterizes the dust properties in the region that produces the extinction. Many authors have used this parameter to study extinction.
2. The interstellar dust grains span a wide range of sizes and reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam by absorption and scattering. The apparent magnitude of each star as a function of wavelength may be written as @xmath10, where @xmath12, @xmath13, and @xmath14 represent absolute magnitude, distance, and total extinction, respectively. The extinction as a function of @xmath15 may be obtained by comparing corresponding stars paired according to spectral properties. The comparison star should be of the same spectral classification as the reddened star, but with a negligible extinction. The magnitude difference obtained from equation ([mred]) and ([mcomp]) is therefore @xmath18, where @xmath19 is a constant term and may be eliminated by normalizing with respect to extinction difference in two standard wavelengths @xmath20 and @xmath21. The extinction curves are generally normalized with respect to the b and v passbands in the CCM system.",0

SWCNT networks can be viewed as a two-dimensional network of conducting one-dimensional rods with large dimension ratio. The nanotube-nanotube junction resistance is much larger than the nanotube resistance, leading to a system with randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport. The network resistance shows percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence.

• The frequency- and electric field-dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks have been investigated for individual SWCNT and some types of SWCNT networks. However, there is a lack of systematic variation of network densities and correlation study between the onset frequency and the length scale determined from nonlinear transport. The investigation of frequency and electric field dependent conductivity for systematic variation of network densities is important for understanding the electrical transport properties of SWCNT networks, which are required for applications such as high-speed transistors, transparent shielding materials, and interconnects in circuits.

• SWCNT networks on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate were prepared by the spraying method using arc-discharged nanotube powder from carbon solution inc. The network density was controlled by the solution concentration and spraying time. The nanotubes formed bundles with a size of 4-7 nm and length of 2-4 µm. The thicknesses of the films ranged from submonolayer to 200 nm, corresponding to room temperature sheet conductance ranging from ~10 to ~1000 S/square.

The conductivity data showed a behavior where the real parts of the conductance kept their dc value up to a characteristic frequency and started to increase at higher frequency. This behavior was observed for carbon nanotube networks above the percolation threshold and was described well by the extended pair approximation model. The onset frequency of the ac conductance increased as the dc conductance increased, following a linear relation over about 4 decades.",1

Grover's algorithm can search an unsorted database with N elements in sqrt(N) steps, providing a quadratic speedup compared to classical methods. It has been implemented in various physical systems, including superconducting qubits.
2. The proposed implementation of the three-qubit Grover's algorithm uses four-level superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) in a cavity-QED system. This approach takes advantage of the strong coupling limit in microwave cavity QED, which is more favorable than using atoms in cavity QED. The implementation of the three-qubit phase gate, a crucial component of Grover's algorithm, is simplified and reduces the number of required quantum gates.

The proposed scheme is robust against certain imperfections, such as variations in coupling constants between SQUIDs and the resonator, and does not require adjustment of squid level spacing during the implementation of Grover's search iteration. This helps suppress decoherence caused by level spacing adjustments. The authors also consider the effects of spontaneous decay and cavity decay during the implementation of the algorithm.

2. The excitation of core electrons by X-rays can lead to shake-up effects, which appear as plasmon replicas in the spectrum.
3. In a metal, the shake-up effects are due to the excitation of plasmons, collective excitations of conduction band electrons, which show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum.
4. The main peak in the XPS spectrum corresponds to the system left in quasi-equilibrium, while the second and third peaks correspond to states where one or two plasmons are excited.
5. In a metal, single-particle excitations can also occur, leading to a deformation and low-energy tail of both the main peak and the plasmon replicas.
6. In pristine graphene, the chemical potential is not inside an energy band or a band gap, but there is still a low-energy tailing in the XPS spectrum.
7. In doped graphene, the chemical potential is inside an energy band, leading to a tailing in the XPS spectrum. However, the 2D character of the system means that the collective excitations are 2D plasmons, which contribute to the tail and make quantitative interpretation of graphene core-hole spectra challenging.

3. * The text argues that mutation probabilities do not have to be symmetric and that not all interaction effects can be described by linear interaction functions.
4. * The authors derive the Fokker-Planck equation, which describes the dynamics of the number of individuals of genotype 1 in the limit of large population sizes.
5. * The Fokker-Planck approach is shown to be effective in an example where the difference between simulation data and theoretical solution became almost not detectable for population sizes larger than 1000.

2. The thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness, and the standard equation of motion for orientation-field models is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
3. The inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is challenging, and the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
4. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been enhanced in the last decade, but physical effects due to the diffuseness of the interface must be controlled to guarantee precise simulations.
5. The thin-interface limit is used to analyze the equations of the phase-field model under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale, yielding effective boundary conditions that contain all effects of the finite interface thickness.
6. The generalization of the thin-interface correction to a model with arbitrary diffusivities is not trivial, but the antitrapping current method has been developed for the one-sided model, making quantitative simulations of alloy solidification possible.
7. There is a second, independent thin-interface effect called the Kapitza resistance, which cannot be removed by an antitrapping current and can lead to discontinuities in the temperature profile.
8. The trapping effect and the Kapitza resistance are two independent thin-interface effects, and a general solution to eliminate both does not seem to exist.

The fundamental atmospheric and physical parameters of stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and age, are crucial for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group. Large spectroscopic surveys like SEGUE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO, and HERMES are used to study individual stars and infer the characteristics of different populations of stars in the Milky Way. Stellar parameters determined by spectroscopic methods are of key importance, as they are used to fit individual stars to theoretical isochrones or evolutionary tracks to determine the stellar mass, age, and distance. Spectroscopic parameters are also not sensitive to reddening, unlike photometric methods.
2. A common method for deriving the spectroscopic atmospheric parameters is to use the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). However, both observational and theoretical evidence suggests that systematic biases are present within such analyses due to the breakdown of the assumption of LTE. Recent studies have quantified the effects of non-LTE on the determination of surface gravity and metallicity, revealing substantial systematic biases in the estimates at low metallicity and/or surface gravity. Therefore, sophisticated methods that reconcile these effects are needed to derive accurate spectroscopic parameters.",0
144,"1. Weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure has been detected in samples of high-redshift quasars (QSOs), intermediate-redshift galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It manifests as angular correlations between these sources and foreground mass inhomogeneities or as a coherent shear effect in the case of galaxies.
2. A more direct way to detect weak lensing uses fluxes of standard candles. If observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen as brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess and fainter ones having mass deficits in their foregrounds.
3. The best example of a cosmological standard candle is Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which have been extensively observed to determine the global geometry of the universe. Nuisance effects like evolution, variations in individual SNe, and gray dust extinction have been studied and corrected for or shown to be small. Weak lensing has been addressed theoretically and found to be unimportant given current uncertainties.
4. The largest homogeneous compilation of SNe Ia contains 74 objects, and the authors use four different light curve fitting methods to estimate distances to SNe Ia. The final quoted distance is the median of the estimates of the four individual methods, and the uncertainty is the median of the error of the contributing methods.
5. The authors use APM galaxies as tracers of foreground mass density. They adjust the optimal lens redshift for each SN source by selecting the appropriate limiting apparent magnitude for APM galaxies on red plates. The median redshift of the 55 SNe Ia in their usable sample is 0.423. They find a relation between SN magnitudes and the number density of foreground galaxies, suggesting that brighter SNe Ia have an excess of galaxies in their foregrounds.",0

2. The low-temperature state is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened f-spins, transitioning to essentially incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering with increasing temperature.
3. Physical properties of HF metals are typically anomalous, with a strong non-monotonic temperature-dependence of resistivity and rich structure in optics from the microwave to the near-infrared range.
4. Theoretical treatments of HF metals center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.
5. The absence of exact results has led to the search for suitable approximation schemes, with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) being a formally exact approach in the large-dimensional limit.
6. DMFT maps lattice models onto an effective single-impurity model with a self-consistently determined host, but its applicability to real HF materials is not immediately clear and requires direct quantitative comparison of theory to experiment.
7. A variety of methods have been employed to solve the PAM, including numerical renormalization group (NRG), quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, perturbation theory, iterated perturbation theory, the lattice non-crossing approximation, the average-matrix approximation, large-N mean-field theory/slave bosons, the Gutzwiller variational approach, and the local moment approach (LMA).

The hairpin loop formation is also an essential step in protein folding and RNA structure formation. A cell's crowded environment and dynamic interactions with various subcellular structures can affect DNA loop formation, with fluctuating forces from the cell interior potentially playing a significant role.
2. Recent experiments and simulations have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation, revealing the impact of mechanical constraints, tension, and torsion on the process. Static and fluctuating tensions have been found to play ubiquitous roles in regulating DNA loop formation, but there is no unifying theoretical framework to explain these experimental findings. Theoretical studies have explored the effects of nonlinear elasticity, tension, and protein-induced kinks on DNA bending, as well as the impact of static tension on protein-mediated DNA loop formation.
3. The text describes a study using Brownian dynamics simulations of semiflexible polymers treated as extensible wormlike chains, combined with a one-dimensional theory of barrier crossing over the free energy of loop formation. The authors find that looping time increases steeply with applied tension and is reduced by dichotomically fluctuating tension, consistent with experiments. They also observe a resonant activation phenomenon, where the looping time is minimum at an optimal flipping time of the dichotomic force.
4. The study models polymers as semiflexible chains of beads with interaction potentials and uses the overdamped Langevin equation to describe the dynamics of the beads. The authors consider static and fluctuating tensions, focusing on the effects of tension on semiflexible polymer looping.

150,"1. Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of materials with non-trivial topological invariants and robust surface metallic states, which are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction. However, all known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements, which poses constraints on the search for topological materials. A proposed solution is to generate effective spin-orbit couplings from ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons. An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been proposed to generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI). However, achieving this proposed topological phase in real materials has not been successful, and the stability of TMIs against competing orders and quantum fluctuations is still an open question.
2. The stability of TMIs in extended Hubbard models is hampered by competing symmetry breakings such as charge density waves (CDWs). Couplings driving the topological Mott transitions are also relevant to formations of a CDW, which has not been satisfactorily discussed in previous studies. The emergence of the TMI in the honeycomb lattice requires the Coulomb repulsion between the next nearest neighbor sites, and the long-period CDW instability must be considered on equal footing, which is not captured in the small-unit-cell mean-field ansatz employed in previous studies. Examining charge fluctuations with finite momentum over entire Brillouin zones is an alternative way to clarify the competitions among TMIs and CDWs, as studied by employing functional renormalization group methods.
3. In this study, the authors examine the competitions among TMIs and other symmetry breakings by first studying the long-period CDW at the level of mean-field approximation, which turns out to be much more stable compared to that of short period. The TMI on the honeycomb lattice studied in the literature is consequently taken over by the CDW. However, the authors found a prescription to stabilize the TMIs on the honeycomb lattice: by reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones, the TMI tends to be stabilized. The authors examine the realization of the TMIs in the extended Hubbard",0

These include the possibility that they have evolved into the radiative phase and have cool, X-ray dim shells, or that thermal conduction, entropy mixing, or cloudlet evaporation has enhanced the central densities. Ejecta enrichment or dust destruction could also increase the metallicities in the centers, enhancing the X-ray emission.

• Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with the ratio of total to selective extinction being a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.
• Studies have found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and the slope, and have devised a one-parameter family of empirical fitting functions to characterize the observed range of extinction law shapes.
• The slope of the extinction/reddening law varies in different interstellar dust clouds and appears to be generally correlated with environment.

Heavy fermion systems are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, with the Kondo scale marking the screening of local magnetic moments through a many-body effect that entangles the spins of conduction electrons and local moments. Below the coherence temperature, which tracks the Kondo scale, a paramagnetic heavy fermion liquid emerges, characterized by a large fermi surface with Luttinger volume including both magnetic moments and conduction electrons. The coherence temperature is small, indicating a large effective mass. Kondo screening competes with the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which indirectly couples local moments via the magnetic polarization of conduction electrons. The competition between Kondo screening, favoring paramagnetic ground states, and the RKKY interaction, favoring magnetically ordered states, is at the heart of quantum phase transitions.
2. The quantum phase transition in heavy fermion systems has been described by two radically different scenarios. In the standard Hertz-Millis picture, the quasi-particles of the heavy fermion liquid remain intact across the transition and undergo a spin-density wave transition. However, alternative scenarios suggest that the quantum critical point is linked to the very breakdown of the quasi-particle of the heavy fermion state, with a topological reorganization of the fermi surface across the transition. Recent experiments show that a change in fermi surface topology can occur not only at the magnetic order-disorder quantum critical point but also on either side of it via application of positive or negative chemical pressure.

Star formation is restricted to cold dense gas and is strongly correlated with the molecular gas content. However, the presence of molecules does not necessarily cause star formation; instead, they mark the regions that are cold and dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse. Understanding the links between star formation, ISM, and galaxy evolution is crucial, and identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas is able to develop is essential.
2. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores that develop in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Tracking molecular chemistry is crucial to accurately represent small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations of star-forming clouds. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensity far below its mean. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, called photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively both numerically and theoretically. The outer, unshielded layers of a PDR are composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon, while the inner layers contain molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The chemistry and thermodynamics of a non-dynamic, one-dimensional PDR are of limited utility in understanding the ISM, which is a dynamic environment where a variety of non-linear, coupled processes determine the global distribution and state of gas.",0

- A recent discovery of an overdensity of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been interpreted as an intervening population of stars representing a dwarf galaxy or tidal debris sheared from a small Milky Way satellite. This overdensity, labeled the VRC (Vertical Extension of the Red Clump), has been found to have about 5% of the angular surface density of the LMC itself. If true, this conclusion would have profound consequences for the interpretation of galactic microlensing studies, as such debris could be responsible for a sizable fraction of the microlensing signal toward the LMC.
- The macho team has challenged this explanation, finding no evidence for a foreground population at a certain distance in their extensive photometric database. They also find an overdensity of stars in a composite color-magnitude diagram, but conclude that the redder color of this feature is incompatible with the hypothesis of a foreground clump population. Gould (1997) argues that any luminous foreground population would not extend more than a certain distance from the LMC center, would be smooth on certain scales, would have a stellar mass-to-light ratio 10 times that of known populations, or would provide only a small fraction of the microlensing optical depth. Johnston (1998) has analyzed the Zhao (1998) proposition, concluding that an ad hoc tidal streamer to explain the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC would cause unobserved overdensities of 10-100% in star counts elsewhere in the Magellanic plane or would require disruption precisely aligned with the LMC within the last certain number of years.",0

The text discusses the use of data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the dependence of star formation on cluster mass and location within a cluster in 69 local galaxy clusters. Cluster membership is determined from SDSS DR7 spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies brighter than m\_r=17.77, and star formation rates are determined with 22 µm photometry from WISE using the relations outlined in Dale et al. (2012). The study finds that both the fraction of demi-LIRGs and the mean specific SFR of cluster galaxies increases with projected distance from the cluster center, but the fraction of demi-LIRGs remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.
2. The study also investigates the impact of cluster mass on star formation by presenting the total cluster SFR normalized by M200 as a function of M200. The study finds no evidence of a correlation between the cluster specific SFR and cluster mass in this first uniform dataset to detect obscured star formation out to several times the virial radius in a large sample of low redshift clusters. This result indicates that cluster mechanisms which scale with cluster mass, such as ram pressure or harassment, are not likely to play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in local clusters.
3. The study suggests strangulation as a plausible candidate for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies. Simulations from Peng & Lilly (2012) have shown that strangulation can occur in low mass groups, where the ICM-galaxy halo interaction is weak relative to clusters. Strangulation has been suggested by several cluster studies as an important cluster mechanism, including by Boselli et al. (2008) who discovered ""mild gradients"" in the morphological fractions of galaxies in CL0024+16 out to large cluster radii, which were best explained by a slow-working gentle mechanism such as strangulation.

The study's results suggest that the dominant process for regulating star formation in dense environments does not depend upon cluster mass, and hence must be efficient in small groups or filaments.

The Bishop-Phelps theorem states that every bounded linear functional on a Banach space can be approximated by norm attaining functionals, but this result does not hold for bounded linear operators in general. The Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás theorem is a numerical version of this theorem. A pair of Banach spaces is said to satisfy the Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property (BPBp) if given a Banach space and a bounded linear operator, there exists a norm attaining operator close to it. Many classical Banach spaces satisfy the BPBp.

The importance of multi-nucleon events has been suggested in many calculations of charge-changing quasielastic cross sections. The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data. A growing interest has arisen in including 2p-2h models into the Monte Carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations. The only 2p-2h model implemented up to date in some of the Monte Carlo neutrino event generators corresponds to the so-called IFIC Valencia model, which has been incorporated in GENIE. There are also plans to incorporate the Lyon model in GENIE, while phenomenological approaches like the Effective Transverse Enhancement Model are implemented in NuWro generator. One of the main problems to implementing the 2p-2h models is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over the final 2p-2h states.
2. In this work, the authors present a fast and very efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the Relativistic Fermi Gas Model (RFG) using the Frozen Nucleon Approximation. This approach reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 (full calculation) to 1. The frozen nucleon approximation was found to work properly in computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators. The authors investigate the validity of the frozen approximation beyond the phase-space study by including the Electroweak Meson-Exchange Current (MEC) model. They find that the presence of virtual delta excitations requires one to introduce a 'frozen' propagator, designed by a convenient average over the Fermi sea. The main advantage of the frozen approximation consists in reducing the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 (full calculation) to 1. It is well-suited to computing the 2p-",0

The reverberation mapping technique is used to estimate the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by measuring the time lag between variations in the continuum emission and the broad emission lines. This time lag is interpreted as the light travel time across the broad line region (BLR). The size of the BLR can then be used, along with the velocity dispersion of the broad emission lines, to estimate the mass of the SMBH.
2. The reverberation mapping technique has been used to estimate the SMBH masses in a limited number of AGNs, as the technique is observationally taxing and demands a large amount of telescope time. However, a correlation has been found between the BLR size and the optical continuum luminosity, which can be used to estimate SMBH masses from single-epoch spectra and calibrate other surrogate relations used for black hole mass estimates. This correlation is useful for low luminosity AGNs, as the time lag between the variations of the broad line and the continuum is expected to be of the order of hours to days, compared to several months for high luminosity sources. Monitoring programs of short durations, but fast sampling, are required to estimate the reverberation time lags for low luminosity sources.",0
172,"1. Broad emission iron lines are common features in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating near the black hole due to radiation reflection on the accretion disc. The black hole's spin significantly influences the line shape, determining the position of the marginally stable orbit that confines the inner edge of the accretion disc.
2. The Laor model, which assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used to describe relativistic disc spectral lines. However, recent studies have allowed the dimensionless angular momentum parameter to be fitted, enabling more accurate spin estimation. Other numerical codes have been developed with similar functionality.
3. The Laor model can still be used to evaluate spin by identifying the inner edge of the disc with the marginally stable orbit, estimating spin from the lower boundary of the broad line. Comparisons of the Laor and other models show similar results when applied to the XMM-Newton satellite data and artificial data generated for the upcoming X-ray mission.
4. The authors compared the Laor and * models using the XMM-Newton satellite data for two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit skewed iron lines. The * model provided a smoother adjustment between different points in the parameter space, allowing for more reliable constraints on the spin.
5. The Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line. Discrepancies between the models are more visible, especially for lower spin values. Proper data re-binning is crucial for obtaining statistically relevant results.

The breakdown of an external symmetry is not dangerous for the consistency of the theory, and can provide physical explanations for phenomena such as alpha decay or the solution to the U(1) problem in QCD. However, the breakdown of an internal symmetry (gauge symmetry) leads to inconsistencies in the quantum theory, such as the loss of renormalizability and unitarity.

In optical lattices, this parameter can be easily controlled and varied, enabling detailed studies of the quantum phase transition. Absorption pictures of the system can provide information about the momentum distribution of the state, and were used to experimentally confirm the Mott transition in an optical lattice.

A symmetric second-order tensor field is also defined that serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.
* The model reveals quarks and gluons that oscillate with a universal frequency inside a closed universe, while photons freely travel through flat space-time. The model was further simplified to compare its properties with measured cross sections and branching ratios, resulting in the full AdS spectrum being coupled to the channels of two or more hadronic decay products for which scattering amplitudes can be measured. The AdS spectrum reveals itself through the structures observed in hadronic mass distributions.
* An apparent interference effect was observed around the @xmath25 threshold in the invariant-mass distribution of @xmath26 events, which could be due to interference between the typical oscillation frequency of 190 mev of the @xmath27 pair and that of the gluon cloud. This effect might be explained by @xmath30 exchange between the quarks, which interferes with the natural quark oscillations. The @xmath30 could be a light scalar glueball, albeit much lighter than found in previous refs. It may decay into photons via virtual quark loops, and through photons into @xmath0 pairs, but the probability for such reactions to occur is extremely remote.

• Stochastic resonance is the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by the addition of noise. This is because the optimal level of noise can enhance the detectability of the signal, while too little or too much noise can deteriorate the signal.
• The paper discusses the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model with a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal, where a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process is added and the perturbed signal is observed in continuous time. Two schemes of observations are proposed: observing the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold, and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.
• The paper proposes two different estimators for the schemes and studies their asymptotic properties. It is shown that the estimators proposed are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators.
• The paper also discusses the problem of testing the simple hypothesis against the simple alternative by applying the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion. It is shown that the overall probability of error is nonmonotonic dependent on the noise level, and there exists a non-trivial local minimum of this probability, which is again the effect of stochastic resonance.
• The paper establishes asymptotic properties of estimators given by the generalized method of moments for two models, and gives an example of stochastic resonance based on a process where the phenomenon appears pronounced.

This symmetry has been confirmed through try-crystal phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements.

• The fourfold oscillation in the thermal conductivity when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO planes can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles. However, deviations from the expected angular pattern have been attributed to the effect of pinning of vortices.

• The variation of the thermal conductivity as a function of angle between the heat current and the magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO planes depends mainly on the heat transport by quasiparticles, their interaction with the supercurrents (vortices), and the symmetry of the order parameter. The nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity at low temperatures, where the quasiparticle momentum is close to the nodal directions of the gap.

• The effect of the pinning of vortices plays an important role in determining the correct angle pattern in this kind of measurement. A field-cooled procedure has to be used to rule out the influence of this effect in the measurements. The angular patterns of the longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures for the twinned and untwinned crystals show a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity as the field is rotated from one direction to another.

However, they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be solved by adding a universal scalar mass.
* Hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMSB) is a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB, with SUSY breaking localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region. The warping suppresses tree-level gravity mediation and allows anomaly mediation to become the dominant source of SUSY breaking in the visible sector.
* The bino mass in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation, and can lead to a small or large perturbation to the spectrum of anomaly mediation depending on its size.
* The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a wide range of relative contributions.
* The hcamsb ssb contribution is parametrized using a dimensionless quantity that governs the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms relative to the AMSB contribution.
* The hcamsb model assumes electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively by the large top-quark yukawa coupling, and the scalar potential minimization conditions are used to determine the magnitude of the SUSY breaking terms.

The DT leads to transformations of the potentials and wavefunctions, resulting in a chain of integrable potentials.
3. The text also discusses the use of ZRPs in the multi-center problem. The wavefunction can be expressed in terms of the outgoing-wave Green function, and the partial waves can be expressed as a superposition of Green functions. The scattering amplitude for potential and ZRP can be derived by imposing boundary conditions. The tangents can be found from the compatibility condition of the system. The Green function can be written as a single-center expansion over spherical harmonics, and the integral cross section can be derived using the optical theorem. The text also discusses the multi-center scattering within the framework of the ZRP model and the use of structures to study slow electron scattering by polyatomic molecules.",0

The convection-diffusion model is a semi-linear parabolic partial differential equation used to describe various phenomena in science and engineering, such as fluid motion, heat transfer, and pollutant transport. The equation is typically solved numerically using techniques like finite element method, lattice boltzmann method, and finite difference schemes. Researchers have developed various high-order compact schemes to improve the accuracy and stability of the solutions.
2. The document discusses several high-order compact schemes for solving the convection-diffusion equation, including a nine-point scheme proposed by Noye and Tan, a fourth-order compact scheme by Dehghan and Mohebbi, and a family of unconditionally stable schemes presented in [xcite]. The schemes differ in their accuracy and stability properties, and some are specifically designed for time-dependent problems.
3. The paper also discusses the differential quadrature method (DQM) for solving the convection-diffusion equation. The DQM is an approximation method that transforms the partial differential equation into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by approximating the derivatives using weighted sums of functional values at certain nodes. The paper presents a modified trigonometric cubic-b spline DQM (MTB-DQM) and compares its performance with other methods for solving the convection-diffusion equation. The MTB-DQM is found to be accurate and efficient for solving the convection-diffusion equation with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.",0

The use of bolometer arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths has led to the discovery of dusty objects at extreme redshifts, which are not detectable in surveys at shorter and longer wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavorable @xmath11 corrections. These ""scuba galaxies"" have significantly changed the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
2. Radio imaging of submillimeter survey fields has allowed for the detection and study of a diverse population of bright submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), including quasar-like galaxies, morphologically complex galaxies, extremely red galaxies, and galaxies with obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds. However, spectroscopic redshifts have been difficult to determine, and selection biases may have skewed the understanding of SMGs. A robust sample of bright SMGs has been selected using SCUBA and MAMBO in the Lockman Hole region, with the goal of determining the true fraction of radio drop-outs and obtaining practical information such as the intrinsic positional uncertainty for SMGs in the absence of radio/IR counterparts.",0

These differences are likely due to small sample sizes, small survey areas, and systematic errors, as well as uncertainties in the local LF.",0
192,"1. Rapidity gaps, regions without hadronic activity in collisions, have been observed at HERA and the Tevatron, attributed to color singlet quanta exchange between partons. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events exhibit rapidity gaps between jets, indicating color singlet exchange effects relevant at high momentum transfers.
2. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent, based on a fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without underlying events, filled by soft interactions between other partons.
3. The two-gluon exchange model, with the two-gluon exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part, is used to calculate the color singlet fraction. The color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons.
4. Measurements by CDF and D0 collaborations show no decrease in the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum or pseudorapidity separation, contrary to the two-gluon exchange model's expectations.
5. The unitarized RPWE framework demonstrates that the dependence on regularization parameters is strong enough to encompass both scenarios, with predictions for the jet transverse energy or pseudorapidity dependence of the gap fraction being similar for CDF and D0 cuts.
6. The unitarized gluon exchange model, an extension of the two-gluon exchange model, can describe the trend of color singlet fractions growing with jet transverse momentum, as seen in D0 data.
7. The variation of RPWE predictions with model parameters highlights the limitations of a perturbative approach to the color singlet exchange probability, but the unitarized two-gluon exchange model can fit present Tevatron data by taking the phase and survival probability as free parameters.",0

2. The system is one of the most X-ray luminous LMXBs known, but its X-ray flux is low due to its extra-galactic nature.
3. The system parameters of LMCX-2 are not well constrained, with estimates for the orbital period ranging from 6.4 hours to 12 days.
4. A new technique using phase-resolved spectroscopy has been applied to LMCX-2, revealing the presence of narrow emission lines in the Bowen region.
5. These narrow emission lines are identified as coming from the irradiated side of the companion star, providing the first constraints on the system parameters of LMCX-2.
6. The radial velocity curve of the HeII emission line shows a periodic variability that has been interpreted as the orbital period.
7. The doppler maps of the HeII emission suggest that the emission is dominated by a bright spot due to the warped accretion disk, making it difficult to determine the orbital phasing of the primary.

195,"1. The axial anomaly, a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, has been analyzed using the renormalization procedure and the path integral formalism. An alternative approach by Dolgov and Zakharov interprets the anomaly as an infrared phenomenon, originating from a singularity in the chiral limit of the triangular diagram's absorbitive part. This infrared interpretation complements the more familiar ultraviolet interpretation from the renormalization procedure.
2. The Dolgov and Zakharov approach has been related to some effects in the dynamics of physical reactions, such as the radiative decays of particles. The axial anomaly can be connected to polarized radiative decays, and its role in the interpretation of spin-dependent parton distribution has been discussed. The cancellation of mass singularities and the application of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem have been studied in the context of these decays.
3. The paper also discusses the behavior of the inner bremsstrahlung contribution to the pion decay rate in the collinear and infrared limits, considering both unpolarized decay rates and the cases of right-handed and left-handed outgoing leptons. The mass singularities cancellation mechanism is found to occur differently according to the polarization of the outgoing lepton.
4. The authors examine a more general process, the radiative decay of a particle in a lepton-antilepton pair with a right-handed polarized lepton. They study the cancellation of mass singularities in this case and discuss the differences with respect to the pion decay. In the conclusions, the main results obtained are summarized, and the Dolgov and Zakharov approach to derive the axial anomaly is briefly discussed.",0
196,"1. Salient object detection is the problem of identifying the most important object in a scene, which has applications in various fields such as recognition, image and video compression, video summarization, and human-robot interaction.
2. A large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past 7 years, which typically involve two steps: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area.
3. Most current models have bypassed the challenge of selecting objects to process by focusing on scenes with single objects, and they perform well on the second step as evidenced by high performances on existing biased datasets.
4. However, it is unclear how current models perform on complex cluttered scenes with several objects, as there is a lack of suitable benchmark datasets and a widely-agreed objective definition of the most salient object.
5. The paper aims to provide solutions for these problems and discover which component might be the weakest link in the possible failure of models when migrating to complex scenes.
6. Some related topics to visual saliency modeling and salient object detection include object importance, object proposal generation, memorability, scene clutter, image interestingness, video interestingness, surprise, image quality assessment, scene typicality, aesthetic, and attributes.
7. The first wave of interest in image saliency in computer vision and neuroscience communities was generated by the model proposed by Itti et al., which was an implementation of earlier general computational frameworks and psychological theories of bottom-up attention based on center-surround mechanisms.
8. Subsequent studies started to predict fixations with saliency models to verify models and to understand human visual attention, leading to the second wave of interest in saliency detection.
9. Some breakthrough efforts in saliency detection include the use of a conditional random field (CRF) framework, subtracting the average color from the low-pass filtered input, using a patch-based approach to incorporate global context, and proposing a region contrast-based method to measure global contrast.
10. Recent efforts to extend existing datasets have only increased the number of images without addressing core issues such as background clutter and number of objects, making model evaluation challenging. The paper suggests that now is the time to move on to more versatile datasets and remedy biases in salient object datasets.",0
197,"1. Heegaard Floer theory is a decorated topological quantum field theory (TQFT) in 2 dimensions, constructed by Ozsváth and Szabó, which associates a vector space to a closed, connected, oriented 3-manifold and a map to a connected, oriented 4-dimensional cobordism decorated with a 2-structure.
2. The maps associated with cobordisms can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary. For example, the nucleus of an elliptic surface can be used to show that two homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic 4-manifolds have different Heegaard Floer invariants.
3. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, which are related to the 3-manifolds and cobordisms involved via Heegaard diagrams.
4. Sarkar and the third author showed that every 3-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that is nice in the sense that the curves split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles. Using such a diagram, holomorphic disks in the symmetric product can be counted combinatorially, leading to a combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of any 3-manifold and null homologous knots and links in any 3-manifold.
5. The goal of the paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps associated with cobordisms between 3-manifolds with the property that the induced maps are surjective. This case includes all cobordisms for which the first homology is torsion, as well as all those consisting of only 2-handle additions.
6. The computation of the ranks of the maps goes as follows: the cobordism is decomposed into a sequence of one-handle additions, two-handle additions, and three-handle additions. Using the homological hypotheses on the cobordism and the action of the Heegaard Floer groups, the problem is reduced to the case of a cobordism map corresponding to two-handle additions only. Then, given a cobordism made of two handles",0

The paper extends the results of Yetter, Gerstenhaber, and Gerstenhaber and Schack on the deformation theory of associative algebras and poset-indexed diagrams of associative algebras to a deformation theory for arbitrary pasting diagrams of categories, functors, and natural transformations.
2. The paper establishes that obstructions are cocycles for deformation complexes of pasting diagrams in general, and considers deformations of pasting diagrams with specified functors or natural transformations required to be deformed trivially.
3. The paper also clarifies that the cochain maps constructed in previous theorems depend on choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions in the pasting diagram, but are independent of those choices up to algebraic homotopy.
4. The paper describes chain maps induced by pasting compositions on the full deformation complexes, and gives examples of deformation complexes associated to various shapes of commutative pasting diagrams.
5. The examples show that cochain maps induced by two different associations of the 2-dimensional composition are not actually equal, but only chain homotopic, and that only when compositions are involved do the cochain maps of the previous section play a role.",0

It highlights the need to select essential degrees of freedom in a theory, using the example of electric conductivity and heat capacity in crystals, which are explained by ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interactions.
* The author then moves on to QCD and the difficulty of understanding the physics behind nucleon and pion masses and low-energy properties due to the complexity of QCD at the 1 GeV scale. The author argues that spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important QCD phenomenon in this case.
* The author then discusses the consequences of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, including the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by valence (practically massless) quarks. These dynamical masses are considered as quasiparticles that arise from nonperturbative gluon and quark-antiquark dressing.
* The author then discusses the interpretation of light and strange baryons in the low-energy regime, arguing that highly nonperturbative gluodynamics gives rise to correlated quark-antiquark structures in the baryon sea, while current valence quarks get dressed by quark condensates and meson loops. The author also discusses the coupling of constituent quarks and pseudoscalar goldstone bosons, which has a form that depends on the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry.

- The document describes a nerve guidance conduit (NGC) for nerve repair and regeneration. The NGC is made of a porous polymeric sheet with aligned nanofibers and a dense outer fibrous tube. The NGC is designed to improve mechanical strength, provide guidance for cell migration and directional axonal regeneration, and prevent infiltration of scar tissue.
- The NGC is fabricated using a combination of the solvent evaporation method and the salt-leaching method. A PCL solution is poured onto a glass petri dish and acupuncture needles are placed on top to form multi-channels. The dish is then moved to a hood to let it air dry. After drying, the PCL sheet is immersed in deionized water to dissolve the salt and produce pores. The needles are removed, leaving multi-channels on the PCL sheet. The sheet is then cut into a rectangular shape and wound in a spiral fashion to form the NGC.
- The NGC has a spiral structure with surface channels that increase the surface area available for cell migration and attachment. The spiral structure also reduces the length of time needed for recovery and wear and tear often observed with single lumen tubular NGCs. A highly-aligned set of electrospun fibers are present within the surface channels and on the backs thereof, ensuring that the regenerating nerve will come into contact with aligned fibers.
- The length and diameter of the NGC can be varied controllably depending on how it is to be used. The method of fabricating the conduit does not limit its length, enabling its application for longer gap repair/regeneration for PNI.

The current application claims the benefit of and priority to Israel Patent Application No. 194519, filed Oct. 5, 2008, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The present invention relates to the field of pelvic floor reconstruction. In particular, the present invention relates to the field of pelvic floor reconstruction using implants.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common female problem that can have a profound impact on a woman's quality of life. The organs in the pelvic cavity, uterus, vagina, bladder and rectum, are held in place by a web of muscles and connective tissues that act much like a hammock. When these muscles and tissues become weakened or damaged, one or more of the pelvic organs shift out of normal position and literally “fall” into the vagina. Prolapse surgical reconstruction is performed through the vagina. During the procedure, the surgeon repositions the prolapsed organs, securing them to surrounding tissues and ligaments, and may use a synthetic non-absorbable polypropylene mesh implant. However, the prior art surgical procedures penetrate the patient from several directions and do not provide reliable anchoring of the mesh implant.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a reliable anchoring of the mesh implant.

The present invention describes a process for rapid and inexpensive in planta assembly of a DNA sequence of interest designed for stable integration into a plant chromosome. This approach allows for fast optimization of the sequences to be expressed by testing various transcription, translation assembled units, units with different protein fusions or different protein targeting or post-translational modification, etc. It can be efficiently used for screening libraries of coding or regulatory sequences of interest. Another application of the invention is the design of safer vectors which are unable to transfer the sequence of interest through an illicit gene transfer. Also, difficult cloning can be avoided during the design of complex DNA regions (e.g. showing instability during cloning procedures in bacterial cells) for stable nuclear transformation, as two or more complex DNA fragments can be linked together in planta prior to integration into plant nuclear DNA.

The general scheme of such assembly from two or more (precursor) vectors by site-specific DNA recombination is shown in FIG. 1. The simplest scheme of such assembly is the creation of a DNA sequence of interest ab from two precursors vectors A and B by recombination using the recombination site RS (FIG. 1A, I). Needless to say that such recombination event shall be selectable. This is easy to achieve e.g. if said recombination creates a functional gene providing for selection.

- The invention describes biomimetic tendon-reinforced (BTR) composite materials with improved properties including high structural performance and strength-to-weight ratio. The BTR composite structure comprises a plurality of spaced-apart stuffer members, tendon elements, and two panels bonded to the first and second ends of the stuffer members. The stuffer members may be parallel, radially aligned, or without any common center point, and the panels may have convex, concave, or flat outer surfaces. The tendon elements may be made of carbon fibers, nylon, Kevlar, glass fibers, plant fibers, or metal wires, and the stuffer members may be rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible components made of metal, ceramic, or plastic. The stuffer members and tendon elements may be embedded in a matrix material such as epoxy resin, metallic or ceramic foams, polymers, thermal isolation materials, acoustic isolation materials, and/or vibration-resistant materials.
- The invention uses a methodology called ""function-oriented material design"" (FOMD) to design materials for specific, demanding tasks. The FOMD process involves defining and quantifying the functions of a particular structure, such as supporting static loads, dissipating or confining vibration energy, or absorbing impact energy, and then optimizing the material design based on these objectives and constraints. The BTR composite concept was obtained through a topology optimization process that maximizes the out-plane stiffness of a composite made of carbon fiber and epoxy matrix material. The concept involves evenly distributing fibers in the matrix material and treating materials in tension and compression differently in the composite.
- The BTR composite structure includes six fundamental components: tendons/muscles, ribs/bones, joints, flesh, skins, and shell. The two-dimensional material concept may be extended to a three-dimensional lattice, which can be made of various raw materials such as steel frame, steel columns, carbon-fiber ropes, and carbon fiber/epoxy cover panels. A potential fabrication procedure involves inserting bent-wire tendon elements into the ends of stuffer members to create linear structures, which can be replicated to create a planar structure. If panels are added, a lightweight yet rigid structure results.

• A window reference circuit constantly compares a desired conditioned sensor signal output to an existing conditioned sensor signal output and adjusts the conditioned sensor signal output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal.
• An error correction generator determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about a position of an object being sensed, wherein inclusion of the static and error signals would require energy.

- The invention describes a method and arrangement for compressing and cooling natural gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method involves compressing the gas to a higher pressure, cooling it by heat exchange, and feeding it back into the pipeline at a lower temperature and increased pressure. The arrangement includes a compressor, heat exchanger, valve-controlled pipelines, and control units. The present invention proposes compressing the gas to an excess pressure, cooling it by heat exchange, and expanding it to the desired exit pressure to obtain further cooling. This method reduces investments and operation risk as it eliminates the need for expensive re-cooling plants used during warm weather periods.
- The invention utilizes the physical effect that a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure. During the warmer period of the year, the gas is compressed to an excess pressure, cooled by heat exchange, and then expanded to the desired exit pressure. The excess pressure is selected so that cooling during expansion is sufficient for obtaining a temperature reduction to the desired exit temperature for the re-entry into the gas pipeline. The expansion can be carried out by a valve or an expansion turbine, which recovers mechanical energy and utilizes it for providing a portion of the drive energy for the compression of the gas to the intended excess pressure.
- A particularly advantageous embodiment of the present invention provides that the compression to the excess pressure is carried out in a total of three stages. A predominant portion of the compression takes place in two successive primary compression stages, which are equipped with machines producing approximately the same pressure ratio. The gas heated in the first primary compression stage is cooled preferably by air/gas heat exchange between the two primary compression stages. The desired excess pressure is reached in an additional compression stage, which includes a booster compressor. Subsequently, the gas is again cooled, preferably by means of an air/gas heat exchange, and expanded in an expansion turbine. The latter is coupled mechanically to the booster compressor of the additional compression stage and is the sole drive means for the booster compressor, so that a significant portion of the total drive energy required for producing the excess pressure can be recovered.

The proposed design consists of a ring element made from at least two flat material ring segments joined in succession in the circumferential direction. These segments are connected via joints that form engagement zones with positively interlocking joint contours, creating an undercut geometry for preliminary coupling. The segments are punched out from a sheet metal material, preferably as 120° ring segments, minimizing cutting waste and requiring only three weld points for joining together a ring element.

This design is suitable for manufacturing radial and axial bearing cages, particularly for groove and angular ball bearings. The method for manufacturing a rolling body guide cage involves composing the ring element from at least two flat material ring segments before the forming step. The flat material ring segments are welded in the region of a joint formed",1

* The invention is a system for compensating electromagnetic interfering fields, specifically for magnetic field compensation using two sensors and a digital processor.
* The system is an improvement on feedback control systems that use one or more sensors to measure the amplitude of interfering fields and calculate control signals for devices generating magnetic fields.
* Magnetic field compensation systems are used in imaging systems such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM) to compensate for the terrestrial magnetic field or fields generated by other current-carrying devices.
* Pairs of Helmholtz coils are commonly used to generate homogeneous compensation fields, with one pair for each of the three space axes forming a cube-shaped cage around the location of interest.
* A device for compensating magnetic fields is disclosed in U.S. Publication No 2005/019555A1, using three coil pairs in a cage and an analog controller.
* Systems are also available that use only one coil per space axis for generating the compensation field, but the compensation region is smaller than with Helmholtz coils.
* Generally, a single magnetic field sensor is used for measuring the magnetic field at the place of interest, but this does not allow for detecting whether the magnetic field is homogeneous or inhomogeneous.
* It is difficult to measure interfering fields directly at the location of interest, as the object to be protected is usually there.
* Undesired feedback effects may occur when two magnetic field compensation systems are arranged directly adjacent to one another.
* Control systems for compensating electromagnetic interfering fields can generally be optimized for single applications, but adjusting to different control tasks is difficult or impossible.

332,"• The invention is related to the use of waveguide holograms (WGH) for controlled illumination of objects with specific illumination requirements, such as display holograms or spatial light modulators (SLMs).
• The WGHs are based on thin substrate waveguides, which are optically coupled to a coherent light source, such as a laser. These waveguides are characterized by the relationship between the width w of an incident laser beam coupled onto an optical waveguide having a thickness t, controlled by λ, the wavelength of the incident lightwave.
• Thin substrate waveguides are characterized by t>>λ, which allows for convenient white light illumination and uniform illumination, avoiding difficulties encountered in coupling the optical source to the thin film waveguide.
• The WGHs can be used to selectively illuminate demanding objects, such as holograms and SLMs, by compensating for non-uniformity of the diffracted wavefront in the direction of propagation through exposing a photographic emulsion to the beam without compensation or recording the hologram of the WGH hologram illuminator non-uniformly.
• The WGH illuminator occupies much less space compared to a conventional lens illumination system and can achieve very high diffraction efficiency, while minimizing noise and making viewers comfortable due to the absence of stray light propagating forward the observer.
• However, there are some penalties to be paid, such as the need for critical alignment of the laser beam, time delay across the hologram, and the need for temporal coherence of the source exceeding the time delay. Additionally, nonuniformity of the diffracted wavefront along the propagation direction, two-sidedness, and light dispersion can also be issues.",1

• The invention is related to electron multipliers used in photomultipliers and particle detectors, specifically channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates.
• There are two types of conventional electron multipliers: discrete dynode multipliers and continuous electron multipliers.
• Discrete dynode multipliers consist of dynode stages that initiate and amplify a cascade of electrons, with each stage biased at a high negative voltage relative to the anode.
• The gain of a discrete dynode multiplier is given by the equation G D =γ I γ SE N−1, where γ SE is the average number of secondary electrons emitted by an electron from one dynode impacting on the next sequential dynode and N is the number of dynodes used in the detector.
• Continuous electron multipliers, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates, employ one or more high resistivity glass channels or tubes, each of which acts as a series of continuous dynodes.
• The gain of a continuous electron multiplier can be modeled as a series of discrete dynodes and is also given by the equation G D =γ I γ SE N−1.
• The foil electron multiplier, in accordance with the present invention, encompasses a next generation design of electron multipliers that uses a sequential series of thin foils in an evacuated enclosure to multiply electrons in a series of transmission stages.
• The gain of a foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, maximizing the transmission through the support grid, and maximizing the secondary electron emission yield of the foil material.
• The gain advantage of the foil electron multiplier over conventional multipliers lies in the term γ SE +1, which represents the secondary electron yield from a primary electron exiting a foil and the continuation of the primary electron with the secondaries that it produces.",1

369," * High-dielectric oxide materials, such as ferroelectric materials, offer advantages in semiconductor circuitry, but integrating non-SiO2 based oxides directly on Si is difficult due to the strong reactivity of Si with oxygen.
* Deposition of non-SiO2 oxides typically results in the formation of a SiO2 or silicate layer at the Si/oxide interface, which has a low dielectric constant and degrades the usefulness of non-SiO2 based oxides with Si.
* Ferroelectrics with a large dielectric constant can be used to form high density capacitors, but they cannot be deposited directly on Si due to the reaction of Si to form a low dielectric constant layer.
* Putting the high dielectric material on a conductive layer has not solved the problem, as the prior art materials generally either form a silicide or react with silicon or the high dielectric oxide to form low dielectric constant insulators.
* A Ge buffer layer on Si oxidizes much less readily and can be used to prevent or minimize the formation of the low dielectric constant layer. An epitaxial Ge layer on Si provides a good buffer layer which is compatible with Si and also many oxides.
* The epitaxial growth of Ge on top of the ferroelectric or high-dielectric constant oxide is also much easier than Si which makes it possible to form three dimensional epitaxial structures.
* The Ge buffer layer can be epitaxially grown on the Si substrate allowing the high dielectric constant oxide to be epitaxially grown on the Ge and hence epitaxially aligned to the Si substrate.
* The epitaxial Ge layer allows ferroelectrics to be directly gown on Si wafers to form non-volatile non-destructive read out memory cells.
* A Ge buffer layer on the Si or GaAs substrate allows many more oxides to be epitaxially grown on it because of the much smaller chemical reactivity of Ge with oxygen compared to Si or GaAs with oxygen.
* However, not all oxides are stable next to Ge. For example, all ferroelectrics containing Pb such as Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 (PZT) are not thermodynamically",1

- The invention describes a receiver input circuit that reduces unwanted signal actuation of non-linear components, which can cause distortions. This is achieved by using several amplification control circuits, each with a different response threshold and frequency bandwidth. The first control circuit helps avoid unwanted overloading of the mixer stage and varactor diodes, while the second control circuit avoids overloading of the mixer stage and frequency influences. The third control circuit supports the other control circuits or lowers the amplification of the circuit for better protection from stronger spurious signals.
- The input circuit includes an input network with reactance elements, a PIN diode for controllable signal attenuation, a preamplifier stage, a mixer and oscillator stage, an intermediate frequency filter, rectifier circuits, and a control signal processing circuit. The control circuit is based on a PIN diode, which has the advantage of protecting all distortion-forming circuit components against signal overloading during control and protecting the following amplifier component against high-voltage discharge surges from the antenna. The rectifier circuits are arranged in such a way that the signal distortions do not affect the input circuit. The control signal is leveled by the capacitor in such a manner that the capacitor quickly charges itself up to the amount corresponding to the highest value of the signal level and follows the decreasing signal level relatively slowly. This enables greater elimination of interference through the control circuit if powerful amplitude-modulated spurious signals are present and there is danger of overloading due to peak amplitudes.",0

It does this by accounting for the regions of interest of the video sequence and the advertising clip, so that there is a continuity between the regions of interest of the pictures of the video sequence and the regions of interest of the advertising clip. This is achieved by generating salience maps for the video sequence and each advertising clip, determining the degree of similarity between them, and selecting the advertising clip with the highest degree of similarity for insertion into the video sequence at a predefined insertion point.
- The insertion point is preferably a point of the video sequence corresponding to a shot change, and the salience map of the video sequence is generated from the salience maps of the last n pictures of the video sequence that precede the insertion point. The salience map of the advertising clip is generated from the salience maps of the first p pictures of the advertising clip. The degree of similarity of an advertising clip is determined by calculating the correlation coefficient between the salience map of the video sequence and the salience map of the advertising clip, or by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two salience maps. Alternatively, the degree of similarity can be determined by selecting the N most salient points of the salience map of the video picture and the salience map of the advertising clip, determining the Euclidean distance between each point and its corresponding point of the same order in the other salience map, and calculating the average of the N Euclidean distances.

• The problem of high electrical fields is inherent in dry etching processes, and is caused by pointed regions at the intersection of conductive members. A mask layer is used to protect the dielectric during operations at the surface, but the pointed regions result in smaller line spacing, higher electric fields, and a greater propensity for electrical shorting between adjacent lines.
• The invention arranges the interface between the mask and cap to be placed at a location away from the high electric field points, where the conductive liner diffusion barrier has integrity. This is achieved by removing a portion of the mask layer and positioning the mask member so that the high field points are separated from the interface.
• The recessed mask structure provides benefits such as minimizing damage to the conductive liner, reducing the overall capacitance of the device, and providing faster signal propagation in the interconnect wiring.
• The invention can be integrated into a component with a lower and predictable overall capacitance, which is achieved by positioning the high k mask in an opening between conductors so that the overall capacitance decreases as more of the hard mask is recessed.

- The invention describes a process for co-producing power and hydrocarbons using an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process and a hydrocarbon production process. The IGCC process uses coal as a feedstock and first gasifies it to produce synthesis gas, which then serves as fuel for a combined cycle power production stage. The synthesis gas is then converted to hydrocarbons. The invention aims to provide an IGCC process integrated with a hydrocarbon production process that shows economic and environmental benefits.
- The process includes a wet gasification stage that gasifies coal to produce a combustion gas at elevated pressure, enriching a portion of the combustion gas with hydrogen to produce an H2-enriched gas, generating power from another portion of the combustion gas, a dry gasification stage that gasifies coal to produce a synthesis gas precursor at elevated pressure, mixing the H2-enriched gas with the synthesis gas precursor to provide a synthesis gas for hydrocarbon synthesis, and synthesizing hydrocarbons from the synthesis gas. The combustion gas may be produced at a pressure of at least 45 bar, and the molar ratio of H2/CO in the combustion gas may be at least 0.6. The dry gasification stage should produce synthesis gas at a pressure which is sufficiently high to allow hydrocarbon synthesis at a suitably high pressure. The molar ratio of H2/CO in the synthesis gas precursor may be between about 0.3 and about 0.6. Enriching a first portion of the combustion gas with H2 may include subjecting said first portion to water gas shift conversion thereby to produce the H2-enriched gas. The process may include purifying a portion of the H2-enriched gas to produce essentially pure hydrogen, which may be used for hydroprocessing of hydrocarbons synthesized from the synthesis gas. The H2-enriched gas may be at elevated pressure, and mixing at least a portion of the H2-enriched gas with the synthesis gas precursor may include passing the H2-enriched gas through an expansion turbine to generate power. Generating power from a second portion of the combustion gas may include combusting the combustion gas",0

• OMB implemented strategic sourcing practices in 2005, directing agencies to develop and implement strategic sourcing efforts based on spend analysis results.
• The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) was established in 2005 to address government-wide opportunities to strategically source commonly purchased products and services.
• Most agencies leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing in 2011, with the DOD, DHS, DOE, and VA accounting for 80% of federal procurement spending but managing only 5% of it through strategic sourcing.
• FSSI managed a small amount of spending through its initiatives in 2011, achieving significant savings, but most agencies' efforts did not address their highest spending areas, such as services.
• Realizing cost savings and benefits from strategic sourcing contracts depends on utilization, but only 15% of government-wide spending for covered products and services went through FSSI contracts in 2011.
• Challenges to strategic sourcing in the federal setting include obtaining and analyzing reliable data, securing expertise, leadership support, and developing metrics.

- EPA selects incineration as a Superfund cleanup remedy in about 6% of decisions, with three incinerators operating at Superfund sites and four more planned as of October 1996.
- Incineration involves four basic steps: preparing and feeding wastes into the incinerator, burning the wastes, collecting and cooling the ash, and filtering and releasing the gases.
- Incinerators at Superfund sites are generally ""transportable"" and are constructed and operated by contractors, with CERCLA exempting any portion of a cleanup action conducted entirely on-site from the need to obtain a permit.
- EPA requires incinerators at Superfund sites to meet RCRA's substantive requirements, such as the act's standards for emissions, and relies on four principal methods to ensure safe operation.
- EPA establishes specific cleanup standards for each incinerator used at a Superfund site, based on studies of the site's characteristics and typically adopting RCRA's standards for fixed facility hazardous waste incinerators.
- EPA requires engineering controls to prevent standards from being exceeded and has built-in safety features unique to each model to prevent excessive emissions of contaminants in the event of an emergency shutdown.

Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure aimed at helping individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts. It generally involves an automatic stay that stops most lawsuits and collection activities against the debtor.
2. In a bankruptcy proceeding, creditors with substantially similar claims are classified similarly and receive the same treatment. Business debtors may seek liquidation under Chapter 7 or reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Code. Proceedings can be voluntary or involuntary, and in an involuntary proceeding, the debtor can defend against the proceeding.
3. A Chapter 7 proceeding involves a court-supervised procedure by which a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor's estate, reduces them to cash, and makes distributions to creditors. A reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 allows debtors to continue some or all of their operations subject to court supervision.
4. The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities, including bankruptcy courts, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC), the Federal Judicial Center, and the Department of Justice's U.S. Trustee Program and Bankruptcy Administrator Program.
5. A preference action can be asserted for payments made to an insider within a year prior to the bankruptcy filing. Large, complex financial companies generally file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Code.
6. Certain financial institutions, such as insured depository institutions and insurance companies, may not file as debtors under the Code, and broker-dealers and commodity brokers face special restrictions in using the Code.

• The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes and to provide services to families and children with the goal of reuniting them.
• If reunification is not possible, the state must find permanent placement for the child outside the family home, with options including adoption, continuing temporary foster care, or long-term foster care due to the child's special needs.
• In response to prolonged stays of children in foster care, some states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing.
• States have implemented various operational and procedural changes to expedite the permanency process, including low-cost methods for financing and providing services that address specific barriers to reuniting families.
• Some states are experimenting with concurrent planning, under which child welfare officials work towards reuniting a family while also developing an alternate plan for permanently removing the child if reunification efforts fail.
• The overall impact of these initiatives is difficult to assess due to the absence of evaluation data and the lack of comparison groups or quality data from the period before the initiative.

• TODs can increase access to employment, educational, cultural, and other opportunities by promoting transportation options to households, resulting in increased transit ridership and reduced road congestion. FTA provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD, but does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, FTA has been expanding its role in TOD in recent years through research, partnerships, and a pilot planning program.

• Factors that can support TOD include a strong local economy, available land for development, supportive local residents, and efficient access to jobs and activity centers. Factors that can hinder TOD include higher construction costs, lenders' reluctance to finance TOD projects, lengthy local development approval processes, an unsupportive local population, and unattractive or unsupportive land uses around transit stations.

• Local governments can use a variety of policies to encourage TOD, including zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. These tools are most effective when they align with local residents' preferences and market demand for development.

• FTA considers factors related to potential TOD when assessing proposed projects for New Starts funding, including local government financial commitment, mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, economic development effects, land use, and cost-effectiveness. However, these factors make up only a small percentage of all the factors considered.

- The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two programs, DI and SSI, that provide benefits for individuals with disabilities. Both programs use the same definition of disability, but have different program purposes and requirements for entitlement. DI is an insurance program funded by payroll taxes and linked to the worker's earnings history, while SSI is a means-tested program that provides a standard minimum level of income for individuals with disabilities and limited income and assets.
- Concurrent beneficiaries, who receive benefits from both programs, are likely to have mental impairments, be female, and have a median earned income of about $250 a month. However, only about 11% of concurrent beneficiaries work, and few take advantage of work incentives available to them under the SSI and/or DI programs. SSA faces challenges in serving concurrent beneficiaries effectively due to the complexity of its programs and the lack of coordination between SSI and DI program rules.

- IRS's National Research Program (NRP) aims to obtain new information about taxpayers' compliance with tax laws, focusing on voluntary reporting compliance data.
- NRP consists of three main processes: casebuilding, classification, and taxpayer audits. The goal is to minimize burden on taxpayers while obtaining accurate reporting compliance data.
- IRS plans to use NRP data to update return selection formulas, design prefiling programs, and allocate resources to address noncompliance issues.
- NRP's classification process involves creating information files on returns selected for the NRP sample, classifying returns based on verifiable items, and conducting taxpayer audits for unverifiable items.
- IRS trained classifiers and auditors, and conducted tests to ensure NRP's effectiveness before full implementation. NRP classification began in November 2002, and IRS has made substantial progress in casebuilding and classification.
- IRS has implemented quality assurance measures in the classification and audit processes, including regular reviews, in-process and completed case reviews, and accuracy checks.
- IRS designed NRP to include several steps to identify NRP audit quality problems, with reviews at various stages and by managers at different levels.
- IRS has included data consistency checks in the NRP database to ensure accurate data entry and has developed a case tracking system to monitor case progress.
- IRS plans to survey taxpayers who receive NRP audits to assess their perceptions of the burden and improve interactions with taxpayers subject to NRP audits.

The MHSS also supports nonactive-duty beneficiaries when resources are available, but when their need for health care exceeds the MHSS' resources, DOD purchases services from the civilian health care sector.
2. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, whether in the military or civilian sector, provide mental health services, but only psychiatrists can prescribe medication due to their medical training. The MHSS created the Prescribing Psychologist Demonstration Project (PDP) to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists in the military so they could treat their patients with psychotropic medication when needed.
3. The PDP was established in response to a conference report dated September 28, 1988, and the Army's Office of the Surgeon General was tasked with designing and implementing the project. The project consisted of a 2-year training model, including course work at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences and clinical experience at Walter Reed Army Medical Center or the Malcolm Grow Medical Center.
4. The first PDP training began in August 1991 with four participants, and subsequent classes consisted of 2 years of training, including classroom and clinical training. PDP participants were trained to take medical histories, incorporate them into treatment plans, and prescribe medication for patients with certain types of mental disorders.
5. Although the medical education received under the PDP qualified clinical psychologists to treat mental conditions with medication, it was less extensive than psychiatrists' medical training. Therefore, the MHSS limits prescribing psychologists' scope of practice, and they may only treat patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who have mental conditions without medical complications as determined by their supervisors.",0

2. GovWorks and FedSource are required to recover their full costs of doing business and are allowed to retain up to 4 percent of their total annual income. They charge fees for services and are expected to provide services more efficiently than federal agencies' own personnel.
3. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to regulatory requirements and contracting practices designed to protect the government's interests. Three main parties share responsibilities for ensuring that proper procedures are followed: government customer, franchise fund, and contractor.
4. GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain the full benefits of competitive procedures, did not ensure fair and reasonable prices, and may have missed opportunities to achieve savings on behalf of DOD customers for millions of dollars worth of goods and services.
5. The franchise funds' business operating principles require them to maintain and evaluate cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors, but they did not perform analyses that DOD could use to assess whether the franchise funds deliver good value. Their performance measures generally focus on customer satisfaction and generating revenues, rather than proper use of contracts and sound management practices.

Hedge funds and private equity funds are not subject to the same federal securities regulations as mutual funds and often invest in a wide variety of financial instruments. They tend to be opportunistic and have high minimum investment requirements, which can make it difficult for smaller pension plans to invest in them. Pension plans that invest in hedge funds and private equity must comply with ERISA's fiduciary standards, which require them to act solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries, invest with the care, skill, and diligence of a prudent person, and diversify plan investments to minimize the risk of large losses.

While states generally have adopted standards essentially identical to the ERISA prudent man standard, specific provisions of law and regulation vary from state to state. Public plans are also not insured by the PBGC, but could call upon state or local taxpayers in the event of a funding shortfall. The Employee Benefit Security Administration (EBSA) at Labor is responsible for enforcing ERISA's provisions and educating and assisting retired workers and plan sponsors, while the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) collects premiums from federally insured plans to insure the benefits of retirees if a plan terminates without sufficient assets to pay promised benefits.",1

2. * The potential for harm from exposure to pesticides is related to both the amount of a substance a person is exposed to and the toxicity of the chemical. Children may be more susceptible to harm from pesticides due to their higher exposure per pound of body weight.
3. * EPA regulates the registration, sale, and use of pesticides through the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), both as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). EPA's analysis of potentially harmful effects to human health focuses on ensuring that older pesticides meet contemporary health and safety standards and that their risks are mitigated.
4. * During the 1990s, tobacco producers in the US commonly used 37 of the pesticides approved by EPA for such use. Most of the pesticides used on tobacco were insecticides and herbicides, which control insect and plant pests. The actual number and amount of pesticides used on tobacco or other crops in any given year vary depending on factors such as the weather and the specific pests that become problematic.
5. * EPA uses risk assessment to evaluate the potential health impacts of a pesticide on humans and determine what measures are needed to mitigate identified risks.

These patterns include the use of a new illicit drug, a change in how a drug is taken, a change in the level of use of an existing drug among populations that routinely abuse drugs, and the use of a drug by a new population group or in a different geographic area.
* Federal agencies fund activities and programs that implement the nation’s drug control strategy, with about 25 percent of resources provided to state and local governments and private entities. In fiscal year 1997, federal funding for drug control efforts was over $15 billion, and the fiscal year 1998 request was for $16 billion. About two-thirds of federal drug control funds are used to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, and one-third supports efforts to reduce demand.

Listing a species results in limitations on activities that could affect that species and penalties for taking individuals of a listed species.
* Federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine whether an agency project might jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify a species' critical habitat. This process is known as consultation and concludes with the issuance of a biological opinion (BiOp) as to the harm the project poses.
* If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is released along with any reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to the agency action that would avoid jeopardy. To excuse any incidental taking of listed species, the Services issue an incidental take statement that includes reasonable and prudent measures (RPMs) to minimize the effects of the project.
* The exemption process is available for federal agencies, the governor of the state where the project would occur, or the licensees or permittees involved in the project to seek an exemption from the ESA if there are extraordinary economic circumstances and there is no RPA that would avoid jeopardy. This process offers the opportunity to consider economic factors in evaluating federal actions, and provides an opportunity for economic factors to override jeopardy to the species.

There has also been interest in the tax treatment of capital losses, with some proposing an increase in the limit on capital losses that can be deducted against ordinary income (the loss limit) from its current $3,000 to $10,000 or $15,000. The loss limit was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from minimizing their income taxes by altering the timing of the realization of gains and losses. However, increasing the loss limitation would tend to increase the dichotomy between the tax treatment of gains and losses.

• The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed repeatedly over the years, with some legislative changes attempting to reestablish symmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses. Under current law, asymmetries remain, with net long-term losses deductible against net short-term gains without limit, and net long-term losses deductible against up to $3,000 of ordinary income even though the maximum rate on ordinary income is 35% while the maximum rate on long-term gains is 15%.

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax calculation with a broader base than the regular tax, including certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions. However, it does not include the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, causing an increase in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT over time.
2. In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but this number increased to 823,000 by 1999 and is projected to reach over 9 million by 2009. This growth is due to the failure to index exemptions to inflation and the interaction of the AMT with tax credits.
3. The AMT will gradually reach further down into the income distribution, with a larger portion of returns with tax liability subject to the AMT. The shift in the distribution of the AMT is dramatic, with a decrease in the share of taxpayers in the highest income classes and an increase in the middle and upper middle income classes.
4. The cost of correcting the AMT is significant, with indexing AMT exemptions costing $13.9 billion by 2008 and eliminating the credit limit provision costing many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009.

* The bill would require individuals to maintain health insurance and certain employers with more than 50 employees to provide insurance or pay a tax, with some exceptions.
* Market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would be implemented, and existing plans offered by employers and in the individual market would be grandfathered.
* Exchanges would be established to offer eligible individuals and small businesses access to private plans, and certain individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level could qualify for credits and subsidies towards their premium costs and cost-sharing.
* States would have the flexibility to establish basic plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid.
* Title VI of the bill includes provisions to raise revenues to pay for expanded health insurance coverage, such as excise taxes and annual fees on health insurers, limitations on executive compensation of insurance companies, and limitations on contributions to tax-advantaged accounts used for health care expenses.
* The bill would alter how current private health insurance markets function, particularly for individuals who purchase coverage directly from an insurer or through a small employer.
* Reforms affecting premium rating would likely increase premiums for some and lower premiums for others, depending on their age, health, behaviors, and other factors.

• HRPs cover individuals who have been denied coverage, received high quotes, or received offers with preexisting condition exclusions in the individual market. They also help states comply with HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions.

• State HRPs have limited enrollment, with approximately 200,000 individuals enrolled in 2008, while nearly 4 million additional persons were potentially eligible. This is due to the narrow focus on individuals with preexisting conditions seeking coverage in the private, non-group market.

• Federal and state laws restrict insurers' ability to reject applications or design coverage based on health factors in the nongroup market, but some applicants are still rejected or charged higher premiums. HRPs assist such individuals by providing an alternative source of coverage.

• HRPs are designed to stabilize the market, promote competition, and retain insurance carriers by removing high risk persons from the individual market and placing them in publicly subsidized insurance pools. However, some researchers are skeptical about their ability to substantially reduce the number of uninsured, particularly among those with serious medical conditions.

The gross estate includes the value of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, in which the decedent owned an interest on the date of death, as well as certain interests in property transferred to another person prior to death.
* The value of the gross estate is determined by adding the value of all lifetime taxable gifts made by the decedent to the taxable estate. Deductions from the gross estate include estate administration expenses, certain debts and losses, qualified transfers to a surviving spouse, charitable bequests, and state death taxes.
* The federal estate tax is computed by applying the tax rate schedule to the sum of the decedent's taxable estate and lifetime taxable gifts, and then reducing the result by any available credits. The unified transfer tax credit, the credit for foreign death taxes, and the credit for previously taxed property are the three major estate tax credits presently in effect.
* The gift tax is a tax imposed on an annual basis on all gratuitous transfers of property made during life. The taxable gift is determined by reducing the gross value of the gift by the available deductions and exclusions, such as the annual per donee exclusion, the gift tax marital deduction, and the gift tax charitable deduction.
* The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is a flat-rate tax applied to three different transfer events: a direct skip, a taxable termination, or a taxable distribution.

• Enrollees are responsible for 100% of the premiums, and there are no preexisting condition exclusions, but there are waiting periods for orthodontia. Eligible individuals can enroll during the standard open season for FEHB plans or following a qualifying life event.

• There are four nationwide dental plans and three vision plans, with varying premiums based on plan, family members, and residency (for dental plans only). Active employees pay FEDVIP premiums on a pre-tax basis, but annuitants, survivor annuitants, and compensationers do not have this option.

• The benefits provided by these plans include oral examinations, restorative procedures, endodontic services, periodontal services, major restorative services, prosthodontic services, and orthodontic services for dental plans, and eye exams, lenses, frames, and low vision coverage for vision plans.

• Enrollees will pay less out-of-pocket costs if they use in-network services. Premiums, benefits, and network limitations vary by plan. It is important to compare FEHB coverage to determine if also enrolling in FEDVIP is beneficial.",1

- The Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) Act of 1999, which was reauthorized until September 30, 2020, requires meat packers to report prices and other information on purchases of cattle, hogs, lamb, boxed beef, wholesale pork, and lamb carcasses and boxed lamb to the USDA. Before LMR was enacted, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price and related market information from meat packers on a voluntary basis. However, by the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone significant changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, more production specialization, and more vertical integration. These changes led to fewer animals being sold through negotiated sales and more sales under alternative marketing arrangements with prices not publicly disclosed or reported. As a result, some livestock producers called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat.
- The LMR Act of 1999 mandated price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine and allowed USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales. The law authorized appropriations as necessary and required USDA to implement regulations no later than 180 days after the law was enacted. Mandatory price reporting was authorized for five years, until September 30, 2004. USDA issued a final rule on December 1, 2000, and although reporting for lamb was optional in the LMR statute, USDA established mandatory reporting for lamb in the final rule. The implementation of mandatory reporting did not affect the continuation of the AMS voluntary price-reporting program. AMS continues to publish prices from livestock auctions, and feeder cattle and pig sales, through voluntary-based market news reports.",0

Job loss is a significant macroeconomic problem, but the distinction between net job loss (the result of greater gross job loss than gains) and gross job loss (the total number of jobs eliminated by contracting firms) is often overlooked in policy debates.

• Gross job loss and gains are each, on average, around 20 times higher than net job loss or gains in any given quarter. Economists view net job loss as detrimental, but gross job loss as a normal part of a functioning market economy as long as it is offset by gross job gains.

• The US labor market is highly dynamic, with labor rapidly shifting from firm to firm. This vitality is the essence of economic growth and rising living standards, but can also have social costs, particularly for those who lose their jobs.

• Trade liberalization has not been shown to have a significant effect on net employment, as employment has steadily increased during the post-war period even as imports have increased as a percentage of GDP.

• Gross job loss can translate into net job loss at the local level even when national employment is rising, and may not necessarily indicate that the same individuals who lose jobs also gain jobs.

North Korea escalated the security situation on the Korean peninsula through words and actions, including announcing it had nuclear weapons and suspending participation in the Six-Party Talks. However, a joint statement of principles was agreed to in September by all parties during the fourth round of talks, committing North Korea to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.
2. * The year saw increased focus on North Korea's human rights record and criminal activities. Jay Lefkowitz was appointed as the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea, and his public statements, along with a high-profile meeting in the White House between President Bush and a prominent North Korean defector and author, amplified the Administration's concern about North Korea's human rights record. In late 2005, American officials imposed penalties on Banco Delta Asia, a Macau bank that allegedly allowed the laundering of U.S. dollars counterfeited by North Korea.

- Proteomics, or the study of proteins, has become more sensitive and accurate in identifying and quantifying proteins in complex samples due to advancements in protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry. However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from very complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present in the sample over wide concentration ranges. To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at either the protein or peptide level, or both. Regardless of the initial fractionation methods used, the final step in most strategies involves analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS. However, undersampling can occur, where only a subset of the peptides will be identified if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer. This has raised concerns about the general value of proteomics for most applications, as the identifications of abundant proteins are reproducible, while most of the variability is observed in lower-abundance proteins.
- To achieve more comprehensive proteome coverage, strategies such as repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses, longer HPLC gradients, or additional fractionation via either more fractions or more modes of separation of complex proteomes can be used. However, the key factor is to determine the most time- and resource-effective strategies for achieving a high depth of analysis, as these factors directly affect sample throughput and proteome analysis cost. In a study comparing the effects of two commonly used strategies, gelc-ms/ms with repetitive lc-ms/ms analysis and additional protein prefractionation, it was found that both strategies conferred some benefit in terms of depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates. However, the 3-d method, which included the prefractionation of the cell lysate using microscale solution isoelectrofocusing prior to the SDS-PAGE separation, substantially improved proteome coverage compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.",0

- The group has explored the synthesis of -lactams using aryl-, thioaryl-, and cyano-substituted anhydrides, demonstrating the possibility of one-pot four-component reactions (4CRs) with thioaryl substitution.
- Computational studies suggest that cyanosuccinic anhydride reactions proceed by a Mannich-like mechanism via the enol tautomer of the anhydride.
- Related reactions reported by Castagnoli, Cushman, and Haimova likely proceed by this mechanism as well.
- The anhydrides used in these reactions are poorly enolizable and require forcing conditions.
- Cushman and Haimova later reported analogous reactions with homophthalic anhydride, which is highly enolizable and reacts at lower temperatures.
- The group then explored Mannich-type reactions and related 4CRs of variously substituted anhydrides.
- Aryl-substituted succinic anhydrides showed some variation in reactivity based on the substituents attached to the aromatic ring.
- Direct attachment of an electron-withdrawing group resulted in higher reactivity.

A model using Fischer-344 (F344) to Lewis rat strain combination has been established to study CAI, and a severe but reversible acute rejection episode occurs 9 days after allogenic transplantation.

• During acute rejection, there is a strong mononuclear infiltration of the allograft interstitium and numerous leukocytes accumulate in the blood vessels. After resolution of acute rejection, the number of intravascular leukocytes decreases but remains chronically elevated compared to healthy kidneys.

• A majority of blood leukocytes in day 9 allografts are monocytes displaying a unique state of partial activation regarding cell surface antigen and cytokine expression. These cells interact with graft endothelial cells and might trigger CAV, which is characterized by intimal hyperplasia.

TG2 is a protein that catalyzes posttranscriptional modifications of proteins, resulting in cross-linking of proteins and modifications via amine incorporation into proteins and via deamidation.

• TG2 has a bewildering functional diversity and is involved in numerous cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell survival, phagocytosis, cell adhesion and migration, and cell signaling.

- EMVs were introduced to a model patient circuit and circulated through a CVVH filter for 70 minutes.
- EMV levels were recorded and expressed as a fraction of starting concentration after mixing occurred.
- The decline in EMV levels due to dialysis was rapid, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes and a relatively constant level of 29% of starting concentration thereafter.
- At the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis, the dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMV concentration.
- The findings support the idea of CVVH as a meaningful therapeutic intervention in acute lung injury (ALI) due to clearance of EMVs from the patient circulation.
- The experimental conditions achieved the same plasma level of EMVs as seen in human clinical disease (110 per ml).

* Ipsilateral motor deficits emerge during the acute phase of stroke and persist chronically, but the reasons for their presence are unclear.
* Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient for detecting ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination function on the ipsilateral side.
* Recent studies have also found kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb during the performance of specific motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination.
* Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, and the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.
* Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have focused on motor deficits, rather than sensory deficits.
* A study was conducted to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb of stroke patients and to examine the correlation between the two variables.

- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects people of all ages, but its prevalence increases with age and is more common in women. The prevalence of RA in Northern Europe and North America is estimated to be 0.5-1%, while in Southern Europe, it is estimated to be lower at 0.45-0.66%. The annual incidence of RA is also lower in Southern European countries. The economic burden of RA is significant, with costs varying across countries due to differences in methods of calculation, reimbursement policies, availability of drugs and social services, and treatment guidelines.
- In Italy, the healthcare costs associated with age-related diseases like RA are expected to increase due to the aging population. The introduction of newer costly therapies may further contribute to the economic burden of RA in Italy. A review of the economic impact of RA in Italy in the past two decades found that the costs of RA before and after the introduction of biological agents were not significantly different. However, the review predicted that the future costs of RA in Italy would increase and be higher than those in other European countries.
- Studies have shown that the prevalence of RA in Italy is around 0.5%. The largest study on the prevalence and incidence of RA in Italy involved more than 4.5 million people and indicated that both the prevalence and incidence of RA progressively increase in both men and women up to the age of 80 years. As Italy is undergoing a demographic transition, the number of elderly people is expected to increase, leading to a heavy socioeconomic burden on the National Health Service (NHS) in the coming years.
- The severity and progression of RA have a significant impact on the costs of the disease. The introduction of biological drugs for the treatment of RA highlights the role of economics in patient access to innovative but expensive treatments. Health-economic analyses should consider the long-term evolution of the disease in terms of its impact on social costs and loss of productivity, as rapid/severe progression can lead to huge increases in indirect social costs and loss of productivity.

- Molecular imaging techniques such as dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and meta-[i]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy can improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD.
- DAT SPECT abnormalities can support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism. However, it cannot differentiate between the various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy.
- MIBG myocardial scintigraphy can assess the sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals in PD patients, with a decreased cardiac MIBG uptake in comparison with other parkinsonian syndrome patients.
- The use of either DAT SPECT or MIBG scintigraphy alone is insufficient for distinguishing PD from non-PD due to their limited test accuracy.

4. The frequency of incorrect use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) ranges from 14% to 90%, reducing lung drug deposition to less than 20%.
5. Scoring systems that assess the difficulties patients face in using inhaled drugs can be useful in reducing those difficulties and improving treatment adherence.
6. Two scoring systems have been developed to assess the ability of patients to use MDIs or dry powder inhalers (DPIs), but they have not yet been validated.
7. The present study aimed to validate these scores, identify the most common errors made during inhaler use, and identify patients in need of an educational program for inhaler use.
8. The study included patients diagnosed with asthma, in outpatient treatment for at least two years, between 15 and 65 years old, with at least four years of schooling, no hearing impairment, and who agreed to participate in the study. Patients who had previously participated in educational programs regarding the use of asthma medications were excluded.",0

It has potential as a food preservative and shows activity against the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and, to a lesser extent, Campylobacter jejuni. The bacteriocin is heat-stable and resistant to pH changes, but sensitive to proteases. Its activity increased during the purification process, and it may be a class IIa bacteriocin.</summary>
2. <summary>The study of the effects of K channel modulators on enterocin S37 revealed that cromakalim and pinacidil, which act on ATP-sensitive potassium channels, caused membrane hyperpolarization and inhibited the growth of sensitive L. monocytogenes strains. Glipizide, which affects cell membrane potential and calcium ion influx, had a weaker inhibitory effect. The combination of enterocin S37 and K channel modulators suggested an implication in a depletion of intracellular potassium levels, affecting the growth of sensitive cells.</summary>
3. <summary>The lipid composition of the cell membrane plays a role in the efficiency of bacteriocin activity. Enterocin S37 alone did not affect the growth of a bacteriocin-resistant variant of L. monocytogenes, but the combination of enterocin S37 and K channel modulators impacted strongly the growth of the resistant variant. The mode of action of enterocin S37 may be triggered by potential interaction with the cell membrane, leading to the formation of pores and the loss of intracellular components, resulting in cell death.</summary>",0

* A total of 28 children were enrolled and received dosing in the phase 1 study, with 15 children having spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 13 having spinal muscular atrophy type 3.
* Lumbar punctures were performed at four sites, and the majority of them were carried out using either a 22- (48%) or 25-gauge (37%) needle inserted in the l3-l4 (44%) or l4-l5 (29%) space.
* Nearly half (44%) of the lumbar punctures were guided using fluoroscopy.
* Of the 73 lumbar punctures performed, the majority (68%) had no complications, while lumbar puncture-related adverse events were reported in 32%.
* The most common adverse events were headache, back pain, and post lumbar puncture syndrome, and all events resolved without long-term complications.
* A subgroup analysis demonstrated that headache, back pain, and post lumbar puncture syndrome were observed more frequently when a 21- or 22-gauge needle was used, in older children (8 - 14 years of age), and in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3.
* The study suggests that using a 24-gauge or smaller needle would likely reduce the chance of adverse events in children with spinal muscular atrophy.

- Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare, congenital liver cysts first described by Friedrich in 1857.
- CHFCs are thought to result from evagination of the foregut during embryogenesis and have specific characteristics, including four layers: pseudostratified columnar epithelium with mucus cells, sub-epithelial connective tissue, smooth muscle, and outer fibrous capsule.
- CHFCs are usually found in the left lobe of the liver, are mostly asymptomatic, and are typically located superficially in the median segments.
- CHFCs can be confused with other hepatic cysts, such as simple cysts, hydatid cysts, biliary cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and bronchogenic cysts.
- CHFCs can present with abdominal pain, and the recommended treatment varies from observation to surgical excision.
- CHFCs can harbor squamous cell carcinoma in rare cases, making serial imaging necessary for those undergoing cyst sclerosis.
- Laparoscopic excision is the best approach for CHFCs, especially for lesions in segments II to VI, where visualization and access are easiest.
- Reporting individual cases of CHFCs is essential due to their rarity, as illustrated by the case presented, which highlights the importance of considering CHFC as a diagnosis for a superficially located unilocular hepatic cystic mass and the benefits of laparoscopic excision as a first-line treatment.

- Obesity is a low-level, chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of factors including a sedentary lifestyle, caloric food consumption, and genetic predisposition. Adipose tissue secretes pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, and a high-fat diet can promote the production of proinflammatory interleukins and a chronic inflammatory process.
* Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian function and is associated with adverse changes in lipoproteins, glucose and insulin metabolism, distribution of body fat, clotting, and vascular endothelium. These changes, in combination with weight gain, place women at a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.
* A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a high-fat diet and ovariectomy on the inflammatory process in rats. The results showed that administration of a hyperlipidic diet for 8 weeks combined with short-term ovariectomy promoted an increase in body weight gain and a decrease in metabolic efficiency, accompanied by hyperleptinemia. The cytokines content of the liver and gastrocnemius muscle was unchanged, but levels of all cytokines analyzed were decreased in mesenteric adipose tissues.
* The study also found that ovariectomy in rats fed a hyperlipidic diet caused hyperleptinemia and increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content. These changes, in combination with long-term ovariectomy, may contribute to the induction of proinflammatory processes, particularly those associated with a high-fat diet.

• The study found that CD patients with associated HP infection showed a lower rate of LG, which may be due to the limited role of bacterial infection in cytotoxicity and HP's ability to converge the immune response towards a TH2 response and suppress the TH1 immune response.
• The study suggests that in undefined cases of CD with overlapping clinical and histological features, the number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum may hint toward the diagnosis of CD rather than HP infection, and the number of lymphoid follicles directs toward the diagnosis of HP infection.

645,"1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive conditions caused by defects in various enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). In patients with 21-OHD, some precursors are shunted into the androgen synthetic pathway, causing signs and symptoms of androgen excess.
2. The discovery of cortisone in the 1950s has led to effective medical treatment for CAH, which typically consists of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. However, recent reports have revealed a high prevalence of small adrenal tumors in patients with untreated 21-OHD CAH.
3. The document reports four cases of patients with CAH who were managed with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone and subsequently found to have adrenal masses. Two of the cases were managed with adrenalectomy due to increasing adrenal mass size and virilization.
4. The development of adrenal adenoma or carcinoma in patients with CAH is rare, but the incidence of adrenal masses appears to be higher in CAH patients and in heterozygotes than in the general population. The pathogenesis of adrenal tumor in patients with 21-OHD CAH is thought to be related to a consequence of ACTH hypersecretion, which results from the lack of glucocorticoid synthesis. Therefore, patients with 21-OHD CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumor, improve its symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorder, particularly hyponatremia.",0

The smear layer should be removed for increased antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness, but some authors insist on retaining the smear layer for better adaptation of materials to the root surface. The photodynamic diode laser group showed higher bond strength than the other groups, except for the 37% orthophosphoric acid group, without removing the smear layer. This may be due to the stable collagen fibrils structure after lasing, which improves the infiltration of the luting agent.
2. Sodium hypochlorite increases the penetration of monomers into the dentinal tubules by removing organic components but can inhibit interfacial polymerization of resin bonding materials due to broken down oxygen. A study found that 17% EDTA alone was not effective in removing smear remnants, and dual irrigation methods were not used for this study due to sporadic erosion and dissolution of the dentin. When the push-out tests were examined, generally, failures of bonding were observed between resin and dentin. In the present study, only the diode laser group showed post-cement failure, while the other groups showed mixed failures.
3. The study suggests that NaOCl (5.25%) and NaCl (0.9%) were not effective in removing the smear layer when used as a final irrigation. According to the SEM evaluation, orthophosphoric acid (37%) and EDTA (17%) were more effective methods in removing the smear layer than NaOCl, NaCl irrigants, and Helbo Theralite laser. However, Helbo Theralite laser and orthophosphoric acid were more effective at the cement-dentin interface than EDTA for bond strength of self-adhesive cements. Therefore, it may be more effective to modify the smear layer when a self-adhesive system is used.",0

The study found that feeding mice with a diet containing 3.5g/kg of NDGA (373 mg/kg bw/d) extended their median lifespan by 12%. However, there was no effect on maximum lifespan. The study also found that NDGA decreased the size of liver tumors but increased hepatic tumorigenesis.
2. The study also investigated the effects of NDGA on the lifespan of Drosophila and found that optimum oral treatment with NDGA at 3.0mg/ml medium increased the median lifespan of the flies by approximately 23%. The results suggest that at least some of the target(s) of NDGA action are phylogenetically conserved between mice and flies.
3. The study found that NDGA consumption in mice, even at doses below its therapeutic dose, was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis. However, in flies, NDGA did not appear to affect energy uptake or utilization. The study also found that 3.5g/kg diet (373 mg ndga / kg bw / d) extended lifespan in mice, but higher and lower dosages were ineffective.
4. The study found that NDGA consumption in mice was associated with an increased incidence of liver, lung, and thymus tumors, and increased hemorrhagic diathesis. However, there was little evidence for acute liver or kidney toxicity as measured by serum chemistries. The study also noted that the doses of NDGA which extend murine lifespan appear to overlap the dosages which produce serious pathologies.",0

* Myosin VA (MyoVA) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
* Each dimerized MyoVA molecule consists of a pair of N-terminal motor domains (i.e., heads) connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain.
* MyoVA's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms for processive motion.
* Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of MyoVA, but high calcium (>1 mM) reduces motor processivity and may cause one or more calmodulins to dissociate from each lever arm.
* Calmodulin dissociation may reduce the efficiency of lever arm displacement amplification and intramolecular strain-dependent gating between the two heads, necessary for the motor's processivity.
* MyoVA is maneuverable and can switch actin tracks, with structural flexibility likely residing within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction.
* Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVA motors and their subdomains.
* The flexural stiffness of MyoVA subdomains, including the lever arms, lever arm/coiled-coil junction, and distal rod, was estimated using TPM and other methods.
* The estimated flexural stiffness of MyoVA constructs and subdomains provides insight into the structural components critical to its functional capacities, such as proper gating, avoiding intracellular obstacles, and delivering cargo efficiently.

- Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 genes were genotyped in a cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
- In multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients carrying the wild-type t/t genotype.
- Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type g/g genotype.
- The study suggests that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC.

However, serum vaspin levels were lower in patients with T2DM compared to those without T2DM, but there was no significant difference in serum vaspin levels between patients with and without RI.
2. * Spearman's analysis showed that serum vaspin levels were related to creatinine (Cr) in patients without T2DM, while in patients with T2DM, serum vaspin levels were related to age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and uric acid (UA). In all subjects, serum vaspin levels were related to estimated creatinine clearance (CrCL), total cholesterol (TC), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

• In a study of breast carcinoma patients with 13 axillary metastatic lymph nodes, the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR were evaluated for their prognostic significance.
• The study found that patients with 15 lymph nodes removed had a significantly higher axillary recurrence rate compared to those with 6 or more lymph nodes removed (9.4% vs 0.9%).
• The most significant LNR threshold value for separating patients into low- and high-risk groups for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was 0.15, which had independent prognostic significance in Cox analysis.
• The study suggests that LNR can be used to separate n1 disease patients into low- and high-risk prognostic groups for distant metastasis development, regardless of the total number of lymph nodes removed.",1

676,"1. Non-native biological invasions have caused significant environmental and economic damage for centuries, with examples including the phylloxera in Europe and chestnut blight in North America.
2. Charles Elton's 1958 book on invasions did not spark widespread research or policy response, but an international project in the mid-1980s led by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) resulted in increased research on invasions and recognition of their global impact.
3. Research has shown that non-native invaders affect ecosystems at various levels, including population, community, and ecosystem levels, and can cause changes in nutrient cycles, fire cycles, and hydrology.
4. Molecular genetic research has revealed a high prevalence of hybridization and introgression between non-native and native species, leading to substantial evolution of native species and even the creation of new invasive species.
5. Genetic techniques have also been used to trace sources and routes of invasions, revealing that introduced populations often combine genes from multiple source populations, resulting in novel genetic combinations.
6. The ""invasional meltdown"" phenomenon has been increasingly observed, where two or more introduced species facilitate each other's establishment or enhance each other's impact on native species.
7. Lag effects, where the full-fledged widespread establishment and impact of an introduced species lag for years behind initial arrival, have also been detected more frequently.
8. Critics of invasion biology argue that the problems are overblown, that introduced species can increase native biodiversity, that antipathy toward introduced species is xenophobic, that controlling invasions is a hopeless battle, and that inhumane methods are used to combat invasive species.
9. However, the majority of introduced species have not been studied, and recent research suggests that the relative frequency of harmful impacts is far greater for non-native species compared to native species.
10. Prevention and management efforts, such as biosecurity, early detection and rapid response, eradication, and maintenance management, have been successful in some cases and are becoming increasingly ambitious, but challenges remain, particularly for terrestrial plants, insects, and aquatic organisms.",0

- Posterior transpedicular pedicle screw fixation is commonly used for managing unstable spines, often caused by trauma or burst fractures.
* Transpedicular short-segment fixation has been popularized for better correction of kyphotic deformity, greater initial stability, early painless mobilization, and indirect decompression of the spinal canal.
* The addition of pedicle screws (intermediate screws) at the fractured vertebra has been found to improve biomechanical stability and prevent screw breakage in short-segment constructs.
* A calf experimental model was used to compare the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws placed at the level of fracture.
* Biomechanical testing revealed that the addition of an intermediate screw decreased the range of motion (ROM) of the l2l4 segments in both the mps and pps groups, indicating enhanced stability.
* The study found that the addition of intermediate screws provided a smaller ROM in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion in both mps and pps groups, irrespective of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used.
* The study concluded that the addition of intermediate screws significantly increases the stability of a short-segment pedicle fixation, especially when using monoaxial screws for fixing unstable burst fractures of the lumbar region.

- A Tornwaldt's cyst can develop if the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, while crusts adhering to the orifice without obstruction can form the crust type.
- The crust type can cause an offensive smell and unpleasant taste, and may be a distinct variant of the disease that can develop at any time without recognized predisposing factors.
- The cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis has two subtypes, one with postnasal discharge and the other with fibrosed tissue.
- The crust type has a unique histologic appearance with reactive lymphoid mucosa and necrotic tissue, which presents clinically as rapid formation of crusts with shedding and postnasal drip.
- Proper endoscopic nasopharyngeal examination with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is the best method of clinical assessment.
- Nasopharyngeal bursitis should be differentiated from nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which can mimic the ulcerative nature of nasopharyngeal bursitis but usually does not form overlying crusts.

• Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (cyp2c19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting.
• Clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation: first, oxidation to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic cyp450 enzymes, and then, in the second step, thiol metabolite is generated.
• A recent study suggested a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (PON1) as the rate-limiting enzyme in the second step of clopidogrel biotransformation.
• A common polymorphism of PON1 (q192r) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the qq (aa) haplotype, and has been linked to an increased risk of stent thrombosis in patients with coronary stenting.

The definition of PR has been revised based on insulin-dose-adjusted A1C (IDAA1C) levels, which show a strong correlation with stimulated C-peptide levels. The underlying mechanisms of PR are largely unknown, but restoration of residual beta-cell mass activity in an insulin-sensitive environment is believed to play a role.

• The study found that PR occurred in 56.2% of type 1 diabetes patients, without any cases of complete remission. The absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was significantly associated with a higher frequency of PR, particularly in boys. Lower A1C levels at diagnosis were also associated with a higher chance of PR, particularly in girls. The duration of PR was significantly shorter in patients with two positive anti-GAD65 and anti-IA2 antibodies at diagnosis compared to those with only one positive antibody.

• The study found that early A1C levels may be helpful in predicting PR durations. Low A1C levels at 3 months after diagnosis were significantly associated with a higher incidence of longer PRs. Patients entering PR had higher C-peptide levels at diagnosis, and this effect was more pronounced in older patients. However, initial C-peptide levels were not significantly associated with higher chances of PR. The study also found that PR duration was shorter in patients with two positive autoantibodies compared to those with a single autoantibody, corroborating recent studies.",1

Recent evidence also shows that exercise alone reduces visceral adipose tissue and intrahepatic lipid, which are associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk.
• There is an increasing emphasis in public health messages on the importance of habitual physical activity levels and reduced sedentary time due to low participation rates in structured exercise. However, it is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits in reducing adipose tissue depots.
• Epidemiological data suggests an inverse relationship between central adiposity and self-reported physical activity levels, as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Prospective studies have further supported this association.
• A study of 82 volunteers with overweight or obesity found that physically inactive cotwins had liver fat scores 170% greater than that of their active cotwin, and habitual physical activity was the strongest correlate of central abdominal fat.
• However, self-reported behavior is subject to reporter bias and tends to overestimate activity levels. Emerging evidence using objectively measured physical activity via accelerometry supports these observations, but research using accurate assessments of VAT and IHL is limited.
• If the above epidemiological data can be confirmed by high quality objective assessments, encouraging habitual physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior will have important clinical ramifications. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate whether levels of accurately quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of VAT and IHL in adults with overweight/obesity.",1

2. A total of 53 eyes of 45 patients were seen during the study period, with the right eye being affected in 30 eyes and the left eye in 23. The severity of ocular damage was more among patients who ignited the fireworks themselves than bystanders. Five eyes had open-globe injuries, and 18 eyes underwent surgical management at the institute. The most common types of firecracker causing injury were bombs. Corneal abrasions, corneal foreign body, and hyphema were the most common anterior segment findings, while vitreous hemorrhage was the most common posterior segment finding.
3. The study found that serious ocular injuries occur due to the sudden appearance of unpredictable firecrackers before a person can deploy any defense mechanism. Fireworks-related ocular trauma can be vision-threatening and cause permanent facial disfigurement. The central pollution control board estimates that 95% of firecrackers violate noise and pollution norms. In India, laws regarding displays and celebrations involving firecrackers and those regulating bursting of firecrackers by individual members of the public are virtually absent.
4. The study concludes that immediate measures such as prohibiting the manufacture and sale of dangerous fireworks, public awareness about the possible dangers, prophylactic measures, and expert primary ophthalmic care of the injured are required to reduce this preventable cause of ocular morbidity. A combined approach of creating public awareness and strong legislation is required to regulate the manufacture, sale, and use of consumer fireworks in India.",0

- Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
- The anaerobic gram-positive bacillus C. difficile releases toxins A and B, which induce C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).
- Diagnosis of CDAD widely uses an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B released by C. difficile cells.
- However, the low detection sensitivity of EIA for the CD toxins has been reported, and there is currently no definite method of determining whether diarrhea is caused by CD toxins present at concentrations below the detection sensitivity of EIA.
- Patients with toxin-negative stool may be dismissed as non-CDAD and thus overlooked in terms of treatment and infection countermeasures.
- The present study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA and found that patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates had shorter diarrhea duration compared to patients with toxin-positive stool.
- The study also found that patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates did not receive CDAD treatment and had similar diarrhea duration as patients with both toxin-negative stool and isolates.
- The group with toxin-negative isolates may have been infected with nontoxigenic C. difficile, while the toxin concentration in the stool and intestines of the group with toxin-positive isolates but toxin-negative stool specimens was likely too low to be detected by EIA.
- Nucleic acid amplification tests are recommended to detect toxigenic C. difficile in stool for a diagnosis of CDAD; however, toxin production is not evaluated. These results may suggest a limited need for CDAD treatment for patients with gdh-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens.

- Acoustic rhinometry is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry by analyzing reflected acoustic impulses.
- The cross-sectional area of the nasal airway measured by acoustic rhinometry has a close correlation with the area found by calculations using data from rhinomanometry.
- Nasal cavity dimensions have significant associations with nasal airflow.
- Acoustic rhinometry is easy to perform and requires less cooperation from the subject compared to other methods.
- A study was conducted to evaluate the changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers for cosmetic rhinoplasty using acoustic rhinometry.
- The study found that there was a reduction in d1, an increase in mca1, a decrease in mca2, and no change in v and d2 after surgery.
- The findings suggest that adequate attention should be paid to the second constriction during surgery, which is the anterior portion of the inferior turbinate.
- Surgeons should be aware of common patterns of change in nose geometry, take care in intervening in the region of the second constriction, perform osteotomy to help patients save nasal patency, and consider placing a strut in most cases.

* Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths, and its incidence is still increasing.
* Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of CVD risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
* N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to have beneficial effects in reducing the risk of CVD, including their lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects.
* The two main types of n-3 PUFAs are omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, which differ in the location of the last double bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule.
* The human body can produce almost all fatty acids except for linoleic acid (LA, c18:2 n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, c18:3n-3), which are essential fatty acids that the body cannot synthesize.

* The biochemical pathways converting ALA to EPA and DHA are limited in humans, with only 0.28% of ALA being converted to EPA and 0.4% being converted to DHA.
* Fish is the major food source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, including EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), while ALA is a plant n-3 fatty acid mainly found in seeds, nuts, and their oils.

- Over the last two decades, new immunotherapy approaches to cancer treatment have been developed due to increased understanding of the immune system and how tumors can circumvent it.
* Many of these investigations have led to approved agents, such as infusional cytokine therapies, intravesical BCG therapy, and an active cellular therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.
* Other agents have shown benefit in large clinical trials and are expected to be approved, such as a monoclonal antibody targeting a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor for advanced melanoma.
* To be clinically approved, these treatments must demonstrate safety and positive impact on patient care and outcome.
* Some agents may be best used in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies, but this presents challenges for clinical development.
* Identifying markers of biological response, ideally associated with clinical outcome, is needed to evaluate these agents used in combination.
* For antigen-specific vaccines, it has been relatively straightforward to evaluate immune responses to the target antigen as a biomarker of immunological efficacy.
* However, there are few instances in which target antigen immune response has been associated with clinical benefit.
* Appropriate biomarkers of response have been more elusive for broadly active immune modulating agents such as anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies or TLR agonists.

- A new approach is the development of smart implants that integrate systems for bone mechanical stimulation using the converse piezoelectric effect.
- An in vivo study was conducted using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films as a substrate for MC3T3 cells, with a coating of acrylic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and Bonelike particles.
- The actuator device was composed of a microboard containing an ultra-low power 16-bit microcontroller, powered by a lithium battery, and encapsulated in PMMA.
- The actuator device was programmed to apply a 5 V square wave of 1 Hz and 3 Hz for 15 minutes at each frequency, once every 24 hours.
- The actuator device was implanted in the left hind limb of a 4-year-old merino ewe, and a control device was implanted in the right hind limb.
- Total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher compared to static controls, and the mineral apposition rate was significantly higher around actuated devices than around static devices.

- Nurses are underengaged in policy processes due to lack of awareness of policy issues and processes, inadequate knowledge and skills, and limited opportunities to contribute. This is partly attributed to gender differences in the healthcare system, with nursing being viewed as a woman's occupation and men more likely to be in positions of power and decision-making.
- Studies have emphasized that nurses can engage in policy processes directly by assuming formal leadership positions and indirectly through lobbying and advocacy with policy-makers via professional organizations. Nurses can build their understanding of and competencies in policy and politics by integrating pertinent courses in nursing training and fellowship programs.
- Nurses have not been adequately supported to generate evidence to inform policy decisions, and nurses from low- and middle-income countries have inadequate training and mentoring in research. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen LMIC nurses' research abilities to enhance their ability to understand, generate, and utilize research knowledge that is useful for policy change.

The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of all affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
2. The study found that 42.3% of patients with CAH due to 21-OHD showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, moderate right temporal lobe atrophy, globular hippocampus with unidentified internal structures, partially empty sella, and cortico-subcortical atrophy associated with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Chronic hyperandrogenism due to non-compliance with treatment may be the main mechanism involved in the genesis of brain MRI abnormalities.
3. The study also found that aldosterone deficiency could induce changes of cerebral arterial structure, leading to subclinical cerebral ischemia, which could be indirectly promoted by glucocorticoids that alter glucose and lipid metabolism and reduce platelet aggregability.

2. CE in humans typically presents with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other organs, and diagnosis is established through radiology and serology.
3. Postsurgical relapses or treatment failure can occur due to nonradical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material.
4. Previous studies have reported relapse rates of 2-25% after CE therapy.
5. Posttreatment follow-up of CE patients is necessary to detect newly growing or relapsing cysts and track previously undetected but still viable cysts.
6. Serology has been used for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies makes relapse diagnosis difficult.
7. A study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for CE serologic diagnosis and determined the diagnostic performance of western blot.
8. The study found that antigenic bands with molecular weights of 52, 24, 39, 46, 63, and 6061 kDa were specific for hydatid disease and had higher diagnostic value.
9. The western blotting technique showed a disappearance of some bands in post-operative cases and the persistence of others, making it useful for post-surgical monitoring.
10. Antibodies against proteins of 24 and 39 kDa constitute a good marker for post-surgical monitoring, as they disappear in post-operative samples of cured patients while remaining in cases with persistent cysts.",0

- Obesity is commonly assessed using parameters such as BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.
- Newer obesity indices, such as waist-to-height ratio, visceral adiposity index, and body adiposity index, have been proposed and may be helpful in assessing the risk of metabolic complications.
- A study was conducted to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
- The study included 66 patients with a mean age of 55.8±11.6 years, including 40 women and 26 men.
- Patients were divided into three groups based on their obesity level, and various body mass-related indices and lipid metabolism indices were calculated.
- The results showed that patients with class III obesity had lower mean serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C compared to patients with class I obesity.
- Negative significant correlations were found between BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, visceral adiposity index, and HDL-C.
- Positive significant correlations were found between waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, visceral adiposity index, and TG/HDL-C.
- The study suggests that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C.

* Endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been shown to affect wild animals and humans, with many chemicals altering the thyroid system in vertebrates.
* The OECD and EPA have established guidelines for investigating frog metamorphosis as a way to study thyroid toxicity, as frog tadpoles are particularly susceptible to contaminants in wastewater due to their thin, permeable skin and aquatic habitat.
* Thyroid hormones (THs) regulate frog metamorphosis, making it a useful indicator of endocrine disruption. THs are produced and secreted similarly in amphibians and mammals.
* Several processes can influence TH balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation, and inhibition of these processes can disrupt TH synthesis and secretion.
* Chemicals can interfere with TH metabolism by binding to transport proteins, inhibiting TH synthesis and secretion, reducing conversion from T4 to T3, and increasing excretion of THs into bile.
* Th sulfating activity is present in the liver cytosol of frog tadpoles and can be inhibited by chemical compounds, leading to disruption of TH metabolism.
* Amphibian metamorphosis can be divided into three stages: premetamorphosis, prometamorphosis, and climax, with each stage characterized by different morphological changes.
* Exposure to thyroid disrupting substances can affect frog metamorphosis, with reported effects including retardation or blockade of metamorphic development, increased hind limb length, and enlarged thyroid glands with follicular hyperplasia.
* The Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (AMA) has been adopted by the OECD and EPA as a guideline for testing chemicals for thyroid activity, using Xenopus laevis as a model organism.

- The major long-term morbidity is erectile dysfunction, which is caused by injury to the cavernosal nerves that run as a plexus of small nerves within a neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate.
- Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, but there is still variability due to the lack of a definite and exact anatomy of periprostatic nerve fibers.
- A study was conducted to describe periprostatic nerve distribution and construct a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution using adult male human cadavers.
- The study found that nerve fibers were distributed evenly around the prostatic capsule, except for the ventral part, which had significantly fewer nerve fibers compared to the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts.
- The average distance from the prostatic capsule to nerve fibers and the average thickness of nerve fibers did not show significant differences among the different parts of the prostate.
- The three-dimensional model of the periprostatic nerve fibers revealed an almost even distribution and nearly similar thickness of periprostatic nerve fibers on dorsal and both lateral parts, but a substantially fewer number and decreased thickness in the ventral part.
- The study found no cord-like neurovascular bundle, which contradicts traditional knowledge and has implications for improved results for nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.

The study involved 30 patients who received an AMSA nerve block on one side of the maxilla, and the anesthetic success was monitored with an electric pulp tester. The results showed that the anesthetic success rates ranged from 16.7% to 66.6%, and the duration of pulpal anesthesia gradually declined during the 60 minutes. No anesthesia of the lips and facial muscles of expression was recorded.
2. The main theoretical advantage of this AMSA nerve block is that it reduces the number of injections and the quantity of anesthetic solution administered in comparison with the conventional supraperiosteal infiltrative anesthesia. However, the study found low success rates with the use of a conventional syringe (17-66%) compared to studies using a computer-controlled system (42-86% and 35-58%). The low success rates could be due to the superiority of the computer-controlled system to inject the anesthetic solution with a controlled and continuous flow.
3. The study also found that the AMSA nerve block has some advantages, such as reducing the total amount of delivered vasoconstrictor, providing excellent hemostasis for maxillary mucogingival procedures, and not affecting the smile line in restorative dentistry. However, the main disadvantage is that palatal injections are generally considered the most painful injections. The study found that severe pain during the technique was not reported, possibly due to the prior application of topical anesthetic and the slow and controlled injection of the anesthetic solution.",0

752,"1. <summary>Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy have improved our understanding of genome organization, specifically the hierarchical folding of the chromatin into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are stable units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions. The boundaries of TADs are associated with the enrichment of certain proteins and histone marks and serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences. In human cells, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, Brg1, contributes to TAD boundary strength, and its loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and preclude the binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries.</summary>
2. <summary>Brg1 plays a role in genome architecture by regulating the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix and lipid synthesis and the differential expression of many long non-coding RNAs. ChIP-seq analysis of Brg1 demonstrated binding primarily at genic regions, with intergenic Brg1 peaks including super-enhancers. Comparison of control and Brg1 knockdown Hi-C data sets revealed that the majority of TAD boundaries were largely overlapping, but more than 10% of the TAD boundaries were unique to either the control or the Brg1 knockdown cells, providing evidence that Brg1 may contribute to the integrity of TAD boundaries.</summary>
3. <summary>Upon Brg1 knockdown, there was a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions, and the strength of the TAD boundaries was significantly reduced. TAD boundaries that were bound by Brg1 had stronger strength than the boundaries that lacked Brg1 localization. The effect of Brg1 knockdown on nucleosome occupancy around the ctcf sites supports the mechanism that the orderly positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes at TAD boundaries renders the local chromatin less flexible, preventing long-range interactions surpassing the boundary.</summary>

755,"1. The text discusses the use of Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) as a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). MPI can visualize and quantify the spatial distribution of SPIONs, providing high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios. Possible application scenarios for MPI include cardiovascular imaging and guidance of cardiovascular interventions.
2. The text also discusses the importance of suitable tracer material for MPI, specifically long-circulating SPIONs that can provide a sufficient signal within the vessels after a single tracer injection. The circulation time of SPIONs in blood is mainly determined by their overall hydrodynamic diameter, which is influenced by the size of the iron oxide core and the coatings. However, previous reports show that SPIONs with a hydrodynamic size greater than 50 nm have rapid and specific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and are cleared rapidly from the blood stream.
3. The text also compares the properties of Resovist, an approved T2\* contrast agent for MRI, as a benchmark material for MPI. While Resovist is the best performing commercial SPION for MPI, its hydrodynamic diameter is greater than 50 nm, limiting its in vivo distribution. The text also discusses the importance of understanding the pharmacokinetics of Resovist, especially its half-life in blood, in the context of cardiovascular MPI. However, because the imaging principle is fundamentally different in MPI, results from MRI cannot be easily extrapolated to MPI. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), which may differ significantly from the blood half-life in MRI.",0

* The study identified a method to isolate KCs based on whether they contain parasites or not, and found that there are genes that are normally regulated as part of the inflammatory response that are not regulated in infected cells.
* The study also identified genes and gene pathways that are commonly or uniquely regulated in infected and inflamed KCs, and found that genes involved in cell-to-cell signaling, the inflammatory response, cell death, antigen presentation, immune cell trafficking, and cell cycle are overrepresented in inflamed KCs.</summary>

3. <summary> A new formulation suggests that aspects of body composition and energy expenditure regulate hunger and appetite, based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects.
4. <summary> An alternative view stems from the study of energy balance, with the inter-relationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI). Exercise can raise resting values of EE several-fold and have numerous physiological effects, potentially influencing appetite through various mechanisms.
5. <summary> Acute bouts of exercise do not consistently increase food intake in the immediate post-exercise period or the following 24 hours, but a partial compensatory response begins to appear when exercise is repeated over several days.
6. <summary> Detailed analysis of body composition and appetite variables has demonstrated a strong correlation between fat-free mass (FFM) and meal size/daily energy intake, suggesting that privileged molecules or physiological consequences of FFM act as a signal to drive food intake.

However, it is prone to dimensional changes and inaccuracies in fit during processing.
2. <summary> Chemically activated resins have higher solubility and inferior color stability compared to heat-activated resins but display less polymerization shrinkage, leading to greater dimensional accuracy. The injection molding technique has advantages over compression molding, including reduced processing time, lower cost, and higher bond strength between denture teeth and denture base resins.
3. <summary> Debonding of denture teeth from denture bases is a common problem in prosthodontic practice, caused by factors such as the basic properties of materials, processing factors, and the available monomer during processing. Surface treatments such as grinding the glossy ground surface, painting the ground surface of teeth with monomer, and cutting mechanical retention features can increase bond strength.

- Arc welding emits intense UV radiation (UVR) that can cause acute and delayed health effects, including keratoconjunctivitis, erythema, cataracts, and skin cancer. A survey of 1667 workers at workplaces where arc welding is performed found that 86% had experienced symptoms of uv keratoconjunctivitis, and 45% reported ongoing experience with this ailment. Possible causes include workers mistakenly putting on face shields after starting the arc or being exposed to UVR by co-workers performing arc welding nearby.
- A study of the UVR hazard present during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel with a shielding gas of 80% Ar + 20% CO2 or 100% CO2 found that the UVR emitted during GMAW performed with a digital inverter-type pulsed arc welding machine was strongly influenced by the type of shielding gas and the magnitude of the welding current, as well as using pulsed vs. non-pulsed welding current. The degree of UVR hazard as a cause of acute health effects is measured by the effective irradiance, which is defined by the spectral irradiance at a wavelength, the relative spectral effectiveness at that wavelength, and the bandwidth. The study used an X13 hazard lightmeter and an XD-45-HUV UV-hazard detector head to measure the effective irradiance, and found that the detector head is well suited to measure the effective irradiance. The measurement device was calibrated by the manufacturer and used within the one-year validity of the calibration. The position of the welding torch was fixed, and the base metal was fixed on a movable table, which moved the metal for welding. The distance between the arc and the detector head was set to 500 mm, and the detector head was positioned at an angle of 40 from the surface of the base metal and at an angle of 90 from the welding direction. The measurement time was set to 40 s, and no local exhaust ventilation system was used during the measurement of UVR. The study measured the effective irradiance of the UVR emitted during three types of welding: 100% CO2 welding",0

2. Vegetation establishment is important for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing productive reuse of land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape.
3. Uncertainty in vegetation establishment comes primarily from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment, with irrigation being expensive and not more successful.
4. Natural rainfall can allow the establishment of robust native or non-native vegetation, but natives are now more recommended due to their long-term stability, resource value for wildlife, and better public acceptance.
5. Non-natives are currently less acceptable due to potential economic losses from invasions, increased wildfire risk, and other negative impacts.
6. A mixed plant community is needed to maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation, with diversity increasing resiliency to disturbance.
7. The study aims to estimate the frequency of successful establishment of native perennial warm-season grasses in southern Arizona using 31 years of historical rainfall event data.
8. The analysis assumes that native warm-season grass seeds are in the soil from 0.1 cm deep and that they germinate when exposed to suitable monsoon conditions.
9. Germinating conditions that occurred before 15 May or after 30 September were not considered, and two scenarios were evaluated for each of the rain gages: 2 days of suitable conditions resulting in germination and 3 days of suitable conditions resulting in germination.
10. The study found that the average germination date for the gage 5 2-day scenario was 20 July, and for the 3-day scenario, it was 1 August, with little difference in germination date and success among the gages and the scenarios in most years. However, in a few years, there were substantive differences among the gages and treatment germination dates.",0

3. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a challenge in mental health care and is defined as a poor response to two adequate trials of two different classes of antidepressants.
4. Researchers have proposed staging methods for TRD based on antidepressant trials, which can help in planning interventions and improving response, remission rate, and quality of life.
5. Neuromodulation therapies (NTS) are increasingly being used in the management of TRD, as they target specific brain circuits and have fewer side effects compared to psychopharmacological therapy.

3. In addition to RISC-mediated regulation at the post-transcriptional level, RNAi can also modulate gene transcription itself.
4. In fission yeast, homologs of the RNA-induced silencing complex can regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNA.
5. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing.
6. In human cells, short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon called RNA activation (RNAA), which has been conserved in other mammalian species.
7. Promoter-targeted small hairpin RNAs have been shown to efficiently upregulate genes in vivo through a mechanism involving naturally occurring antisense transcripts and Argonaute proteins.
8. The study developed a method to design sarnas for upregulation of specific cellular genes, focusing on the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating important target genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming.

- Patient blood management is becoming more important due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which also have high costs and a shortage of blood bank products. Postoperative severe bleeding is common following cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass are at increased risk of postoperative bleeding.
- RBC transfusions should not be based on a single hemoglobin (Hb) transfusion trigger, but instead should be based on the patient's risk of developing complications of inadequate oxygenation. The guidelines recommend that RBC transfusion would generally be indicated, but not mandatory, at Hb levels lower than 6.0 g/dl (3.7 mmol/l) and rarely indicated in patients with hemoglobin higher than 10.0 g/dl (6.1 mmol/l). However, the use of blood and blood products is still common in cardiac and vascular surgery. A survey found that 55.7% of European cardiac surgery patients received blood or blood products in the perioperative period.

Microglia, which were once thought to be derived from meningeal cells, are now known to originate from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and play a crucial role in the immune system of the central nervous system (CNS). They are involved in immune surveillance, inflammatory response, phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic neurons, and exerting scavenging actions on tissue debris under pathological conditions.
2. The glymphatic system, an interstitial fluid (ISF)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exchange system located in the perivascular space, facilitates immune surveillance of brain ISF along with brain microglia. This system clears interstitial solutes through the exchange of ISF and CSF along the perivascular space between the wall of the veins and astrocytic endfeet, and subsequently absorbs CSF into the meningeal lymphatic vessels.
3. Microglia are involved in synaptic pruning, which is the elimination of less active synapses to promote activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and learning. This process is dependent on regional neuronal activity and is mediated by the expression of CR3, the high-affinity receptor for C3. Microglia also play a role in synapse formation by secreting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Genetic inhibition of microglia results in derangement of both synapse formation and elimination of dendritic spines.",0
770,"1. Transposable elements (TEs) were once considered junk DNA, but they have been shown to serve as a genomic reservoir for new regulatory and coding sequences, allowing genetic innovation and organismal evolution. They can be molecularly domesticated to form new cellular protein-coding genes, and TE-encoded proteins have properties that can be of interest for host cellular pathways. For example, they can bind, copy, cut, process, and recombine nucleic acids, as well as modify and interact with host proteins.
2. There are many cases of TE-derived genes fulfilling important functions in plants, fungi, and animals, including vertebrates. In vertebrates, several multigenic families have been formed from different events of molecular domestication of the gag gene of Ty3/gypsy elements, a super family of LTR retrotransposons active in fish and amphibians but extinct in mammals. These genes encode a structural protein with three functional regions: the matrix (ma) domain playing a role in targeting cellular membranes, the capsid (ca) domain involved in interactions with other proteins during particle assembly, and the nucleocapsid (nc), which binds to viral RNA genomes through zinc fingers.
3. In mammals, most MART genes (derived from the gag gene of Ty3/gypsy elements) are found on the X chromosome, suggesting an initial event of molecular domestication on the X, followed by serial local duplication events that subsequently extended this gene family. Two autosomal MART genes, peg10 (MART2) and peg11/rtl1 (MART1), are subject to genomic imprinting and are expressed from the paternal allele. This epigenetic regulation has been proposed to be derived from a defense mechanism repressing the activity of the ancestral retrotransposon before domestication. At least two MART genes, peg11/rtl1 (MART1) and peg10 (MART2), have essential but nonredundant functions in placenta development in the mouse, and peg10 and other MART genes might also control cell proliferation and apoptosis, with possible involvement in cancer.",0

2. These diseases are able to amplify and spread from cell to cell, leading to a self-sustaining cycle that results in a loss of life expectancy and quality of life.
3. Molecular chaperones play a central role in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, but during cellular stress, the heat shock response can be triggered, leading to an imbalance in normal cellular proteostasis and the formation of protein aggregates.
4. Protein aggregates can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function, leading to the formation of intra- or extracellular protein deposits and a variety of diseases affecting the central nervous system.
5. Recent evidence suggests that other protein aggregates, in addition to the prion protein, can spread in a prion-like manner, indicating that protein aggregates propagation and amplification is a widespread phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases.
6. The toxicity of protein assemblies is due in part to their binding to and permeabilization of the cell membrane, which can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cell death. Additionally, exogenous protein assemblies can bind and penetrate cells, amplify by recruiting their endogenous soluble counterparts, and propagate to other cells, leading to the seeding of aggregation and the potential for infectious spread.",0

* Two common non-synonymous SNPs of 2AR are located at nucleotides 46 (A>G) and 79 (C>G), causing changes in amino acid residues at positions 16 (Arg>Gly) and 27 (Gln>Glu) of the amino terminus and the fourth intracellular loop.
* An enhanced agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation for the Gly16 variant of 2AR and a resistance to down-regulation for the Glu27 variant of 2AR have been observed.
* A meta-analysis of case-control studies was conducted to determine the association of 2AR with ischemic stroke.
* Three studies involving 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls were included in the meta-analysis for allelic association and 518 cases and 510 controls for genotypic association.
* The meta-analysis results did not show a significant association between Arg16Gly polymorphism of 2AR and ischemic stroke.
* However, a significant association was observed between Gln27Glu polymorphism of 2AR and ischemic stroke.
* The meta-analysis suggests that Gln27Glu polymorphism of 2AR is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
* Further well-designed larger prospective cohort studies are required to validate this finding and to establish the underlying molecular causal pathways that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke.

- Methadone, a drug used in opioid addiction treatment and pain management, has been shown to negatively impact human cognition through chronic exposure. In sh-sy5y cells, a model for investigating opioid-mediated responses in neurons, methadone induces changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) and can lead to cell death through a necrotic-like mechanism. The study aimed to investigate the mechanisms causing these alterations in [Ca]cyt.
- The research found that methadone decreased the number of cells that were able to control [Ca]cyt after an initial increase (type 4) and increased the number of cells displaying short or delayed continuous rise in [Ca]cyt (types 2 and 3). These changes in [Ca]cyt dynamics were independent of opioid receptors and were partially due to release from thapsigargin-sensitive, intracellular calcium stores. The study also suggests that mitochondria play a role in methadone-induced dcd, as inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis and blocking mitochondrial Ca^2+^ exit affected the response to methadone. Additionally, the data indicate that methadone induces dcd in sh-sy5y cells by altering the capacity of mitochondria to handle calcium, leading to distinct changes in mitochondrial morphology and potentially contributing to mitochondrial damage and cell death.",0

<summary>

• A fixed-effects meta-analysis of pooled results from 10 published reports found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

• The meta-analysis included studies published between 1999 and 2007 that reported RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and estimated risk reduction. Studies were not excluded based on quality, sample size, language, or other objective criteria. However, case reports, psychosocial or behavioral studies, commentaries, and clinical recommendations were excluded if they did not estimate risk reduction.

• Personal communications with researchers or consortia that have large series of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were undertaken to identify all reports of RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

• The meta-analysis found that RRSO was associated with an 80% reduction in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk and a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk in women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

• The analysis also found that modeling studies have demonstrated that salpingo-oophorectomy has a large effect on years of life added, particularly when adjusted for quality of life.

• A prospective study with short-term follow-up found that RRSO was associated with a 90% reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality, a 95% reduction in gynecologic cancer-specific mortality, and a 76% reduction in overall mortality.

• Despite the consistent evidence favoring RRSO in women with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, the influence of cohort effects on cancer risk over time remains unclear.

* The IL-23/IL-17 axis, a newly discovered proinflammatory signaling pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, including OLP.
* In OLP, both IL-23 and IL-17 are overexpressed, with the former being predominantly produced by keratinocytes in the epithelial layer of the lesions.
* The upregulation of IL-23 is associated with increased levels of IL-17 in the early stage of OLP lesion, promoting the pathogenic function of Th17 cells.
* The IL-23/IL-17 axis may represent a new signaling pathway in the crosstalk between keratinocytes and CD4+T cells, contributing to the immunopathogenesis of OLP.

- A definitive diagnosis of cirrhosis is made through histological findings after a liver biopsy. However, many patients undergo imaging examinations before a definitive diagnosis is established.
* Several studies have shown that morphological signs often accompany cirrhosis and can be identified on routine clinical imaging examinations.
* Different morphological signs have been described on various imaging techniques, including the transverse diameter of segment 4, caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL), the right posterior notch (RPN), right lobar atrophy, porta hepatis enlargement, and expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF).
* The C/RL ratio is a quantitative measurement that has demonstrated high specificity and accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis. The size of the caudate lobe has also been correlated with the hepatic functional reserve in cirrhotic patients.
* The RPN and EGF are simple qualitative visual signs of cirrhosis that have shown high specificity and positive predictive value for the MRI diagnosis of cirrhosis.
* A study was conducted to evaluate and compare the diagnosis performance of the C/RL, RPN, and EGF signs in diagnosing cirrhosis. The study found that there was no statistical significance difference between C/RL and RPN for the diagnosis of cirrhosis, but there were statistical significant differences between C/RL and EGF and between RPN and EGF for the diagnosis of cirrhosis.

• The study also found that 26.8% of patients whose visit was due to pain met depression criteria.

• The findings are in good correlation with the literature, though this study captures the pain intensity during the last week, not necessarily persistent pain.

• The findings are clinically important since the visual Dolotest profiles can facilitate both awareness and often otherwise difficult communication about depression and pain.

• It has been shown that suffering from both pain and depression at the same time besides the low hrqol is associated with dramatically increased health care costs compared to depression alone.

798,"• miR-200c, a member of the miR-200 family, is involved in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and has been shown to repress EMT-promoting transcription factors such as ZEB1 and ZEB2. This repression leads to the upregulation of E-cadherin and a decrease in cell migration and invasion.

• In addition to its role in EMT, miR-200c has been shown to regulate chemosensitivity to microtubule targeting agents such as paclitaxel. Specifically, increased miR-200c levels have been associated with increased chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer cells, and this is thought to be mediated by the repression of tubb3, a gene that is normally only expressed in neuronal cells but has been shown to be aberrantly expressed in several different types of cancers and to cause resistance to paclitaxel.",1
799,"1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence involves two methods: the ""inside-out"" approach described by Delorme and the ""outside-in"" approach described by de Leval. Both approaches have similar cure rates, as confirmed by a recent meta-analysis. Multiple studies have shown that both approaches are anatomically safe from a neurovascular perspective.
2. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach. The study found that the out-in tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischiopubic ramus than the in-out tapes. The in-out tapes had a mean full inner angle of 122, while the out-in tapes had a mean full inner angle of 144.
3. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory. This technique can be applied to different types of non-radio-opaque implants, allowing for a better spatial understanding of the anatomical position within the pelvis.
4. The cadaveric study found that both obturator approaches were u-shaped bands that head backwards or dorsally, and the tape is not positioned caudally but lies as a band behind the urethra. The in-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the out-in approach. The radiographic images also explained the increased risk of button-holing during an out-in procedure due to the more acute in-out mus trajectory.",0
