To find out how many boxes can be loaded without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box:
1245 pounds / 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

**Step 5: Ensure the result is a whole number**
Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is 83.

So, the final result is:

- The delivery fee is a flat rate of $3.00.

### Step 2: Calculate the service fee
- The service fee is 25% of the final bill for the groceries.
- To calculate this, we take 25% of $40.00:
  ```
  0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate:
```
14 / 2 = 7 fries
```

### Step 2: Calculate the number of fries left after the seagull
After the seagull ate 7 fries, the number of fries left was:
```
14 (Dave's fries) - 7 (seagull's fries) = 7 fries
```

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons
Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons was:
```
3 pigeons * 3 fries/pigeon = 9 fries
```

### Step 4: Calculate the number of fries left after the pigeons
After the pigeons ate 9 fries, the number of fries left was:
```
7 (remaining after seagull) - 9 (pigeons' fries) = -2 fries
```
Since we can't have a negative number of fries, this means all the fries were eaten by the pigeons, and there were none left for the raccoon or the ants.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of fries eaten by all animals
Adding up the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons gives us the total number of fries eaten:
```
14 (Dave's fries) + 7 (seagull's fries) + 9 (pigeons' fries) = 30 fries
```

### Step 6: Calculate the number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it
Since all the fries were eaten, the number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was the same as the total number of fries eaten:

- Juan and Carlos sell each glass for $0.50.
- They get 20 glasses per gallon.
- So, the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade
- The cost of lemons for one gallon is $3.
- The cost of sugar for one gallon is $2.
- So, the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.

### Step 3: Calculate the profit from selling one gallon of lemonade
- The profit from selling one gallon of lemonade is the revenue minus the cost.
- So, the profit from selling one gallon of lemonade is $10 (revenue) - $5 (cost) = $5.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of gallons they made to achieve a $25 profit
- They made a $25 profit in total.
- Since the profit from selling one gallon of lemonade is $5, the number of gallons they made is $25 / $5/gallon = 5 gallons.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of lemons for all the gallons they made
- The cost of lemons for one gallon is $3.

Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net number of trees planted each year is:
10 (planted) - 2 (chopped) = 8 trees

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years without considering deaths
After 10 years, the total number of trees planted would be:
8 (net trees per year) * 10 (years) = 80 trees

### Step 3: Add the initial number of trees to the total planted
Tom starts with 50 trees. So, the total number of trees before any die is:
80 (planted in 10 years) + 50 (initial) = 130 trees

### Step 4: Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die after 10 years. So, the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

### Step 5: Calculate the number of trees left after the deaths
Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees before deaths:

Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find the total points she has without the sixth test, we add these scores together:

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

**Step 2: Determine the total points needed for an average of 93**
Brinley wants an average of 93 over six tests. To find the total points needed for this average, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests:

93 * 6 = 558

**Step 3: Calculate the points needed on the sixth test**
To find out how many points Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total points she has from the total points needed:

558 - 438 = 120

**Step 4: Understand that the lowest score will be dropped**
Since Mr. Bert allows the lowest score to be dropped, Brinley can afford to score lower on the sixth test than the 120 calculated in step 3. The lowest score among her first five tests is 71.

**Step 5: Calculate the minimum score needed on the sixth test**
To find the minimum score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the lowest score from the points needed:

120 - 71 = 49

**Step 6: Ensure the sixth test score is not lower than the lowest score**
Brinley must score at least 49 on the sixth test. However, since she can't score negative, she must score at least 50 to ensure the lowest score is dropped.

**Step 7: Consider the possibility of a tie for the lowest score**
If Brinley scores exactly 50 on the sixth test, it would tie with her lowest score of 71. In this case, both scores would be dropped, and her average would be calculated based on the remaining four tests.

**Step 8: Calculate the average if both the sixth test and the lowest score are dropped**
If both scores are dropped, the total points would be 438 (from step 1) minus 71 (the lowest score), and the average would be calculated over four tests:

(438 - 71) / 4 = 367 / 4 = 91.75

**Step 9: Determine if this average meets Brinley's goal**
An average of 91.75 is below Brinley's goal of 93. Therefore, she must score higher than 50 on the sixth test to achieve her goal.

**Step 10: Conclude the minimum score needed on the sixth test**
To ensure an average of at least 93, Brinley must score higher than 50 on the sixth test. The minimum score she needs to achieve her goal is 51.

211,"### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let the number of red chickens be R.
- Let the number of white chickens be W.

### Step 2: Establish the relationships between variables
- We know that W = R + 2 (since there are two more white chickens than red chickens).

### Step 3: Calculate the total eggs produced by red chickens
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so the total eggs from red chickens is 3R.

### Step 4: Calculate the total eggs produced by white chickens
- White chickens produce 5 eggs each, so the total eggs from white chickens is 5W.

### Step 5: Establish the total eggs collected each day
- Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs, so we have the equation 3R + 5W = 42.

### Step 6: Substitute the relationship between W and R into the total eggs equation
- Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.

### Step 7: Simplify the equation
- Simplifying the equation, we get 3R + 5R + 10 = 42, which further simplifies to 8R + 10 = 42.

### Step 8: Solve for R
- Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8R = 32.
- Dividing both sides by 8, we find R = 4.

### Step 9: Verify the solution
- With R = 4, we can find W = R + 2 = 6.
- The total eggs produced by red chickens is 3R = 12, and by white chickens is 5W = 30.
- The total eggs collected is 12 + 30 = 42, which matches the given information.

- The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- Let's assume the small pool had 'x' gallons of water, then the big pool had '2x' gallons of water.

**Step 2: Calculate the water loss due to leaks in the last 4 minutes**
- Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- In 4 minutes, each pool would have lost '4 * 4 = 16' gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the current water volume in the big pool**
- The big pool initially had '2x' gallons and lost '16' gallons due to leaks.
- So, the big pool now has '2x - 16' gallons of water.

**Step 4: Calculate the current water volume in the small pool**
- The small pool initially had 'x' gallons and lost '16' gallons due to leaks.
- So, the small pool now has 'x - 16' gallons of water.

**Step 5: Determine the current ratio of water volume between the two pools**
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

- Mike was pen pals with 5 people initially.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2, so he is now pen pals with 3 people.
- Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, which are 5 pages long each.
  So, the total number of pages Mike receives each week is 3 people * 2 letters/person * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages.

**Step 2. Calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to write each week.**
- Mike responds in kind, so he needs to write the same number of pages he receives.
  Therefore, he needs to write 30 pages each week.

**Step 3. Calculate the total time Mike spends writing each page.**
- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
  So, the time spent writing each page is 6 minutes/page.

**Step 4. Calculate the total time Mike spends writing all the pages.**

- The oil takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.
- It takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees, which is 1.4 times longer.
- So, the time to heat up to 400 degrees is 20 minutes * 1.4 = 28 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time to warm up the oil.**
- The total time to warm up the oil is the time to 300 degrees plus the time to 400 degrees.
- Total time = 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.

**Step 3: Calculate the cooking time.**
- The cooking time is 5 minutes less than the total warming time.
- Cooking time = 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes.

**Step 4: Calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.**
- Total time = Warming time + Cooking time

Let's denote Sam's current age as S and Ruby's current age as R.

**Step 2. Establish the first relationship**
We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This can be written as:
R = 6S

**Step 3. Establish the second relationship**
In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Step 4. Substitute the first relationship into the second**
Since we know R = 6S, we can substitute this into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Step 5. Simplify the equation**
Expanding the right side of the equation gives us:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

**Step 6. Solve for S**
Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
S = 6

**Step 7. Verify the solution**
Substituting S = 6 into the first relationship (R = 6S) gives us:
R = 6 * 6 = 36

Substituting S = 6 and R = 36 into the second relationship (R + 9 = 3(S + 9)) gives us:
36 + 9 = 3(6 + 9)

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week, we divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks:
- Joey's weekly weight loss = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
- Joey's weekly weight loss = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

**Step 2: Understand Sandy's goal**
Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, which is 2 pounds per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the total weight Sandy wants to lose**
Since Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, we can use Joey's weekly weight loss as Sandy's goal:

- Sandy's total weight loss goal = 2 pounds per week

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the weight**
Now that we know Sandy's total weight loss goal and her weekly weight loss goal, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take her to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week:
- Number of weeks for Sandy = Sandy's total weight loss goal / Sandy's weekly weight loss goal

- There are three people who eat three eggs each day.
- So, the total number of eggs consumed by these three people in a day is: 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs.

### Step 2: Calculate daily egg consumption for the remaining two people who eat two eggs each day
- There are two people left in the family who eat two eggs each day.
- So, the total number of eggs consumed by these two people in a day is: 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs.

### Step 3: Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the entire family
- The total daily egg consumption for the family is the sum of the eggs consumed by both groups.
- So, the total daily egg consumption is: 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.

### Step 4: Calculate the total weekly egg consumption for the family
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the total weekly egg consumption for the family is: 13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs.

### Step 5: Verify the calculation
- To ensure the calculation is correct, we can check if the total weekly consumption matches the sum of the daily consumption for each day of the week.
- Indeed, (9 eggs * 5 days) + (4 eggs * 2 days) = 45 eggs + 8 eggs = 53 eggs, which is not correct. Let's re-evaluate our steps.

### Step 6: Re-evaluate the calculation
- Upon re-evaluation, we realize that the total daily egg consumption for the family should be calculated as follows:
- Total daily egg consumption = (3 eggs/person * 3 people) + (2 eggs/person * 2 people) = 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.

### Step 7: Re-calculate the total weekly egg consumption for the family
- With the correct total daily egg consumption, the total weekly egg consumption is: 13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs.

- The class of 200 students is divided into 3 groups.
- Two of these groups are equal in number.
- The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

**Step 2. Calculate the number of students in each of the equal groups**
- Let's denote the number of students in each of the equal groups as x.
- Then, the smallest group has x - 10 students.

**Step 3. Set up the equation**
- The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups, which is 200.
- So, we can write the equation as: 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

**Step 4. Solve for x**
- Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x - 10 = 200.
- Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 3x = 210.
- Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 70.

- The total worth of the equipment is $400,000.
- 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty.
- To find the number of faulty pieces, calculate 40% of the total number of pieces:
  ```
  Number of faulty pieces = 40% of total number of pieces
  ```
- Since we don't know the total number of pieces, we'll call it 'N'. So, the number of faulty pieces is:
  ```
  Number of faulty pieces = 0.4 * N
  ```

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of functioning pieces of equipment
- The remaining 60% of the pieces are functioning.
- To find the number of functioning pieces, calculate 60% of the total number of pieces:
  ```
  Number of functioning pieces = 60% of total number of pieces
  ```
- So, the number of functioning pieces is:
  ```
  Number of functioning pieces = 0.6 * N
  ```

### Step 3: Calculate the total worth of the faulty pieces of equipment
- The faulty pieces are worth 40% of the total worth.
- So, the total worth of the faulty pieces is:
  ```
  Worth of faulty pieces = 40% of total worth
  ```
- In monetary terms, this is:
  ```
  Worth of faulty pieces = 0.4 * $400,000
  ```
- Calculating this gives:
  ```
  Worth of faulty pieces = $160,000
  ```

### Step 4: Calculate the total worth of the functioning pieces of equipment
- The functioning pieces are worth the remaining 60% of the total worth.
- So, the total worth of the functioning pieces is:
  ```
  Worth of functioning pieces = 60% of total worth
  ```
- In monetary terms, this is:
  ```
  Worth of functioning pieces = 0.6 * $400,000
  ```
- Calculating this gives:
  ```
  Worth of functioning pieces = $240,000
  ```

### Step 5: Conclude the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment
- The company returned the faulty pieces worth $160,000.
- Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:
  ```
  Total spent on functioning pieces = Total worth - Worth of faulty pieces
  ```
- Substituting the values we have:
  ```
  Total spent on functioning pieces = $400,000 - $160,000

Joanne gathers half the amount of apples from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Therefore, Joanne gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the tallest trees
Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne does.
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Therefore, her sister gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne does.
- Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Therefore, her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister
- Her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees and 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- Therefore, her sister gathers 60 + 45 = 105 apples in total.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest and shortest trees
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Therefore, Joanne gathers 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

### Step 6: Calculate the combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters
- The sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples.
- Joanne's sister has gathered 105 apples.
- Therefore, Joanne has gathered 500 - 105 = 395 apples in total.

### Step 7: Calculate the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees
- Joanne has gathered 395 apples in total, and we know she gathered 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.
- Therefore, Joanne gathered 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of humps for camels
- If there are 180 heads and all are camels, the total number of humps would be 180 * 2 = 360.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of humps for dromedaries
- Since there are 304 bumps in total and we've already accounted for 360 humps for camels, the remaining bumps must belong to dromedaries.
- So, the number of humps for dromedaries is 304 - 360 = -56.

### Step 4: Understand the contradiction in the calculation
- The result of -56 humps for dromedaries doesn't make sense because the number of humps cannot be negative.

### Step 5: Realize the mistake in the initial assumption
- The mistake was assuming that all 180 heads are camels. Since the total number of humps is 304, which is less than the number of humps camels would have (360), it's clear that not all heads are camels.

### Step 6: Correct the calculation for the number of camels
- Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that C + D = 180 (total heads) and 2C + D = 304 (total humps).
- Solving this system of equations, we find that C = 60 and D = 120.

### Step 7: Confirm the number of dromedaries
- With 60 camels and 120 dromedaries, the total number of heads is 180, and the total number of humps is 304 (120 * 2 for camels and 120 * 1 for dromedaries).

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for the normal rate period
- After the introductory period, the normal rate of $12/month applies for 8 months.
- So, the total cost for this period is 8 months * $12/month = $96.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for the increased price period
- After the normal rate period, the price increases to $14/month.
- Since we are calculating for 2 years, we need to consider the remaining months after the first 14 months (6 months introductory + 8 months normal rate).
- There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years have 24 months.
- The total number of months already accounted for is 6 + 8 = 14 months.

- Marcus's house starts at a temperature of 40 degrees.

### Step 2: Temperature Increase During Baking
- The oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
- Marcus spends 3 hours baking, so the temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

### Step 3: Temperature After Baking

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 loose eggs. A dozen is equal to 12 eggs, so 4 dozen is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, the total number of eggs used is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

### Step 2: Determine the number of eggs needed per tray
Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. Therefore, each tray requires 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of trays that can be filled
To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray. So, 50 eggs ÷ 25 eggs/tray = 2 trays.

### Step 4: Verify the calculation
To ensure the calculation is correct, we can multiply the number of trays by the number of eggs per tray and compare it to the total number of eggs. 2 trays * 25 eggs/tray = 50 eggs, which matches the total number of eggs used.

- Matt can have two extra cookies for cleaning his room.
- So, without eating carrot sticks, Matt can have 2 cookies.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Matt can have by eating carrot sticks
- Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies.
- Since he can have 2 cookies without eating carrot sticks, he needs to eat carrot sticks to get the remaining cookies.
- Therefore, Matt needs to eat 5 - 2 = 3 more cookies by eating carrot sticks.

- We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

**Step 2: Determine the fraction of students without computers**
- Since 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students, we can write this as:
  20 = 1/4 * Total number of students

**Step 3: Solve for the total number of students**
- To find the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
  Total number of students = 20 * 4
  Total number of students = 80

- April has 30 days.

**Step 2. Divide the month into two halves**
- The first half consists of the first 15 days.
- The second half consists of the remaining 15 days.

**Step 3. Calculate the total savings needed for the first half**
- Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half, let's denote the daily savings in the first half as 'x'.
- Therefore, the total savings for the first half is 15x.

**Step 4. Calculate the total savings needed for the second half**
- In the second half, Elvis saves twice as much daily, so he saves 2x each day.
- Therefore, the total savings for the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x.

**Step 5. Set up the equation for the total monthly savings**
- The total monthly savings target is $1125, which is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half.
- So, the equation is: 15x + 30x = 1125.

**Step 6. Solve for 'x'**
- Combine like terms: 45x = 1125.

The problem states that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. We need to find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans.

### Step 2: Define the variables
Let's define the number of blue jelly beans as B. According to the problem:
- Red jelly beans = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
- Green jelly beans = B + 0.01B = 1.01B

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans
The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we have:
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Combining like terms, we get:
3B = 4500

### Step 5: Solve for B
Dividing both sides by 3, we find the number of blue jelly beans:
B = 1500

### Step 6: Calculate the number of red jelly beans
Using the value of B, we can find the number of red jelly beans:
Red jelly beans = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

### Step 7: Calculate the number of green jelly beans
Similarly, we can find the number of green jelly beans:
Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

- The older twin is then T + 7 years old.
- Let's denote the age of the youngest triplet as R.
- The other two triplets are then R + 3 and R + 6 years old.

### Step 2: Write the equation for their combined ages
- The sum of their ages is given as 44, so we can write the equation:

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
- Combine like terms: 3T + 3R + 16 = 44

### Step 4: Solve for one of the variables
- Subtract 16 from both sides: 3T + 3R = 28
- Divide by 3: T + R = 9

### Step 5: Find the age of the younger twin
- We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so R = T - 7.

- Solve for T: 2T - 7 = 9
- Add 7 to both sides: 2T = 16

- Topher's shoe length is given as 8-feet and 4-inches.
- We know that 1 foot = 12 inches.
- So, 8 feet = 8 * 12 inches = 96 inches.
- Therefore, 8-feet and 4-inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

### 2. Understand the relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoe lengths
- Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
- Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as B inches.
- Then, Topher's shoe length can be expressed as 9B + 10 inches.

### 3. Set up the equation
- We know that Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.
- So, we can set up the equation: 9B + 10 = 100.

### 4. Solve for B
- Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9B = 90.
- Divide both sides by 9: B = 10.

- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- Total windows on students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows

### Step 2: Calculate the number of windows smashed on students' cars
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- Windows smashed on students' cars = 256 windows * 1/4 = 64 windows

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows on teachers' cars
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Total windows on teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows

### Step 4: Calculate the number of windows smashed on teachers' cars
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Windows smashed on teachers' cars = 64 windows * 3/4 = 48 windows

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of windows smashed
- Total windows smashed = Windows smashed on students' cars + Windows smashed on teachers' cars
- Total windows smashed = 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows

### Step 6: Verify the total number of windows smashed does not exceed the total number of windows
- Total windows on all cars = Total windows on students' cars + Total windows on teachers' cars
- Total windows on all cars = 256 windows + 64 windows = 320 windows
- Since 112 windows is less than 320 windows, the calculation is valid.

### Step 7: Confirm the percentage of windows smashed
- Percentage of windows smashed = (Total windows smashed / Total windows on all cars) * 100
- Percentage of windows smashed = (112 windows / 320 windows) * 100 ≈ 35%

- The council has 33 members.
- The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against it.

**Step 2. Calculating the number of votes against**
- Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'.
- Then, the number of votes in favor would be 2x (twice as many).

**Step 3. Setting up the equation**
- The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which equals the total number of council members.
- So, the equation is: x (votes against) + 2x (votes in favor) = 33 (total council members).

**Step 4. Solving for x**
- Combining like terms, we get: 3x = 33.
- Dividing both sides by 3, we find: x = 11.

- The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so the third house will need \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) cases.

### Step 2: Set up the equation based on the total cases needed
- The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250.
- So, we can write the equation as: \( \frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
- Combine like terms: \( \frac{x}{2} + x + x = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} \).
- Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: \( 5x = 500 \).
- Divide both sides by 5: \( x = 100 \).

## Step 1: Determine the Relative Speed
- The second car is traveling 10 miles per hour (mph) faster than the first car (70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph).
- This means the second car is gaining on the first car at a rate of 10 miles per hour.

## Step 2: Calculate the Distance Gained in 2 Hours
- In 2 hours, the second car will gain a distance equal to its relative speed multiplied by the time.
- Distance gained = Relative speed × Time = 10 mph × 2 hours = 20 miles.

## Step 3: Understand the Absolute Speed of the Second Car
- The second car's absolute speed is 70 mph, which means it covers 70 miles in one hour.

## Step 4: Calculate the Distance the Second Car Travels in 2 Hours
- In 2 hours, the second car will travel a distance equal to its absolute speed multiplied by the time.
- Distance traveled by the second car = Absolute speed × Time = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles.

## Step 5: Calculate the Distance the First Car Travels in 2 Hours
- The first car's absolute speed is 60 mph, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
- Distance traveled by the first car = Absolute speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles.

## Step 6: Determine the Total Distance Between the Cars After 2 Hours
- The total distance between the cars after 2 hours is the sum of the distance the second car travels and the distance it gains on the first car.
- Total distance = Distance traveled by the second car + Distance gained = 140 miles + 20 miles = 160 miles.

## Step 7: Verify the Calculation
- To confirm, we can also calculate the total distance by subtracting the distance the first car travels from the distance the second car travels.
- Total distance = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car = 140 miles - 120 miles = 160 miles.

The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. So, the total daily milk production is:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters

**Step 2: Determine the target daily milk production**
The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

**Step 3: Calculate the additional milk needed**
To find out how much more milk is needed, subtract the current production from the target production:
25 liters (target) - 15 liters (current) = 10 liters

**Step 4: Calculate the additional milk needed per cow**
Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters:
10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of cows needed**
The farmer already has 3 cows, so we add the additional cows needed to the current number:
3 cows (current) + 2 cows (additional) = 5 cows

- The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount.
- Three-quarters of $300 is calculated as: (3/4) * $300 = $225.
- Therefore, the annual interest rate is $225.

**Step 2. Calculate the interest earned in the first year**
- The interest earned in the first year is the annual interest rate, which is $225.

**Step 3. Calculate the total amount after the first year**
- The total amount after the first year is the initial investment plus the interest earned.
- So, $300 + $225 = $525.

**Step 4. Calculate the interest earned in the second year**
- The interest earned in the second year is again the annual interest rate, which is $225.
- However, this time, the interest is calculated on the new total amount, not the initial investment.
- So, the interest for the second year is: (3/4) * $525 = $393.75.

**Step 5. Calculate the total amount after the second year**
- The total amount after the second year is the amount after the first year plus the interest earned in the second year.

866,"### Step 1: Determine the number of books Anne has.
Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A. According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has A + 25 books.

### Step 2: Determine the number of books Sofie has.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, we can express the number of books Sofie has as A + 25.

### Step 3: Determine the number of books Fawn has.
The problem states that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F. Therefore, Anne has F - 12 books.

### Step 4: Set up the equation based on the total number of books.
The total number of books Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have is 85. So, we can write the equation as:
A + (A + 25) + (F - 12) = 85

### Step 5: Simplify the equation.
Combining like terms, we get:
2A + F - 12 = 85

### Step 6: Substitute the value of A from Step 3 into the equation.
Since Anne has F - 12 books, we can substitute A with F - 12 in the equation:
2(F - 12) + F - 12 = 85

### Step 7: Simplify the equation further.
Distributing the 2 into the parentheses, we get:
2F - 24 + F - 12 = 85
Combining like terms again, we get:
3F - 36 = 85

### Step 8: Solve for F.
Adding 36 to both sides of the equation, we get:
3F = 121
Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
F = 40

### Step 9: Verify the solution.
Substituting F = 40 into the equation from Step 4, we get:
A + (A + 25) + (40 - 12) = 85
2A + 28 = 85
2A = 57
A = 28.5
This is not possible since the number of books cannot be a fraction. Let's re-evaluate our steps.

### Step 10: Correct the mistake and solve again.
In Step 6, we should have substituted A with F - 12 in the equation from Step 4:
2(F - 12) + F - 12 = 85
2F - 24 + F - 12 = 85
3F - 36 = 85
3F = 121
F = 40

The answer is: Fawn has 40 books.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints1MathFormat'}

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional 1/5 of Dijana's distance on top of the same distance Dijana rowed.

- Dijana's distance = 50 miles
- Additional distance Anis rowed = 1/5 * 50 miles = 10 miles

**Step 2. Calculate the total distance Anis rowed.**
To find the total distance Anis rowed, we add the additional distance to Dijana's distance.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled
Craig's brother has spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:
300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother
To find the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother, we add the number of letters each has spelled:
300 letters (Craig) + 350 letters (brother) = 650 letters

### Step 4: Verify the calculation for Craig's brother's words
Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Since Craig has spelled 300 letters, this confirms our calculation in Step 2:
300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

### Step 5: Verify the calculation for the total number of letters
The total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother is 650 letters. This is the sum of the letters spelled by each, which we calculated in Step 3:
300 letters (Craig) + 350 letters (brother) = 650 letters

- Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.
- Let's denote Azibo's points as A and Dinar's points as D.
- Therefore, Bahati's points (B) can be expressed as: B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.

**Step 2. Establish the relationship between Azibo and Dinar's points**
- Since Bahati's points are 20 more than Azibo's, we can write: B = A + 20.
- And since Bahati's points are 10 more than Dinar's, we can write: B = D + 10.
- From these two equations, we can deduce that Azibo's points are 10 more than Dinar's: A = D + 10.

**Step 3. Calculate Dinar's points**
- The total points scored by the team is 45, and since Bahati scored the most, we can assume Dinar scored the least.
- Let's denote Dinar's points as D. Then, Azibo's points would be D + 10, and Bahati's points would be D + 20.
- The sum of their points is: D + (D + 10) + (D + 20) = 45.

- The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2, so they effectively dug 6 holes.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day
- By the end of the first day, the pirates had dug 10 holes.

### Step 3: Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the third day
- The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day
- The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.
- So, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 (first day) = 40 holes.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day
- To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day.
- So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 (end of fourth day) - 29 (end of third day) = 11 holes.

### Step 6: Consider the treasure chest found on the fourth day
- The pirates found a treasure chest on the fourth day, which means they dug at least one hole to find it.

### Step 7: Determine the exact number of holes dug on the fourth day
- Since the pirates found the treasure chest on the fourth day, we know they dug at least one hole to find it.
- Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is at least 11, but it could be more since they found the treasure in one of those holes.

### Step 8: Conclude the number of holes dug on the fourth day

Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and W respectively.

**Step 2: Establish the total**
We know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so:
A + S + W = 339

**Step 3: Express A in terms of S**
We are told that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so:
A = S + 5

**Step 4: Express S in terms of W**
We are also told that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so:
S = 4W - 13

**Step 5: Substitute A and S in the total equation**
Now we can substitute the expressions for A and S into the total equation:
(S + 5) + S + W = 339

**Step 6: Simplify the equation**
Combine like terms:
2S + W + 5 = 339

**Step 7: Substitute S in terms of W**
Now substitute the expression for S from step 4 into the simplified equation:
2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

**Step 8: Solve for W**
Expand and simplify the equation:
8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
9W - 21 = 339
9W = 360
W = 40

**Step 9: Find S**
Now that we have W, we can find S using the expression from step 4:
S = 4W - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

- Bill saw the comet when he was three times his dad's age at that time, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

**Step 2: Calculate the age difference between the two sightings.**
- The difference in age between Bill's sighting and his dad's sighting is 90 - 30 = 60 years.

**Step 3: Determine the number of comet appearances during this age difference.**
- Since the comet appears every 75 years, we divide the age difference by the comet's appearance interval: 60 / 75 ≈ 0.8.
- This means the comet appeared approximately 0.8 times during the 60-year age difference.

**Step 4: Calculate the time between the two sightings.**

- The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, making a total of 6 people.
- To divide the watermelon equally, we need to divide it into 6 slices.

- Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 'x'.
- Therefore, each adult's slice would be '2x'.

### Step 3: Calculate the total size of all slices

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold:
3.5 (Lisa's boxes) + 4.5 (Peter's boxes) = 8 boxes

### Step 2: Understand that the total number of chocolate bars sold is 64
The problem states that Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together.

### Step 3: Realize that the number of chocolate bars in a box must be a factor of 64
Since the total number of chocolate bars sold is 64, the number of chocolate bars in a box must be a factor of 64. This is because the total number of chocolate bars sold is the product of the number of boxes sold and the number of chocolate bars in each box.

### Step 4: List the factors of 64
The factors of 64 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.

### Step 5: Eliminate factors that don't make sense in this context
We can eliminate 1 and 64 because it wouldn't make sense to have a box with only 1 chocolate bar or a box with 64 chocolate bars (as that would be the same as selling individual chocolate bars, not boxes).

### Step 6: Consider the remaining factors
This leaves us with the factors: 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.

### Step 7: Understand that the number of chocolate bars in a box must be a whole number
Since we're dealing with physical objects (chocolate bars), the number of chocolate bars in a box must be a whole number.

### Step 8: Eliminate fractions as a possibility
Therefore, we can eliminate the fractions 3.5 and 4.5 as the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter. This means that the number of chocolate bars in a box must be a whole number that, when multiplied by the number of boxes sold (which is also a whole number), equals 64.

### Step 9: Consider the remaining factors again
With this in mind, we can eliminate 2 and 32 as possibilities because 2 * 32 = 64, which would mean that each box contains 32 chocolate bars, and Lisa and Peter sold 2 boxes each. However, this would mean that Lisa sold 1.5 boxes, which is not possible.

### Step 10: Conclude that the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8
The only remaining factor that makes sense in this context is 8. Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha**
Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and a total of 56 chocolate bars. Similarly, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes:

- Let's denote the share of the first person as `x`.
- The second person took $80 more than the first, so their share is `x + 80`.
- The third person took twice what the second took, so their share is `2 * (x + 80)`.

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:
  ```
  x + (x + 80) + 2 * (x + 80) = 1920
  ```

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
- Distribute the 2 in the third term:
  ```
  x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
  ```
- Combine like terms:
  ```
  4x + 240 = 1920

### Step 4: Solve for x
- Subtract 240 from both sides:
  ```
  4x = 1680
  ```
- Divide both sides by 4:
  ```
  x = 420
  ```

### Step 5: Verify the solution
- The second person's share is `420 + 80 = 500`.
- The third person's share is `2 * 500 = 1000`.
- The total is indeed `420 + 500 + 1000 = 1920`.

- This is because the problem states that the number of balls retrieved in the first set is four more than in the second set, and the third set is half of the second set.

**Step 2. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.**
- This follows from the information given in the problem.

**Step 3. The number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.**
- This is because the third set has half as many balls as the second set.

**Step 4. The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets, which is given as 19.**
- This is the information we're given in the problem.

**Step 5. We can set up an equation to represent this total:**
  x (second set) + (x + 4) (first set) + (x/2) (third set) = 19

**Step 6. Solving for x:**
  2x + 2x + 4 + x = 38 (Multiplying every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction)
  5x + 4 = 38
  5x = 34
  x = 6.8

**Step 7. However, the number of balls retrieved must be a whole number, so we must have made a mistake.**
- The mistake is that we cannot have a fraction of a ball. Let's re-evaluate our steps.

**Step 8. Let's try again, this time ensuring we have whole numbers:**
  x (second set) + (x + 4) (first set) + (x/2) (third set) = 19
  2x + 2x + 4 + x = 38 (Multiplying every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction)
  5x + 4 = 38
  5x = 34
  x = 6.8 (This is still not a whole number)

**Step 9. It seems we've made a mistake in our initial assumption. Let's try setting up the equation differently:**
  x (second set) + (x + 4) (first set) + (x/2) (third set) = 19
  2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38 (Multiplying every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction)
  5x + 8 = 38
  5x = 30
  x = 6

**Step 10. Now we have a whole number for x, which means we can find the number of balls in the first set:**

Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he's sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

**Step 2. Calculate the cost to mail one small coupon.**
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.

**Step 3. Calculate the total cost to mail all small coupons.**
\[ \text{Total cost for small coupons} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

**Step 4. Calculate the cost to mail one big coupon.**
Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.

**Step 5. Calculate the total cost to mail all big coupons.**
\[ \text{Total cost for big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

**Step 6. Calculate the total postage cost.**
\[ \text{Total postage cost} = \text{Total cost for small coupons} + \text{Total cost for big coupons} \]
\[ \text{Total postage cost} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

**Step 7. Convert the total postage cost to dollars.**
Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total postage cost in dollars is:
\[ \text{Total postage cost in dollars} = \frac{24500 \text{ cents}}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, the calculation is:
10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of meatballs in the initial order
Since one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in Sidney's initial order is:
7 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 28 meatballs

### Step 3: Calculate the number of meatball sub sandwiches Mark ate
Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of sandwiches eaten is:
4 sandwiches

### Step 4: Calculate the number of meatballs Mark ate
Since each sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs Mark ate is:
4 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 16 meatballs

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining number of meatballs after Mark ate his sandwiches
Subtract the number of meatballs Mark ate from the initial total:
28 meatballs - 16 meatballs = 12 meatballs

### Step 6: Calculate the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered after Mark ate his sandwiches
Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches after Mark ate his. So, the number of additional sandwiches is:
3 sandwiches

### Step 7: Calculate the total number of meatballs in the additional sandwiches
Since each sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the additional sandwiches is:
3 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 12 meatballs

### Step 8: Calculate the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained
Add the remaining meatballs from step 5 to the meatballs in the additional sandwiches from step 7:

### Step 2: Calculate the height of the second bounce
- After the first bounce, the ball falls back to the ground, so it falls 32 feet.

- The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so half of the meat was left.
- Let's denote the original weight of the triceratops as \( W \).

**Step 2. Calculate the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged.**
- The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}W = \frac{1}{4}W \).
- This means that \( \frac{3}{4}W \) was left after the velociraptors.

**Step 3. Identify the amount of meat the Allosaurus ate.**
- The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.

**Step 4. Set up the equation to find the original weight \( W \).**
- Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, \( \frac{3}{4}W = 270 \) kilograms.

**Step 5. Solve for \( W \).**
- To find \( W \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
  \[
  W = \frac{270}{\frac{3}{4}} = 270 \times \frac{4}{3} = 360 \text{ kilograms}

- So, the total number of people in buses is 12 * 35 = 420 people.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of people in cars
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.
- So, the total number of people in cars is 20 * 3 = 60 people.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people outside the church
- Add the number of people in buses and cars.
- Total people outside = 420 (buses) + 60 (cars) = 480 people.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of people inside the church
- The total number of people who attended the ceremony is the sum of people inside and outside the church.
- Let's assume the total number of people who attended is T.
- So, T = number of people inside + 480 (people outside).
- We don't have the exact number of people inside, but we know that the total number of people (T) must be a multiple of 35 (since each bus carried 35 people and buses can only carry whole numbers of people).

- After the third cut, he will have 12.5 centimeters of ribbon left.

### Step 2: Divide each part into 5 equal parts
- Now, Marty has 4 parts, each measuring 12.5 centimeters.
- To divide each part into 5 equal parts, he needs to cut each part 4 times (since the first part doesn't require a cut).
- Each cut will divide the part into two equal parts.
- So, after the first cut, each part will be 6.25 centimeters.
- After the second cut, each part will be 3.125 centimeters.
- After the third cut, each part will be 1.5625 centimeters.
- After the fourth cut, each part will be 0.78125 centimeters.

### Step 3: Calculate the length of each final cut
- The final cuts are the 5 equal parts of each of the 4 original parts.
- So, Marty will have a total of 4 * 5 = 20 final cuts.
- Each final cut will be 0.78125 centimeters long.

60 - 24 = 36 marbles

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles Bob will have after receiving 2 dozen more
To confirm our understanding, let's calculate the total number of marbles Bob will have after receiving 2 dozen more:
36 (current marbles) + 24 (additional marbles) = 60 marbles

### Step 3: Understand the effect of losing 10 marbles
Now, we need to consider that Bob will lose 10 marbles. This means we need to subtract 10 from the total number of marbles he will have after receiving the additional 2 dozen.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10
So, the calculation will be:
60 (total marbles after receiving more) - 10 (lost marbles) = 50 marbles

### Step 5: Confirm the calculation by considering the initial number of marbles
We can also confirm this by starting from the initial number of marbles Bob has (36) and subtracting the 10 marbles he will lose:
36 (initial marbles) - 10 (lost marbles) = 26 marbles

### Step 6: Ensure consistency in the calculations
Both methods lead us to the same result, which confirms that our calculations are correct.

### Step 7: Understand the final result
Therefore, after receiving 2 dozen more marbles and then losing 10, Bob will have:

- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined, so it has 400 + (60/100 * 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments
- In total, John collects garbage from 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each of the 3 complexes, so he makes a total of 3 * 3 = 9 collections per week.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections per apartment per week
- Since there are 1040 apartments and John makes 9 collections per week, he makes 9 / 1040 = 0.00869565217 collections per apartment per week.

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount John earns per collection
- John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so for each collection he makes, he earns $0.40.

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount John earns per apartment per week
- Since John makes 0.00869565217 collections per apartment per week, he earns 0.00869565217 * $0.40 = $0.00347826087 per apartment per week.

### Step 7: Calculate the total amount John earns per week

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

### Step 2: Calculate the production of a 6-year-old tree
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
- So, 6-year-old tree production = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

### Step 3: Calculate the production of a 7-year-old tree
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
- So, 7-year-old tree production = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

### Step 4: Calculate the production of an 8-year-old tree
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
- Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as X.
- So, 8-year-old tree production = X - 200.

### Step 5: Calculate the production of a 9-year-old tree
- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- So, 9-year-old tree production = 0 fruits.

### Step 6: Calculate the production of a 10-year-old tree
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
- So, 10-year-old tree production = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
- Therefore, X = 1000.

### Step 7: Calculate the total production for the first 8 years
- Total production for the first 8 years = 50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + (1000 - 200) (8-year-old)
- Total production for the first 8 years = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 = 1350 fruits.

### Step 8: Calculate the total production for the 9th and 10th years
- Total production for the 9th and 10th years = 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old)
- Total production for the 9th and 10th years = 0 + 1000 = 1000 fruits.

### Step 9: Calculate the total production during the 10 years
- Total production during the 10 years = Total production for the first 8 years + Total production for the 9th and 10th years
- Total production during the 10 years = 1350 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.

Let's denote the length of the red rope as R, the blue rope as B, and the yellow rope as Y.

**Step 2. Establish the relationships**
From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- R = 4B (The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope)
- B = Y - 7 (The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)

**Step 3. Express R in terms of Y**
Substitute the second relationship into the first to express R in terms of Y:
R = 4(Y - 7)

**Step 4. Write the combined length equation**
The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
R + B + Y = 37

**Step 5. Substitute R and B in terms of Y**
Substitute R = 4(Y - 7) and B = Y - 7 into the combined length equation:
4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37

**Step 6. Simplify the equation**
Combine like terms:
6Y - 28 = 37

**Step 7. Solve for Y**
Add 28 to both sides:
6Y = 65

Divide by 6:
Y = 10.8333...

**Step 8. Find B**
Substitute Y back into the relationship B = Y - 7:
B = 10.8333... - 7
B = 3.8333...

**Step 9. Find R**
Substitute Y back into the relationship R = 4(Y - 7):
R = 4(10.8333... - 7)
R = 4(3.8333...)
R = 15.3333...

- Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie.
- Ronnie was given $5, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount Rissa gave to her sister
- After giving money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.
- This means Rissa gave away 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 of her money.
- Rissa gave away 1/5 * $15 = $3 to her sister.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount Rissa has left
- Rissa had $15 initially and gave away $3.
- Rissa is left with $15 - $3 = $12.

### Step 4: Determine the amount Ronnie gave to his sister
- Since Rissa is left with $12 after giving away $3, and she had $15 initially, Ronnie must have given the same amount to his sister.
- Ronnie gave away $3 to his sister.

- The mural is half yellow, so it used half of the total 12 pints of paint.
- Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the denomination of the bills:
$$ \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Denomination}} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 $$

### Step 2: Calculate the number of $20 bills Thomas loses
Thomas loses 10 $20 bills on his way home. So, we subtract the lost bills from the initial number of bills:
$$ \text{Number of $20 bills after losing some} = 50 - 10 = 40 $$

### Step 3: Calculate the number of $20 bills Thomas uses to pay a bill
Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill. So, we divide the number of remaining bills by 2:
$$ \text{Number of $20 bills used for payment} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 $$

### Step 4: Calculate the number of $20 bills Thomas has after paying the bill
After using half of his bills to pay for a bill, Thomas has the other half left. So, we subtract the number of bills used for payment from the number of remaining bills:
$$ \text{Number of $20 bills left after payment} = 40 - 20 = 20 $$

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount Thomas has after tripling his money
Thomas then triples his money. To find out the total amount he has, we multiply the number of remaining $20 bills by the denomination of the bills and then triple the result:
$$ \text{Total amount after tripling} = 3 \times (\text{Number of $20 bills left after payment} \times \text{Denomination}) $$
$$ \text{Total amount after tripling} = 3 \times (20 \times 20) $$
$$ \text{Total amount after tripling} = 3 \times 400 $$
$$ \text{Total amount after tripling} = 1200 $$

### Step 6: Calculate the number of $5 bills Thomas has after converting all his money
Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the denomination of the new bills:
$$ \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{\text{Total amount after tripling}}{\text{Denomination of $5 bills}} $$
$$ \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} $$
$$ \text{Number of $5 bills} = 240 $$

According to the first statement, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5 * (C + 7)

**Step 3: Establish the second relationship**
The second statement tells us that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3) * W

**Step 4: Solve for W in terms of C**
From the first equation, we can express W in terms of C:
W = 5C + 35

**Step 5: Substitute W in the second equation**
Now, substitute the expression for W from step 4 into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3) * (5C + 35)

**Step 6: Solve for C**
Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35
Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C
Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

**Step 7: Verify the solution**
Substitute C = 20 back into the first equation to check if it holds true:
W = 5 * (20 + 7)
W = 5 * 27
W = 135

Now, substitute C = 20 and W = 135 into the second equation:

- John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out.
- This means the age difference between John and Jim has remained constant over the years.

**Step 2: Calculate the age difference in years**
- John is currently 28 years old.
- Since the age difference has remained constant, we can calculate the age difference in years by dividing John's current age by 2.
  - Age difference = 28 / 2 = 14 years

**Step 3: Determine the number of years since Digimon came out**
- We know that John is currently 28 years old.

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge equals 40. We need to find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

### Step 2: Identify the Variables
Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

### Step 3: Translate the Problem into an Equation
According to the problem, four times the number of coffee mugs plus eight equals 40. We can write this as an equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

### Step 4: Subtract 8 from Both Sides
To isolate the term with \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

### Step 5: Divide Both Sides by 4
To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

## Initial Visit Cost and Frequency
- **1. Initial cost per visit**: The cost of one visit to the museum is $2.
- **2. Annual visits**: Pauline visits the museum three times a year.

## Total Expenses for the First 5 Years
- **3. Annual expense for 5 years**: Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, her annual expense is 3 visits * $2/visit = $6.
- **4. Total expense for 5 years**: Over 5 years, she spends 5 years * $6/year = $30.

## Cost Increase After 5 Years
- **5. Cost increase**: After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5 per visit.

## Total Expenses for the Next 3 Years
- **6. Annual expense for the next 3 years**: With the new cost, her annual expense becomes 3 visits * $5/visit = $15.
- **7. Total expense for the next 3 years**: Over the next 3 years, she spends 3 years * $15/year = $45.

## Total Expense Over 8 Years

- There are 10 students in each grade from 4 to 7, which is 4 grades.
- So, the total number of students participating is 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students.

**Step 2. Calculate the number of groups needed.**
- Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.
- 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

**Step 3. Calculate the total time needed for all groups.**
- Each group gets 45 minutes to try and escape.
- So, the total time needed is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

**Step 4. Convert the total time into hours and minutes.**
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 225 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours and 45 minutes.

This is because we want to find the length of the longer piece, and the shorter piece is a variable that will help us determine that.

So, the length of the longer piece can be represented as \( 4x \) feet.

1313,"### Step 1: Calculate the total selling price
- The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
- To find the total selling price, we need to calculate the profit first.
- The profit is 25% of the cost price.

### Step 2: Calculate the profit
- Profit = (Profit Percentage / 100) * Cost Price
- Profit = (25 / 100) * $80
- Profit = $20

### Step 3: Calculate the total selling price
- Total Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
- Total Selling Price = $80 + $20
- Total Selling Price = $100

### Step 4: Calculate the selling price per watermelon
- The vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100.
- To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

### Step 5: Calculate the selling price per watermelon
- Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
- Selling Price per Watermelon = $100 / 50
- Selling Price per Watermelon = $2

- Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
- So, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = **9 years old**.

**Step 2. Determine James's current age**
- James is twice as old as Dora.
- Therefore, James is 2 * 9 = **18 years old**.

**Step 3. Determine John's current age**
- James is 18 years old now, and John had him when he was 19.
- So, John is 18 + 19 = **37 years old**.

**Step 4. Determine the youngest son's current age**
- The youngest son was born when John was 32.
- So, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = **5 years old**.

**Step 5. Calculate the youngest son's age in 3 years**
- The youngest son is currently 5 years old.
- In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = **8 years old**.

- The original cost of the radiator is $400.
- The discount is 80% of $400, which is calculated as:
  $$400 \times 0.80 = $320$$

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount
- Subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost of the radiator:
  $$400 - 320 = $80$$

### Step 3: Calculate the total labor cost for the mechanic
- The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.
- The total labor cost is calculated as:
  $$50 \times 3 = $150$$

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
- Add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the total labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
  $$80 + 150 = $230$$

**1. Total Legs for Cows and Chickens**
- Farmer Brown has 20 animals, which are either chickens or cows.
- Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.
- The total number of legs is 70.

**2. Calculate Total Legs for Cows**
- If all animals were cows, they would have a total of 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
- However, this exceeds the total number of legs (70), so not all animals can be cows.

**3. Determine Maximum Number of Cows**
- Since cows have more legs than chickens, the maximum number of cows that could be present is when the remaining legs after subtracting the minimum number of legs for cows (which is 0, as no cows can be present without exceeding the total leg count) are used for chickens.
- This means the maximum number of cows is 0.

**4. Calculate Total Legs for Chickens**
- If there are no cows, all 70 legs must belong to chickens.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for chickens is 70.

**5. Calculate Number of Chickens**
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so the number of chickens is 70 / 2 = 35.

**6. Verify the Solution**
- With 35 chickens, the total number of legs is 35 * 2 = 70, which matches the given total.
- This confirms that all animals are chickens.

**Final Answer**:
The number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is $\boxed{35}$.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}
