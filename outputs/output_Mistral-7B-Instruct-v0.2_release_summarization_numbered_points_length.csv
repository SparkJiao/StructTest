1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, specifically ratchet systems, are not well-understood due to their complex phase-space structures and sensitivity to parameters.
2. Recent interest in ratchet systems stems from their potential for extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as observed in biological systems.
3. Chaotic and Hamiltonian ratchets have received attention due to their behavior, which is defined by sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters.
4. The phase-space structure of these systems is typically complicated, consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas or co-existing attractors that can change significantly with parameter variations.
5. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the ensemble average velocity could be positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.
6. He conjectured a connection between current reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics.
7. Barbi and Salerno argued against this conjecture, showing that current reversals could occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative explanation related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.
8. This study investigates the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the same system as considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno. It shows that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and the importance of discarding transients.

1. The text discusses the results of observations and simulations of six extrasolar planetary systems, each with a planet having high eccentricity.
2. The planet-planet scattering method is proposed to explain the architecture of some planetary systems, including the presence of a hot Jupiter and two jovian planets in moderately eccentric orbits.
3. The Kozai mechanism is suggested to explain the high eccentricity of certain planets, particularly those with large inclination angles between their orbital planes and those of stellar companions.
4. Six of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity also have stellar-mass companions in wide binary orbits.
5. The Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of a planet if the inclination angle between its orbit and that of the stellar companion is large.
6. The text presents updated orbital fits, dynamical simulations, and detection limit computations for the six systems, using data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and other sources.
7. The simulations show that test particles can survive in stable orbits in the presence of a planet, but the regions of stability depend on the planet's mass, eccentricity, and the distance from the star.
8. The text also discusses the limitations of current radial velocity surveys for detecting additional planets in these systems and the importance of considering the sampling strategy and intrinsic scatter in the data.
9. The authors conclude that the observations and simulations provide insights into the formation and evolution of extrasolar planetary systems, highlighting the importance of considering multiple formation scenarios and the role of stellar companions in shaping planetary architectures.

1. The Large Electron-Positron (LEP) experiments have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the decay of the @xmath1-boson into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand. The agreement of LEP data with SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the @xmath1-pole.
2. The physics of the @xmath1-boson is expected to play a central role in particle physics again if the next generation @xmath1 factory comes true, with generated events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP. This factory can be realized in the gigaz option of the International Linear Collider (ILC).
3. The ILC is a proposed electron-positron collider with a tunable energy ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and polarized beams in its first phase. The gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of the @xmath1 boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
4. With the high luminosity and cross section at the resonance of the @xmath1 boson, about @xmath16 @xmath1 events can be generated in an operational year of gigaz, which implies that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of the @xmath1-decay can be improved from @xmath18 at the LEP to @xmath19 at the gigaz.
5. Among the rare @xmath1-decays, the flavor changing (fc) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics. The branching ratios of these processes in new physics models can be greatly enhanced for lepton flavor violation decays and quark flavor violation decays.
6. The study extends previous studies of these decays to some new models and investigates them altogether. The motivation comes from recent studies on the singlet extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), where a light cp-odd higgs boson with singlet-dominant component may naturally arise. These non-minimal supersymmetric models can avoid the @xmath25-problem and alleviate the little hierarchy.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. SUSY particles, including superpartners of Standard Model particles, are expected to have masses below the TeV range and will be discovered at the Tevatron or Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector is an important problem in SUSY phenomenology.
2. In many models, SUSY breaking dynamics is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak (EW) scale, such as the GUT or Planck scale. Once the mechanism is specified, the mass spectrum and flavor structure of SUSY particles at the EW scale can be determined by a small number of parameters. This makes it possible to confirm or exclude the mechanism by direct search or flavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) experiments in the near future.
3. If SUSY breaking is mediated by gravity, the structure of SUSY breaking masses of scalars is determined by the Kähler potential. In the present paper, the authors focus on the no-scale type Kähler potential, which separates the hidden sector and observable sector fields as in equation ([eq : noscalekahler ]) in the paper. This type of Kähler potential was originally investigated in [@xcite with @xmath5 and @xmath6]. The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models and has been shown to be realized naturally in some classes of string theory.
4. The authors of the paper investigate the indication of the current higgs mass and FCNC constraint on SUSY models with the no-scale boundary condition. They first consider the minimal case where universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale. This scenario is already constrained by direct search at LEP and the cosmological bound severely under the assumption of exact R-parity. The authors show that the higgs mass bound and FCNC constraint further exclude almost all the parameter region, leaving a very narrow allowed region for @xmath48. Next, they consider the case that the boundary condition is given above the gut scale.

1. Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but these singularities can be weakened by endowing the waves with a relative cross polarization or by coupling them with an electromagnetic field.
2. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) gave a solution with a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity, initiating a literature on the stability of horizons formed in CPW.
3. Yurtsever showed that the CH formed in spacetimes of CPW is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and CX revealed an analogous result through linear perturbation analysis.
4. The electromagnetic field itself plays a role in weakening the strength of a singularity in CPW, and the collision of pure electromagnetic waves has a special significance regarding singularity formation.
5. Bell and Szekeres gave a solution describing the collision of two linearly polarized step electromagnetic waves, and the singularity (a CH) formed in the interaction region was shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation.
6. However, essential curvature singularities remain on the null boundaries, which cannot be removed by any means.
7. Cross polarization and the electromagnetic field both influence the nature of the resulting singularity, leading to the pursuit of cross-polarized versions of solutions.
8. The cpbs solution, which has the nice feature that the weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region, was chosen as a test ground for studying the validity of a CH stability conjecture proposed by Helliwell and Konkowski.
9. The paper explores the spacetimes of a) single plane waves with added colliding test fields and b) colliding plane waves having non-singular interaction regions with test field added, and calculates the weyl and maxwell scalars for each case.

1. Deep X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N), have recently extended to cosmologically interesting distances, detecting normal galaxies with X-ray emission below 0.52 keV fluxes. These normal galaxies contribute significantly to the diffuse X-ray background (XRB), making up to 51% of its flux in the 0.52 keV band.
2. The investigation of the typical galaxy's X-ray emission, whether dominated by a population of X-ray binaries, hot interstellar gas, or even a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), is an essential function of deep X-ray surveys. Normal galaxies are expected to be the most numerous extragalactic X-ray sources in the universe and dominate the number counts at 0.52 keV fluxes.
3. The CDF-N survey has reached the depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies, enabling the study of their X-ray properties and evolution. Reaching larger look-back times presents the exciting possibility of detecting the bulk X-ray response to the heightened star-formation rate at high redshifts.
4. The X-ray luminosity per unit optical luminosity of normal spiral galaxies is expected to be larger in the past due to the increased energy output of X-ray binary populations at high redshifts. Measuring the X-ray luminosities of typical galaxies can constrain models of X-ray binary production in galaxies.
5. Statistical methods, such as stacking, are used to estimate the X-ray emission of normal galaxies at their extremely faint flux levels. The CDF-N data provide extremely deep X-ray coverage over the area of interest, and the point-source detection limits in this region are 56 erg s-1 for the lowest redshift bin and 35 erg s-1 for the highest redshift bin. The study places observational constraints on the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity of normal spiral galaxies up to high redshifts and the fraction of the diffuse XRB explained by galaxies lingering just below the CDF-N detection threshold.

1. Quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical descriptions, with degrees of non-classicality ranging from non-separable to bell-nonlocal states.
2. Non-separable or entangled states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of their constituents, and their measurement correlations cannot be explained by a local hidden state model.
3. Bell-nonlocal states violate Bell inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality and allowing two spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement if they cannot trust each other or their detectors.
4. EPR-steerability is a weaker form of non-classical correlation than bell-nonlocality, allowing one party to steer the state of the other by measurements on their own system.
5. EPR-steerability was only formalized eight years ago and is the only way to verify the existence of entanglement if one party or their detectors cannot be trusted.
6. The quantum steering ellipsoid formalism is used to investigate the epr-steerability of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, called t-states.
7. A deterministic local hidden state model is developed for projective measurements on these t-states using the steering ellipsoid formalism, and two sufficient conditions for t-states to be epr-steerable are obtained via epr-steering inequalities.
8. These sufficient conditions touch the necessary condition in some regions of the space of t-states, and the gap between them is small elsewhere.
9. The paper is organized into sections discussing the notions of non-locality, the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism, and the derivation of asymmetric steering inequalities for arbitrary two-qubit states.

1. In 1994, a scheme was proposed to realize a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field.
2. The system consists of three quantum dots, and exchange interaction is allowed only between nearest neighbor spins.
3. The spin orientation in each quantum dot becomes a binary variable, with two possible states: parallel or anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field.
4. In the presence of exchange interaction between two electrons confined to two separate potentials, the anti-ferromagnetic ordering (two neighboring spins are anti-parallel) is preferred over the ferromagnetic ordering (two spins are parallel).
5. The ground state of the array has the spin configuration shown in the figure, with ""upspin"" being the spin orientation directed along the magnetic field and ""downspin"" the opposite orientation.
6. Encoding logic 1 in the upspin state and considering the two edge dots as input ports and the middle dot as the output port, the NAND gate truth table was realized.
7. However, the system has a long-lived metastable state, which can prevent decay to the global ground state, causing potential issues for high-speed logic operations.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors include the lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have not been able to reproduce the precise position of the short-period cut-off and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
2. Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum reach a minimum period at around 65 minutes. The probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region, leading to an accumulation of systems (a spike) at the minimum period. However, no such spike is present in the observed distribution. The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which in turn is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer and thermal relaxation. The minimum period occurs where the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time are about equal.
3. To address the mismatch between the theoretical and observed minimum orbital period in CVs, this paper investigates possible solutions, including increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of period minimum values in the CV population. The mass transfer rate can be written as the sum of two terms: the systemic angular momentum loss rate, which is independent of mass transfer, and an explicit function of the mass transfer rate. The authors consider the general case in which the angular momentum loss mechanism, along with nova mass ejections, causes a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the system. They employ a generic prescription for the angular momentum loss mechanism and present detailed calculations of the long-term evolution of CVs.

1. The Stephan's Quintet (SQ) system is a strongly interacting compact group that has produced a large-scale intergalactic shock wave, first observed in radio continuum and later in X-ray emissions.
2. The shock wave is believed to be caused by the high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318b, with the intergalactic medium of the group.
3. Optical emission line ratios and broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is powered by strong shocks and not star formation.
4. The main elements of SQ include a primary shock, NGC 7318b (the intruder galaxy), a large Seyfert 2 galaxy, and other group members. A peculiar extranuclear star formation region, SQ-a, is located at the extreme northern end of the main shock wave.
5. A recent model suggests that h@xmath9 formation occurs out of the multiphase, shocked gas, and an efficient cooling channel for high-speed shocks as an alternative to x-ray emission.
6. Since the SQ detection, several other systems exhibiting similarly strong h@xmath9 emission have been discovered. Mechanical heating driven by radio jet interaction with the host galaxy ISM is the favored mechanism for h@xmath5  emission in these systems.

1. Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) exhibit diverse broad and narrow emission lines, with broad lines arising in or near an accretion disk and narrow lines serving as reliable measures of the local quasar rest frame. Two populations of Type 1 AGNs have emerged: population A with smaller broad-line widths and population B with larger broad-line widths.
2. Population A sources, which include Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSY1) sources, have best-fit hα profiles described by a single Lorentz function, and their broad-line widths range from 1000 to 4000 Angstroms. Population B sources, on the other hand, require two Gaussians for a reasonable profile description, and their broad-line widths range from 4000 to 12000 Angstroms. Broad-line profiles as narrow as 500 Angstroms and as broad as 40000 Angstroms have been found.
3. Population A is predominantly radio-quiet, while population B involves a mix of radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. Narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are reliable measures of the local quasar rest frame, except in the case of ""blue outliers,"" which are usually found in sources with fwhm(hα)=1500-3500 Angstroms and weak [OIII] emission. Blue outliers show [OIII] blueshifts as large as 100000 km/s.

Careful use of [OIII] and hα narrow lines as rest frame measures suggests that broad hα in population B sources is redshifted, and composites involving the 469 brightest SDSS-DR5 quasars suggest that these two components represent the underlying stable structure of hα in population B.

1. Water vapor is an important molecule in interstellar and circumstellar clouds, and the 183 GHz transition of H2O has been used to trace high excitation gas around star forming regions and evolved stars. However, no information has been obtained from this line on the role of H2O at large spatial scales due to the small size of the emitting regions.
2. Other H2O lines have been detected from ground or airborne based telescopes, such as the 325 GHz line, which has not been used to map the emission of H2O at very large spatial scales. The present study reports the detection of extended water emission at 325 GHz and shows that the H2O abundance is around 10-10 in the plateau.
3. Ground-based observations provide much finer spatial resolution than ISO or SWAS and an estimate of x(H2O) as accurate as that obtained from the extremely optically thick H2O lines observed in the submillimeter and far infrared domains. The observations were performed with the 10.4 m telescope of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory.
4. The 325 GHz emission is spatially extended and shows a different brightness temperature than the 183 GHz emission, which is explained by the different physical conditions in the emitting regions. The radiative transfer of the rotational levels of p-H2O was modeled to understand the behavior of the two masing lines.
5. The models show that the line intensity ratio between the 183 and 325 GHz lines increases with n(p-H2O) for low column densities but decreases for higher values due to the saturation of the 183 GHz line and the exponential amplification of the 325 Ghz line. The water vapor column density that fits the observed log *r* depends strongly on the assumed values of n(H2) and T.

The results highlight the importance of ground-based observations to obtain the spatial distribution of H2O in interstellar clouds and to constrain the physical conditions of the different emitting regions.

8. Sequence nets have structural properties that can be easily analyzed, and the introduction of an ordering in ensembles of sequence nets is useful for visualizing and studying their various attributes.

2. DTW distance is a shape-based similarity measure that uses dynamic programming to find the minimum distance between two time series. It may not provide the best mapping without a global constraint.
3. Two well-known global constraints, Sakoe-Chiba band and Itakura parallelogram, and a recent representation, Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (r-k band), have been proposed to limit permissible warping paths.
4. In this work, a new efficient time series classification algorithm is proposed based on 1-nn with DTW distance and multi r-k bands as a global constraint.
5. To select the best r-k band, two learning algorithms, band boundary extraction and iterative learning, are proposed.
6. The band boundary extraction algorithm obtains maximum, mean, and mode of paths' positions on the DTW distance matrix, and iterative learning adjusts band structures based on silhouette index.
7. Silhouette index is used as a heuristic function for selecting the band that yields the best prediction accuracy.

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems, particularly qubits, plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.
2. The study of entanglement's essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence has attracted significant attention due to phenomena like entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB).
3. ESD, where entanglement between qubits terminates in a finite time despite single qubit coherence loss, is detrimental to quantum information processing.
4. However, some studies have shown that revived entanglement can occur after ESD, which plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.
5. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD is always accompanied by ESB of the reservoirs.
6. Similar results have been observed for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.
7. The entanglement dynamics and distribution in bipartite partitions are determined by the time-dependent factor of single-qubit excited-state population.
8. Population trapping, a phenomenon responsible for the suppression of spontaneous emission in a photonic band gap (PBG) reservoir, can lead to the formation of bound states between qubits and their reservoirs.
9. These bound states result in the initial entanglement in qubit1-qubit2 being unable to be fully transferred to qubit-reservoir, and the oscillation during the evolution is a manifestation of the strong non-markovian effect induced by the reservoirs.
10. When qubits are located in the upper band of a PBG medium, the bound states are absent, and the initial entanglement in qubit1-qubit2 is completely transferred to qubit-reservoir.

2. Initially, both networks contain nodes with no cross-links between them. At each time step, two new nodes are introduced, each with outgoing links that attach preferentially to pre-existing nodes in both networks.
3. The rate of acquiring a link depends on the number of connections and the initial attractiveness of the pre-existing nodes. The model is analyzed using a rate equation approach, and the time evolution of the joint distribution of intra-links and cross-links is described.
4. The total in-degree distribution is obtained, which is a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes. The distribution of the average number of nodes with intra-links in network 1 is also analyzed, which has a power-law form that depends on both the attachment rate and the coupling parameter.
5. The distribution of average nodes with incoming cross-links in network 1 is found by summing over all its intra-links, and the distribution has a power-law form with exponents that are inversely proportional to the coupled parameters. In the weak coupling case, the exponent of the intra-link distribution is equal to the total link distribution, and varying the coupling parameter yields any values of the cross-link distribution between certain limits.

1. The text discusses the production of hadrons at large transverse momentum in high-energy hadronic or nuclear collisions. Traditionally, this process is described as a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation to detected hadrons.
2. However, recent studies have shown that fragmentation is inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions. Instead, recombination of partons is the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.
3. The authors aim to take the first step towards a universal description of hadronization by introducing the concept of shower partons and determining their distributions to represent phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
4. Shower partons are initiated by a hard parton and can either recombine among themselves or recombine with soft partons in the environment. The former case reproduces the fragmentation function, while the latter case introduces a new component that is important in heavy-ion collisions.
5. The authors focus on quantifying the properties of shower partons and illustrating their importance in the recombination of thermal partons. They use the BKK parameterization to determine the shower parton distributions for valence and sea quarks and gluons.
6. The authors demonstrate that the use of shower partons is important in heavy-ion collisions by reproducing the fragmentation functions for pions and kaons. They also show that the thermal distribution of partons in the medium is crucial for the recombination process.
7. The authors relate their approach to previous attempts to incorporate QCD dynamics in the description of branching and collision processes, such as the Marchesini-Webber and Geiger models. They note that their shower partons do not correspond to the partons of those models at the end of their evolution processes.
8. The authors consider two applications of the shower parton distributions: the production of hadrons from a hard parton in the presence of thermal partons, and the study of the dihadron distribution in a jet. They demonstrate the utility of the shower parton distributions in problems where the knowledge of fragmentation functions alone is not sufficient.

1. The text discusses the investigation of collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints in cognitive radio networks. The authors characterize the secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (AF) cognitive relay channel and formulate the beamforming optimization as a quasiconvex optimization problem. They propose two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes to reduce computational complexity. The channel model consists of a cognitive relay channel with a secondary user source, a primary user, a secondary user destination, an eavesdropper, and relays. The source tries to transmit confidential messages to the destination while keeping interference on the primary user below a predefined interference temperature limit and keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the information.
2. The authors assume that relays work synchronously and have no direct link with the source, primary user, or eavesdropper. They express the received signals at the destination and eavesdropper as the superposition of messages sent by the relays and gaussian background noise components. They write the objective function of the optimization problem as the secrecy rate, which is the maximum achievable rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver while keeping the eavesdropper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages. They use semidefinite programming to solve the optimization problem and propose suboptimal null space beamforming techniques to simplify the analysis.

The authors argue that a classical @xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFS, so it is logical to maintain this symmetry during quantization. This allows the free field to behave like in a flat space, and the corresponding Wightman two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts.
2. The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism and realize all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. They introduce auxiliary fields and use the Gribov-Bleuler quantization scheme to deal with gauge freedom. The use of a well-suited coordinate system allows the authors to get @xmath0-invariant CFS formulas to have a Minkowskian form.

The authors demonstrate that the SM is not recovered when the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale.

The method aims to explore all parameter space where neither doping nor degeneracy is fixed, allowing the calculation of properties of realistic solid state systems.
2. The authors propose an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation, which is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem but follows the ideology of LDA theory. They use the slave boson mean field (SBMF) approach and the Hubbard I approximation to determine the functional dependence of the interpolating coefficients upon doping, degeneracy, and the strength of the interaction.
3. The authors compare the results of their interpolative method with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations for various quantities such as quasiparticle residue and multiple occupancies. They find that the sbmf approach can predict the positions and widths of the atomic satellites with good accuracy, while the Hubbard I method fails in some regimes. They also discuss possible improvements to the algorithm and conclude that it provides a fast and accurate method for calculating the self-energy in strongly correlated electronic systems.

1. Harmonic maps were initiated by Fuller, Nash, and Sampson in the study of smooth maps between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The first existence result was obtained by Eells and Sampson.
2. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional and have a vanishing trace of the second fundamental form. They are defined using the energy density and the pullback bundle.
3. The second fundamental form of a smooth map is a symmetric map that measures the curvature of the map. The tension field is a section that vanishes for harmonic maps.
4. A smooth variation of a harmonic map leads to the definition of the Hessian, which measures the stability of the map. A harmonic map is stable if its Morse index is zero, and unstable otherwise.
5. An almost product structure is a tensor field of type (1,1) that satisfies certain conditions. An almost para-complex manifold is an almost product manifold with eigenbundles of equal rank.
6. An almost para-hermitian manifold is an almost para-complex manifold endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian metric compatible with the almost para-complex structure. The fundamental form and co-differential are defined for almost para-hermitian manifolds.
7. An almost paracontact manifold is an almost product manifold with a triplet structure consisting of an endomorphism, a unique vector field, and a bivector form. The eigen distributions corresponding to the characteristic values of the endomorphism have equal dimension.
8. A normal almost paracontact metric manifold is a normal almost paracontact manifold with a vanishing nijenhuis torsion. It is integrable and has a paracosymplectic structure if it is para-sasakian. Harmonic maps between para-sasakian manifolds are studied, and it is shown that a smooth paraholomorphic map between para-sasakian manifolds has a vanishing tension field.

1. The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is a crucial measure for understanding the hierarchical build-up of the universe.
2. Large-scale simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high mass galaxies, necessitating processes to quench star formation.
3. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of massive galaxies are believed to be the solution to this problem.
4. SMBHs grow through accretion of cold material, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
5. AGNs can deposit energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies through jets or powerful outflows, a process known as feedback.
6. Indirect evidence of AGN feedback includes the tight scaling relationships between the mass of the SMBH and various properties of the host galaxy.
7. Much debate remains about the exact mechanism of AGN feedback and its role in the overall evolution of galaxies.
8. Recent studies have focused on the so-called starburst-AGN connection, which manifests itself in the infrared (IR) regime.
9. Determining accurate estimates of the SFR in AGN host galaxies is challenging due to contamination from the central AGN.
10. The IR regime is the preferred waveband for studying star formation in AGN host galaxies because dust plays a crucial role in the heating and cooling of the ISM and re-emits stellar light.

1. The fundamental group of the complement of plane curves and line arrangements is an important topological invariant used to distinguish between components of moduli spaces of smooth projective surfaces and study Zariski pairs. The Zariski-Lefschetz hyperplane section theorem states that the fundamental groups of complements of curves can be used to compute those of complements of hypersurfaces.
2. A real arrangement of lines is a union of copies of lines in a plane, and its graph consists of multiple points, which are points where more than two lines intersect. Fan defined a graph associated to the multiple points of a line arrangement, which lies on the arrangement and consists of multiple points and segments between them on lines with at least two multiple points. Fan proved results concerning the projective fundamental group of complex arrangements and conjectured that the inverse implication of his result holds.
3. The fundamental group of a real arrangement whose graph is a cycle of length three and has no line with more than two multiple points has a conjugation-free geometric presentation. The presentation has a specific form, and the fundamental group can be read directly from the arrangement or its incidence lattice without computation. The paper aims to attack the problem of which line arrangements have a fundamental group with a conjugation-free geometric presentation and discusses the relation between nice, simple, and the new family of arrangements.

1. In recent times, researchers have been interested in finding flavor symmetry to generate mass and mixing patterns of fermions. Continuous symmetries like @xmath9, @xmath10, and most popular discrete symmetry, @xmath11 exchange symmetry, have been used to describe mass and mixing patterns in the leptonic sector.
2. The paper by e. ma and g. rajasekaran introduced the @xmath1 symmetry to avoid mass degeneracy of @xmath13 and @xmath14 under @xmath15 symmetry. Since then, a lot of work has been done with this symmetry.
3. After the introduction of tri-bi maximal mixing pattern (@xmath16, @xmath17, @xmath18), people have tried to fit this mixing pattern through the @xmath1 symmetry. In an extension of the standard model, the leptonic mixing arises solely from the neutrino sector since the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal.
4. The model also admits hierarchical masses of the three charged leptons whereas the neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate or hierarchical. It gives rise to @xmath19 and @xmath20, which is consistent with the Chooz-Palovarez experimental upper bound at 3@xmath22.
5. The non-zero and complex value of @xmath0 leads to the possibility to explore violation in the leptonic sector, which is the main goal of many future short and long baseline experiments. The generation of nonzero complex @xmath0 and possibility of non-zero CP violation has been extensively studied in the proposed model of altarelli-feruglio.
6. In the model, the authors showed that the tri-bi maximal mixing pattern is also generated naturally in the framework of see-saw mechanism with @xmath23 symmetry. Exact tri-bi maximal pattern forbids at low energy CP violation in the leptonic sector, and the textures of mass matrices could not generate lepton asymmetry.

1. Organic molecular crystals, composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces, are emerging as candidates for nanoscale devices in electronics and optoelectronics.
2. These devices consist of both an organic and inorganic component, where the organic part forms the active part and the inorganic part provides electrical contact to external circuitry.
3. The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the device performance.
4. Charge transfer between the organic and inorganic components and the energies at which transfer takes place need to be understood.
5. Upon adsorption on a substrate, electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change due to the polarization of the substrate and the formation of image charges.
6. Quasiparticle (qp) description is a common way to calculate addition and removal energies, but its adequacy depends on the level of theory used to calculate energy levels of the homo and lumo.
7. Density functional theory (DFT) is a popular choice for calculating energy levels, but it fails to capture the non-local nature of image charge formation, leading to inaccurate results.
8. An explicit many-body approach, such as the GW approximation, can capture the energy levels renormalization due to image charge effects but is computationally demanding.
9. Constrained Density Functional Theory (CDFT) is a more resource-efficient alternative for evaluating charge transfer energies between an organic molecule and an inorganic substrate.

1. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecule in the universe and forms through the sticking of hydrogen atoms (H) onto dust grains, primarily carbonaceous or silicate particles, in the interstellar medium (ISM). The sticking of H onto surfaces can be physisorbed or chemisorbed, and experiments have shown that both states play a role in H2 formation.
2. Neutral pahs, when highly hydrogenated, act as efficient catalysts for H2 formation in the ISM. The hydrogenation of pah cations, which are usually present at lower extinction levels, is also an important route to form H2. The first hydrogenation of pah cations is barrierless, but subsequent hydrogenations have alternating barriers and no barriers, allowing for highly hydrogenated states and continued H2 formation.

4. Problem (b) is solved through computer-mediated feedback that adjusts the oscillator based on detections of scattering of the oscillator's radiation by the clock's atoms.

4. In a one-dimensional case, MOPED creates a second peak of equal height at an incorrect parameter value, resulting in a serious problem for parameter estimation.
5. Adding a second parameter may rectify the problem, but there may still be unphysical degeneracies that need to coincide to give an unphysical mode of equal likelihood to the true peak.
6. In a more complex scenario, MOPED creates multiple modes of equal likelihood to the true peak, which is problematic for parameter estimation.
7. The set of intersections of contour surfaces determines where additional peaks are located, and degeneracy will interact with the model's intrinsic degeneracy.
8. To determine the validity of degenerate peaks in the MOPED likelihood function, one can compare the original likelihoods of the peak parameter values.

2. The vacuum energy density can come from various sources, including zero point energy of particles, potential energies from phase transitions, and radiative corrections with a cutoff scale.
3. The effective description of physics concerning the CCP suggests that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy, assuming that classical gravitational fields do not effectively couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy.
4. The evolution of dark energy is described by the equation of state ([rho - de]), which varies logarithmically with the temperature and radius of the universe, and is independent of the renormalization point. The potential of matters changes after the incorporation of zero point energies and symmetry breakdown, and is almost constant except for the early universe.

2. For low luminosity galaxies, clustering is a strong function of color, while for luminous galaxies, clustering is a strong function of luminosity. Red galaxies show a non-monotonic function of luminosity, peaking at both high and low luminosities.
3. Galaxy environment is independent of surface brightness and concentration at fixed color and luminosity, indicating that color and luminosity measures have a more fundamental relationship with environment.
4. Studies have explored the scale dependence of these relationships, with some investigations coming to conflicting conclusions regarding the dependence on scale of the relative bias of SDSS galaxies.
5. The authors address this question by examining the dependence of overdensity on luminosity and color for six different projected radii, demonstrating that the environments of low luminosity, red galaxies continue to become denser as absolute magnitude increases.
6. The ratio of the overdensity at each scale relative to that at the largest scale shows that for each class of galaxy, the strength of the correlation on large scales is always associated with a steeper correlation function.

2. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are crucial in both two and three dimensions, reducing the zero-temperature AF order parameter and Néel temperature significantly.
3. Recent interest lies in spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in quantum antiferromagnets. In the random-AF model, the lattice-averaged AF order parameter appears to be enhanced for small fractions of vacancies, while strong disorder enhances spin fluctuations.
4. A new method is presented to evaluate transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the hf-level broken-symmetry state using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
5. This method is applicable in the whole interaction strength range and is illustrated with three applications: the pure model in strong coupling, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-impurity concentrations in three dimensions.
6. The RPA approach properly interpolates between weak and strong coupling limits for spin-wave velocity, and identical results are obtained for all quantum corrections order by order when going beyond the RPA level within a systematic inverse-degeneracy expansion scheme.
7. The method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators, and it is shown to yield the correction to the sublattice magnetization solely in terms of transverse spin correlations.
8. The deviation of transverse spin correlations from the hf approximation is due to the neglect of single particle excitations across the charge gap in eq. (2), and the sum of these yields a measure of transverse spin fluctuations about the hf state.

1. The existence and thermal relic abundance of dark matter (DM) have been established by the WMAP experiment, and the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a promising candidate for DM.
2. In models beyond the Standard Model (SM), it is desired to have a viable DM candidate. The WIMP DM candidate can be accommodated economically by introducing an inert scalar field with the inert property, ensuring the stability of the DM candidate.
3. Neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses, and their different flavor structure from that of quarks and leptons may indicate that neutrino masses are of Majorana type.
4. The seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) are simple ways to explain tiny neutrino masses, but they do not contain a DM candidate in themselves.
5. In models where tiny neutrino masses are generated by higher orders of perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained. In these models, the yukawa couplings of neutrinos with the SM Higgs boson are forbidden at the tree level, and the same parity also guarantees the stability of the lightest odd particle, which can be the candidate of the DM as long as it is electrically neutral.
6. The paper considers an extension of the HTM in which the parity @xmath6 is generated at the one-loop level, and the DM candidate appears. In the HTM, majorana masses for neutrinos are generated via the yukawa interaction with a nonzero vacuum expectation value of an triplet scalar field with the hypercharge of @xmath9.
7. The smallness of the neutrino masses is realized by obtaining the dim.-5 operator at the loop level, and the model gives small neutrino masses naturally without using very heavy particles. The suppression factor @xmath190 is constrained by the DM relic abundance measured by the WMAP experiment.
8. The model is characterized by the fact that the DM candidate mass is much larger than the mass of the particle responsible for neutrino masses. A possible collider signature for probing the large DM mass would be the production of a final state with two jets and two leptons whose invariant mass gives the DM mass.

1. The text discusses a method for quantifying the effective entanglement in qubit-mode systems using only homodyne measurement results and knowledge of the initial preparation.
2. The method works particularly well if the mode subsystem exhibits low noise.
3. The quantification scheme involves determining the projection of the full state onto the most significant two-qubit subspace and bounding the entanglement of this projection.
4. The bounds are based on the maximal eigenvalues and overlaps of the conditional states and can be calculated using homodyne measurement results.
5. The method can be extended to truncate the mode subspace using the two largest eigenstates from each conditional state, but this increases the complexity of the quantification calculation.
6. The text also discusses the effects of higher noise on the approximations used in the quantification scheme.
7. A simple channel is considered to study the approximations independently, and the results show that the tolerable excess noise is higher when the maximal eigenvalues and overlap are known exactly.
8. The two-qubit projection is weaker for higher values of overlap, only working to about half the noise value that the entanglement verification curve reaches.
9. The ultimate goal is to calculate non-trivial values for the entanglement wherever it is verified, providing a true quantitative complement to existing entanglement verification methods.

1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles, including the magnetic moments of charged particles, has led to significant advancements in subatomic physics. This research began with the pioneering work of Stern and led to the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the renormalizable theory of QED. For charged particles with spin, the magnetic moment is given by the Dirac equation, which relates the magnetic moment to the gyromagnetic ratio and anomaly.
2. The situation for baryons is different due to their internal quark structure, which gives them large anomalies. The magnetic and electric dipole moments can be represented as the real and imaginary parts of a generalized dipole operator, and the interaction Lagrangian becomes a function of the magnetic and electric fields and dipole moments. The electron anomaly is now measured to a relative precision of four parts in a billion, which is better than the precision on the fine-structure constant, and the muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million.
3. The hadronic contribution to the magnetic moment of the muon cannot be calculated directly from QCD due to the low energy scale, but dispersion theory provides a relationship between the vacuum polarization loop and the cross section for a specific process. The muon anomaly is sensitive to new physics at the TeV scale, and potential contributions include lepton substructure, anomalous couplings, and supersymmetry.
4. The muon magnetic moment experiment, E821, was designed to measure the muon spin precession frequency in a magnetic field and reached a precision of 0.17 ppm in the magnetic field measurement. The experiment used an electric quadrupole for vertical focusing and detected the decay positrons using lead-scintillating fiber calorimeters. The goal of a new experiment, E969, is to achieve a total error of ppm, with the goal of controlling the total systematic errors on the magnetic field and muon frequency measurement to 0.1 ppm each.

1. A new design for an optomechanical system was presented in a recent paper by Li et al., consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide.
2. The system has attractive features, including universality and the ability to study reactive effects in optomechanical coupling.
3. The origin of reactive coupling lies in the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator and further phase-dependent gradient forces.
4. The authors argue that this design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, but they also examine other possibilities to investigate effects arising from strong reactive coupling.
5. The system is modeled using a Hamiltonian that includes the energy of the cavity field, waveguide, interactions between fields and waveguide, and coupling of the cavity field to the pump field and stokes field.
6. The authors find that there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling, but normal mode splitting occurs in output fields in the presence of reactive coupling.
7. The real parts of the roots of the denominator of the output fields change from two equal values to two different values with increasing pump power for reactive coupling, resulting in normal mode splitting of the output fields.
8. The imaginary parts of the roots of the denominator of the output fields change with increasing pump power for reactive coupling, indicating that the normal mode splitting is solely due to the reactive coupling.
9. The output fields depend on the behavior of the roots of the denominator, and normal mode splitting can lead to the appearance of normal mode splitting in the output stokes field, with the peak separation increasing with increasing pump power.

Additionally, the paper reports on reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting, while previous works only used dispersive coupling for normal mode splitting in optomechanical devices. The authors investigate the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields and find that the system can generate an anti-stokes field with frequency due to the reactive coupling. The maximum gain for the stokes field is about 1.3, and for the anti-stokes field is about 0.1.

3. The study reveals that the magnetization does not become homogeneous even after infinite time due to the presence of odd-occupation basis states, which have zero eigenvalues.

1. The text discusses the behavior of Quark-Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite baryon density, which is crucial for understanding the structure of compact stars and conditions near the core of collapsing stars. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase.
2. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, and the charge neutrality condition is required to form bulk matter inside them. This induces a mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks, which eventually destroys the cooper pairing and may lead to a first-order phase transition from the color superconducting phase to the normal phase.
3. The text also mentions the existence of a spatial non-uniform Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fudde-Ferrell (LOFF) state in a certain window of moderate mismatch. It is still not fully understood how the cooper pairing will be eventually destroyed by increasing mismatch in a charge neutral system.
4. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system, and if it is satisfied globally and the surface tension is small, the mixed phase will be favored. It is difficult to precisely calculate the surface tension in the mixed phase, so the focus is on the homogeneous phase when the charge neutrality condition is required locally.

1. The range of Hi column densities in nearby galaxy neutral gas disks is similar to those in damped Lyman-@x alpha systems (DLAs). An attractive experiment would be to map the Hi gas of DLAs in 21-cm emission and measure their total gas mass, extent, and dynamics.
2. However, such studies are impossible with present technology due to the weak 21-cm line and the limited number of DLAs whose 21-cm emission is within reach. Instead, we have collected information on cold gas properties in local galaxies and several hundred DLAs at intermediate and high redshifts.
3. Most observers study DLAs in the optical wavelengths, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been unsuccessful. There are now @xmath10 DLAs known at @xmath11, spanning a wide range in galaxy properties.
4. We cannot study all luminous, high surface brightness spiral galaxies in the 21-cm line on a case-by-case basis, but we can do a statistical study to see if the properties of DLAs and local galaxies agree with our knowledge of Hi in the local universe.
5. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe have resulted in accurate measurements of @xmath12, which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLAs studies. We use high resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies to study the column density distribution function of Hi.
6. The surprising result from the study is that there appears to be only very mild evolution in the intersection cross section of Hi from redshift @xmath21 to the present. The local galaxy population explains the incidence rate of low and intermediate @xmath3 DLAs, and there is no need for a population of hidden very low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies or isolated Hi clouds (dark galaxies).

Most of the DLAs cross-section appears to be in galaxies that are fainter than @xmath29, and 45% is in galaxies with @xmath30.

1. Stars are primarily formed in star clusters during the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds (Lada & Lada, 2003). Only a modest percentage of the gas is turned into stars, leaving the initial cluster with a combination of gas and stars.
2. During the initial phases of a star cluster's lifetime, the cluster is in equilibrium, but at the onset of stellar winds and after the first supernovae explosions, enough energy is injected into the gas to remove it on timescales shorter than a crossing time (Hills, 1980; Lada et al., 1984; Goodwin, 1997a).
3. The resulting cluster, now devoid of gas, is far out of equilibrium due to the rapid change in gravitational potential energy caused by the loss of a significant fraction of its mass.
4. Recent studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in young clusters by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters, but results have been discrepant, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs.
5. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, suggesting that the youngest clusters may not be in virial equilibrium.
6. The authors present evidence that m82-f and ngc 1569-a, which have been reported to have non-standard stellar IMFs, are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss.

7. Environment-induced quantum decoherence and dissipation due to the interaction with chaotic degrees of freedom have been studied since the mid-eighties, and the problem can be efficiently reduced to a localization problem in lower dimensions.
8. The ammonia molecule is well described by two doublets below the barrier height in the unperturbed case, and the transition probability from the localized wavepacket to a delocalized state can be estimated using the degree of coherence.
9. The degree of coherence of the time-dependence of the transition probability can be used to estimate quantitatively the difference between coherent and incoherent motions, and it is found that the tunneling oscillation loses coherence for large perturbation strengths.

1. According to quantum electrodynamics, the zero-point energy of electric and magnetic fields gives rise to a force between two electrically neutral metallic plates in vacuum, known as the Casimir effect. This force is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the separation distance.
2. Lifshitz theory generalized Casimir's prediction to isotropic dielectrics and derived an analytical formula for the force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions. The theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force at very short distances and reduces to Casimir's result at larger separations.
3. The torque between two parallel birefringent slabs placed in an isotropic medium causes them to spontaneously rotate towards the configuration of minimum energy. This effect can be explained by the anisotropy of the zero-point energy between the plates, which generates a torque that makes them rotate towards configurations of smaller energy.
4. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been verified in several high-precision experiments, and although most investigations have focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum, the theory's general validity is not in doubt.

The torque between anisotropic materials predicted by Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash has received little attention, with the exception of a theoretical derivation of a more simplified equation for the torque between two plates in a one-dimensional calculation and between engineered anisotropic surfaces.

1. The text describes an embedding scheme for solving the Dirac equation within a limited region i of a larger system ii, where the influence of ii is taken into account by adding an energy-dependent non-local potential to the Hamiltonian for i. This scheme has been developed into a powerful tool for surface electronic structure problems, particularly for situations where an accurate description of the spectrum of electron states is necessary.
2. The scheme is based on a trial function in which the large component is continuous and the small component is discontinuous across the surface separating i and ii. The discontinuity in the small component is restored when the equations are solved exactly, enabling the expectation value to be expressed purely in terms of the trial function in i.
3. The method has been illustrated through calculations of the eigenstates of a hydrogen atom within a cavity and the determination of the green function for the embedded region. The results show that the eigenvalues converge to the exact values as the basis set size increases, and the poles of the green function coincide with the eigenstates of the entire system.

2. Real-world networks are constantly evolving over time, but the effects of temporal structural variations on network dynamics are poorly understood.
3. The adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (asis) model is a relevant model for studying network adaptation mechanisms, where edges can be temporarily removed to prevent the spread of epidemics.
4. The asis model is able to account for arbitrary contact patterns, but analytical results are based on assumptions of homogeneous contact patterns and node/edge dynamics.
5. The lack of tools to analyze network adaptation mechanisms hinders the development of effective methodologies for utilizing adaptation mechanisms to contain spreading processes.
6. The heterogeneous asis model extends the standard asis model by allowing heterogeneous node and edge dynamics.
7. The evolution of nodal states and edges in the heterogeneous asis model can be described by stochastic differential equations.
8. The heterogeneous asis model exhibits an upper bound on the epidemic threshold, which is tight around the origin and can be derived using matrix theory.
9. The optimization of adaptation rates in the heterogeneous asis model can be formulated as a geometric program, which can be efficiently solved using standard optimization software.
10. Numerical simulations show that degree-based and eigenvector-based edge centralities are good measures for determining the amount of investment in tuning cutting rates, while betweenness centrality does not show a significant dependency on optimal cutting rates.

1. Open dielectric resonators have received significant attention due to their applications as microlasers, sensors, and paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths.
2. Semiclassical methods have been successful in treating wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength, providing approximate solutions in terms of the properties of the corresponding classical system.
3. The classical system for open dielectric cavities is an open dielectric billiard, where rays travel freely inside and are partially reflected and refracted at the boundary according to Snell's law and the Fresnel formulas.
4. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from their ray dynamics.
5. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
6. Trace formulas, which relate the density of states (DOS) of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system, have been developed for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators and successfully tested in experiments.
7. However, there is no investigation of the trace formula for three-dimensional (3D) dielectric resonators due to the difficulty of solving the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities. Flat microlasers are treated as 2D systems using an effective index of refraction, but this approximation introduces uncontrolled errors, and no a priori estimates of these errors are known even when the cavity height is much smaller than the wavelength. The present work aims to compare the experimental length spectra with the 2D trace formula and investigate the effect of dispersion and the need for higher-order corrections.

1. The merger of two neutron stars or a black hole and a neutron star are significant sources of gravitational waves (GW), releasing huge amounts of energy at frequencies within the range of ground-based laser interferometers.
2. The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) may emit approximately 10^(erg) in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, with frequencies up to 1.4-1.6 kHz. The rate of these mergings in the local universe is uncertain, with estimates varying due to different assumptions about the formation of massive binaries and the fraction of binaries that remain bound after the second supernova event.
3. Besides the emission from the nearest DNS mergers, a stochastic background of GW is produced by the superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts. The nature of this background depends on the duty cycle, which is the ratio of the typical duration of a single burst to the average time interval between successive events.
4. The simulations described in the paper used Monte Carlo methods to estimate the occurrence of merging events and the resulting GW background. The results indicate that about 96% of coalescences occur above a critical redshift, contributing to the production of a continuous background, while sources in the redshift interval correspond to a duty cycle of 0.1 and are responsible for a cosmic ""popcorn"" noise.
5. The density parameter of the GW background, as a function of the observed frequency, increases as 1/f^((3/2)), reaches a maximum amplitude around 670 Hz, and exhibits a high-frequency cut-off corresponding to the frequency of the last stable orbit at the critical redshift. The amplitude of the popcorn background is about one order of magnitude higher than the continuous background, with a maximum around a frequency of 1 kHz.

1. Diffusive acceleration at Newtonian shock fronts is a well-studied phenomenon, but the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock is still a subject of debate. This phenomenon violates the test particle approximation when the acceleration process generates pressures of the accelerated particles comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure.
2. There are three approaches to account for the backreaction of particles upon the shock: numerical simulations, fluid models, and analytical methods. Numerical simulations have shown that even a small fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas can significantly affect the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid, making the test particle approach unsuitable.
3. Fluid models treat cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid and allow the calculation of thermodynamics of the modified shocks but do not provide information about the spectrum of accelerated particles. Analytical methods may be helpful to understand the physics of nonlinear effects in a way that is difficult to achieve through simulations due to their intrinsic complexity.
4. A perturbative approach was adopted in a previous study, which treats the pressure of accelerated particles as a small perturbation and provides an answer only for weakly modified shocks. An alternative approach assumes that the diffusion of particles is sufficiently energy dependent that different parts of the fluid are affected by particles with different average energies.
5. Recently, the effects of non-linear backreaction of accelerated particles on the maximum achievable energy and geometry have been investigated. The maximum energy of particles accelerated in supernova remnants in the presence of large acceleration efficiencies was also studied.
6. A practical solution of the acceleration problem in the non-linear regime was recognized, and a simple analytical broken-power-law approximation of the non-linear spectra was presented. Recently, some promising analytical solutions of the problem of non-linear shock acceleration have appeared in the literature.
7. Numerical simulations have been instrumental in identifying the dramatic effects of the particles backreaction, which shows up as a peculiar flattening of the spectra of accelerated particles at the highest energies. The analytical approaches reproduce well the basic features arising from nonlinear effects in shock acceleration.

1. The text discusses the evidence from type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large scale structure that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase.
2. This result is attributed to the existence of a dark energy sector with negative pressure, which eventually dominates over cold dark matter and drives the universe's accelerating expansion.
3. The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, which has an equation of state parameter.
4. However, the cosmological constant model is plagued by the cosmological constant problem, where the observed value is much smaller than the expected one from quantum field theories.
5. The text also mentions the age problem in the @xmath2cdm paradigm and the possibility of an evolving dark energy with an equation of state parameter crossing @xmath3 from above to below in the near cosmological past.
6. Over the past decade, several dark energy models have been proposed, including quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic dark energy, new agegraphic dark energy, and ricci dark energy.
7. Teleparallel gravity, a theory based on the Weitzenbck connection instead of the Levi-Civita one, is another possibility to explain the accelerated phase of the universe.
8. In teleparallel gravity, the torsion tensor is achieved from products of first derivatives of tetrad fields, and no second derivatives appear.

1. In standard cosmology, the acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated based on CMB anisotropy power spectrum measurements.
2. This ""standard ruler"" scale can be measured at low redshifts, such as in large galaxy redshift surveys, to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.
3. However, if CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, the misinterpretation could potentially spread to low-redshift applications and bias inferences.
4. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, which are robustly measured in the CMB.
5. The actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation; only their ratio matters.
6. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality.
7. The epoch of recombination is very insensitive to the cosmology, and the baryon-to-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum.
8. Measuring the potential envelope robustly constrains matter-radiation equality, and the dependence of the sound horizon on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality is relatively small.
9. Understanding the acoustic oscillations at recombination allows us to translate knowledge of the sound horizon into knowledge of wavelength of the baryonic features in the mass power spectrum.
10. Measuring the scale of the acoustic oscillation at low redshift in a galaxy survey can isolate the cosmology between the survey redshift and the recombination redshift, allowing us to search for dynamical shenanigans at high redshift.

2. Solar neutrino experiments have also provided evidence for neutrino oscillations, and accelerator and reactor experiments have given strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters.
3. The LSND experiment at Los Alamos reported evidence for neutrino oscillation, specifically @xmath2 oscillation.
4. The goal is to determine neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles, which may help infer the neutrino mass matrix and potentially lead to a more fundamental theory beyond the Standard Model.
5. The text proposes an ansatz for the 3 generation neutrino mass matrix, specifically eq. (1.1), and investigates its consequences.
6. In an SO(10) grand unified model, each generation contains one light massive two-component neutrino and a heavy one that is ""integrated out"" using the seesaw mechanism.
7. The effective neutrino mass matrix takes the form of eq. (2.1), where the mass matrices of the light neutrinos, heavy neutrinos, and heavy-light mixing are involved.
8. The assumption that the first term in eq. (2.1) dominates allows for the derivation of eq. (1.1), which corresponds to the approximate signature of grand unification.
9. The matrices appearing in eq. (2.3) are essentially unrestricted complex ones, but the assumption that they are hermitian simplifies the analysis.

2. These networks exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, with many vertices having a low number of contacts and a few vertices having a high number of contacts.
3. The heterogeneity in networks of human contacts or animal movements can influence the potential risk of spread of acute and chronic diseases.
4. Scale-free networks have been studied extensively for their implications on the spread of infectious diseases using various epidemic models.
5. The authors generated scale-free networks using the Barabasi-Albert (BA) algorithm and compared their dynamics to networks generated by other methods (MA, MB, MR, and Kalisky).
6. BA networks are more centralized and efficient than other networks, while MB networks are decentralized and have a larger number of components and a smaller giant component size.
7. The authors simulated the spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases on these networks using SI and SIS epidemic models to investigate disease prevalence levels and how fast they would be reached.
8. The authors observed that the prevalence of diseases tends to stabilize in the same level despite the addition of vertices and an increase in the number of edges.
9. The networks generated using the MB algorithm presented the lowest values of prevalence in the spreading simulations, while those generated using the BA algorithm had the lowest values overall.
10. The authors concluded that the topological features of a network can significantly influence the dynamics of infectious diseases and that the intensification of interactions between vertices may promote the spread of diseases.

2. The constant @xmath3 is related to the topology of spacetime and the deficit angle, possibly connected to the gravitational analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
3. The constant @xmath0, which becomes problematic for interpreting LC spacetime, describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass with mass @xmath0 per unit coordinate length.
4. For small @xmath0, LC describes a flat spacetime, but circular timelike geodesics only exist when @xmath0 is null or spacelike, and the Kretschmann scalar diminishes monotonically as @xmath0 increases.
5. If the spacetime admits an extra killing vector corresponding to plane symmetry, the obvious question is what LC represents for values of @xmath15 outside the range (0, @xmath10).
6. The absence of circular test particle orbits for @xmath16 and the fact that most known material sources for LC require @xmath17 led to the belief that LC describes the field of a cylinder only if @xmath0 ranges within (0, @xmath10).
7. However, interior solutions matching to LC exist with @xmath16, and the absence of circular test particle orbits may be due to the fact that the centrifugal force required to balance gravitational attraction implies velocities larger than 1 for the test particle.

Several unresolved issues are highlighted, including the role of collision centrality in relation to the low-x gluon transverse structure of the proton, the nature and systematics of the underlying event (UE), the systematics of minimum-bias dijet (minijet) production, and the possible existence and phenomenology of a nonjet azimuth quadrupole component.

The phenomenological model should offer a conceptual context with two manifestations: (a) as a mathematical framework to represent data systematics efficiently, and (b) as a theoretical framework to provide physical interpretation of model elements via comparisons between data structures and QCD theory.

During the last decades, metamaterials, specifically left-handed metamaterials (LHMs), have gained significant attention due to their negative refractive indices and applications in modern optics and microelectronics. LHMs can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, or yield slow light propagation.
2. The presence of negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) disordered LHMs strongly suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length @xmath0 at long wavelengths. A sixth power dependence of @xmath0 with wavelength @xmath5 under refractive-index disorder was reported instead of the quadratic asymptotic behavior.
3. The effects of polarization and oblique incidence on light propagation in disordered metamaterials were studied, and a fourth order perturbation theory was developed to resolve the problem of non-conventional Anderson localization in bilayered periodic-on-average structures.
4. The localization length of light was calculated numerically for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with alternating indices of refraction @xmath1 and @xmath3 and thicknesses @xmath2 and @xmath4. Disorder was introduced by changing the position of layer boundaries while maintaining the same refraction indices, leading to positional disorder. Two structures, homogeneous stacks (h) and mixed stacks (m), were analyzed, and the localization length was found to depend on the wavelength and disorder for both structures.

7. For energies above few tens of gev, the detected particles, mainly protons, have arrival directions with a remarkably isotropic distribution, which is understood in terms of diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields.
8. The observation of high energy cosmic rays has been recently reviewed by Nagano and Watson, who have shown that there is very good agreement between different experiments including the low and high energy regions of the spectrum. However, there is increasing evidence for a different component of the high energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum, which may have a change of slope and a different composition.

1. The family of iron pnictides is an important system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with several sub-families and a wide structural variety.
2. All iron pnictides share common physical properties, including magnetic behavior with a phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic crystal symmetry and long-range antiferromagnetic order.
3. Understanding magnetic fluctuations in iron pnictides is crucial for unveiling the physics underlying superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated due to debates over itinerant or localized magnetic moments and the role of correlation effects.
4. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an important experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides, but it is difficult to account for magnetic anisotropy due to twinned crystals and mixed magnetic domains.
5. The study addressed the issue of magnetic anisotropy in ARPES data by performing comprehensive DFT calculations on the magnetic phase of iron pnictides and comparing the results to available experimental ARPES data on detwinned crystals.
6. The results showed good agreement between theoretical and experimental data, providing insights into the electronic structure of iron pnictides and the influence of in-plane anisotropy in the magnetic phase.

1. The M31 globular cluster GC B158 contains a bright X-ray source named XB158, which exhibits strong intensity modulation on a 10017 second period.
2. Previous observations by XMM-Newton and ROSAT revealed similar variation in the folded lightcurves, with the amplitude of modulation decreasing with increasing source intensity.
3. Assuming this represents the orbital period, the system is likely a neutron star binary with a low mass donor and a separation of around 510-6 cm.
4. However, analysis of the unfolded 2000 June XMM-Newton lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, with no evidence for dips in the two previous orbital cycles.
5. Further analysis of three proprietary XMM-Newton observations over 2004 July 17-19 found 1100% dipping for one orbital cycle and zero evidence for dips in other cycles, indicating disk precession.
6. Such behavior is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon observed in accreting binaries where the mass ratio is smaller than 10.3.
7. The 2004 July 17 XMM-Newton PN spectrum of XB158 was modeled with a blackbody and a power law, finding a photon index of 2.0 and a luminosity of 1.5 erg s-1.
8. Swift observations from 2013 found evidence for a super-orbital period of 16 days, with the 0.310 keV luminosity varying by a factor of 15.

1. The text discusses the methods used to calculate the energy and lifetime of resonance states in quantum systems, with a focus on the complex scaling method and the density of states (DOS) method. The complex scaling method reveals resonance states by the appearance of isolated complex eigenvalues on the spectrum of the non-hermitian complex scaled Hamiltonian. The DOS method, on the other hand, relies on the possibility to calculate the Ritz variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter, and the localized DOS can be expressed as a function of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix.
2. The text also highlights the challenges of choosing the best numerical solution among the host of approximate values provided by these methods, and the importance of assessing the accuracy and convergence properties of the results. For the DOS method, the values of the resonance energy and width are obtained by performing a nonlinear fitting of the DOS with a Lorentzian function, but the method relies on the availability of a known value of the lifetime, making it dependent on results not provided by itself. The text also mentions the use of finite size scaling arguments to analyze the critical behavior of the DOS in the region where a given Hamiltonian has resonances.

1. The text discusses the study of nonlinear optical systems with parity-time symmetric Hamiltonians, which were originally proposed as an alternative to standard quantum theory with hermitian Hamiltonians. These systems can give rise to completely real spectra and are appropriate for describing physical settings with complex potentials. Recent developments in optics have led to experimental realizations of these systems, particularly in optical waveguiding arrays.
2. The authors focus on the stability and dynamics of stationary modes in these nonlinear systems, using a multicomponent nonlinear Schrödinger equation and analyzing the symmetry properties of the associated linear problem. They find that the symmetry is preserved by the nonlinear term in the context of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, but not in the usual matrix sense. The authors also discuss the existence, stability, and dynamical fate of nonlinear states in the presence of parity-time symmetric perturbations.
3. The text also mentions the potential applications of these systems in creating two-dimensional plaquettes, which may be used as building blocks for constructing larger two-dimensional lattices. The authors propose four basic types of plaquettes and analyze their spectral stability, finding that most stationary modes are unstable, but stable branches were also found in some cases. They also discuss the potential existence of isolated solutions versus branches of solutions in parity-time symmetric systems and the possibility of further considerations of three-dimensional parity-time symmetric lattice systems.

2. Irregularities in the observed-calculated variations led to the discovery of two planets: a 5.7 planet in a 0.013 orbit with an eccentricity of 0.25, and a 7.6 planet in a wider and more eccentric orbit.
3. Despite the system's dynamical instability on a 100,000-year timescale, numerical simulations exhibit long-term dynamical stability for certain models.
4. The presence of planets around a cataclysmic variable is peculiar but could be a natural consequence of their formation or a common occurrence.
5. The planets around HU Aqr allow for a precision reconstruction of the binary history and the derivation of the rate of mass loss during the common-envelope phase.
6. The common-envelope phase caused the binary to lose more than half its mass, reducing the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude. The presence of planets offers unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and evolution of the system.
7. The planets' orbits were affected during the common-envelope phase, with the inner planet migrating to its current orbit and the outer planet responding differently depending on the mass loss rate.

2. The method has been successfully applied to two-body cluster systems and has shown efficiency in various systems. However, it cannot properly describe three-body cluster states, which are essential for studying nuclear systems with such configurations.
3. Recent work has introduced three-body cluster configurations into the method and presented the first results for the @xmath1he ground state and continuum states within a @xmath2he+n+n basis.
4. The extension of the NCSM/RGM approach to properly describe three-body cluster configurations requires expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states. This leads to a set of coupled-channel integral-differential equations, which are solved using the microscopic r-matrix method.
5. The present calculations describe the @xmath2he core only by its ground-state wave function and use SRG evolved potentials obtained from the chiral NN interaction. The results show only one bound state in the @xmath24 channel, which corresponds to the @xmath1he ground state.

Thurston introduced the concept of core entropy and showed that it can be defined purely combinatorially but displays a rich fractal structure.
3. The paper also discusses the relationship between the core entropy and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for a polynomial, as well as its monotonicity along veins in the Mandelbrot set.

They prove that the growth rate of a graph associated to a labeled wedge varies continuously as a function of the angle and coincides with the core entropy for rational angles.

1. The detection of X-ray, optical, and radio afterglows from some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has shown that most long GRBs are of cosmological origin, favoring the fireball model. However, the puzzle of GRBs remains unsolved, with the major issue being whether they are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs.
2. Three methods have been proposed to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs: the first based on the break in the light curve during the relativistic phase, the second on the strong polarization of optical afterglows, and the third on the ratio of orphan afterglow rate to GRB rate.
3. The third method, which involves the detection of orphan afterglows, has great expectations but faces difficulties such as the absence of large numbers of orphan afterglows and the presence of failed gamma-ray bursts (FGRBs) that can also manifest as orphan afterglows.

1. Cosmic bursts of gamma rays, which last less than a minute, have been discovered to produce x-ray afterglows that can be detected for several hours and sometimes days after the burst.
2. Two such afterglows were observed using the XMM-Newton satellite: GRB 011211 and GRB 001025. The former was detected on December 11, 2001, and had a long duration and faintness in both x-rays and gamma rays. The latter was detected on October 25, 2000, and had a shorter duration and peak flux.
3. The optical afterglow of GRB 011211 was identified using data from the Gran Telescopio Canarias and had a redshift of z=2.14. The optical transient was found to be superposed on an apparent host galaxy.
4. The XMM-Newton observation of GRB 011211 revealed a significant x-ray flux decline during the observation, providing additional evidence for its identification as the afterglow.
5. The x-ray light curve of GRB 011211 could be fit with a power law or an exponential decay. The average measured flux in the 0.2-10 keV band was 1.7×10^-10 erg/s/cm^2.
6. The XMM-Newton observation of GRB 001025 revealed two x-ray sources in the error box. The brighter source was analyzed and found to have a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.01 and galactic absorption value of 6.1×10^20 cm^-2.
7. No significant flux variability was detected from the source, but its spectrum was typical for x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. An alternative identification of the x-ray source with a background quasar was considered but deemed unlikely due to the lack of an optical counterpart.

2. AI3 is different from graphene and topological insulators in several ways, including the tilt of the Dirac cones, anisotropy in the Fermi surface, smaller average Fermi velocity, and the presence of additional massive carriers.
3. The smaller Fermi velocity in AI3 leads to a larger effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions, making it an exciting prospect to study strongly-correlated Dirac fermions beyond the scope of graphene electrons.
4. Recent ab-initio band-structure calculations have identified the presence of massive carriers in the vicinity of the Fermi level, but the interplay between massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers has not been proven experimentally.
5. The authors present magneto-transport measurements of AI3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure larger than 3 GPa, where Dirac carriers are present. They show the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes, and the interplay between both carrier types at low energy.
6. The measured mobilities for the two carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.
7. The analysis of the data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity and is similar to the one presented in ref. for multi-carrier semiconductor systems.
8. The magneto-conductivity is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor, and its analytical expression for a single carrier system is given by equation (1) in the text. The magneto-conductivity curve of AI3 under pressure shows two ""plateaus,"" indicating the existence of two different carrier types with significantly different mobilities.

1. Fe-based superconductors (FEBS) represent a class of high-temperature superconductors with unconventional superconducting states. The origin of this state is still debated, but FEBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides.
2. The Fermi surface (FS) in FEBS is formed by Fe 3d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the M point and two electron sheets around the X and Y points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ). In the two-fe BZ, electron pockets are centered at the Γ point.
3. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, with maximal scattering near the wave vector equal to the M point or to the Σ point in the 1-fe BZ or to the π point in the 2-fe BZ.
4. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetries and structures. The random-phase approximation spin fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach gives the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets (d-wave state), while orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have sign-preserving symmetry.
5. Probing the gap structure can help elucidate the underlying mechanism. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for studying the dynamical spin susceptibility in the superconducting state, which carries information about the gap structure.
6. There have been reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems appearing only for Tc or around Tc. The common explanation is that the peak is the spin resonance appearing due to the d-wave state.
7. However, recent measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy show that there are at least two distinct gaps present in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LFeAs. The larger gap is about 9 meV and the smaller gap is about 4 meV in BaCo2As2.

1. The presence of impurities in quantum systems can significantly alter their coherence and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, random impurity distributions lead to exponential localization in 1D and 2D systems, but a mobility edge exists in 3D.
2. Correlated impurity positions, such as minimum distances between impurities, can result in delocalized states in the spectrum. This was demonstrated in 1D for the random dimer model (RDM) and dual random dimer model (DRDM).
3. In 1D, the effects of correlated disorder were studied in various physical contexts. In 2D, the exploration of correlations is almost unexplored, except for speckle potentials and pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions.
4. Correlations in speckle potentials can mimic the presence of a mobility edge, but all states are localized in the thermodynamic limit. Random dimers introduce a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2D lattices, as in 1D, and the main difference between the two models is the decay of the correlation function.
5. The 2D generalization of the DRDM (2D-DRDM) is introduced, where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites. Using a decimation and renormalization procedure, it is shown that there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized.
6. The resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and is the same as the DRDM in 1D. In the weakly interacting bose gas confined on such a potential, the effect of the 2D-DRDM is to drive the homogeneity of the ground state.
7. The disorder induces a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength, and enhances both in correspondence of the resonance energy of the 2D-DRDM single-particle Hamiltonian.
8. The dependence of such quantities on the interaction strength can be explained by including the effect of the healing length in the resonance condition discussion.

1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method for secure communication that is said to be unconditionally secure under certain conditions. However, practical implementations of QKD have faced challenges due to the difficulty of meeting the requirements for security.
2. A new scheme called Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD) has been proposed to address these challenges. In this scheme, neither Alice nor Bob performs any measurement, but they only send out quantum signals to a measurement unit (Mu). Mu can be an untrusted third party, but after the successful detection of a quantum event, Alice and Bob proceed with standard post-processing.
3. MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol and is remarkable because it removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing performance. It has been shown to cover about twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD.
4. The only assumption needed in MDIQKD is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is almost perfect and carefully characterized. The characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit.
5. Two schemes of phase encoding MDIQKD have been proposed and proven to be unconditionally secure with basis-dependent flaw. The first scheme employs phase locking of two separate laser sources, while the second one uses the conversion of phase encoding into polarization encoding.
6. The security of these schemes has been simulated with realistic parameters, and the results imply that the first scheme covers shorter distances and may require less accuracy of the state preparation, while the second scheme can cover much longer distances when the state is prepared very precisely.
7. The study also considers the most general type of attacks allowed by quantum mechanics and establishes unconditional security for the protocols.

Multi-wavelength observations toward five star-forming complexes traced by methanol maser emission revealed that weak-radio continuum flux maser sites are associated with massive, luminous, and deeply embedded cores. However, the spatial resolution was too low to resolve the sources inside the clumps.

2. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion scenario for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion, increases its mass, and then explodes. Significant progress has been made in this model, particularly in sustaining stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
3. There are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. According to the model, these channels predict which companion stars lead to SNe Ia. However, the above evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia has not been confirmed by observations.
4. Observations suggest that a G2iv star may be the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) by measuring velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the SNR. However, confirmation by other means would be useful.
5. A direct method has been proposed to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta. A hint was found in observations of a star called S-M star near a Type Ia SNR 1006. The broad wings observed in the absorption lines of this star indicate that it is located behind the SNR 1006 ejecta.
6. When a star is inside the ejecta of a SN Ia, photons emitted from the star are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward us. Thus, the broad wing must be present only in the blue side, enabling us to identify companion stars of SN Ia.

1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource in quantum mechanics, characterized by conservation laws and manipulated independently of its physical realization. It is useful for making quantitative predictions and quantifying entanglement in pure bipartite systems using the entropy of entanglement. However, the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear in mixed quantum systems due to the lack of complete information.
2. The density operator for a mixed quantum system can be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for the average entanglement. For example, two decompositions of an equal mixture of Bell states have different entanglement values. Various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem, such as entanglement of formation and entanglement of distillation.
3. The entanglement of formation is defined as the minimal amount of entanglement required to form a density operator, while the entanglement of distillation is the guaranteed amount of entanglement that can be extracted from a density operator. These measures satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure set out by Horodecki et al. and give the value zero for some states, such as the separable state.
4. Quantum trajectory theory can provide insight into the behavior of open quantum systems and the long-term behavior of entangled systems. For example, in the case of a cascaded qubit system, quantum trajectory theory reveals a distinct bimodal behavior at resonance, where the system either evolves into a maximally entangled bell state without emitting photons or an entangled-state cycle is initiated under which the system switches indefinitely between orthogonal bell states while emitting a continual stream of photons.

1. The text discusses a study on the infrared emission anisotropy of Type 1 and Type 2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies.
2. The authors used host-galaxy subtraction for radio galaxies and clumpy torus models for interpretation. They found that the average infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Type 1 and Type 2 AGN differ significantly, with Type 1 AGN showing stronger emission in the near-infrared.
3. The authors analyzed the origin of the anisotropy by fitting extinction models and clumpy torus models to the observations. They found that a single absorber and emitter (the dust torus) may be responsible for the radio galaxy/quasar anisotropy.
4. The study also showed that the quasar/radio galaxy ratio in the mid-infrared gradually decreases from 20 to 2 and then increases again up to about 3, indicating a range of sed shapes in the sample.
5. The authors concluded that the observed anisotropy is likely related to torus orientation and strongly suggests that the observed anisotropy is a measure for the intrinsic anisotropy of luminous Type 1 and Type 2 AGN.

1. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) between Alice and Bob has seen advancements in theory and experiment, but security loopholes remain due to the neglect of monitoring the local oscillator (LO) intensity.
2. In practical systems, LO intensity fluctuates during key distribution, and if not monitored or quantified, it can open a loophole for Eve to intercept partial or full secret keys without being detected.
3. Eve can exploit this loophole by reducing the LO intensity, which can lead to underestimated channel excess noise and undetected intercepted information for Alice and Bob.
4. Monitoring and scaling measurements with instantaneous LO intensity values are crucial for maintaining the security of CVQKD, as even small fluctuations can compromise the secret key rate for reverse reconciliation and present a challenge for accurate monitoring over long distances.

1. The text describes a code for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for stellar models, prioritizing simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy. The code offers flexibility in integration methods and the ability to determine all frequencies within a given degree and frequency range. The variables describing the equilibrium model and oscillations were inspired by previous work.
2. The equilibrium model is defined using a minimal set of dimensionless variables, including mass and radius, as well as mass and photospheric radius in dimensional units. The model also includes central pressure and density, scaled second derivatives, and a polytropic index for models with vanishing surface pressure.
3. The text provides relations between the defined variables and more physical variables, such as characteristic frequencies for adiabatic oscillations, and expresses the displacement vector and eulerian perturbation to pressure in terms of polar coordinates. The equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations are expressed in terms of the variables @xmath39, @xmath40, @xmath41, @xmath42, @xmath43, @xmath44, and @xmath45.
4. The code solves the equations on the interval @xmath63, using either a shooting method or a relaxation technique. The shooting method matches solutions at a suitable inner fitting point, while the relaxation technique solves the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions. The eigenvalue is found by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point. The programme also allows the use of two different techniques for solving the differential equations: the standard second-order centred difference technique and the method proposed by @xcite.

1. The highly structured distribution of hydrogen ionized gas (HI) in gas-rich galaxies is marked by cavities, shells, and supershells. These features were first discovered in the Milky Way and have since been observed in several other spiral galaxies.
2. The largest HI arcs and loops, extending across several kiloparsecs, have been identified with greater clarity in the HI images of edge-on spirals such as NGC 5775, NGC 4631, NGC 3044, and NGC 3556. These features are interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like or circular appearance in projection and either a persistence over a wide velocity range or evidence for expansion in position-velocity space.
3. Two main classes of explanations for the supershells posit the source of their kinetic energy to be either internal or external to the parent galaxy. The internal source model involves starbursts, driving stellar winds and subsequent supernova explosions. The chimney model proposes that disk-halo features and other halo gas are produced via processes related to underlying star formation.
4. The starburst model faces difficulties in explaining the required input energies for the largest shells, which can require energy input from staggering numbers of spatially correlated supernova events. This is particularly challenging for external edge-on galaxies, where only the largest shells are observed.
5. Alternative evidence against star formation processes creating the HI shells includes the lack of optical evidence for recent star formation in numerous lower energy HI holes and the absence of X-ray and FUV emission. Some studies propose that gamma ray bursts may be responsible for the HI shells instead.
6. The alternative external source hypothesis invokes infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies. This resolves the energy problem since input energy is then a function of the mass and velocity of the infalling cloud.
7. Observational evidence for this hypothesis includes observations of high velocity clouds around our own Milky Way and signatures of interaction in M 101 and NGC 4631. However, it requires that the galaxy be in some way interacting with a companion or that sufficiently massive clouds be in the vicinity.

Additionally, the Ising model is a well-studied model in physics, with a critical temperature and a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. The XY model in three dimensions is chosen as a model to probe the ability of a variational autoencoder to classify phases of models with continuous symmetries. The order parameter is defined analogously to the Ising model magnetization, but with the L2-norm of a magnetization consisting of two components. The first versions of autoencoders were used for dimensional reduction of data before feeding it to a machine learning algorithm, and they have been surpassed by variational autoencoders in recent years. Variational autoencoders impose restrictions on the distribution of latent variables and learn the parameters of a probability distribution modeling the data, allowing for sampling from the learned distribution and generating samples closely resembling the training data.

6. The unitary operator defining the QCM must satisfy certain conditions to ensure its symmetry and unitarity.
7. The fidelity between the initial and produced states is used to measure the closeness, with a more convenient measure being used for analytical considerations.

1. Colloidal crystals, formed through self-assembly under an applied electric field, exhibit unique optical properties and can be used to produce photonic crystals. The ability to tune colloid-colloid interactions using electric fields leads to exotic crystal structures and direct observation of phase transitions. Experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simulations were used to compare the lattice constant of the crystalline rafts formed with the minimum in the effective interaction potential.
2. The system was modeled using the Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) approach, which considers attractive van der Waals interactions at short ranges and long-ranged repulsive electrostatic interactions. The electrostatic repulsions were modeled using a hard core Yukawa potential, and the dipolar attractions were treated to first order as a dipolar interaction. The renormalized charge of the colloids was calculated using the measured potentials and the conductivity of the particles.
3. Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate the behavior of the colloidal system, and the results showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the lattice constant. The system was found to exhibit a minimum in the effective interaction potential, which provided a useful approximation to the lattice constant. However, at high field strengths, the assumptions of the theory began to break down, and higher order terms or non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann contributions may become important.

The outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with a duration of about 5 years. Type I X-ray bursts have been observed during the declining phase, indicating the presence of a neutron star.
2. The X-ray emission from Aql X-1 during the quiescent state is considerably softer and has a lower luminosity than during outbursts. An intriguing possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) turns on in the quiescent state, providing a missing link between persistent low mass X-ray binaries (LMXRBs) and recycled MSps.
3. The first Bepposax observations during the decay phase revealed a sharp decrease in luminosity, which is well described by an exponential decay with a folding time of about 3 years. The spectra during the fast decay phase and quiescence can be fit with a model consisting of a black body plus a power law. The soft black body component remained nearly constant in temperature but decreased in radius, while the power law component changed substantially.
4. The sharp flux decay leading to the quiescent state is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf nova outbursts but presents important differences due to the different efficiencies in gravitational energy release between white dwarfs and neutron stars. Models of SXT outbursts are built in analogy with dwarf novae outbursts but present significant differences, particularly the steepening in the X-ray flux decrease and the transition to the propeller regime.

1. Swcnt networks, which can be viewed as two-dimensional networks of conducting one-dimensional rods, exhibit interesting electrical behavior due to their large length-to-diameter ratio and the presence of nanotube-nanotube junctions with much larger resistance than the nanotube resistance itself. For sub-monolayer networks, the junction resistance dominates the overall resistance, leading to percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence. For thicker films, conductance through metallic tubes dominates, resulting in metallic behavior of the overall resistance.
2. The frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity of swcnt networks have been investigated for individual tubes and some types of networks. Burke et al. measured the microwave conductivity of individual swcnts and investigated their operation as a transistor at 2.6 GHz. For swcnt networks with 30 nm thickness, the ac conductivity is frequency-independent up to an onset frequency of about 10 GHz, beyond which it increases with an approximate power law behavior. For thicker films with thickness in the range of tens of micrometers, conductivities at dc and 10 GHz are almost the same.
3. In this paper, the authors investigated the frequency- and electric-field-dependent conductivity for swcnt networks with systematically varying densities. They found that the onset frequency extracted from the frequency dependence measurement increases with the film thickness, while the length scale extracted from the electric field dependent measurement decreases at the same time. Using the measured onset frequency and extracted length scale for different films, they developed an empirical relation between the two transport measurement methods.
4. Swcnt networks on pet substrate were prepared by the spraying method and characterized by their sheet conductance rather than conductivity due to the inhomogeneous nature of the conducting pathways. The conductance of these films was measured using a corbino reflectometry setup and a 4-probe method, revealing similar behavior to disordered systems with a universal relationship between onset frequency and dc conductance. The authors also investigated the scaling behavior of the conductance and frequency for swcnt networks and found a scaling behavior with all data sets falling on the same master curve.

2. Grover's algorithm for searching an item in an unsorted database can be carried out with only a quarter of the steps required by classical computation, representing a quadratic advantage. The three-qubit version of Grover's algorithm is probabilistic and requires more complex implementation than the two-qubit case.
3. The proposed work aims to implement three-qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level squids in cavity QED. The scheme is based on resonant and off-resonant interaction of the cavity field with the squid's transition and application of resonant microwave pulses. It does not require adjustment of squid level spacing or identical coupling constants between each squid and the resonator.

It reduces the number of steps required, simplifies the implementation, and reduces the possibility of error. The scheme also considers the effect of spontaneous decay rate from the intermediate level and decay of the cavity field during the implementation of Grover's iterations.

1. In the 1970s, many-body theory was a flourishing topic, particularly in relation to x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the many-body effects on deep core levels in metals.
2. Singularities appeared near edges in absorption and emission spectra, and conduction band electrons had various effects on the xps peak from the core level.
3. If the excitation was considered adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by the conduction band electrons would lead to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy.
4. However, the excitation was not adiabatic, and the conduction band electrons were left in a nonequilibrium state, resulting in shake-up effects.
5. These shake-up effects showed up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum, with the main peak at the adiabatic position and the first replica at a shifted position with the plasma frequency.
6. The main peak corresponded to the system left in quasi-equilibrium, while the second peak represented a state where one plasmon was excited, and so on.
7. In the present work, the authors address pristine and doped graphene, which has a unique system due to its lack of a Fermi surface and chemical potential neither inside an energy band nor in a band gap.
8. Despite this, there is still a low-energy tailing in the pristine case, and in the doped case, the 2D character of the system results in 2D plasmons with a completely different dispersion, contributing to the tail and no distinct plasmon replicas.
9. As a result, making quantitative interpretations of graphene core-hole spectra using Doniach and Sunji fitting is not feasible, and it is more reasonable to calculate the spectra using the tools provided in the material.

1. The phase-field method is a popular simulation technique for studying microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity. It describes the geometry using phase fields, which obey simple partial differential equations.
2. The text discusses several topics where robust phase-field modelling tools are not yet available, including the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification, and the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations.
3. The thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness. The currently available approaches can only reduce these effects to some extent.
4. Orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification have a standard equation of motion for the orientation field that is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
5. The standard approach for including microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
6. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been greatly enhanced in the last decade by a detailed control of their properties.
7. Phase-field models are rooted in the mean-field description of spatially diffuse interfaces by order parameters but need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of physical solid-liquid interfaces and the typical scale of microstructures.
8. The use of the thin-interface limit procedure helps to eliminate physical effects due to the diffuseness of the interface and guarantees precise simulations. This procedure was pioneered by Karma and Rappel for the symmetric model of solidification.
9. The text also discusses the challenges and limitations of phase-field modelling, including the need for further research to develop more efficient and robust models for materials modelling.

1. The text discusses the importance of accurately determining stellar parameters, particularly effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, for studying the Milky Way and other galaxies. Spectroscopic methods are used to infer the characteristics of different stellar populations, with the most reliable way to measure metallicity being through spectroscopy. The atmospheric parameters can be estimated from a spectrum in a consistent and efficient way, avoiding the problem of reddening inherent in photometry.
2. The text also highlights the challenges of accurately determining stellar parameters due to the breakdown of the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Recent studies have revealed significant systematic biases in estimates of surface gravity and metallicity at low metallicity and/or surface gravity. To address these challenges, new methods are being developed to reconcile the effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) and improve the accuracy of stellar parameter estimates.

1. Weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure has been detected in high redshift quasars, intermediate redshift galaxies, and BATSE gamma-ray bursts. The effect manifests as angular correlations between sources and foreground mass in the case of point sources, and coherent shear in the case of galaxies.
2. A more direct way of detecting weak lensing is by using fluxes of standard candles, such as Type Ia supernovae (SNIA). The observed magnitudes of SNIA can be corrected for cosmological distances to reveal the effect of lensing.
3. The analysis presented in the text uses the largest homogeneous compilation of SNIA and finds that brighter sources are preferentially found behind regions overdense in foreground galaxies, with a slope of -0.3 to -0.4 for angular radii of 5-15 arcmin. The statistical significance is at the 2. level.
4. The observed correlation between SNIA magnitudes and foreground galaxy density can be explained by weak lensing or galactic dust obscuration. While galactic dust corrections applied to SNIA magnitudes are too small, galactic dust can change projected galaxy number density by up to 30%.
5. The results have implications for the determination of global cosmological parameters using SNIA standard candles. Weak lensing can affect the derived values of H0 and Omega_m if demagnified SNIA are preferentially lost from the sample or if the SNIA sample size is small and the mass distribution is asymmetric.

1. Lanthanide-based heavy fermion (hf) metals are a class of correlated electron materials with distinct behavior driven by strong spin-flip scattering from localized 3d-levels, leading to large effective masses and low-energy scales indicative of strong interactions.
2. The low-temperature state is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened spins, crossing over with increasing temperature to essentially incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering.
3. Physical properties of hf metals are typically anomalous, with resistivity showing strong non-monotonic temperature-dependence and optics exhibiting rich structure from the microwave to the near infrared, with pronounced evolution on low temperature scales.
4. Theoretical treatments of hf center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.
5. The absence of exact results has spurred the search for suitable approximation schemes, with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) being a major impact in recent years.
6. DMFT is formally exact in the large-dimensional limit, but still retains full temporal dynamics, allowing all lattice models to map onto an effective single-impurity model with a self-consistently determined host.
7. The LMA approach, which has been developed to encompass the Anderson lattice (PAM), provides a many-body description of dynamical and transport properties of paramagnetic hf, including single-particle dynamics, DC transport, and optical conductivities.
8. The LMA approach has been shown to make direct quantitative comparison with experiment for three classic heavy fermion materials and a classic intermediate valence compound.
9. The LMA approach, which is non-perturbative and introduces the notion of local moments from the outset, leads directly to a two-self-energy description, capturing key correlated spin-flip dynamics and restoring local singlet symmetry characteristic of a Fermi liquid state.

1. The text discusses the effects of static and fluctuating tension on semiflexible polymer looping. The looping time dramatically changes as tension varies, and the mean first-passage time (mfpt) can be calculated using the free energy of the chain given the chain end-to-end distance.
2. The mean-field wormlike chain (mf-wlc) model is used to understand the effect of tension on the looping time, which shows that the normalized looping time increases exponentially with tension for short chain lengths. The sensitivity of looping on tension is an emergent behavior that manifests beyond the complexity of real DNA loop formation.
3. In the presence of dichotomic tension, the looping time shows a minimum at an optimal flipping time, and the probability of the dichotomic tension being negative at the instant of looping has a maximum near the mean flipping time. The minimum looping time occurs when the flipping time is comparable to the diffusion time of a Brownian particle in the free energy barrier.
4. The study suggests that the polymer looping in the presence of dichotomic tension can be regarded as the process of a Brownian particle crossing over a fluctuating free energy barrier, and the results are consistent with recent experiments for both static and a fluctuating tension cases. The study also highlights the possibility that a biopolymer can self-organize optimally utilizing the ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations.

1. Tidal interactions play a significant role in dynamical processes in close binary systems, leading to phenomena such as synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, and disruption or fall of an object onto a star.
2. In this study, the authors consider the tidal interaction between a star and a point source, which can be a star or a planet. They take into account the stellar evolution and investigate the dynamical tides.
3. The authors chose three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses and studied their evolution, focusing on the overlap integrals and the change in the planet's orbital period.
4. The star of one solar mass, which closely corresponds to our sun, has a radiative core and a convective envelope on the main sequence. The other two stars have a more complex structure, with a convective core and a radiative envelope.
5. The problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star-planet system.
6. The low-frequency g-modes of the stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides. Tidal interactions are intense at small periastron distances, and the dimensionless excitation frequency corresponds to g-modes.
7. Many exoplanets have been discovered in the last few years, including hot jupiters with short orbital periods and low eccentricities, which points to the importance of tidal interactions.

9. The brunt-v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency is subject to significant changes as the solar age increases, which can directly affect the tidal forces. The star passes from a solar-type star to a star with a convective core and a radiative envelope.

2. Fluorescence microscopy, which uniquely provides noninvasive imaging of cell interiors, has recently achieved nanometer-range resolution using techniques that rely on the accurate localization of individual fluorescent markers.
3. A key challenge for these subwavelength imaging methods is the optical transparency of the media surrounding the light emitters.
4. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique that measures the distance between two fluorophores based on their energy transfer, but determining distances in a scattering medium remains a challenge.
5. The proposed approach in this paper uses the analysis of intensity fluctuations to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment.
6. The method is based on the intensity-intensity correlation function and the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources.
7. The approach permits monitoring the relative distance between sources in the range 10-500 nm, with a precision not limited by diffraction but by the microstructure of the scattering medium.
8. Multiple scattering, which had long been considered a nuisance, can actually enhance the performance of sensing, imaging, and communication techniques.
9. The method replaces the two-point field-field correlation of the background noise with a measurement at a single point of the intensity noise due to the two fluctuating sources, potentially simplifying the technique.
10. The results illustrate that multiple scattering can provide an advantage in sensing, imaging, and communication applications by enhancing performance and enabling the measurement of power fluctuations instead of field-field correlations.

1. The text discusses the mechanical behavior of living cells and how it can be rationalized using polymer physics models. Recent studies have compared cell rheological data with minimalistic _ in vitro _ reconstituted constructs of the cytoskeleton, providing new insights into the mechanical properties of cells. The glassy wormlike chain (GWC) model, a phenomenological extension of the standard wormlike chain (WLC) model, has been successful in describing the rheological data for polymer solutions and living cells over many decades.
2. However, the latest investigations have underscored the glassy, fragile, and inelastic character of the mechanical response of living cells. The aim of the present contribution is to extend the GWC model to situations involving inelastic deformations, focusing on reversible inelastic behavior where the deformation does not alter the microscopic ground state. The protocol applied by Trepat _ et al. _ provides a paradigmatic example of reversible inelastic behavior, where cells are subjected to a transient stretch and recover their initial linear material properties after some waiting time.
3. The extended model can be formulated using the notion of an effective interaction potential, and the physical mechanism underlying the mechanical response under pulsed and periodically pulsed loading is explained. The model exhibits the hallmarks of nonlinear cell mechanics, including strain/stress stiffening, fluidization, and cyclic softening. The relevance of recently quantified structural heterogeneities in networks of semiflexible polymers for the mechanical properties is also investigated.

1. The text discusses the study of topological mott insulators (TMIs) in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. The authors found that the long-period charge density wave (CDW) state is more stable than the previously estimated CDW state with smaller unit cells. To stabilize the TMI, the fermi velocity at the dirac point needs to be suppressed below the standard dirac dispersion. This is realized by introducing third neighbor hopping in the honeycomb lattice.
2. The authors also examined the effect of on-site coulomb repulsion on the stability of the TMI. They found that increasing the on-site coulomb repulsion decreases the value of the order parameter of the TMI but does not destroy its stability. It also suppresses the emergence of the CDW.
3. The study also estimates the single-particle excitation gap induced by the TMI, which is crucial for its applications as a spintronics platform. The estimated gap is substantially larger than room temperatures, and topological insulators with such a large gap are possibly obtained by using abundant carbon atoms. The authors plan to further analyze experimental methods of controlling the stability of the TMIs and perform _ab initio_ quantitative estimates of the stability for bilayer graphenes.

1. Graphene, a two-dimensional material, has attracted interest from various communities due to its potential for atomic-scale circuit devices and new topological phases. One community sought to gap the massless Dirac spectrum in Bernal stacked bi-layer graphene, bringing the graphene-based transistor closer to reality.
2. However, the realization of a gate-induced band gap introduced a new puzzle: the gapped bilayer is not as insulating as expected. Dominant transport along the physical edge of the samples was ruled out by Corbino geometry measurements, which observed two-dimensional variable range hopping temperature dependence, independent of geometry.
3. A new solution was proposed: the existence of topological gapless channel of transport along recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary networks. This prediction holds the promise of the first realization of topological surface/edge states hosted by structural topological defects.
4. The tilt boundary is a structural topological line defect along which each neighboring layer is displaced by one inter-atomic spacing. It forms a boundary between two inequivalent stacking structures, AB and BA. The tilt boundaries host gapless modes of topological origin and form the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states.
5. The electronic structure of tilt boundaries with pure shear (armchair) is gapped, though the gap magnitude is small when the tilt boundary is spread over a finite width. In contrast, the electronic structure of tilt boundaries with pure strain (zigzag) is gapless.
6. The bulk of each domain is gapped in the presence of inter-layer hopping and an external electric field, which is important for breaking the inversion symmetry between the layers and gapping otherwise touching bands. Microscopic calculations confirmed the existence of gapless edge states at tilt boundaries.
7. The findings have important experimental implications. The transport through the network of tilt boundaries was proposed as a solution to the long-standing mystery of sub-gap transport. Feasible experiments were proposed to test this proposal, including four-terminal transport measurements, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements, thermoelectric imaging, and edge current imaging using scanning squid.

The model deals with the structural properties of networks and their attractors, and the relevance of certain elements in determining the system's behavior. The study also compares the results of the annealed approximation and the new approach, and discusses the distribution of relevant elements and their influence on the dynamical properties of the network.

The Kauffman model is a set of elements with binary variables representing their states of activation, each under the control of other elements and response functions that specify how the element responds to signals from its control variables. The dynamics of the system are deterministic but disordered due to the random choice of control rules. The study investigates the probability distributions of the number, length, and size of attraction basins of periodic orbits and the statistical properties of the system in the frozen phase and on the critical line.

The ADAF model predicts a ""submillimetre bump"" in its spectral-energy distribution (SED), while the standard disc is responsible for a big-blue bump in the SED of luminous AGNs.
3. The first imaging investigations for accretion discs must be promising with future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments that will provide micro-arcsec resolutions. The observational evidence of the ADAF is crucial in the LLAGN radio sources.
4. Although the ADAF model successfully explains the broadband spectra of LLAGNs, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands. This indicates that additional unknown emission exists and may be buried under it.
5. The submillimetre bump means a highly inverted spectrum at centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelengths of spectral index @xmath3, where @xmath4, @xmath5 is flux density at frequency @xmath6. Observations for LLAGNs have been carried out exclusively at centimetre bands due to their very faint radio sources.
6. About half of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions hold a compact radio core, and at least 25% of transition objects also hold a compact core at 15 or 8.4 GHz in 0.152.5 arcsec resolutions. Most of the cores show nearly flat spectra in 0.5-arcsec resolution, indicating jet domination.

1. Scattering, absorption, and reradiation of photons by dust grains affect the propagation of starlight and play a key role in regulating the energy balance in the interstellar medium.
2. Studies of these processes have provided insights into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains, and it is important to disentangle the effects of intervening dust from various astronomical observations.
3. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and this dependence can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law or reddening law.
4. Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (1989) found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and the slope of the extinction law, and they devised a one-parameter family of empirical fitting functions to characterize the observed range of extinction law shapes.
5. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with diffuse interstellar dust having an average @xmath0 value of 3.1, but significant deviations from this value and corresponding differences in the overall shape of the extinction/reddening law exist for various interstellar dust clouds.
6. The scatter in the hb of the differentially-reddened globular cluster ngc 4833 is used to measure the angular power spectrum of dust on scales smaller than the angular resolution of thermal emission maps, and the results indicate that the power spectrum varies from field to field and is not universal.
7. Interstellar dust causes extinction and reddening of starlight and reprocesses the energy, leading to dust patchiness that has a profound impact on the accuracy of many astronomical measurements even at high galactic latitudes.

The methods are based on the premise that the width of the blue horizontal branch is minimized when the appropriate @xmath0 value is used to correct for extinction and reddening.

1. The text discusses the results of dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations for the Kondo lattice model (KLM) on a square lattice, focusing on the investigation of the ground state and the evolution of the single-particle spectral function. The calculations were carried out for various values of the magnetic coupling and conduction electron density.
2. The study reveals that the KLM exhibits a kondo insulator phase at half-filling and with particle-hole symmetry, where the minimum of the valence band lies at the bottom of the Brillouin zone, and the maximum of the conduction band is at the top. In this phase, the lower band runs very flat around the Fermi energy with relatively low spectral weight, indicating kondo screening of the impurity spins and the resultant large effective mass of the composite quasi-particles.
3. As the system is doped with holes, the lower energy band flattens out progressively, becoming almost flat by a certain doping level. This leads to the formation of a fermi surface with holes centered around a wave vector in the Brillouin zone. The staggered magnetization of the system decreases gradually as the system is doped and vanishes smoothly at a quantum critical point.
4. The results are summarized in the magnetic phase diagram, which shows the evolution of the magnetic order with decreasing values of the magnetic coupling and increasing dopings. The rkky interaction progressively dominates over the kondo scale, leading to the stabilization of the magnetic metallic state. The calculations were carried out with the DCA value for the magnetization and varied to obtain the best qualitative fit to the respective DCA spectrum.

1. A recent discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of a resonance at 125 GeV compatible with the expectations for the Higgs particle is a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles.
2. This discovery should also affect the subfield of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
3. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature may be beneficial for having the Higgs responsible for inflation and as a suppression mechanism for the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields.
4. Upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons from LHC experiments have been discussed, and bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity can be obtained by considering strong-gravity astrophysical objects.
5. The presence of strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles, such as the electron.
6. Nucleons, however, should be minimally affected by the strong curvature since most of their mass arises from gluonic fields that are not coupled to the Higgs field at tree level.
7. Peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions and strongly suppressed for molecular transitions, due to the vanishing of the Ricci scalar for spherically symmetric objects.
8. The only non-zero curvature scalar outside spherically symmetric masses is the Kreschmann invariant, and bounds to the Kreschmann coupling to the Higgs field in a Lagrangian of the form (1) are considered.
9. White dwarfs, which have had a prominent role in fundamental physics since the early 20th century, are used to obtain limits on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant by means of spectroscopic observations of a carbon-rich white dwarf, bpm 27606, using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT).

1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into distinct phases: hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium. Star formation occurs in cold dense gas, with a star formation rate strongly correlated with molecular gas content. The link between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution relies on understanding the pathways and conditions for cold, molecular gas development. The gas temperature sets the size and mass of prestellar cores in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity far below its mean.
2. The atomic-to-molecular transition within large-scale, three-dimensional simulations has received less attention than dynamical simulations. Simulations have shown success in reproducing a multiphase ISM or demonstrating the regulation of the star formation rate by stellar feedback. However, studies examining the atomic-to-molecular transition within large-scale simulations have received less attention. Some simulations have included an atomic-dissociating fuv photo-background but assumed it to be constant in both space and time. A recent study conducted a series of galactic-scale simulations including supernova feedback, non-equilibrium chemistry, and radiative shielding based on the treecol algorithm. The amount and distribution of molecular gas depend sensitively on a number of parameters, particularly the precise rhythm and spatial distribution of supernovae. While these simulations have provided insight into the relationship between dynamics and chemistry, their treatment of photodissociation is extremely primitive.

This feature, labeled as the vertical extension of the red clump (VRC), is interpreted as an intervening population of stars or tidal debris.
2. However, the authors argue against this interpretation based on the presence of the VRC in all their lmc fields, its agreement with the blue loops in stellar evolution models, and its consistency with the solar neighborhood hipparcos data. They suggest that the VRC is due to stellar evolution, not an intervening population.

1. The text discusses a study using data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to investigate the relationship between star formation and cluster mass and location within a cluster. The study identifies 109 star-forming demi-lirgs in 69 clusters and finds that both the fraction of demi-lirgs and the mean specific star formation rate (mssfr) of cluster galaxies increase with projected distance from the cluster center. However, the fraction of demi-lirgs remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.
2. One possible explanation for the suppressed demi-lirg fraction at large radii is that even galaxies that reside significantly beyond the virial radius have already been quenched in their previous environments, such as small groups or filaments. The study also investigates the impact of cluster mass on star formation by presenting the total cluster star formation rate normalized by the cluster mass as a function of mass.
3. The study finds no evidence of a correlation between the cluster specific star formation rate and cluster mass, suggesting that cluster mechanisms which scale with cluster mass, such as ram pressure or harassment, are not likely to play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in local clusters. The study also confirms this result with a lower detection limit and a larger sample size.

1. The frozen nucleon approximation is a method used to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic fermi gas model (rfg) efficiently. It neglects the momentum dependence of the two holes in the ground state and requires the use of an effective propagator for the resonance conveniently averaged over the fermi sphere. This approximation makes it possible to compute the responses with only a one-dimensional integral, which can be used instead of the full 7d integral, obtaining very satisfactory results.
2. The validity of the frozen approximation was investigated by comparing the exact results with the frozen approximation in the rfg for the nucleus carbon with fermi momentum 350 mev/c. The results showed that the frozen approximation quenches and broadens the peak of the propagator, reducing its strength and enlarging its width, which drives the actual shape of the exact 2p-2h nuclear responses. The frozen approximation was also compared with the shell model results, showing similarities but also differences due to the different coupling constants and form factors used in the models.

1. The text describes the optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of a new low luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), h 0507 + 164, using the reverberation mapping technique to estimate the black hole mass and the size of the Broad Line Region (BLR). The observations were carried out for about a month at the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and the data reduction and analysis were performed using standard procedures.

1. The broad emission iron lines in active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries are believed to originate close to the black hole due to reflection on the accretion disc. The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in determining the line shape, particularly the position of the marginally stable orbit.
2. The innermost stable orbit occurs closer to a black hole with a higher spin value, and the spin affects the overall shape of the line. For about two decades, the LAOR model has been the most widely used relativistic disc spectral line model, but it sets the dimensionless angular momentum to a canonical value and cannot be subject to data fitting.
3. Recent studies have relaxed this limitation and allowed the angular momentum to be fitted in the suite of Ky models. Other numerical codes have also been developed independently with similar functionality. The LAOR model can still be used for spin estimation if the inner edge of the disc is identified with the marginally stable orbit.
4. The authors aim to compare the LAOR and KY models using the current XMM-Newton data and artificial data for an upcoming X-ray mission. They have chosen two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit an extremely skewed iron line and have marginally stable orbits.
5. The authors used the SAS software and standard tools to reduce the XMM-Newton data and prepare and fit the spectra. The sources have significantly different exposure times, leading to better statistical constraints for the active galaxy MCG-6-30-15. Both sources are well described by a continuum model plus a broad iron line model.
6. The authors find that the KY model leads to a better defined minimum for the best fit value and more regularly shaped confidence contour plots, indicating a smoother adjustment between different points in the parameter space. The LAOR model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.

1. The text discusses the application of the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method to generate static disks made of perfect fluid from spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates. The method involves disregarding the part of space containing the center of a sphere and inverting the remaining space to obtain a disk surrounded by a cap of perfect fluid.
2. The generated class of disks is made of a perfect fluid with well-behaved density and pressure. The energy density and pressures decrease monotonically and rapidly with radius, and the disks become more relativistic as the ""cut"" parameter decreases. Regions of unstable circular orbits are more likely to appear for high relativistic disks.
3. The article presents models of disks with halos obtained from different known exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates. The disks have positive energy density and equal radial and azimuthal pressures (perfect fluid), and the sound velocity and tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion are less than the velocity of light.
4. The text also discusses the common features of the disks studied in the article, such as the decreasing functions of radius for surface energy density and pressures, the increasing tangential velocity with radius and its maximum value at the boundary for some solutions, and the decreasing function of radius for the sound velocity, except for one solution where it reaches its maximum value at the boundary. The presented disks can be used to describe more realistic models of galaxies than most already studied disks since they do not require the counter rotation hypothesis to have a stable configuration.

In 1971, it was theoretically shown that strong enough hf radio beams could excite weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionospheric plasma.
2. Experiments in the 1970s at Platteville in Colorado and Arecibo in Puerto Rico demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation of ionosonde records, and excitation of spread F, among other effects, after the hf transmitter was turned on. These experiments also triggered weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionosphere.
3. In the 1980s, experiments in Troms, Norway, observed strong, systematic, structured, wide-band secondary hf radiation escaping from the interaction region. These observations demonstrated the complexity of interactions, including weak and strong em turbulence and harmonic generation, in these experiments.
4. Numerical simulations have become an essential tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence. Analytical and numerical studies of Langmuir turbulence and upper-hybrid/lower-hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas have been conducted.

In this letter, the authors present a full-scale simulation study of the propagation of an hf em wave into the ionosphere, using ionospheric parameters typical for the high-latitude EISCAT heating facility in Troms, Norway. This is the first simulation involving realistic scale sizes of the ionosphere and the wavelength of the em waves.
6. The results suggest that such simulations will be a powerful tool to study hf-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level for direct comparison with experimental data. The simulation propagates the em pulse through the neutral atmosphere until it reaches the ionospheric layer, where it undergoes faraday rotation and excites both the r-x and l-o mode pulses.

1. The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid Mott-Insulator transitions in various systems, including cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices. This model is attractive due to the possibility of directly manipulating and testing the many-body behavior of a system of trapped bosonic atoms.
2. The Mott-Insulator quantum phase transition is driven by the interplay of the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy. The ratio of the onsite energy and the bandwidth forms the key parameter in the system, which can be easily controlled and varied in optical lattices.
3. The essential physics of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic Mott-Hubbard model. The gutzwiller approach, which is based on an ansatz for the many-body ground state that factorizes into single lattice-site wavefunctions, has been used to obtain an approximate variational solution for the Mott-Hubbard Hamiltonian. However, it fails to describe the correct behavior of short-range correlations between different lattice sites, which are important for experimentally measurable observables such as expansion patterns.
4. To get a satisfactory description of the short-range correlations, perturbative corrections to the gutzwiller mean-field result are derived. These corrections improve the wavefunction and grand-canonical energy obtained from perturbation theory. The results show important modifications to single-site observables as well as to the correlation function, which are crucial for determining the location of the insulator-superfluid transition.

They augment the target space to a larger space of lorentzian signature, where the logarithm of the scale factor plays the role of time. Flat cosmologies are null geodesics in this metric, and when the potential changes sign, the tangent to the geodesic becomes null just as the scalar fields take values for which the potential is zero. The second step is to further enlarge the target space to a doubly-augmented target space, which includes all the previous cases and allows for the study of non-flat cosmologies. Accelerating cosmologies correspond to geodesics within the lightcone, and the tangent vector lies within the acceleration cone when the potential is positive.

1. An optically faint and red star, later identified as LSPM J2322 + 7847, was discovered to have common proper motion with the active G9V star HIP 115147. The initial identification was based on Luyten's (1967) report of a magnitude 17 object with a specific proper motion and position angle.
2. New photometry and preliminary trigonometric parallax astrometry were obtained for HIP 115147, its known visual companion HIP 115147b, and LSPM J2322 + 7847. The results suggested a young age and origin for this interesting triple system.
3. Photometric observations of the system were taken using the 1.0-meter reflector at the Flagstaff Station in August 2005 and June 2007. The calibration was done using the standard field PG2213-006 from the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey.

5. HIP 115147 was identified as the bright X-ray source H2311+77, which suggested RS CVn-type activity. However, it was later determined that the star is not evolved and not a short-period spectroscopic binary, making the currently accepted classification as a very young, naked post-T Tauri dwarf.

1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in which quarks and gluons degrees of freedom are mostly liberated. The study of hot and dense nuclear matter in the form of QGP has been ongoing for about thirty years. Experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have provided hints of QGP formation, with consensus favoring the creation of a quark-gluon liquid at very low viscosity.
2. The Landau Fermi liquid theory describes relativistic systems such as nuclear matter, quark matter, and quark-gluon plasma. Using this theory, the energy density of weakly interacting quarks in QGP can be evaluated. The energy density is given by equations (1), (2), (3), and (7), with the Landau-Fermi interaction function related to the two-particle forward scattering amplitude.
3. The thermodynamic properties of the interacting QGP, including energy density, entropy, and free energy, are calculated. The energy density is given by equation ([tatsumi]), with the quark degeneracy for two flavors. The thermodynamic quantities are obtained as functions of chemical potential and temperature, but it is more practical to express them as functions of baryon density and temperature.
4. The phase diagram of QGP is extracted by solving equation ([xmath72]). Both the weakly interacting QGP and the hadronic pressures are considered. The one-gluon exchange interaction, which is repulsive, causes the quarks to transition to the deconfined phase at lower densities and temperatures. The results depend on the values of bag pressure and the coupling constant, and future work could adjust the phase diagram to get the relation between these parameters and generalize the method for non-constant coupling and bag pressure.

1. A conformally symmetric model was proposed for strong interactions at low energies, based on the observation that gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form under conformally-flat metrical fields. The model introduces two scalar fields that spontaneously break the symmetry down to @xmath8 and @xmath9, respectively, and a symmetric second-order tensor field that serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism. Quarks and gluons, which do not couple to this tensor field, are confined to an anti-de Sitter (ads) universe.
2. The model was simplified to only survive its main property, namely its flavor-independent oscillations, by coupling the full ads spectrum to the channels of two or more hadronic decay products for which scattering amplitudes can be measured. The ads spectrum reveals itself through structures observed in hadronic mass distributions.
3. An experimental signal with the shape of a narrow breit-wigner resonance was observed in preliminary radiation data of the babar collaboration, which may be a light scalar particle mediating quark-pair creation. The particle's scalar properties make it a candidate for the quantum associated with the above-discussed scalar field for confinement.

1. The text discusses the results of thermal conductivity measurements on two single crystals of YBaCuO high-temperature superconductor (HTS) at different temperatures and magnetic fields. The measurements reveal a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity below a critical temperature (Tc) due to the presence of a predominant d-wave gap symmetry.
2. The text also explains that the thermal conductivity patterns are not free of phononic contribution, but it is constant under variations of magnetic field orientations due to the unlikely presence of Josephson vortices with normal cores and the lack of experimental evidence for substantial phonon-electron scattering.
3. The text introduces a model that involves a doppler shift (ds) in the energy spectrum of quasiparticles and accurate inclusion of impurity scattering to explain the variation of thermal conductivity with temperature and magnetic field. The model predicts an increase in oscillation amplitudes with increasing magnetic field strength.
4. The text also mentions that neither the ds nor the Andreev scattering (as) mechanism alone can explain the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation amplitude in the whole field range, and a more realistic picture of thermal transport should take both mechanisms into account. The text also discusses the competition between thermal activation of quasiparticles and the gap structure, and the importance of considering the inelastic scattering rate in the calculations.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have received attention due to their calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariant soft terms. However, they suffer from negative slepton mass-squared parameters.
2. A solution to this problem is to add a universal mass term for scalars, which renders the soft terms positive. The parameter space of the minimal AMSB model (mAMSB) is given by m_0, m_3/2, sign (μ), and the mass of the bino gaugino can lead to a small perturbation or the largest soft susy breaking parameter in the visible sector.
3. Hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMSB) is a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB but localizes susy breaking at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region. The warping suppresses contributions from tree-level gravity mediation and anomaly mediation can become the dominant source of susy breaking in the visible sector.
4. The mass spectra of various sparticles in AMSB and HCAMSB models differ significantly. In AMSB, the sleptons have negative mass-squared values, while in HCAMSB, the stops and sbottoms have negative squared masses. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.
5. The hCAMSB model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if the mass of the gravitino is not too large. The presence of chargino and neutralino candidates in cascade decay events reflects the mass ordering in the hCAMSB model, while in the mAMSB model, the mass ordering is reversed.
6. The mass spectra and parameters of three case study points, amsb, hcamsb1, and hcamsb2, are compared using ISASUGRA. The hCAMSB models exhibit a severe left-right splitting of scalar masses, while left-right degeneracy tends to occur in mAMSB. The light third generation squarks are expected to be generically lighter in hCAMSB models, leading to cascade decays with large multiplicities of quarks in the final state.

1. The Zero Range Potential (ZRP) approach is a theoretical framework developed to widen the limits of traditional scattering problem treatments. It allows for obtaining exact solutions and can be represented as a boundary condition or pseudopotential. Darboux transformation (DT) is used to construct exactly solvable potentials and modify the ZRP boundary condition, creating potentials with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.
2. In the case of a central field, the angular momentum operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, allowing for wavefunctions to be expanded in spherical waves. The radial Schrödinger equation for a partial wave with angular momentum is considered, and the generalized ZRP (GZRP) boundary condition is introduced as a potential at the coordinate origin. The DT technique is used to modify the GZRP boundary condition and dress the potential, leading to a chain of integrable potentials.
3. The next step in dressing the ZRP is defining the free parameters of the solutions. The boundary conditions on the dressed wavefunctions require modification in the presence of multiple ZRPs. The DT technique is used to add or remove poles of the @xmath11-matrix, allowing for the construction of a zero-range potential eigenfunction in the multi-center problem. The text also discusses the application of the ZRP model to multi-center scattering problems and the calculation of partial and integral cross sections.

The text begins by explaining how surveys using bolometer arrays at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths have led to the discovery of dusty, starburst galaxies that were previously undetected due to obscuration and unfavorable @xmath11 corrections. The first such surveys using SCUBA and MAMBO radically changed the accepted picture of galaxy formation and evolution.

The text then discusses the challenges in identifying and measuring redshifts for these submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), which has limited our ability to address the true recovery fraction in the radio and determine star-formation histories and galaxy-formation models. Recent progress has been made through the use of independent submm and mm maps, which has resulted in a more reliable submm source catalog and the determination of the true fraction of radio drop-outs among SMGs.

Despite this progress, a detailed understanding of SMGs remains a distant goal, and confusion currently limits our investigations to the brightest SMGs. Existing surveys have employed a snr threshold of 3.0-3.5, but false detections are dominated by flux boosting, possibly at the 1040% level. The goal is to provide a highly reliable submm source catalog, free from concerns about contamination by spurious or artificially bright sources.

1. Rapidity gaps, i.e., pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron. These gaps are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons.
2. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies above 100 GeV and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets. This observation raises hope that perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions.
3. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent based on the fraction of dijet events due to 0-channel color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps of order 10%.
4. The two-gluon exchange model, which replaces the two-gluon loop-integral with its imaginary part, is used to calculate the color singlet fraction. However, the predicted color singlet fractions depend strongly on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer and cannot be reliably calculated within perturbation theory.
5. Unitarity fixes the imaginary part of the 0-channel two-gluon exchange amplitude in terms of the born amplitude, and this imaginary part dominates 0-channel color singlet exchange. However, the one- and two-gluon exchange amplitudes are too large to be compatible with unitarity.
6. Phase shift unitarization leads to a more realistic description, where the total differential cross section remains unchanged compared to the born result, but with 0-channel color singlet exchange fractions which differ substantially from the expectations of the two-gluon exchange model.
7. The unitarized model summarizes non-perturbative effects in terms of the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift. Implications for the formation of gaps at the Tevatron are analyzed, including the variation of the gap fraction with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation.

1. The text describes a study on the effects of a copepod oil composition on atherosclerosis and blood cholesterol levels in female mice. The oil is derived from the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus and is rich in EPA and DHA, but also contains high levels of stearidonic acid (SDA) and wax esters.
2. The study involved three groups of ten female mice, each fed a different diet for 13 weeks. One group was fed a control diet, another group was fed a diet containing 1% copepod oil, and the third group was fed a diet containing 0.1223% EPA/DHA concentrate, to ensure equal amounts of EPA and DHA in both experimental groups.
3. The results showed that the copepod oil significantly reduced plaque formation in the aortas of the mice, both in the aortic arch and the total aorta, compared to the control group. The EPA/DHA concentrate also reduced plaque formation, but the effect was not statistically significant.
4. The copepod oil also had a notable effect on reducing blood cholesterol levels in the experimental animals, while the cholesterol levels in the EPA/DHA group were the same as in the control group after 13 weeks of feeding.
5. The study also found that the copepod oil had a slight triglyceride-lowering effect compared to the control, similar to the EPA/DHA group. The mice grew fastest on the copepod oil diet and had a higher level of fat deposited in the white adipose tissue, but the differences were not statistically significant.

1. The invention describes an electro-surgical dissecting and cauterizing instrument for use in laparoscopic procedures, which includes a rigid insulating sleeve surrounding a conducting rod that delivers electrical energy to a working tip electrode.
2. The novel feature of the instrument is a rigid arm extending from the sleeve, which laterally offsets the working tip electrode from the sleeve, improving the surgeon's view of the operation site. The arm is formed of electrically conductive material and is supplied electrical energy via the conducting rod. A thin insulating jacket covers the arm from the sleeve to the base of the working tip electrode.
3. The working tip electrode comes in various shapes, such as a hook or a flattened spatula, depending on the surgical application. The arm's lateral offset from the sleeve's longitudinal axis provides maximum visualization of the working tip electrode and operation site.
4. The invention addresses two problems with prior art electro-surgical instruments: the sleeve obstructing the surgeon's view of the working tip electrode and inadvertent cauterization of healthy tissue by the sleeve. The arm's lateral offset and insulating jacket eliminate these issues, ensuring easy handling and use by the surgeon.

1. The text describes a disposable finishing article drive member assembly constructed in accordance with the principles of a new invention. The assembly includes a grinding wheel, a backing flange, a retaining nut, and a pressure cap.
2. The grinding wheel has a depressed center and a back surface with a raised portion. A central aperture is provided in the depressed center of the grinding wheel. A backing flange is adapted to be received on the back surface of the grinding wheel about the raised portion. The flange defines a second central aperture aligned with the aperture in the grinding wheel.
3. The backing flange includes lands and reinforcing ribs. The lands engage the back surface of the grinding wheel away from the depressed center, while the ribs are continuous and disposed between the depressed center and the remainder of the grinding wheel. The ribs have gripping means, such as fingers, formed therein.
4. A retaining nut is inserted through the apertures in the wheel and the flange. The nut is then upset to form a protrusion that secures the nut and the backing flange together on the wheel without the use of adhesives.
5. A pressure cap is snapped into locking engagement with the hub assembly. The cap includes a first surface for engaging a surface on the power tool spindle and a second surface that contacts the top of the continuous rib on the backing flange. The cap is retained in position by a gripping rib that snaps over the fingers on the rib.
6. The force necessary to cause the grinding wheel to be placed in compression is generated upon attachment of the spindle to the threads in the nut. The mutual clamping force between the threads and the spindle seat causes the grinding wheel to be placed in compression, which precludes movement relative to the hub or driving member and prevents disengagement from the spindle.
7. The new invention provides a disposable finishing article driving member assembly that requires no adhesive for construction, is relatively light in weight, vibration-free, and less expensive than prior art throw-away articles while meeting all safety standards currently known and in existence.

1. The text describes an invention related to a hydraulic unit for a vehicle brake system, which includes a housing block, a motor, and a housing.
2. The motor is mounted against the housing block and has a securing face, a shaft trunnion, and an eccentric chamber. The eccentric chamber defines a pivot axis for an eccentric that is embodied integrally with a shaft.
3. The motor is displaceable longitudinally by the eccentric, which generates pressure by displacing the pump pistons in the piston pumps. The piston pumps are fixed in the housing block and have inlets and outlet valves.
4. The invention utilizes first conduit portions that extend downward from the eccentric chamber and form a conduit oriented downward from the cam element chamber and discharging into the spring chambers.
5. Pressure fluid dripping from the pistons finds a path out of the cam element chamber and into the spring chambers, preventing dirt and water from penetrating the bores from below.
6. The closure elements, each assigned to one of the bores, are produced in the form of a substantially cup-shaped deep-drawn part and press-fitted into the respective spring chamber.
7. A sealing element is used to supplement the sealing created by the closure element and prevent pressure fluid from reaching the outside even from a beginning of a bore portion that belongs to the conduit portion.
8. The interior of the motor and the housing are pressure-equalized by a pressure equalization conduit, which is formed by interstices between wires of the cable sheath and the tubular cable sheath that sheathes the wires.
9. The cable sheath is introduced into a further sealing sleeve located inside a second plug part, and a plug prong is electrically connected to the wires that extend inside the cable sheath.
10. The invention prevents the invasion of water to the hydraulic unit yet provides a pressure equalization of interiors of the hydraulic unit with the ambient atmosphere, and it moreover brings about the diversion of pressure fluid, entrained by pump pistons, into a region of the unit that is located far from vulnerable electrical parts of the hydraulic unit.

2. Early railroad car center plate assemblies used manganese steel liners, which required frequent lubrication. Later, ultra-high molecular weight polymer (UHMW-PE) liners were introduced, eliminating the need for lubrication but requiring separate grounding apparatus.
3. The Chierici and Murphy patent introduced an all-plastic bowl liner made of UHMW-PE with improved electrical properties. The liner had two slip surfaces, ensuring adequate truck swiveling action and wear-resisting resurfacing.
4. The American Association of Railroads requires railroad car center plate assemblies to be sufficiently grounded to the truck bolster bowl, and the invention exceeds the NFPA standards for static electricity conductivity.
5. The Chierici and Murphy all-plastic bowl liner had to incorporate grounding apparatus, as disclosed in the Wulff patent, using conductive shunt clips and metal rivets. These methods were disadvantageous due to wear and tear, increased friction, and potential difficulties with intermittent contact.
6. The present invention introduces a liner composed of UHMW-PE with a conductive material additive, such as carbon black, to eliminate the need for additional grounding apparatus.
7. The liner is pliable but non-stretchable, compaction resistant, and has a high degree of elastic memory. The carbon black particles are uniformly distributed within the UHMW-PE matrix, enhancing conductivity and wear resistance.

1. The present invention relates to a swash plate type compressor with an aluminum swash plate coated with a durable, heat curable, cross-linked coating of PTFE-based polyfluoro elastomer, lubricious additive, and load bearing additive. This coating allows the use of low silicon alloy aluminum without the need for expensive metal plating or high finish polishing.
2. The coating process involves applying a solution or slurry of PTFE, lubricious and load bearing additives to the roughened surfaces of the swash plate using a liquid spray. The coated swash plate is then cured in an oven at an elevated temperature to form a highly adherent coating with high load bearing and wear resistant properties.
3. The use of the cross-linked polyfluoro elastomer coating may eliminate one or more machining steps currently used in the manufacture of swash plates, resulting in smooth facial and end surfaces with a surface roughness of approximately 0.000020 inch (0.5 μm).
4. Experimental results show that swash plates coated with the PTFE polyfluoro elastomer coating have significantly higher seizure loads and lower friction coefficients compared to uncoated and tin-coated swash plates, and non-hypereutectic aluminum swash plates perform equal to or better than hypereutectic aluminum swash plates with the PTFE polyfluoro elastomer coating.

The catalysts, such as CrF3.4H2O or Cr/Ni/AlF3, have been tested under severe conditions, including high temperature, high concentration of HCl, and the presence of 141b and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane, and the results show high conversion and selectivity for 143a with minimal change in catalyst performance.
3. The process can be run under isothermal conditions, and excellent yield and selectivity are obtained at reaction temperatures as low as 100° C. In another embodiment, the process may be run under adiabatic conditions in a continuous, plug flow adiabatic reactor.
4. The feed source can be pure 142b and HF or other streams containing these two compounds. The reactor can be any vessel that allows the contact of the reactants with the catalyst for sufficient time to achieve the desired conversion. The catalyst can be any chromium salt, supported or unsupported, and salts of other metals such as nickel, cobalt, manganese, and zinc can be used as supported or unsupported cocatalysts.

1. The present invention involves a method and apparatus for forming bias laid, non-woven fabrics with parallel courses of yarns. This is achieved by using a rake mechanism synchronized with, but driven separately from, the conveyors, yarn carrying means, and bonding mechanism. The rake mechanism accepts and retains yarns between its needles, allowing for greater assurance of parallelism and enabling successive courses to overlap for better control of strength and thickness. The rake mechanism can be adjusted to move a full course or a fraction of a course, resulting in varying degrees of overlap and fabric density.
2. The apparatus includes a pair of parallel conveyors with needles extending from them, a yarn carrier system that moves back and forth between the conveyors, and a bonding mechanism such as a stitching machine. The yarn carriers lay yarns at various angles to the long axis of the fabric, and the number of layers and their angles are determined by the end use of the fabric. The yarns are placed between or impaled on the needles of the conveyors and rake system, and the rake mechanism moves in a direction opposite the fabric forming mechanism to place the yarns onto or between the appropriate needles on the conveyors. The use of the rake mechanism and slowing of the yarn carrying means near the ends of their travel allows for complete parallelism within each layer, with or without overlap.

2. The production of nonwoven fabrics is more efficient than traditional textile processes, but they have been disadvantaged in terms of fabric properties, particularly in elongation resistance.
3. To address this issue, the present invention uses a support layer or scrim made of a fluid-permeable material, such as a thermoplastic spunbond nonwoven fabric.
4. The fabric is formed by providing a first and second precursor web, each with a fibrous matrix, and interposing a support layer between them.
5. The precursor webs are then hydroentangled on a three-dimensional image transfer device, which imparts the three-dimensional image while keeping the fibrous matrices separate.
6. The fabric may also include apertures of various shapes and sizes, extending partially or entirely through the layers.
7. The resulting fabric exhibits improved physical properties, such as elongation resistance, due to the support layer and the three-dimensional imaging.
8. The fabric can be used in various applications, including home cleaning, personal hygiene, medical, and industrial uses.
9. The present invention provides a method for manufacturing a durable, two-sided nonwoven fabric with a three-dimensional image, improving its properties and expanding its applications.

1. The invention describes a device for feeding a strip of material into a sewing machine and sewing it onto a cut of fabric. It includes a stop that can be moved into the feed path of the strip and contacted by it to control the operation of the sewing machine. The stop is carried by a control means that includes a control switch and a setting means for adjusting the position of the stop.
2. The stop is mounted on a two-armed lever that is biased by a spring and pivots about a pin. When the strip contacts the stop, it pivots the lever and switch arm of a proximity switch, which in turn activates a cylinder valve to actuate air cylinder 30 and lower the presser foot of the sewing machine.
3. The device also includes a guide apparatus for guiding the strip of material into the stitch forming area and a contact arm that makes contact with the strip when it is in the correct position. When the trailing edge of the strip loses contact with the contact arm, a sequence control is started to switch off solenoid valve 25 and start the final locking operation, stopping the sewing machine, and lifting the presser foot.

1. The present invention relates to a knitting method and a knit fabric for connecting tape-shaped knit pieces in the collar of a sweater or other garments.
2. In traditional methods, tape-shaped knit pieces are formed separately and then joined by sewing or linking, resulting in increased thickness and productivity loss.
3. The invention introduces a connective knitting method that joins two tape-shaped knit pieces during the knitting process.
4. Two tape-shaped knit pieces are knitted on a flat knitting machine with needle beds on both front and rear sides, one or both of which can move in the lateral direction.
5. When the pieces reach a specified length, the rear needle bed is moved, transferring the loop portion of one piece to the other, and the loops are overlaid and bound off to join the pieces.
6. This process continues, decreasing the number of loops in the moving side fabric and increasing the connection strength.
7. The end portions of the joined knit pieces are prevented from loosening, ensuring a secure and seamless connection.
8. The method can be applied to various types of knit fabrics, including plain, rib, tubular, and others.
9. The invention can be used in the collar of a sweater, neck rope portion of a tanktop, lower end portion of baseball stockings, and neck rope portion of an apron.
10. The two pieces of knit fabric are knitted together and the transfers are carried out by a controlled computer following a designed knitting pattern.

1. The present invention pertains to a method and apparatus for enhancing crude oil production using pulsed power electrohydraulic and electromagnetic discharges in one or more wells. These discharges generate acoustic and coupled electromagnetic-acoustic vibrations that can enhance oil flow and increase estimated ultimate recovery from reservoirs.
2. Approximately 66% of discovered oil is left in the ground due to the lack of effective extraction technology for secondary and tertiary Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). A new EOR technology that can be easily and cost-effectively deployed in onshore and offshore field locations would significantly improve performance and increase known recoverable oil reserves.
3. Traditional injection methods rely on the injection of fluid at one well and use of the injected fluid to flush in situ hydrocarbons out of the formation to a producing well. However, once the injected fluid attains a continuous phase between the injection and production wells, efficiency drops substantially and the injected fluid is unable to flush out remaining hydrocarbons.
4. Electrical methods, such as electro-osmosis, have been used to enhance oil recovery by using direct current to stimulate an area around a well and relying on the electro-osmotic effect to enhance oil production. However, these methods have limited effectiveness and range.
5. Heating methods, such as resistive or arc heating, have been used to stimulate oil production by causing resistive heating in the formation. However, these methods are only effective within close proximity to the well.

3. The tool's mandrel is powered by stacked pistons in the tool body, increasing the delivered power from the vibratory tool.
4. The plug is retrievable and has a seal to help close off the passage and build pressure in it.
5. The mandrel has a lower end with a shoulder, and when the plug is landed on the shoulder, it closes off the passage, allowing pressure to build on the pistons and move the mandrel downwardly.
6. The dump valve is cylindrically shaped with a seal ring that initially rides on the valve surface to hold pressure in the chamber.
7. At some point, the ring seal moves off the surface to a larger surface, resulting in a loss of sealing contact and the valve being moved uphole to relieve the pressure built up in the passage.
8. The mandrel continues to move downhole due to momentum, but the valve in the open position and the pressure dissipated quickly causes the momentum to dissipate.
9. The string, now no longer exposed to a stretching force, contracts, and the mandrel and pistons move up relative to the housing.

The housing of the pump head comprises an inlet through which fluid is drawn from outside the housing, and the fluid is moved by the impeller from the housing into at least two fluid conduits, preferably at least three fluid conduits, to be combined into one fluid flow before exiting the pump head.
3. The drive structure comprises any one or collection of structures that is configured to impart rotational motion on the impellers. It is preferably powered by a single power source, such as a motor.
4. The pump heads are connected to provide rigidity and a fluid seal between the pump heads. They may be removably connected or may be formed in a unitary structure. Removable connection permits modularity, facilitating repair or the inclusion of more pump heads in the series.
5. The text also describes a pump head for connecting two other pump heads in a fluid pump having at least three pump heads. This pump head comprises a combiner for combining fluid flow from the at least two conduits into a single flow of fluid that flows out of the chamber along a first fluid flow path into an inlet in a first neighboring pump head.

1. The present invention relates to an air intake device for an internal combustion engine that includes a tank, two pipes with different cross-sectional areas, and a control valve. The tank provides a constant volume, and the two pipes interconnect the tank with the air intake passage. The larger pipe has a cross-sectional area equal to or larger than that of the intake passage, while the smaller pipe has a smaller cross-sectional area and is located upstream of the larger pipe.
2. A vacuum diaphragm actuator is used to actuate the control valve, which is disposed at the tank-side opening of the larger pipe's passage. The actuator has a diaphragm mounted in a casing, a valve rod fixed to the diaphragm, and a vacuum chamber defined by the diaphragm and the casing. A spring urges the diaphragm in the direction toward which the valve is closed, and a vacuum introduced into the vacuum chamber causes the valve to open against the spring.
3. The length of an air inlet pipe placed upstream of the air cleaner is decreased to improve engine performance, but this results in an increase in air intake noise. The present invention aims to decrease this noise while improving engine performance by providing a narrow passage in the smaller pipe that acts as a resonator to absorb the noise. The resonator effect is determined by the relationship between the frequency of the intake noise, the speed of sound, the cross-sectional area of the passage in the pipe, the length of the passage in the pipe, and the volume of the tank.
4. The valve is turned to open or close at specific engine speeds based on the intersection of the volumetric efficiency curves of the engine with the valve open and closed. The valve is preferably closed at any engine speed when the load is below a certain line, and opened only in the region where the load is above the line and the speed is above a certain value. These valve operating conditions can be stored as a map in the control circuit, which produces a control signal for the solenoid valve and thus the control valve based on the engine speed sensor and the throttle position sensor.

3. The present invention aims to provide kinematic mounts with novel damping features to protect instruments from potentially damaging flight loads. Two preferred embodiments of dampers are presented: a spherical damper using viscoelastic material (VEM) and a cylindrical slot damper with o-rings filled with space-qualified high damping VEM.

1. The text describes an invention related to the use of waveguide holograms for controlled illumination of objects, particularly holograms and spatial light modulators (SLMs). The invention is based on thin substrate waveguides and was made with government support.
2. Thin substrate waveguides have specific optical properties that make them suitable for controlled illumination. They allow for convenient white light illumination and uniform illumination. The inventors have discovered that these waveguides can be used to provide improved, controlled illumination of demanding objects.
3. Conventional illumination systems have limitations, such as requiring a substantial amount of space, stability problems, alignment difficulties, and obstruction of other light beams. WGH illuminators offer advantages, including occupying less space, easy alignment, and eliminating stray light.
4. WGH illuminators have high diffraction efficiencies and can achieve very high efficiencies over large area holograms with careful design. They are ideal for minimizing noise and making viewers comfortable. However, they require careful alignment and can have some penalties, such as time delays and clock skew.
5. Nonuniformity of the diffracted wavefront along the propagation direction is a challenge for WGH illuminators. This can lead to illumination depletion and the production of two diffracted beams. Solutions include absorbing the unutilized beam, using a mirror, or using off-axis illumination.
6. For SLMs, WGH illuminators offer new possibilities, such as diffracting out only polarized light and using the SLM to modulate the polarization. The invention was recorded on silver halide plates and illuminated a SLM using a white light illuminator. The quality of the reconstructed beams was analyzed, revealing some nonuniform depolarization and inefficient coupling.

1. The present invention relates to implementing a FIFO-type queue in a functional memory using a tree-shaped structure.
2. In functional memories, updates are made by copying the path from the root to the point of updating before making the update.
3. A typical way to implement a FIFO queue in overwrite memory environments is by using a double-ended list, but this method is ineffective for functional memories due to the large amount of copying required for each update.
4. The invention achieves an improvement by implementing and maintaining a queue using a tree-shaped structure with given maximum-sized nodes.
5. Additions to the queue are directed to the first non-full node on the first edge of the tree, and deletions are directed to a leaf node on the edge of the tree.
6. The leaf nodes remain at the same hierarchy level of the tree, and new nodes are created when necessary to keep the leaf nodes at the same level.
7. Each update requires time and space that are logarithmically dependent on the length of the queue, and the node to be updated is easy to access.
8. A separate header node is used in a preferred embodiment, which comprises three elements: one for the end of the queue, one for the middle part, and one for the beginning of the queue.
9. Additions are made to the end of the queue by copying the leaf node of the end and adding the new record to the copy, while deletions are made from the beginning of the queue by copying the leaf node of the beginning and deleting the last record from the copy.
10. The header node is copied and the inversion bit is updated to invert the queue when necessary, allowing for constant time and space inversion of the queue.

1. The present invention relates to a rotary magnetic head type apparatus that allows independent and precise regulation of bias currents supplied to plural MR heads mounted on a rotary drum in a simple structure. This is achieved by having a control signal generator on the stationary drum side and a decoder circuit and current supply circuit on the rotary drum side. The control signals are transmitted over a single channel of a rotary transformer and set the operating currents of the magneto resistive heads.

This structure requires only one control line for transmission from the stationary side to the rotary side even if the number of MR heads is increased, and since the transmitted signals are digital signals, highly precise transmission is made possible.

The control timing in the regenerative integrated circuit is illustrated in Fig. 9, and the invention enables stable data reproduction and prevention of signal loss due to an increase in head switching time.

[3] The invention positions a mask member below the surface to be planarized, where there is a lower electric field, to protect the dielectric and maintain its integrity. The mask position is in the range of 0.5 to 20 nanometers below the surface.
[4] The invention is particularly useful in damascene type device structures, where conductors are lined with a conductive and diffusion barrier film in thin trenches in an intralevel dielectric material. Masking is employed to protect the dielectric and assist in patterning the trenches.
[5] The recessed mask structure achieves both the benefit of having a recessed surface of the mask with respect to the device surface and a final mask thickness that is selectable and no thicker than necessary. The process involves removing mask material after chemical-mechanical polishing.
[6] The invention provides several benefits, including minimizing damage to the conductive liner from planarization operations, reducing overall capacitance, and providing a lower and predictable overall capacitance for faster signal propagation in interconnect wiring.

The structure's thickness is determined by the effective aperture of the interstices and is sufficient to impart a directional component to the fluid passing through.
2. The multiorifice structure has several advantages over prior art methods for making multiorifice structures. The triangular-shaped orifices are more effective in atomizing the exiting fluid due to their distortion from the natural spherical configuration, which increases surface tension forces and causes the fluid to break up into smaller particles. The method also results in more uniform aperture sizes compared to drilling and photoetching techniques.

1. The text describes methods and apparatus for generating supply voltages for display driver circuits with high efficiencies and low EMI (1-3). This is important for driving large displays without generating unwanted noise.
2. A switching regulator circuit is used, which operates by charging and discharging an inductor to provide an output voltage (3-6). However, these circuits often produce radiated energy as part of the switching process, leading to noise.
3. Charge pump circuits provide energy without introducing noise but have lower current driving capability due to their large internal resistance (6-9). This may not be an issue for small displays but can limit the size of displays that can be driven.
4. The present invention utilizes switching regulator circuits with multiple circuit paths carrying current in opposite directions to cancel out the radiated noise of each path (9-12). Additionally, terminal leads are provided to sink any EMI generated in the outermost paths.
5. The use of terminal leads acts as RF antennas to pick up any leaking fields generated by the last fully-connected paths in the circuit, further reducing EMI (12-15).
6. The text includes schematic diagrams and a timing diagram to illustrate the operation of the switching regulator circuit (15-18). The circuit is operated by switching the transistor on and off to charge and discharge the inductor, providing energy to the load.
7. The invention also includes a description of a conventional implementation of a switching regulator circuit and how it can be improved by the principles of the present invention to reduce EMI (18-22). The use of indium tin oxide (ITO) as a bonding wire in the circuit can result in high resistance and large amounts of EMI.
8. The present invention interleaves the parallel source and drain paths to cancel out the EMI produced on each path (22-25). This is accomplished by configuring the drain path to be in between two source paths, and vice versa.
9. The use of terminal leads next to the outermost fully-functional paths further reduces EMI by picking up any leaking fields generated by adjacent paths (25-28).

1. The text describes a method for charging and balancing the voltages of cells in a battery pack to support a desired drive range. The controller determines the maximum capacity of each cell, the common voltage needed for all cells, and the charge time for the battery pack. If the pack charge time is greater than the maximum resistive circuitry activation times, the controller activates the resistive circuitry for each cell and waits for it to expire before deactivating it. Once all resistive circuitry has been deactivated, the controller charges the battery pack to the target voltage.
2. The method aims to reduce the time spent rebalancing and charging the battery pack by optimizing the charging process based on the individual cell capacities. The controller calculates the required cell voltage and the energy content of each cell to determine the optimal charging voltage for each cell. By charging cells to their individual optimal voltage, the battery pack can be charged more efficiently and quickly.
3. The text also discusses the importance of accurate cell voltage measurements and continuous monitoring during the charging process. The controller measures the voltages of each cell at operation and determines the maximum capacity of each cell using the techniques described. The charging process is monitored to ensure that all cells reach the target voltage and that the battery pack is charged to the desired capacity.

1. GAO has been advocating for strategic sourcing in federal acquisitions since 2002, encouraging a more enterprise-wide approach to services acquisition.
2. Leading companies in the private sector have committed to strategic sourcing, resulting in structural changes such as commodity managers and better leveraging of buying power.
3. Strategic sourcing tactics include leveraged buying, managing demand, achieving efficiencies, evaluating total cost of ownership, and better managing supplier relationships.
4. Spend analysis is crucial for efficient procurement, revealing spending patterns and opportunities for savings and performance improvement.
5. The federal government's procurement spending is decentralized, preventing full utilization of aggregate buying power and leading to inconsistent pricing.
6. In response, OMB issued a memorandum in 2005 directing agencies to develop and implement strategic sourcing efforts based on spend analysis results.
7. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) was established in 2005 to address government-wide opportunities for strategic sourcing and eliminate duplication of efforts.
8. In 2012, GAO found that most agencies were not effectively leveraging their buying power through strategic sourcing, with only 5% of spending managed through these efforts.
9. Data issues, lack of expertise, and a lack of leadership commitment were identified as major challenges to strategic sourcing in the federal setting.

1. The current surface transportation programs are not effectively addressing the nation's transportation challenges due to a lack of clear goals, insufficient links to needs or performance, and inadequate use of best tools and approaches. Many programs are funded through formulas that have only indirect relationships to needs and performance, and some goals have conflicting federal roles. For example, only one federal program is specifically directed at intermodal infrastructure, and most safety grants are more likely to focus on goals rather than specific transportation systems.
2. The fiscal sustainability of surface transportation programs is at risk due to increased spending from the Highway Trust Fund without commensurate increases in revenues. The federal government does not possess adequate data to assess outcomes or implement performance measures, and some funds cannot be transferred between highway and transit programs, impeding efficient planning and project selection. Modally stovepiped funding also limits the use of existing infrastructure and tools to make better use of it, such as intelligent transportation systems and congestion pricing. The Highway Trust Fund is projected to face shortfalls in 2009 for the Highway Account and in 2012 for the Transit Account, and expenditures have exceeded revenues since the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) and Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). Increases in federal funding do not necessarily lead to commensurate increases in total investment in highways due to state and local governments shifting nonfederal funds away from highways to other purposes.

2. The costs associated with safety oversight are primarily driven by the volume of activities, while ATC costs depend on the nature and usage of the services.
3. ATC includes terminal and en-route services, with commercial flights relying heavily on terminal services and GA flights varying greatly in their use of ATC services.
4. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is a grant program that funds airport infrastructure development, with funding not directly linked to user costs.
5. The Trust Fund was established in 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system, and is credited with revenues collected from system users through dedicated excise taxes.
6. The Trust Fund's revenues have exceeded spending commitments since its creation, but expenditures exceeded revenues in 2005.
7. Alternative funding options for collecting revenues from NAS users include relying solely on a fuel tax, increasing the passenger segment tax, weight/distance charges, en-route charges, flight segment charges, and certification charges.
8. Using a combination of workload-related taxes or charges to fund FAA might best address the revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency concerns associated with the current funding structure.

1. The Internet, which relies on the domain name system to ensure the uniqueness of email and website addresses, has grown significantly in importance for American businesses and consumers, as well as for vital services such as power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense. The domain name system functions through a set of rules and a system of servers called root servers, which coordinate the translation of domain names into Internet addresses. The U.S. government supported the implementation of the domain name system for nearly a decade, but began a process in 1997 to transition technical responsibility to the private sector.
2. The Department of Commerce issued a White Paper in 1998 outlining the need for privatization and the guiding principles of stability, competition, representation, and private, bottom-up coordination. ICANN, a private, nonprofit organization, was established in 1998 to manage the domain name system. ICANN made progress in increasing competition, such as allowing multiple registrars to register domain names and expanding the pool of available domain names through new top-level domains. However, progress has been slower on activities designed to address other guiding principles, such as increasing stability and security, ensuring representation of the Internet community, and using private, bottom-up coordination.
3. The stability and security of the Internet is critical, as a single vulnerability in the domain name system could disrupt the entire Internet. The White Paper designated this as the top priority of the transition. ICANN and the Department of Commerce entered into a cooperative research and development agreement in 1999 to develop operational requirements and security policies to enhance the stability and security of the root servers. However, progress on this task has been behind schedule, and recent reports have highlighted the importance of addressing these vulnerabilities. The amended MOU also called for formalizing relationships with other entities involved in running the domain name system, but few such agreements have been signed as of May 2002.

1. The largest government contracting vehicles are the MAS program, GWACs, MACs, and enterprisewide contracts, with $60 billion spent in fiscal year 2008.
2. The MAS program, managed by GSA, is the primary governmentwide buying program for commercial goods and services, providing advantages to both agencies and vendors.
3. Interagency and enterprisewide contracts should reduce administrative overhead and leverage buying power, but reliable data on these contracts is lacking.
4. The total number of MACs and enterprisewide contracts is unknown due to insufficient data in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation.
5. Agencies establish their own MACs and enterprisewide contracts for reasons like cost avoidance, mission specific requirements, and better control.
6. Duplication of effort among MACs, GWACs, and enterprisewide contracts is a concern, with vendors offering similar products and services on multiple contracts.
7. Federal regulations require agencies to consider existing contracts before establishing new ones, but policies and guidance vary among agencies.
8. GSA's MAS program faces challenges in effectively managing the program due to lack of transactional data, limited use of pricing tools, and a decentralized management structure.
9. To improve contracting efficiency and effectiveness, the government needs reliable data, consistent policy, and better coordination among agencies in establishing and managing MACs and enterprisewide contracts.

1. The baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is approaching retirement age, leading to a significant increase in the aged dependency ratio. By 2030, there will be fewer than three persons of traditional working age for every person age 65 or over.
2. Social Security policies have been changed to encourage older workers to continue working. The practice of reducing benefits for those with earnings after the normal retirement age was eliminated, and the delayed retirement credit for those who claim benefits after the normal retirement age has been increased.
3. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) aim to promote the employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age and prohibit age discrimination in employment. However, these laws only apply to firms with 20 or more employees, leaving a significant segment of the labor force unprotected.
4. Pension laws can influence the work decisions of older individuals. To encourage employers to establish and maintain pension plans, the federal government provides preferential tax treatment. Many pension plans have features that encourage early retirement, which can discourage employment after becoming eligible for these benefits.
5. The number of older workers will continue to grow, and they will become an increasingly significant proportion of all workers. Older workers are employed in a diverse range of occupations, with a growing proportion in white-collar occupations. Between 2000 and 2008, the number and percentage of workers over age 55 will increase in all major occupational categories, with the largest change occurring in white-collar occupations.

2. The program requires countries to offer reciprocal visa-free travel, have a low refusal rate for their nationals applying for business and tourism visas, issue machine-readable passports, report lost or stolen passports, accept repatriation of citizens, and not compromise U.S. law enforcement or security interests.
3. In 2002, the Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and gave it responsibility for managing the VWP. DHS created the Visa Waiver Program Office in 2004 to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating countries' adherence to requirements.
4. The 9/11 Act increased the frequency of assessments of each country's continued participation in the VWP and added security requirements, such as sharing information on whether citizens and nationals represent a threat to U.S. security or welfare.
5. ESTA, an automated system to assess passengers' eligibility to travel to the United States under the VWP, was implemented in 2008 and made mandatory in 2009. It notifies passengers of program ineligibility before they embark and has reduced the burden on passengers by eliminating the need to complete the I-94W form at the port of entry.
6. ESTA applications are regularly reevaluated as new information becomes available, potentially changing applicants' ESTA status. DHS has taken steps to minimize the burden associated with ESTA use, such as less frequent applications and earlier notice of ineligibility.
7. VWP country government and travel industry officials praised DHS's widespread outreach efforts to publicize the ESTA requirement but expressed dissatisfaction over the Travel Promotion Act fee collected as part of the ESTA application.

2. States must make reasonable efforts to prevent child removals and provide services to families and children with the goal of reunification. If reunification is not possible, permanent placements must be found.
3. Many states have enacted laws or policies to expedite the permanency planning process, including holding permanency hearings within 12 months of entering foster care. Ohio and Minnesota require a permanency decision after a limited extension period.
4. Some states have implemented operational and procedural changes to expedite and improve the permanency process, such as Arizona's Housing Assistance Program and Kentucky's Severance Project.
5. Concurrent planning, where child welfare officials work toward reuniting a family while developing an alternate plan for permanent removal, can reduce the time needed to prepare termination paperwork.
6. Hamilton County, Ohio, focused on expediting court involvement in achieving permanency more quickly by designating specially trained magistrates, assigning one magistrate per case, and agreeing to hearing dates at the end of each hearing.
7. Initiatives to improve the permanency planning process require long-term involvement, stakeholder consensus, and available resources to plan, implement, and sustain the project.
8. The lack of evaluation data from these initiatives hinders the ability of program officials and policymakers to fully understand their impact and identify unintended outcomes.

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is primarily funded through the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from excise taxes on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and cargo shipments. The Trust Fund also provides funding for FAA's capital accounts, including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account. In fiscal year 2005, the ticket tax was the largest single source of Trust Fund revenue.
2. The administration's reauthorization proposal aims to change FAA's financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges. Under the proposed system, funding for Air Traffic Organization (ATO) would come primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft. Funding for AIP, Safety and Operations, and part of the Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account would come from equal fuel taxes on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers.
3. The current funding structure has successfully funded a growing FAA budget, but FAA has expressed concerns about the long-term revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency of its funding. Some of the administration's proposed changes, such as establishing direct user charges for commercial aviation and substantially increasing fuel taxes for general aviation, are intended to link FAA's revenues more closely with its costs. However, the effectiveness of the proposed funding structure in linking costs with revenues depends on the soundness of FAA's cost allocation methodology and how closely it adheres to the principle of cost-based funding.

The Federal Student Aid (FSA) office manages and administers student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, providing over $50 billion in aid to 8 million students annually. The environment is complex, involving 5,300 schools, 4,100 lenders, and 36 guaranty agencies, and overseeing approximately $200 billion in outstanding loans.
2. In 1998, Congress established FSA as a Performance Based Organization (PBO), with the purpose of improving service, reducing costs, increasing accountability, providing flexibility, integrating information systems, implementing an open, common, integrated delivery system, and ensuring program integrity. The PBO legislation requires the appointment of a COO, development of performance plans, annual reporting, performance agreements, and the use of certain personnel and procurement flexibilities.
3. FSA has taken steps to develop a strategic direction, including increasing customer and employee satisfaction while decreasing unit cost, but more actions are needed to fully meet the goals set out in the PBO legislation. The performance plan discusses strategic goals and associated measures, but could be more useful to congressional decision makers with respect to systems integration and program integrity.
4. FSA uses the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and Gallup Q12 to measure customer and employee satisfaction, respectively, and has seen improvements in both areas. However, the unit cost measure, which divides budget obligations by the number of people receiving aid, has limitations, as it does not measure total obligations per person or explain the basis of the calculation in reporting on performance. Additionally, FSA has not fully addressed systems integration and program integrity in its performance plan, and has not reported annually to Congress as required by the PBO legislation.

1. Program evaluations are systematic studies that assess a program's effectiveness and other aspects of performance in the context in which it operates. They provide valuable supplements to ongoing performance reporting by measuring results that are difficult or expensive to assess annually, explaining performance goal non-achievement, or comparing different approaches. Federal managers reported that evaluations contributed to improving program management or performance, assessing program effectiveness or value, and making changes based on findings.
2. The use of evaluations in decision making is influenced by several factors, including leadership support, organizational resources, and the availability of evaluation results. Managers who reported having evaluations most frequently cited agency leadership support, staff involvement, and evaluation relevance to decision makers as facilitators of evaluation use. However, they also reported lack of resources to implement findings, difficulty obtaining results in time, and concern about the credibility of study results as barriers.
3. The federal government has taken steps to encourage the use of evaluations in decision making, such as the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act (GPRAMA) and the establishment of the Performance Improvement Council. GPRAMA requires agencies to establish priority goals, review progress quarterly, and report publicly on their progress. The act also charges the Performance Improvement Council with facilitating agencies' exchange of successful practices and the development of tips and tools to strengthen agency performance management.

Additionally, the text discusses the findings from a 2013 survey of federal managers, which revealed that most managers lacked recent evaluations of their programs. Despite this, those who had evaluations reported that they contributed to understanding program performance, assessing program effectiveness or value, making changes to improve program management or performance, and sharing what works with others. However, a lack of resources was identified as a barrier to implementing evaluation findings. The text also mentions the strategies identified by experienced evaluators to facilitate evaluation influence: leadership support, building a strong body of evidence, and engaging stakeholders throughout the evaluation process. The text also discusses the key elements of national or organizational capacity to conduct and use evaluation in decision making, including an enabling environment, organizational resources, and the robust, transparent availability of evaluation results. The 2014 survey of PIOs found uneven levels of evaluation expertise, organizational support, and use across the government.

1. The Rehabilitation Act defines a disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities. Federal efforts aim to promote employment of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce and help agencies meet their responsibilities under the Act.
2. Special hiring authorities exist, such as Schedule A and veterans' appointments, to help agencies hire qualified individuals with disabilities. Proof of disability can come from various sources, and the document does not need to detail medical history or accommodations.
3. Executive Order 13548 requires agencies to develop plans for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities, designate a senior-level official for implementation, and report progress to OPM and Labor. OPM and Labor have oversight responsibilities to ensure successful implementation.
4. The federal government tracks disability employment through OPM's SF-256 form, which separates disabilities into targeted and other categories. Targeted disabilities include severe conditions like total deafness or psychiatric disabilities, while other disabilities include partial hearing or vision loss and learning disabilities.
5. The executive order also aims to improve efforts to help employees injured on the job return to work. The POWER Initiative was established in 2010 to set performance targets, collect injury and illness data, and prioritize effective safety and health management programs.

2. The project was later scaled down to $575 million and renamed ALMRS/Modernization, consisting of ALMRS IOC, Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and technology modernization and rehost of selected systems.
3. Between 1983 and 1995, about $296.2 million had been appropriated for ALMRS/Modernization, with obligations totaling $262.8 million. BLM expects to meet its obligations by September 30, 1995.
4. The project aims to establish a common information technology platform, increase public access to BLM records through the Internet, integrate multiple databases, shorten case processing activities, and replace manual records with automated records.
5. The initial installation of computer and telecommunications equipment and about 4,400 workstations has been completed in eight state offices and their subordinate district and resource area offices. However, initial hardware installation for Alaska and Wyoming state and subordinate offices has been delayed.
6. The development of ALMRS IOC software is on schedule, with about 120,000 lines of code developed in build 2 and expected to be completed in build 3. The GCDB component is also on schedule, with nine state offices meeting or ahead of data collection milestones.
7. BLM plans to stress test the entire ALMRS/Modernization system before deployment to ensure all systems and technology can process workloads during peak operating periods. The Bureau has contracted for an independent verification and validation of the ALMRS IOC software and is taking actions to closely monitor the project status and schedule.

The Information Quality Act (IQA) was enacted in 2001 and required OMB to develop guidelines for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated by federal agencies. Agencies covered by the Paperwork Reduction Act were required to establish mechanisms for correcting information and report to OMB about IQA complaints.
2. OMB issued governmentwide IQA guidelines in 2002, which agencies used as a basis for developing their own guidelines. The guidelines emphasized the importance of meeting basic information quality standards, applying the guidelines in a common-sense manner, and providing transparency to the public.
3. According to a GAO report, as of March 2006, some independent agencies did not have IQA guidelines in place, and it was unclear what appeals process the public would follow for requesting corrections from these agencies. OIRA concentrated its efforts on cabinet-level and regulatory agencies and did not clarify for many independent agencies whether the law applied to them.
4. The report also noted that while agencies had received a significant number of IQA requests, the impact of IQA on agencies could not be determined because agencies and OMB did not have mechanisms in place to track the effects of implementing the law. Addressing IQA requests and appeals can take agencies 2 years or longer to resolve and requires a wide range of staff, particularly if the requests center on substantive matters.

1. On June 12, 2002, Congress passed the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, which requires specific activities related to bioterrorism preparedness and response. The Act calls for improving the nation's preparedness for bioterrorism and other public health emergencies by increasing coordination and planning, developing priority countermeasures, and improving state, local, and hospital preparedness and response.
2. The Secretary of HHS is required to establish an integrated system or systems of public health alert communications and surveillance networks among federal, state, and local public health officials, public and private health-related laboratories, hospitals, and other health care facilities. These networks allow for secure and timely sharing and discussion of essential information concerning bioterrorism and other public health emergencies.
3. Since fiscal year 2002, HHS has funded over $2.7 billion for public health preparedness efforts through grants administered by CDC and just over $1 billion for hospital preparedness grants administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. HHS has also encouraged the integration of health care system response plans with public health department plans.
4. The funding guidance provided by HHS to state and local governments calls for improvements in seven key areas: preparedness planning and readiness assessment, surveillance and epidemiology capacity, laboratory capacity for handling biological agents, laboratory capacity for handling chemical agents, health alert network/communication and IT, risk communication and health information dissemination, and education and training.
5. In April 2004, the President established the goal that health records for most Americans should be electronic within 10 years and issued an executive order to develop a strategic plan for implementing interoperable health IT in the public and private health care sectors. HHS has also continued to lead federal efforts in providing public health and medical services during major disasters and emergencies.
6. IT can play an essential role in supporting federal, state, local, and tribal governments in public health preparedness and response. Development of IT can build upon the existing systems capabilities of state and local public health agencies and provide routine public health functions, as well as support public health emergencies, including bioterrorism.

1. The largest sponsors of DB pension plans have made significant revisions to their benefit offerings over the last decade. Eighty-one percent of responding sponsors reported modifying the formulas of one or more of their DB plans. The primary reasons for these changes included unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements for nonbargaining employees and global or domestic competitive pressures in the industry for collectively bargained employees.
2. With regard to plans for bargaining employees, some sponsors also cited inflation or a cost-of-living adjustment as a reason for increasing the generosity of their DB plan formulas. Many sponsors have converted DB plans covering nonbargaining unit employees to hybrid plans, such as cash balance plans, due to trends in employee demographics. Among respondents who answered the cash balance conversion question for their collectively bargained plans, 21 percent reported converting one or more of their traditional plans to a cash balance plan.
3. The majority of respondents (90 percent) reported on their 401(k)-type DC plans, and very few reported having reduced employer or employee contribution rates for these plans. Many (67 percent) of responding firms plan to implement or have already implemented an automatic enrollment feature to one or more of their DC plans. Health benefits are a large component of employer offered benefits, and health care comprised the single largest benefit cost, representing 15 percent of base pay. All responding firms offered health insurance to active employees and contributed to the cost, and all provided health benefits to some current retirees. However, 46 percent of responding firms reported that retiree health benefits were no longer offered to active employees hired after a certain date.

In 1959, Congress amended the TVA Act, allowing TVA to finance its power program through revenue from electricity sales and borrowing, and requiring it to repay a substantial portion of the annual appropriations.
3. TVA's rates must cover all costs but also keep rates as low as feasible. It can borrow by issuing bonds and notes, with a limit of $30 billion outstanding at any given time. Legislation also limits competition between TVA and other utilities.

2. In response, First City, its regulators, and the FDIC agreed that major infusions of capital were needed for long-term viability, but could not come solely from the private sector due to the economically strained condition of the Southwest.
3. In 1988, FDIC entered into a recapitalization agreement, or open bank assistance, with First City, which involved reducing subsidiary banks from nearly 60 to about 20 and infusing $970 million in capital. The agreement also required the creation of a collecting bank to dispose of certain troubled assets.
4. After the recapitalization, First City banks embarked on an aggressive growth policy, increasing assets from about $10.9 billion to about $13.9 billion and reporting $183 million in profits and $122 million in cash dividends. However, problems with loan portfolios caused operating losses and eroded capital.
5. In 1990, the OCC strongly criticized the lending practices of First City's lead bank and required improvements in underwriting standards, bank management and board oversight, strategic planning, budgeting, capital and dividend policies, management of troubled assets, internal loan review, allowance for loan and lease losses, lending activities, and loan administration and appraisals.
6. Despite these efforts, First City banks failed between 1990 and 1992, resulting in losses of about $625 million. The causes included the continued decline in the Texas economy, weaker-than-anticipated loan portfolios, questionable lending activity by management, and high bank operating expenses.

1. The decennial census is a large, long-term project with significant costs and risks, and proper planning is crucial for cost-effectiveness and obtaining congressional support. The Bureau's past experience shows that lack of planning can increase costs and risks, and sound planning is necessary to demonstrate optimal design and effective management.
2. The 2000 Census was marked by poor planning, which added to its cost, risk, and controversy. The Bureau failed to involve key operations staff in initial design phases, did not translate key performance goals into operational terms, did not provide sufficient data on likely effects of initiatives, and did not develop and document design until mid-decade.
3. To prevent repeating past mistakes, the Bureau was recommended to provide comprehensive information backed by documentation in future funding requests for planning and development activities, including specific performance goals, detailed information on program feasibility and priorities, and performance measures.
4. The 2010 Census has four principal goals: increase relevance and timeliness of census long-form data, reduce operational risk, increase coverage and accuracy, and contain costs. These goals are a response to problems experienced in the 2000 Census, such as untimely long-form data, inaccurate maps, coverage difficulties, and expensive, labor-intensive, and paper-laden field data collection.
5. The Bureau's approach to taking the census in 2010 is based on a ""three-legged stool"" strategy, with the mainstay being an accurate address list and its associated maps. The Bureau uses MAF and TIGER to provide maps, geographic location of every structure, address lists, and names and codes for data tabulation. The Bureau recognized the need to update and modernize MAF/TIGER prior to 2010 due to inaccuracies and outdated software.

1. According to HHS, health information technology, including electronic prescribing, can improve patient care and reduce costs. Electronic prescribing allows providers to transmit prescriptions directly to pharmacies, requesting beneficiary information beforehand.
2. Federal laws dictate acceptable uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information (PHI), including treatment, payment, health care operations, and public health or research purposes. Covered entities and business associates work together to gather and confirm patients' electronic health information for prescribing.
3. Electronic health records can be used to obtain patients' health information for electronic prescribing, while prescription drug event data is provided to the individual's health plan for payment. Medicare beneficiaries' prescription drug event data is provided to CMS for Part D payment calculations.
4. Under certain circumstances, PHI, including prescription drug use information, can be used for purposes not related to directly providing clinical care, such as research. Access to this information must follow CMS's policies and data-sharing procedures.
5. HIPAA, enacted in 1996, provides privacy and security protections for individually identifiable health information. It requires covered entities to maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect PHI and establishes civil money and criminal penalties for violations.
6. The HITECH Act, enacted in 2009, strengthens HIPAA's privacy and security protections and enforcement provisions. It requires the Secretary of HHS to issue breach notification regulations and establish enforcement provisions for civil money penalties.
7. OCR, under the HITECH Act, has established a framework for protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including Medicare beneficiaries' prescription drug use information. However, OCR has not yet issued required guidance to assist entities in de-identifying PHI and has not fully implemented periodic compliance audits as required by the HITECH Act.

The Army, Navy, and Air Force all have uniformed health care providers to meet their MHSS medical readiness needs.
2. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists play a role in meeting the MHSS medical readiness mission by providing mental health care to active-duty personnel. Psychiatrists can diagnose and treat mental disorders medically, while clinical psychologists rely on psychosocial approaches and cannot prescribe medication.
3. The Prescription Demonstration Project (PDP) was established in 1991 to train military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication. The project faced challenges, including a lack of clear purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, and delays in granting prescribing privileges.
4. The PDP has produced seven prescribing psychologists who are currently practicing at DOD military facilities, and three more are expected to complete clinical training. Prescribing psychologists have benefits, such as reducing psychiatrist workloads and increasing the number of mental health care providers, but their cost-effectiveness is unclear.
5. The MHSS has more psychiatrists than needed to meet medical readiness requirements, and the cost of producing 10 prescribing psychologists through the PDP was substantial. DOD should clearly demonstrate savings, define prescribing psychologists' roles and scopes of practice, and determine the need for and level of supervision before reinstating the PDP.

1. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, deployable infrared-optimized space telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror, designed for a 5-year mission to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies. It is expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope.
2. To keep the scientific instruments cold, a tennis-court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect them from the sun's heat. The observatory segment of JWST includes several elements and major subsystems, including the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), spacecraft, sunshield, and cryocooler.
3. The JWST project is complex and faces numerous risks, leading to the allocation of schedule and cost reserves. Integration and test activities are divided into five periods, with the majority of work relying on three contractors: Northrop Grumman, Harris, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).
4. The MIRI instrument, one of the four instruments within ISIM, requires a dedicated, interdependent two-stage cooler subsystem to cool its infrared light detector to about 6.7 Kelvin. This cooler, referred to as a cryocooler, has never been developed or flown in space before and poses a significant challenge to the project.
5. Schedule and cost reserves are allocated to each element and major subsystem to address unforeseen risks and delays. The use of schedule reserve on any element or major subsystem may reduce the overall project schedule reserve, with the element or major subsystem with the least amount of reserve determining the critical path. Cost reserves are held by both the project manager and contractors to address unanticipated issues.

2. The majority of benefits go to retirees, but Social Security also provides disability insurance, survivors' insurance, and benefits to dependents.
3. Disability Insurance pays monthly cash benefits to 7 million workers who can no longer work due to a severe long-term disability.
4. Survivors' Insurance provides benefits to over 11 million dependents, including widows, widowers, parents, and children.
5. Social Security benefits often represent a significant source of income, providing an average of $1,051 a month to retired workers, $995 a month to widows and widowers, and $979 a month to disabled workers.
6. Disabled workers and dependents receive slightly lower average monthly benefits than retired workers, but these benefits can be particularly important as these individuals may face financial difficulties.
7. Social Security was originally intended to provide an income base, not an adequate income, and balances the goals of income adequacy and individual equity.
8. The program expanded over the years to include disability and survivors' insurance, with dependents' benefits introduced in 1939 and disability insurance in 1956.

TARP included various programs such as the Capital Purchase Program, Automotive Industry Financing Program, Public-Private Investment Program, and Troubled Asset Relief Program for Housing.
2. Some of these programs have wound down or ended, while others, like the Capital Purchase Program and Troubled Asset Relief Program for Housing, remain active. The Capital Purchase Program provided capital to financially viable financial institutions and has produced a lifetime income for the government.
3. The Troubled Asset Relief Program for Housing includes initiatives like Making Home Affordable, the Hardest Hit Fund, and FHA Short Refinance. These programs aim to prevent avoidable foreclosures and preserve homeownership. As of September 30, 2014, approximately $13.7 billion of the $38.5 billion in TARP housing funds had been disbursed.
4. The status and exit strategy of TARP programs are subject to change based on market conditions and other factors. For example, the Hardest Hit Fund must commit funds by December 31, 2017, but can continue to spend committed funds after that date. The FHA Short Refinance program was extended for an additional 2 years, with all loans required to close on or before December 31, 2016.

The Foundation used these funds, along with interest earned, to construct the Memorial Garden, which was dedicated in 1994. The Memorial Garden, located adjacent to a World War II museum in Caen, France, is a 2.5-acre site featuring a granite fountain, a ""Wall of States,"" and a waterfall. The Foundation's financial statements for 1986-1992 showed that approximately 63% of revenues were spent on program activities, and for 1993, about 83% of revenues were spent on program activities.
2. Allegations were made against the Foundation regarding financial impropriety, including spending most of its revenues on non-program activities from 1986 to 1992, inappropriately promoting tours to Normandy in 1993, and altering records related to rent payments from a sublease with a related party. The Foundation spent approximately 61-63% of revenues and 60-76% of expenses on program activities during the period in question. The Foundation contracted with a travel agency to facilitate travel services for attendees of the D-Day commemoration and received an opinion from the Army's Office of General Counsel stating that it may designate its tour company without implying U.S. Government endorsement.

Older military retirees may choose to supplement Medicare+Choice care with space-available care from MTFs, saving the plan money.
4. As of 2001, there were about 1.5 million military retirees, dependents, and survivors aged 65 or older eligible for military health care services. About 600,000 of these seniors lived near an MTF, and retirees had access to all MTF and network services until they turned 65 and became eligible for Medicare.

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of endangered or threatened species, resulting in limitations on activities that could affect them and penalties for taking individuals of a listed species. Federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to determine if their projects might jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify their critical habitat.
2. The consultation process concludes with the appropriate Service issuing a biological opinion (BiOp) as to the harm the project poses. If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is released along with any reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to avoid jeopardy. To excuse incidental taking of listed species, the Services issue an incidental take statement with reasonable and prudent measures (RPMs) to minimize effects.
3. When a federal action cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species, and the federal agency believes that RPAs would thwart the project, the federal agency, governor, or licensees or permittees may seek an exemption. The exemption process offers the opportunity to consider economic circumstances and provides an opportunity for economic factors to override jeopardy to the species. However, an exemption is for a federal project, not for a species.
4. The Tellico Dam controversy in Tennessee in the 1970s set the stage for Congress's creation of the exemption process. The ESA originally prohibited all activities detrimental to listed species with very few exceptions. After the Supreme Court mandated that the gates of Tellico Dam not be closed due to the snail darter, Congress amended Section 7 of the ESA to include a process for economic impacts to be weighed and government projects exempted.
5. The exemption process is complex and could take up to 280 days. Potential applicants must balance the costs of the process with the benefits of winning an exemption. Some parties may be reluctant to apply due to the stringency of the process, the fact that exemptions apply to the action rather than the species, the need for the applicant to fund potentially costly permanent mitigation, and the fact that after an exemption is granted, the burden of conservation may fall more heavily on other areas that the species inhab",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 15}"

1. The net capital loss limitation was enacted to prevent taxpayers from minimizing their income taxes by selectively realizing capital losses and deferring gains. The limitation allows taxpayers to deduct up to $3,000 of capital losses against ordinary income per year, with any excess losses carried forward. The current system allows for asymmetrical treatment of long-term capital gains and losses, with net long-term losses deductible against short-term gains and up to $3,000 of ordinary income without limit. This creates an incentive for taxpayers to sell losing stocks and hold onto winning ones, potentially exacerbating market volatility.
2. The historical treatment of capital losses has undergone significant changes since the enactment of the individual income tax in 1913. Initially, capital losses were only deductible in connection with a taxpayer's trade or business. Later, excess losses could be deducted against ordinary income, and then against both short-term and long-term gains. The current system, which allows for the deduction of net long-term losses against short-term gains and up to $3,000 of ordinary income, was introduced in 1978. Some argue that increasing the net capital loss limitation could help stimulate the economy by restoring confidence in the stock market or providing an economic stimulus. However, the empirical evidence suggests that the benefits of such a change would primarily accrue to higher income individuals, and that the current system, despite its asymmetries, is more generous to taxpayers than the system that existed prior to 1978.

1. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a multilateral organization of 10 Southeast Asian nations with a combined population of 580 million and a GDP of around $1.5 trillion. Established in 1967, ASEAN aims to foster regional dialogue and cooperation on economic growth, regional peace and security, and collaboration in various development areas.
2. The Obama Administration has pursued a policy of expanding and upgrading U.S. relations with Southeast Asia and ASEAN, aiming to pay greater attention to regional concerns and work with multilateral organizations. The United States has deep-seated interests in the region, including maritime security, democracy and human rights, and economic and trade issues.
3. China's growing economic and cultural ties in Southeast Asia and security ties have led to a soft power rivalry between the United States and China in the region. Other external powers, such as Japan, the EU, and India, have also shown renewed interest in the region.
4. Engagement with ASEAN has presented the United States with a diplomatic dilemma, as despite significant security, economic, and foreign assistance initiatives, there is a perception that the United States has placed relatively little priority on ASEAN itself. The United States has strong bilateral relations with many Southeast Asian nations, but recent actions suggest a greater commitment to multilateral engagement.
5. Recent actions by the Obama Administration include Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visits to the ASEAN Secretariat and accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, as well as a U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting and increased dialogue on issues such as Burma and human rights. The United States also plans to visit Indonesia and Australia in March 2010.
6. ASEAN was founded in 1967 and has since grown to include 10 members. It operates on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members, and has faced challenges in dealing with members such as Burma that have caused troublesome policy issues both within the region and with ASEAN's relations with outside states. A new ASEAN Charter went into effect in 2007, which may signal a greater willingness to discuss and comment on the internal affairs of members.

5. Three countries have been removed from the list: South Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.
6. Cuba was added to the list in 1982 due to its support for terrorist groups in Latin America, specifically the M-19 guerrilla group in Colombia.
7. Cuba continues to host members of foreign terrorist organizations and U.S. fugitives from justice, which is a point of contention regarding its inclusion on the list.
8. The debate over Cuba's retention on the list centers on its past support for revolutionary movements and governments, its current hosting of members of foreign terrorist organizations and U.S. fugitives, and the potential for negotiation and extradition of fugitives.

2. The AMT base includes business provisions, certain itemized deductions, and personal exemptions, but excludes benefits of lower capital gains tax rates, tax-exempt bonds, and home mortgage interest deductions. Exemptions are not indexed to inflation, leading to an increase in the number of taxpayers covered.
3. The AMT tax liability was projected to rise from $6.4 billion in 2001 to $38.2 billion in 2010, but this number will now be higher due to the rate reductions and marriage penalty provisions in H.R. 1836.
4. Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities but do not alter the AMT will interact with the AMT in two ways: they will increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and the number affected by the credit limit, and they will cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families.
5. Proposed tax cuts that lower tax rates or narrow brackets across the board will also interact significantly with the AMT, as they tend to affect higher income taxpayers proportionally more. Taxpayers already on the AMT will get no tax cut, and some taxpayers will be shifted to the AMT.

1. In 2009, there was renewed interest in imposing import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs) due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes. Advocates argued that stricter import controls would prevent unlimited importation of milk protein, encourage domestic production, and raise milk prices for farmers. Opponents warned of increased costs and higher retail food prices.
2. The United States imports a significant amount of MPCs, with New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union being major suppliers. Until 1995, imports were subject to section 22 import quotas, but since then, they have not been restricted and are not subject to licensing requirements or tariff rate quotas. In 2002, the National Milk Producers Federation petitioned to change the tariff classification of MPCs, aiming to make them subject to TRQs and import licenses, but the U.S. Customs Service disagreed, stating that MPCs imported under 0404.90.10 met the statutory conditions provided in Additional Note 13.

1. High risk health insurance pools (HRPs) are state-established programs designed to help individuals with preexisting health conditions obtain health coverage. These individuals cannot access or afford insurance in the private market due to their health conditions. Approximately 35 states have HRPs, and they enroll around 200,000 individuals.
2. HRPs were established to address the needs of individuals who cannot access employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) or public programs and are seeking coverage in the individual market. Insurers in the individual market conduct rigorous underwriting, which results in a fairly healthy enrollee population and excludes individuals with moderate to severe health conditions.
3. HRPs function as a safety net for the individual market by ensuring that individuals have access to health insurance as long as they are able and willing to pay for it. They also help stabilize the market by removing high risk individuals and promoting competition among insurers.
4. HRPs are typically operated through state-established nonprofit organizations and bear the insurance risk. They usually offer more than one plan and have caps on premiums, which are often between 150% and 200% of standard risk rates. Many states also receive federal grants to help cover operating expenses.
5. HRPs have limitations, including high premiums and cost-sharing requirements, long exclusion periods for preexisting conditions, and limited coverage options. Some researchers are skeptical that HRPs will be able to substantially reduce the number of uninsured, particularly among those with serious medical conditions. Consumer groups generally advocate for broader health care reform to expand coverage.

The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a program established in 1951 that allows the Departments of Defense and Transportation to work together to manage civil aircraft for military airlift needs during emergencies. CRAF participants must be U.S. carriers fully certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and commit at least 30% of their passenger fleet and 15% of their cargo fleet to the program. Aircraft committed must be U.S. registered and carriers must maintain crews for each aircraft.
2. The CRAF program has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the aircraft performance characteristics needed.
3. The CRAF program provides benefits to both the DOD and the U.S. airline industry. It is relatively inexpensive compared to maintaining a larger organic fleet, but commercial aircraft have operational limitations such as shorter range and lack of roll on/roll off capability. The DOD pays rates based on carrier costs for using their aircraft during an activation, but the cost is minimal compared to the costs of acquiring and maintaining military airlift capability.

5. The Census Bureau's poverty thresholds, which date back to the 1950s, are based on a minimal standard of food consumption and have not been updated to reflect changes in living standards. Critics argue that these thresholds do not accurately reflect the cost of living in different areas or the effects of government programs.
6. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), developed in response to these criticisms, takes into account a more comprehensive range of income and expenses, including taxes, work-related expenses, and in-kind benefits. The SPM yields a higher poverty rate than the official measure, particularly for certain groups such as the elderly and children.
7. The SPM highlights the importance of work-based supports, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, in reducing poverty, particularly for families with children. It also recognizes the importance of affordable child care and the effects of government programs, such as SNAP benefits, in reducing poverty.

1. The campus-based programs, including the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs, were authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965.
2. These programs are unique because federal funds are awarded directly to institutions, which determine the mix and amount of aid awarded to students based on institution-specific criteria.
3. The FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, while the Perkins Loan program was extended through FY2017.
4. The Perkins Loan program was established in 1958 as a response to the space race and concerns over national security, offering low-interest loans to students with financial need.
5. Institutions were required to give special consideration to students in certain majors and those intending to teach when selecting award recipients.
6. The FWS program was originally authorized in 1964 to promote part-time employment for students from low-income families and was later incorporated into the HEA in 1968.
7. Institutions are required to use at least 7% of their FWS allocation for community service, and students must ensure they operate at least one tutoring or family literacy project.
8. The FSEOG program was extended and renamed in 1972, serving as a supplement to the Pell Grant program, and institutions were required to match federal funds for the first time.
9. The current allocation procedures for the campus-based programs favor long-term participants, as they receive a base guarantee based on prior-year participation.

1. The September 11, 2001, attacks raised concerns about the security of water supply and water quality infrastructure in the United States. These systems are potentially vulnerable to physical disruption, bioterrorism/chemical contamination, and cyber attacks.
2. Water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources, dams, reservoirs, treatment facilities, finished water reservoirs, distribution systems, and wastewater collection and treatment facilities. They are owned and managed by both public and private entities.
3. The federal government has ownership responsibility for hundreds of dams and diversion structures but owns only about 5% of the dams whose failure could result in loss of life or significant property damage. The largest federal facilities are operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
4. Since 9/11, federal dam operators have gone on high-alert, and security threats are under constant review. The Corps temporarily closed all its facilities to visitors and implemented additional security measures.
5. Drinking water and wastewater utilities have primary responsibility to assess their vulnerabilities and prioritize security improvements. Most have emergency preparedness plans, but many were developed to respond to natural disasters and may not incorporate sufficient procedures to address terrorist threats.
6. Water sector research on infrastructure protection has been underway for some time, but gaps exist in threat/vulnerability risk assessments, identification and characterization of biological and chemical agents, and application of information assurance techniques to computerized systems.

1. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 phased out the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes, leaving the gift tax as the only federal transfer tax in 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 temporarily reinstated these taxes with lower top rates and larger exemptions, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently extended the estate tax rules except for the top tax rate, which increased from 35% to 40%.
2. The federal estate and gift taxes are unified, with the same rate structure and a lifetime transfer credit of $5,340,000 for 2014. The determination of federal estate tax liability involves adjusting the gross estate, which includes all property owned by the decedent on the date of death and certain transfers made prior to death, and applying tax rates and credits.
3. The gross estate may include property not owned by the decedent on the date of death, such as lifetime gifts over which the decedent retained a life interest or the power to alter, amend, terminate, or destroy the beneficial enjoyment of the property. The value of the property is determined at its fair market value on the date of death or the alternate valuation date.
4. The estate's taxable estate is determined by reducing the gross estate with allowable deductions, including funeral expenses, administration expenses, debts, charitable bequests, and state death taxes. The marital deduction allows for the value of all property passing to the decedent's surviving spouse to be excluded from the estate tax.
5. The federal gift tax is a tax on gratuitous transfers made during life and seeks to account for transfers that would reduce the estate and accordingly estate tax liability at death. The donor's tax liability on the gift depends on the value of the taxable gift, which is determined by reducing the gross value of the gift by available deductions and exclusions.

1. Approximately 766 million acres of forestlands exist in the United States, with 58% being privately owned. The federal government supports forest management on private and public forests through various programs, primarily administered by the Forest Service (FS) in the USDA. These programs aim to achieve goals such as wildfire planning and response, and the development of new wood product markets.
2. Forestry assistance programs have a long history, with the USDA Division of Forestry established in 1881. The FS, which was formed in 1905, has three primary mission areas: managing National Forests, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. Congress has authorized specific forestry assistance programs since 1924, with the most recent being the 2014 farm bill.
3. To be eligible for funding, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, which includes a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions, threats, and strategies for addressing them. Most forestry assistance programs are administered by the FS but implemented by state partners, with technical and financial aid provided to states, which then assist private landowners. Some programs may also offer direct federal financial assistance to private forest landowners through agricultural conservation programs.
4. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, with an average annual appropriation of $362.7 million and a peak of $420.5 million in FY2010. The Administration requested $197.4 million in FY2019, proposing to eliminate funding for seven programs and decrease funding for others. Some unfunded or repealed programs may still have activities performed or provided through other authorizations or funding sources.

The study compared the effects of two commonly used strategies, gelc-ms/ms with repetitive injections and additional protein prefractionation using microsol ief, on depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates. Both strategies are simple and have been integrated into diverse analyses of complex proteomes. The 3-d method using microsol ief fractionation prior to gelc-ms/ms showed excellent reproducibility and substantially improved proteome coverage compared to the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.
2. The dynamic range of protein concentrations in cell lysates is less than in plasma or serum, so the microsol ief separation was designed to yield four final fractions. Proteins with pi values close to the ph of the disk remain in the disk but can be recovered in high yield. Extracts from disks with extreme ph values showed only trace amounts of proteins, while extracts from disks located between separation chambers contained a mixture of proteins unique to that disk and proteins present in adjacent chambers. When similar samples were separated by microsol ief and analyzed on 2-d gels, comparisons of solution fractions and membrane fractions showed that most proteins recovered from membrane disks were either unique to the membrane or had pi s slightly lower than the ph of the membrane.

The study found that the incidence of delayed hemorrhage was significantly lower in the smuppp group (1.45%) compared to the tonsillectomy group (5.05%).
2. The study also noted that the smuppp technique, which includes tonsillectomy and excision of the soft palate and redundant tissue followed by reconstruction, may decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding due to epithelial preservation and tension-free closure of the epithelium. Bipolar cauterization and suturing of the tonsillar pillars were identified as potential factors contributing to decreased bleeding in the smuppp group.

Additionally, the study found that the mean age and gender distribution were similar between the two groups. The postoperative bleeding rate of the tonsillectomy group was within the reported range in the literature, while rates of hemorrhage after smuppp have not been studied as extensively but fall within the reported range of 0.6% to 14.0%. The study also noted that some studies have found an increased rate of posttonsillectomy hemorrhage in males compared with females, but this was not a significant factor in the study. The increased rate of hemorrhage in the tonsillectomy group could not be attributed to any factor other than the operative techniques used. The study suggested the routine use of the suturing technique for smuppp in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. Breast cancer continues to be a leading cause of death among women in China, and the morbidity is increasing, particularly among young people. Early detection and accurate analysis of molecular biology characteristics are crucial for effective treatment.
2. miRNAs are non-coding proteins that inhibit translation or induce degradation of related mRNAs, leading to changes in protein expression. Some miRNAs have oncogene or anti-oncogene functions and play important roles in breast cancer invasion and development.
3. Specific miRNAs, such as mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145, have been identified as having anti-oncogene functions and are related to the occurrence of tumors. For instance, mir-125a can inhibit the metastatic and invasive abilities of breast cancer cells by affecting the protein levels of her-2 and her-3.
4. The expression levels of miRNAs in breast cancer tissues were examined, and the results showed that the expression of mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 was lower in breast cancer tissues than in para-carcinoma tissues. Additionally, the relative transcript levels of mir-145, mir-125a, and mir-206 in patients' tumor tissues were also lower than those in para-carcinoma normal tissues, suggesting their potential use as markers for early diagnosis.
5. The findings from this study contribute to the development of new anti-her-2 drugs and overcoming herceptin resistance in drugs. Additionally, mir-145 and mir-206 are expected to be new target spots in tnbc treatment, as they can inhibit tnbc development and positive er lines.

1. Transplantation of kidneys in the Fischer-344 (F344) to Lewis rat strain combination is an established model for chronic allograft injury (CAI). During reversible acute rejection (AR), mononuclear leukocytes accumulate in allograft blood vessels, and their interaction with graft endothelial cells may trigger CAI.
2. Mononuclear leukocytes isolated from renal allografts on day 9 after transplantation exhibit strong tgm2 immunoreactivity, and graft monocytes are identified as tgm2-positive cells. tgm2 expression is increased in mononuclear blood leukocytes and graft tissue during AR.
3. The increase in tgm2 expression in mononuclear blood leukocytes is not solely due to the increased proportion of monocytes, as isograft blood leukocytes contain about 50% monocytes and allografts about 70%, but interactions of monocytes with graft endothelial cells and proinflammatory cytokines produced during AR may induce tgm2 expression.
4. tgm2 expression is linked to apoptosis, as a stronger induction of activated caspase-3 is seen in leukocytes isolated from day 9 allografts compared to respective isografts. tgm2 expression can induce apoptosis but also stabilizes the cytoskeleton of dying cells, preventing cell rupture and release of proinflammatory cytoplasmic components.
5. The functional relevance of tgm2 expression by m2 macrophages and monocytes is still elusive, as their role in apoptosis and monocyte differentiation is unclear.

1. Endothelial cells were stimulated with Plasminogen Activation Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to produce extracellular microparticles (EMPs), which were collected and characterized using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
2. Counter-current dialysis using a standard CVVH filter removed EMPs from a model patient's circulation, supporting the idea of CVVH as a therapeutic intervention for ali due to clearance of EMPs.
3. The experimental conditions achieved the same plasma level of EMPs as seen in human clinical disease (110 per ml).
4. The observed EMP clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon, explaining the relatively constant EMP concentration from 40 to 70 minutes and low dialysate EMP levels.
5. The low dialysate EMP level and plateauing circulation EMP level beyond 40 minutes suggest that EMP sequestration occurs within the CVVH filter or tubing and is a saturable phenomenon.
6. Frequent changing of the CVVH filter or using more efficient and selective EMP clearance methods, such as conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to specialty CVVH filters, can overcome this limitation.
7. Clinical data support the protective role of CVVH in ali management, including the achievement of negative fluid balance and prevention of volume overload.
8. The authors plan to assay patients pre- and post-dialysis to observe EMP concentration effects and examine efficacy in on-going diseases using animal models.
9. Standard dialysis alone was effective in removing EMPs due to their small size in an in vitro model, and the utility of ultrafiltration can be tested in an animal model.

2. Recent studies have identified subtle motor deficits on the ipsilateral side, which demonstrate chronic persistence.
3. Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient for detecting ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified kinematic deficits in specific tasks.
4. Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, including disrupted counterbalance, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal track, or different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a significant economic burden. The prevalence of RA in Italy is estimated to be around 0.5%, with higher rates in older populations. The economic burden of RA is expected to increase due to the aging population and the availability of costly biological agents.
2. The direct medical costs of RA in Italy were estimated to be €11,546 per patient in 2008, with indirect costs accounting for the majority of the total costs. The structure of RA costs has changed over the years, with a substantial increase in direct costs due to the availability of biological agents.
3. A systematic literature review showed that disease severity, functional disability, age, and socioeconomic status are the most relevant predictors of cost increase in RA. Cost-effectiveness analyses are important for marketing approval and reimbursement of new treatments, but should also consider the long-term impact on social costs and loss of productivity.
4. The use of biologic agents in the early stages of RA may reduce other healthcare costs by slowing the evolution of the disease. Accurate pharmacoeconomic estimates can help guide treatment decisions and ensure effective spending without compromising quality of care. Comorbidities are common in RA patients and can significantly impact the economic burden of the disease.

1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It disproportionately affects developing countries and males, with 85% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia. HCC risk factors include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens, and genetic metabolic diseases.
2. The median overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced HCC is estimated at 58 months. HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products, and p53 mutations. Systemic therapeutic options in the locally advanced or metastatic setting are limited to sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor.
3. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex multistep process driven by accumulation of heterogeneous molecular alterations from initial hepatocyte injury to metastatic invasion. Dysplastic nodules progress to early HCC through cumulative genetic alterations, while advanced HCC often involves intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein invasion.
4. Molecular alterations implicated in HCC development include mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic alterations, chromosomal changes, and aberrant activation of signaling cascades necessary for proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and survival. Pathogenesis of early and advanced HCC may be modulated through different mechanisms.
5. HGF and its transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, cMet, promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. HGF-cMet signaling is critical for normal processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, and postnatal tissue repair after acute injury.

The man had presented to the clinic with a perianal nodule, which was later identified as a tick bite. He had recalled defecating near a water reservoir in a rural area of South Korea, where he felt a sting around his anus.
2. The tick was identified through histopathological examination and was found to be 25 mm in length and 18 mm in width, with a long article II in the pedipalps and a small ornamented scutum. The genital aperture was located between the coxa I and II, and the anus was posterior to the spiracular plates and embraced by a Y-shaped anal groove. The coxa I had two subequal spurs, while the coxa IV had a longer spur.
3. The skin reaction at the site of the tick attachment was intense, with pathological changes observed through all skin layers. The feeding lesion was composed of a superficial perirostral portion and a deep cavitary portion, filled with purulent exudates and inflammatory cells. A dense and mixed cellular infiltrate was noted around the feeding lesion, but very few inflammatory cells were immediately adjacent to the site which abutted the eosinophilic cement.

The tick is more common in tropical and subtropical areas, including South East Asia and the Indian Peninsula. The present case was infested in a western coastal area of Jeollanam-do, extending the geographic range of distribution from the southern coastal area more northwards. Ticks embed their anterior part, the capitulum, into the skin, and the histopathology of skin responses to infection with the present female A. testudinarium shows a dermal infiltration of various inflammatory cells associated with both acute and chronic reactions.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, predominantly involving the interventricular septum, and caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with cardiac troponin T (Tnnt2) being one of the major genes implicated.
2. Tnnt2 mutations have been reported to account for approximately 15% of familial HCM cases, and most mutations are missense mutations located in exons 8-16. These mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle, especially the calcium sensitivity of force development and ATPase activity.
3. Previous studies suggested that certain genetic mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in HCM, but recent research indicates that the specific gene mutation is not the sole factor that dictates clinical phenotype. Late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been identified as a predictive marker of ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in HCM.
4. Genetic testing is clinically informative for risk stratification in HCM, and the Tnnt2 mutation has the third-ranked incidence of familial HCM. However, the genotype-phenotype correlation of this gene still remains insufficient in Japanese familial HCM. Therefore, close monitoring and regular follow-up are essential for all HCM patients, regardless of the type of genetic mutation.

3. Inhaler education is crucial for improving treatment adherence and reducing incorrect use, with scoring systems assessing difficulties in using inhaled drugs potentially useful for identifying and addressing common errors. (3, 6)
4. The frequency of incorrect use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) ranges from 14% to 90%, reducing drug concentration in the airways to less than 20%. (10)
5. In a study of patients using inhaled or oral corticosteroids, increased bronchodilator use, nebulizer use, and hospitalizations were observed in more than 50% of non-adherent patients. (11)
6. Instruments assessing inhaler technique can play an important role in evaluating patients, with the Leal scoring system for MDI technique and Santos et al.'s scoring systems for MDI and dry powder inhaler (DPI) technique being used in hospitals. (3, 12, 13)
7. Validation of these instruments allows determination of congruence between the scoring system and reality, increasing reliability and ensuring data quality. (14)
8. The objectives of the present study were to validate two scores for measuring patients' ability to use MDIs orDPIs, identify the most common errors, and identify patients in need of an educational program. (17, 19)

1. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that have gained significant interest for their use as natural and nontoxic food preservatives and potential applications in human and veterinary fields. They can have activity against closely related and broad-spectrum bacteria, and their sensitivity to target strains can depend on ecological conditions.
2. Enterocin s37 is a bacteriocin produced by a strain of E. faecalis isolated from chicken feces. It showed antagonism against Listeria and Campylobacter species and exhibited activity against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of enterocin s37 was assessed using agar diffusion tests, and it was found to be stable at high temperatures and different pH levels.
3. Enterocin s37 was purified using a three-step method, including ammonium sulfate precipitation and two reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) steps. The purified bacteriocin appeared to have a molecular weight between 4 and 6 kDa and was active against Listeria monocytogenes and other target strains even after treatments with lipase and lysozyme. The activity of enterocin s37 was also found to be enhanced in the presence of certain k channel modulators, such as pinacidil and cromakalim.
</summary>

Additional context:
- Bacteriocins are classified into four classes based on their structure and mode of action. Enterocin s37 is likely a class IIa bacteriocin due to its small size, membrane activity, and sensitivity to proteases.
- The stability of enterocin s37 was studied by heating treatments and at different pH levels, and it was found to remain intact. Attempts to reduce disulfide bridges in enterocin s37 using dithiothreitol were not conclusive due to toxicity towards target strains.
- Enterococci are widely distributed in the environment and are known to produce various bacteriocins called enterocins, which have great diversity in structure and activity against numerous microorganisms.

1. Hydatid cyst disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus parasite. Canines are the final hosts, and they spread the parasite through their feces. Herbivores and humans are intermediate hosts, and humans can be infected through contaminated water, vegetables, or direct contact with infected dogs. The disease commonly affects the lung and liver in humans.
2. The disease is prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in countries with animal husbandry. Iran is considered a hyper-endemic area due to its close relationship with animals and traditional animal husbandry. The prevalence rate of hydatid cyst in the intermediate host is 11.5%-34.6%, and the prevalence rate of human hydatid cyst is 1.1%-13.7%.
3. In Khorasan Razavi province during 2011-2014, 357 hydatid cyst cases were diagnosed. The most common cities with hydatid cyst cases were Mashhad (51.8%), Ghouchan (7.8%), Neishabour (7.0%), and Fariman (4.8%). The most common symptom was abdominal pain (42.3%), and the most common diagnosis methods were radiology (42.3%) and CT scan (37.8%).
4. The disease affects different age groups, with the highest proportion in the age group of 21-40 years old (39.2%). Women are more commonly infected than men (54.9% vs. 45.1%), possibly due to their greater involvement in agriculture and animal husbandry. Housewives also have a high rate of infection (45.8%). Prevention efforts should focus on improving education levels, washing vegetables with hygiene principles, and identifying infection sources.

1. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and celiac disease (CD) are two conditions that can cause gastroduodenal diseases, ranging from asymptomatic to significant manifestations. The mechanisms behind the diversity of clinical manifestations are not known. Both conditions are associated with a local immune inflammatory reaction, defined by the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the gastric mucosa.
2. CD is a T-cell-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in susceptible subjects, affecting not only the small bowel but also the gastric mucosal structure and function. HP infection is a major etiology for lymphocyte-predominant gastritis (LP-GC), extensively documented in adults and children. The relationship between HP infection and CD has yielded conflicting results.
3. The present study aimed to define the immunophenotype of the gastric mucosa in pediatric patients with LP-GC due to CD or HP infection. Forty patients were included in the study, and biopsies were obtained from the second part of the duodenum and the antrum for histologic examination and HP testing. Sections obtained from gastric biopsies were immediately fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.
4. The study found that CD patients had increased numbers of IELs (45.5-18.5 per 100 gastric epithelial cells) compared to patients without LP-GC (10.8-4.5 per 100 gastric epithelial cells). The highest proportion of LP-GC (50%) was found in CD patients without HP infection. HP-infected patients had the highest number of lymphoid aggregates in the antrum, irrespective of the CD status. The mean number of CD3+ and CD8+ IELs was increased significantly in CD patients with or without HP infection compared to controls.

6. The study used adult male Sprague Dawley rats, and all surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia. The IOP was increased to 110 mmHg for 60 minutes, and time-course examination was performed at 1, 3, and 5 days after acute IOP elevation.
7. The results showed that AAA treatment attenuated gfap immunoreactivity in Müller cell processes across the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and reduced retinal TNF levels in the rat model of AOH.
8. These findings suggest that AAA promoted survival of RGCs in the rat model of AOH, likely through the inhibition of AOH-induced Müller cell gliosis and in turn downregulation of TNF protein production.

1. Five patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFTR-L) for nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms between June 2015 and September 2015.
2. The procedure involves identifying the target lesion using a forward-viewing endoscope, ligating it with a ligation device, temporarily suturing the seromuscular layer, resecting the lesion under the ligation band, and retrieving the specimen intraluminally.
3. The lack of a seromuscular layer and provisional and additional sutures prevent exposure of the abdominal cavity to malignant cells and ensure a closed procedure.
4. The mean operative time was 173 minutes (range 138-217 minutes), and the mean diameter of the resected specimen was 24 mm (range 18-32 mm).
5. Complete resection was achieved in all cases, and full-thickness resection was histologically confirmed.
6. Conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) could be a curative strategy for superficial duodenal neoplasms, but complete resection is challenging, especially for flat or non-lifting lesions.
7. Duodenal ESD is not a standard clinical procedure due to the high technical difficulty and risk of severe adverse events, including delayed perforation.
8. LAPFTR-L is a promising technique for the treatment of nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms, as it achieves complete resection without peritoneal exposure of tumor cells or severe adverse events. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate its efficacy and safety.

1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is primarily caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), leading to the shunting of precursors into the androgen synthetic pathway and resulting in signs of androgen excess. CAH has been effectively managed since the discovery of cortisone in the 1950s.
2. Four cases of CAH patients were managed with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, but all developed adrenal masses. Recent reports suggest a high prevalence of small tumors in untreated CAH patients, and most adrenal masses in children with CAH are benign.
3. CAH is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deletions or mutations of the cytochrome p450 21-hydroxylase gene. The pathophysiology of CAH is closely linked to the degree of enzyme deficiency, leading to hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism.
4. CAH can be diagnosed through newborn screening programs or corticotropin stimulation tests. Medical treatment aims to suppress adrenal androgens while allowing for normal pubertal development and fertility. Patients with CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumors and to manage symptoms and electrolyte disorders.

SRH, as a single survey question developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been validated as a tool to predict mortality in populations with and without cardiovascular diseases and functional ability [4, 5]. In the US and other countries, asking participants to describe their overall health on a five-point scale has gained popularity as a health-indicating tool [6, 7].
2. Noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic lung diseases, are largely attributed to four main behavioral factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity, and harmful alcohol use [13]. Poor health for persons with chronic diseases has been attributed to a lack of adherence to medical recommendations, including diet and physical activity [13].
3. Diet and physical activity can have positive effects for persons with preexisting coronary heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes [13, 14]. Reduction in chronic disease burden and increase in quality of life have been well documented with higher daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and physical activity [13, 14].
4. Lack of physical activity and unhealthy dietary patterns place a burden on society due to lack of work productivity and increased health care costs [13]. Physical health components from the Short Form 12 (SF-12) were associated with increased physical activity and healthier diet from baseline to five-year follow-up of a European cohort from the inter99 study [23].

The American Urological Association (AUA) considers it an option in managing VUR.
2. Pic cystography, a technique used to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent UTIs after negative standard voiding cystograms, has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystograms. It can detect occult VUR and predict successful surgical outcomes when performed intraoperatively immediately after dx / ha injection.
3. The study compared two different pic cystography techniques and two scenarios: detecting de novo contralateral VUR in the case of preoperative unilateral VUR and predicting successful surgical outcomes by correlating the results with a standard 2-month postprocedure voiding cystogram.

1. The accuracy of detecting fetal pathology using ultrasound depends on the sonographer's expertise and limitations such as fetal head descent, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an essential diagnostic tool due to advancements in technology and better understanding of fetal pathology. MRI is particularly useful in cases of ventriculomegaly, a condition characterized by an enlarged lateral ventricle, to detect and characterize additional cerebral anomalies.
2. MRI offers several advantages over ultrasound, including excellent contrast resolution, direct visualization of the cortical region, and the ability to detect small intraventricular hemorrhages, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and other anomalies. MRI is also useful for assessing normal and pathological cortical development and maturation, and for detecting white matter pathology. However, MRI has limitations such as the impact of fetal motion on image acquisition and relatively low spatial resolution compared to ultrasound.

The null hypothesis was that no significant differences would be found among push-out bond strength values after different root canal surface treatments.
2. The study used 55 extracted maxillary central incisors, which were cleaned, prepared with a rotary system, and filled with gutta percha and resin sealer. The post spaces were treated with different methods, including saline, sodium hypochlorite, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, orthophosphoric acid, and photodynamic diode laser. The laser group also received a photosensitizer solution and was irradiated for one minute.
3. The results showed that the higher bond strength values were obtained for the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups. The other groups, including saline, sodium hypochlorite, and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, showed mixed failures (post-cement and cement-dentin). The null hypothesis was rejected, as different smear layer removal methods affected the bond strength of a fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin (p<.05).

Additionally, the study found that the smear layer should be removed to increase antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness, as it becomes porous and weakens the interface between cement and dentin. However, in the photodynamic diode laser group, bond strength was higher than the other groups except for the 37% orthophosphoric acid group without the removal of the smear layer. This may be due to the fact that collagen fibrils remain stable and less affected by dehydration, allowing for better infiltration of the luting agent. Sodium hypochlorite and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid were effective in removing the smear layer, but sodium hypochlorite alone did not remove it as effectively as in other studies, and the residual solution affected the change in redox potential of the bonding agent.

Recent research has identified and quantified bacterial communities in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, with initiatives like the Human Microbiome Project and Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract Consortium focusing on characterizing microbial communities across multiple human body sites.
2. Collaborative efforts have been made to investigate a common core of bacterial species shared among humans, revealing that the human gut flora mainly belongs to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with smaller representations of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Archaea, represented by methanogenic methanobrevibacter smithii, have also been discovered, although their diversity is much less expansive than bacterial species.
3. The composition of the bacterial flora appears to depend on the environment and maternal input during delivery and breastfeeding, with members of the same family having more similar bacterial communities than unrelated individuals, regardless of host genotype.
4. Recent studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities, specifically a series of experiments aimed at determining a common bacterial core shared by all or at least a majority of humans. The bacterial groups present in vast numbers were bacteroidetes and dorea / eubacterium / ruminococcus, with only 18 species present in all individuals and 57 species seen in more than 90% of samples.

6. Attention has also been drawn to the minimal gut metagenome coding for functions involved in the homeostasis of the whole ecosystem, which are present in most individual host samples. Most of these common bacterial genes are involved in the digestion of complex sugars and their subsequent fermentation.

Mice were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups, with control mice shifted to daily feeding of a control diet and treatment groups receiving identical quantities of control diet supplemented with ndga at various doses.
2. The study found that 373mg/kg bw/d (3.5g/kg diet) of ndga extended median lifespan in male mice by 12%, but had no effect on maximum lifespan. The results suggested that the dose of ndga which extended median lifespan was within 12% of the initially reported dose for NIH-ITP mice. However, further study is needed to resolve differences in lifespan extension reported by the NIH-ITP.

2. Each myova dimer consists of a pair of n-terminal motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain.
3. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms.
4. Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of myova, but high calcium levels reduce motor processivity and may cause calmodulin dissociation from the lever arms.

8. Ulcer areas and percent granulation were measured by planimetry using a validated portable wound measurement device, and the variables were calculated using area in mm and time in days.
9. Comparison between healed and nonhealed was assessed using the chi-square test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, and missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward or the average of contiguous evaluations.
10. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals, and cutoff points were generated to maximize sensitivity and specificity.

1. The breathing process, which begins at the upper airway and culminates in gas exchange inside the alveoli, is essential for human survival.
2. When breathing begins through the nose, the air is prepared and activated with immunological processes, while mouth breathing lacks filtering or immunological activity.
3. Mouth breathing in childhood can lead to pathological adaptations of the stomatognathic system, causing dental occlusion alterations, facial growth pattern changes, and functional speech, chewing, and deglutition issues.
4. The main causes of mouth breathing in childhood include hypertrophy of the pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsils, nasal mucosa and turbinate edema, nasal septal deviation, and extended suction habits.
5. Nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry are essential exams for diagnosing and treating mouth breathing, with nasopharyngoscopy being the gold standard for assessing nasopharyngeal obstruction.
6. The correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils was investigated in a study.
7. The study involved children from public schools, aged 7.0 to 11.11 years, who underwent otorhinolaryngologic assessment, nasopharyngoscopy, and cephalometry.
8. The results showed a regular and positive correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing the grade of hyperplasia in the pharyngeal tonsils, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.52.
9. Cephalometry, as compared to nasopharyngoscopy, presented a tendency to underestimate the pharyngeal tonsil size in the nasopharynx, with a sensitivity of 35% and a negative predictive value of 72%.

1. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in breast cancer patients is less than 6%, but distinguishing between true local recurrences (TR) and new primary tumors (NPT) is necessary.
2. To differentiate TR from NPT, consider the location, staging, and histological subtype of the new tumor.
3. A 35-year-old woman with no relevant medical history was diagnosed with moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in her right breast in 2004.
4. The primary tumor was ER/PR positive and Her-2 negative, and no metastases were detected in the lymph nodes.
5. In 2008, the patient noticed periareolar thickening in the right breast with redness and heat, which led to the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) in the same breast.
6. IBC is a rare and aggressive form of locally advanced breast cancer, accounting for 0.55% of primary invasive breast tumors.
7. The treatment for IDC includes surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiation therapy if indicated.
8. The risk of second primary breast cancer depends on the er status, period of diagnosis, and family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer.
9. The risk of developing a second breast cancer is similar for women who had a mastectomy or breast-conserving treatment (BCT).
10. IBTR can be classified as either TR or NPT based on pathologic features and genetic sequencing.
11. TR represents the regrowth of malignant cells not removed by surgery or not killed by radiotherapy, while NPT is a distinct histology type or a change from a more invasive to a less invasive carcinoma.
12. The best way to differentiate TR and NPT is through genetic sequencing, but molecular techniques such as DNA fingerprinting and loss of heterozygosity pattern can also be used.

1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in people aged 55 and older, with neovascular AMD accounting for most cases of severe central vision loss. Up to 65% of patients with neovascular AMD have been shown to experience an overall improvement in vision-related quality of life (VFQ-25 composite score) after switching to aflibercept from ranibizumab.
2. Ranibizumab and aflibercept are intravitreal anti-VEGF agents approved for the treatment of neovascular AMD. Ranibizumab is a recombinant VEGF-specific monoclonal antibody fragment, while aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that binds to both VEGF-A and placental growth factor. Aflibercept has a greater binding affinity to VEGF and a longer duration of action, potentially allowing for less frequent dosing.
3. The Pelli-Robson Contrast Sensitivity (CS) test is a quick and reliable method used in clinical settings to assess an individual's ability to detect low contrast images. CS is a sensitive and essential outcome end point for a complete assessment of visual function and visual performance, including driving, mobility, reading speed, and general vision-related quality of life. CS charts that utilize letters are familiar to both patients and practitioners.
4. In a study of patients with recalcitrant exudative AMD who were switched from ranibizumab to aflibercept, there was a statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome end point of change in CS from baseline to week 12, with an average CS change of two letters. This improvement in CS was broadly comparable to a five-letter difference in visual acuity (VA) in terms of vision function performance.
5. The sample size of the switch cohort in the study was relatively small, and follow-up of participants was limited to 12 weeks only. Comparative analyses involving a control arm of patients continuing on ranibizumab despite recurrent or persistent fluid might have strengthened the overall analysis. A larger study to evaluate long-term outcomes and the potential for greater improvement in vision-related functional benefit with continuing treatment after a treatment switch to aflibercept from ranibizumab would be of interest.

The population consisted of 522 Korean male hypertensive patients without a history of AA. Most suboptimal images were due to errors in raw CT data storage.
2. The mean age of the patients was 73 years, and 34.5% had diabetes, 64.1% had dyslipidemia, and 51.6% had coronary artery disease. Prevalence of TAA was 36.5%, and 6.0% had AAA. Prevalence of TAA was higher in patients with AAA (64.6%) compared to those without AAA (40.0%). Prevalence of AAA was significantly higher in current/past smokers (7.4%) compared to non-smokers (2.4%).
3. Determinants for TAA included age, absence of dyslipidemia, body surface area, and diastolic blood pressure, as well as the presence of AAA. Determinants for AAA included presence of dyslipidemia, current/past smoking, and the presence of TAA. The study highlighted the need for further research to clarify the relationship between TAA, AAA, dyslipidemia, serum cholesterol, and statin therapy.

In this case report, we present a patient with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and congenital toxoplasmosis. The patient, a 34-year-old Arabian female, had a history of hydrocephalus, right ventriculoperitoneal shunting, and chorioretinitis. Brain imaging revealed multifocal parenchymal calcifications, hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and amygdala hypertrophy. Ictal and interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring confirmed TLE. Despite polytherapy with AEDs, the seizures were poorly controlled, and further evaluation, including video-EEG monitoring, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), was performed to localize the epileptogenic focus. Given the medically intractable TLE and epileptogenic focus in the left temporal lobe, epilepsy surgery with left anteromesial temporal resection was considered to achieve seizure control.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 4}"

1. Approximately 20 million people have gallstones, and 1 million new patients are diagnosed with cholelithiasis every year, making cholecystectomy the most costly digestive disease with an estimated annual cost of over $5 billion.
2. In September 1992, the National Institute of Health (NIH) held a consensus development conference to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The panel concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no increase in morbidity or mortality.
3. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces disability and loss of income, leading to cost savings. However, charges for laparoscopic procedures are often higher than open cholecystectomy due to equipment and technical requirements.
4. Maricopa Medical Center (MMC) identified excessive length of stay (LOS) and charges for cholecystectomy by comparing DRG 195 with other hospitals in the region. The increased charges were attributed to laparoscopy.
5. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients was conducted to determine the cost effectiveness of open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $6,880 more than open cholecystectomies.
6. Decision tree analysis showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective, but reducing laparoscopy charges and applying reusable instruments could make laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost-effective. A reduction of $3,331 to $4,689 in laparoscopic charges would be needed depending on the conversion rate.

1. The study included 242 children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 1994 and 2008, and followed them up to adulthood. Pr (partial remission) occurred in 56.2% of patients, without any case of complete remission. The absence of dka (diabetic ketoacidosis) at diagnosis was more common in pr patients (82.3%) than in those without pr (63.5%). Lower a1c (glycated hemoglobin) levels at diagnosis were also associated with higher chances of pr.
2. Pr duration ranged from 151 to 1572 days (0.5 to 6.6 years), with 71.6% lasting less than a year and 7.5% lasting more than 2 years. Patients entering pr had lower a1c levels at diagnosis and lower insulin doses than those without pr. Lower a1c levels at diagnosis were also associated with longer pr durations in the youngest age group.
3. No significant differences were found in c-peptide secretion, anti-gad65 and anti-ia2 antibody titers, or occurrence of severe hypoglycemia between pr and non-pr patients. However, pr duration was shorter in patients with 2 positive anti-gad65 and anti-ia2 antibodies at diagnosis. No long-term effects of pr on diabetes complications or incidence of severe hypoglycemia were observed, but a short-term effect on metabolic control was suggested in patients with pr durations between 510 and 570 days.

1. Oral health is crucial for individuals of all ages, including the elderly population, as oral lesions can interfere with daily activities and lead to additional symptoms.
2. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines elderly population as those over 60 years old, and in India, 8.6% of the population fell into this category in the 2011 census.
3. Previous studies on oral lesions in the elderly have been conducted in various countries, but none have been done in the Indian subcontinent.
4. The present study aimed to find the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in 5,100 geriatric patients in India, with 60.8% being men and 39.2% women, aged 60 to 98 years.
5. Of these patients, 64% presented with various oral lesions, with males being more affected than females, but the difference was not statistically significant. The majority of lesions were observed in patients between 65 to 70 years of age.
6. The hard palate had the most lesions (23.1%), followed by the tongue (16.4%) and gingiva (14.7%), while the soft palate was the least affected site (3.6%).
7. The most common oral lesions were nicotinic stomatitis (43%) due to tobacco use and denture stomatitis (34%) due to long use of prostheses. Oral submucosal fibrosis (OSMF) was also a commonly seen premalignant lesion (30%).

1. Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that primarily affects the epiphyseal regions of tubular bones, especially the ends of the tibia, femur, and humerus. In the head and neck region, it commonly occurs in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint (TMJ), leading to various symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, clicking of the TMJ, hearing impairments, dizziness, and otorrhea. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma are rare but can occur after irradiation, increasing the risk of malignant progression.
2. A misdiagnosed case of chondroblastoma in the temporal bone is presented, where the initial diagnosis relied solely on imaging analysis without careful MRI/CT scanning or histopathologic examination. This less than thorough approach led to unnecessary treatments and a delay in suitable treatments for this rare chondroblastoma with malignant potential. The study discusses methods for diagnosing chondroblastoma and suitable surgical procedures for maintaining postoperative functionality.

A 41-year-old male with TMJ disorder was initially diagnosed with otitis media due to chronic hearing loss on the right side. Despite several attempts at antibiotic therapy and treatment for eustachian tube blockage, his symptoms were unresponsive. The patient underwent endoscopic surgery and attempts to correct the malocclusion for the TMJ disorder, but there was no significant improvement. A CT scan and pathologic examination later revealed the presence of a giant cell tumor in the temporal bone. The patient consulted the department for persistent restriction of the mouth opening, hearing loss, and dizziness, which he had noticed five years earlier. Re-examination of the CT scan showed that the tumor mass had progressively enlarged and destroyed the middle cranial fossa in the temporal lobe. MRI displayed the presence of a poorly defined mass with predominantly low signal and relatively high signal intensities on T1- and T2-weighted sequences, respectively, involving the right middle cranial fossa and infratemporal fossa floor. The tumor mass invaded the right temporal lobe and destroyed the subzygomatic fossa. The patient reported no",1,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 6}"

1. The benefits of regular structured exercise are well documented, including improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic function, which reduce the risk of chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence suggests that exercise alone reduces visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL), both associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk.
2. However, it is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits in reducing these adipose tissue depots. Cross-sectional analyses indicate an inverse relationship between central adiposity and self-reported physical activity levels, as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
3. Prospective studies have further supported this association, with habitual physical activity being the strongest correlate of central abdominal fat after controlling for environmental and genetic factors. However, self-reported behavior is subject to reporter bias and tends to overestimate activity levels, especially in overweight and obese populations.
4. Emerging evidence using objectively measured physical activity via accelerometry supports these observations, but research using accurate assessments of VAT and IHL is limited. If the epidemiological data can be confirmed by high-quality objective assessments, encouraging habitual physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior will have important clinical ramifications.
5. In this study, the researchers aimed to evaluate whether levels of accurately quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of VAT and IHL in adults with overweight/obesity. They hypothesized that there would be a negative relationship between time spent in moderate intensity physical activity and levels of VAT and IHL and a positive relationship between time spent in sedentary behavior and VAT and IHL content.
6. The study included 82 volunteers from larger intervention trials and conformed to ethical guidelines. Eligible participants were screened via telephone interview and provided informed consent for baseline assessments, which included measures of anthropometry, a fasting blood test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (H-MRS), and accelerometry. Data were analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS).

1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, representing early, mild thyroid failure. The relationship between SCH and adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes is unclear, and the optimal TSH cutoff values and clinical significance of these subclinical abnormalities are controversial.
2. The most common cause of SCH is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is more common in girls and women and can lead to vascular problems characterized by increased vascular stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. SCH is also associated with metabolic syndrome (METS) and increased risks of all-cause mortality and CV events.
3. SCH is associated with various clinical conditions, including weight gain, increased blood pressure (BP), and altered lipid levels. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that higher TSH levels are associated with increased body mass index (BMI), weight gain, and enhanced BP. A meta-analysis found that SCH is associated with higher systolic BP.
4. Thyroid hormones exert multiple effects on the regulation, absorption, and metabolism of lipid synthesis. Previous studies have shown that elevated levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), and possibly triglycerides (TG) are reversed in individuals with overt hypothyroidism following levothyroxine (T4) therapy.
5. SCH can lead to impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function, and older people with SCH and a high CV risk appear to be at an increased risk of incident heart failure. A pooled analysis from six prospective cohorts found that the risk of heart failure events increases in conjunction with higher TSH levels.

1. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (CDAD), which can be diagnosed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh) and toxins A and B.
2. EIA has a lower sensitivity for detecting CDAD toxins compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytotoxigenic culture, with reported sensitivities ranging from 50% to 70%.
3. Patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates are often overlooked, despite the potential for these individuals to transfer C. difficile to others and the need for infection countermeasures.
4. The present study investigated patients with gdh-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens to assess their clinical history and need for treatment.
5. The study retrospectively analyzed patients aged 2 years whose stool specimens were submitted for CDAD testing between March 2013 and June 2014.
6. Patients were divided into three groups based on EIA results: toxin-positive stool, toxin-negative stool with toxin-positive isolates, and toxin-negative stool and isolates.
7. No significant differences were observed in clinical characteristics, diarrhea duration, or antibiotics usage among the three groups. However, a significant difference was found in diarrhea duration between the positive stool and dual-negative groups.
8. The findings suggest that patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates may have milder symptoms, as reported in other studies.
9. The study highlights the importance of considering the potential for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates to contribute to hospital infection and the need for infection countermeasures.

1. Biological scaffolds derived from human, bovine, and porcine dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa have been used for soft tissue repair applications due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria in contaminated settings. These materials are particularly useful in damage control situations for protecting the abdominal contents until granulation tissue forms. However, they are expensive, exhibit variability, and provoke patient-specific immunological responses.
2. Early absorbable polymer scaffolds, such as dexon and vicryl, have been utilized for damage control applications but have limitations. Dexon, made of polyglycolic acid, loses mechanical strength and is fully resorbed within 2-3 months. Vicryl, a copolymer of glycolide and lactide, also loses mechanical strength and is fully resorbed within 2-3 months. Both scaffolds have been shown to have reduced tensile strength and increased mesh failure, making them less than ideal for long-term hernia repair applications.
3. More recent absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly. Gore Bio-A, a copolymer of poly(glycolide : trimethylene carbonate), has been shown to be effective in hernia repair applications and has promising outcomes with low rates of recurrence, infection, and pain. Tigr Matrix, a knitted mesh with two fibers of different resorption rates, has been evaluated in a long-term animal model and a clinical trial, showing gradual resorption and increased collagen deposition compared to permanent polypropylene mesh. Phasix Mesh, a fully resorbable polymer monofilament, has been shown to have appropriate tensile strength and strain values for hernia repair applications and has demonstrated similar burst strengths and relative stiffness to the native abdominal wall in porcine models.

Rudolf Virchow, a 19th century pathologist, is considered the father of modern pathology and was the first to propose that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic inflammation. Gastric cancers have been linked to chronic inflammation, particularly atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria.
2. Pelayo Correa, a Colombian pathologist, devoted his career to understanding the etiology of gastric cancer. In 1975, he published a model for gastric cancer development, hypothesizing that chronic atrophic gastritis leads to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over several decades. The initial changes are thought to occur in the first decade of life, when h pylori colonization occurs.
3. Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered h pylori in the late 1970s and were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2005 for their discovery and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Although they did not directly investigate the role of h pylori in gastric cancer, they speculated that it might play a role in other gastritis-associated diseases.
4. Early epidemiologic studies in the 1980s and 1990s provided weak evidence for a link between h pylori and gastric cancer. However, three large cohort studies with nested case-controls, conducted between 1993 and 1998, found that prior h pylori infection significantly increased the risk of gastric cancer. The World Health Organization declared h pylori as a definite carcinogen in 1994 based on these studies.
5. Subsequent research has confirmed and expanded upon the early epidemiologic studies. H pylori is a risk factor for both intestinal and diffuse-type gastric cancers, and measuring h pylori exposure through western blot against h pylori cytotoxin-associated gene a (CAGA) increases the odds ratio. H pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer, and population-based screening and eradication programs have shown promising results in reducing gastric cancer incidence.

Before the introduction of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, only prevention of visual acuity loss could be achieved in a limited number of patients using different treatment options like laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and vitreoretinal surgery.
2. Intravitreal treatments with Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab, which are full-length antibody against VEGF-A and the Fab part of the antibody against VEGF-A, respectively, have led to preventing baseline visual acuity loss and even achieving visual improvement in some patients. Multicenter studies like MARINA, ANCHOR, PRANTO, and EXCITE, and the comparative study CATT, showed that both drugs were effective in preventing visual acuity loss up to 95% and making an improvement in visual acuity up to 40%.
3. In this study, the functional and anatomical outcomes of Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab therapy were compared on an as-needed treatment regimen for AMD in Turkish patients. The clinical data of patients who were treated with either Bevacizumab or Ranibizumab between 2009 and 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. The mean BCVA and CRT were significantly better than the baseline at every time point in both groups, and the two groups were parallel to each other in terms of change in BCVA and CRT, injection numbers, and complications.

A short-term efficacy and safety study reported that both drugs resulted in similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes one month after an intravitreal injection. A retrospective study reported that after a median follow-up time of 12 months, 79.5% of the patients in the Bevacizumab group and 84.9% of the patients in the Ranibizumab group lost fewer than 15 letters in visual acuity.

Proteinuria is a classic symptom of PE, but several studies suggest that it is not a significant predictor of adverse outcomes. Hypoalbuminemia, which occurs due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased angiotensin secretion, and damaged vascular endothelial cells, may serve as an indicator of PE severity.

1. The past 20 years have seen the development of various agents targeting the VEGF-A signaling pathway, including humanized monoclonal antibodies (such as Avastin) and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which have provided insights into the efficacy of targeting this pathway in cancer.
2. Avastin, a humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF-A, has been widely used in treating various human cancers since the late 1990s, but its limitations, such as the development of resistance and the need for cost-benefit analysis, have been highlighted.
3. Alternative ligands for VEGF receptors (such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D) and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families are being explored as potential candidates for promoting resistance to Avastin and other anti-angiogenic treatments.

1. Over the last two decades, many new immunotherapy approaches for cancer treatment have entered clinical development due to advances in understanding antigen presentation, lymphocyte recognition, and immune system functions.
2. Several agents, such as infusional cytokine therapies for melanoma or renal cell cancer, intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer, and sipuleucel-T for advanced metastatic prostate cancer, have been approved.
3. Other agents, like ipilimumab for advanced melanoma, have shown benefit in large clinical trials and are anticipated for approval.
4. However, evaluating these agents using traditional clinical development paradigms is challenging due to their potential use in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies.
5. Biomarkers of biological response, ideally associated with clinical outcome, are needed to evaluate these agents.
6. Antigen-specific vaccines have relatively straightforward evaluation methods, but few instances of target antigen immune response have been associated with clinical benefit.
7. Broadly active immune modulating agents, like t-cell checkpoint inhibitors or TLR agonists, have elusive biomarkers of response.
8. Studies with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have sought to identify biomarkers, such as amplification of other t-cell costimulatory molecules or antibodies to defined antigenic tumor-associated proteins.
9. Machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) have been used to identify promising biomarkers and potential biomarker networks in complex data sets.
10. The current study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of using ML-BBNs to identify early biomarkers of immune response to vaccine therapies in their data.

1. Nurses, who make up the majority of the global healthcare workforce, have been called upon to engage in national policy processes due to their experiences and insights that can improve health service delivery and inform health systems strengthening. However, historically, nurses have had limited involvement in policy decisions that affect their work environments.
2. Reasons for nurses' underengagement in policy include lack of awareness and knowledge of policy issues and processes, inadequate skills to contribute, and gender differences in the healthcare system that favor men in decision-making roles. In Kenya, for instance, a survey revealed that nurse leaders and hospital-based nurses were not involved in policy formulation or modification stages.
3. Strategies to enhance nurses' engagement in policy processes include assuming formal leadership positions, lobbying and advocacy through professional organizations, and building nurses' understanding of policy and politics through integrated courses in nursing training programs.
4. The study applied a critical theory perspective to examine nurses' involvement in national health policy processes in Kenya, revealing historical hierarchies and gender-related issues that influenced nurses' participation. The findings showed that nurses were not adequately involved in policy development processes, and their contributions were considered inadequate by both nursing and non-nursing decision-makers.

1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited disorders caused by a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most common variant is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), affecting 95% of patients.
2. CAH patients with 21-OHD experience hyperplasia of the adrenal gland due to decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens and chronic hyperandrogenic state.
3. CAH patients exhibit different clinical forms, including classical CAH with salt-wasting (SW) and simple virilizing (SV) forms, and non-classical (NC) CAH with postnatal or adult onset hyperandrogenism. Studies suggest high genotype-phenotype concordance in classic CAH.
4. Treatment for CAH involves replacement of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and suppress abnormal androgen and steroid precursor secretion. However, conventional glucocorticoid replacement cannot mimic natural circadian rhythms, leading to over-suppression or under-suppression, causing various side effects and complications.

2. Two main ways of annotating genes exist: empirical observations and predicted evolutionary relationships. Websites like LocusLink, Genecards, and Ensembl integrate diverse sources of information for individual genes.
3. Homology-based annotation relies on evolutionary relationships, allowing for inferences about tertiary structures and functions based on homologous genes. However, homology does not always indicate functional similarity.
4. Domains are homologous portions of sequences that have survived evolution and represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution. Domain resources like Pfam, SMART, Prosite, and InterPro detect and predict domains using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments.
5. InterPro combines multiple domain lexicons to provide annotation for a larger percentage of Swiss-Prot and Trembl entries, reducing the need to query each resource separately.
6. Gene annotation by domain content implies that a protein's function is a synthesis of its component parts, providing the best predictions for the uncharacterized majority of human genes.

WISH was initially performed using radioactive probes but was simplified with the use of nonradioactive probes.
2. WISH is widely used in various biological systems, including drosophila, xenopus, quail, dictyostelium, and zebrafish, and has applications in medical and prenatal diagnostics. Chromogenic multilabeling techniques have limitations, such as difficulty in discerning overlapping regions of expression.
3. Fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts may overcome the limitations of chromogenic methods, but successful implementation is rare, especially in mouse or xenopus embryos, and the images are of insufficient quality. Autofluorescence of embryos complicates fluorescent detection.
4. Quantum dots (QDs) are inorganic fluorophores with ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission, long excited state lifetime, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching.
5. Previous efforts to use QDs for in situ hybridization in embryos met with aggregation issues and were time-consuming due to the need for rna covalently linked to hydroxylated QDs. New methods of creating hydrophilic QDs and hydrophilic QD conjugates have become commercially available.

1. Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus and is common in areas where there is close contact between intermediate (sheep) and definitive (dogs) hosts.
2. CE in humans presents with symptoms related to fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other viscera, and diagnosis is typically established through radiology and serology.
3. Postsurgical follow-up of CE patients is necessary due to the risk of relapses or treatment failure, which can affect between 2-25% of cases.
4. Serology has been used for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies makes it difficult to diagnose relapses.
5. This study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of CE using immunoblotting analysis.
6. The study also reported on the post-operative evolution of patients treated for CE and determined the diagnostic performance of western blot.
7. Blood samples were obtained from 50 CE patients, 40 non-CE patients, and 20 healthy controls, and all underwent surgical procedures after receiving standard antihelminthic treatment.
8. The results were compared between preoperative and post-operative groups using paired t-test, and hydatid cyst fluid antigen (HCF) was prepared for use in the study.

1. Obesity is a global metabolic disease associated with dyslipidemias.
2. Classical obesity parameters include BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).
3. Newer obesity indices like waist-to-height ratio (WHTR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and body adiposity index (BAI) are gaining attention.
4. WHTR may help assess risk of metabolic complications, including dyslipidemia and cardiovascular events.
5. There is limited data on the associations between VAI and BAI with lipid profiles in obese patients.
6. This study aimed to examine the relationship between obesity parameters and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
7. The study included 66 obese non-diabetic patients, with mean age of 55.8 years and 63.6% women.
8. Patients were divided into three groups based on their obesity level: class I (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m²), class II (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m²), and class III (BMI ≥40 kg/m²).
9. Patients with a history of diabetes, pregnancy, cancer, acute stroke, renal or hepatic diseases, cardiovascular events, or abdominal surgery were excluded.
10. The study found that patients in class III obesity had lower mean serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to class I obesity, but this was not related to lipid-lowering treatment.

2. A bias voltage was applied through the gauges to down-mix their resistance change at the actuation frequency, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier.
3. Typical measurement values included a bias voltage of 1.5 V at 500 kHz and all measurements performed in a vacuum chamber at 10 mbar and room temperature.
4. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same setup with the drive electrode disconnected, and the allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration.
5. The phase of the measured signal was transformed into frequency fluctuations using the resonator's phase response, and the complete phase response was used instead of the linear approximation.
6. Harmonics appearing at the electricity supply frequency were filtered out during post-processing, and n samples of the resonance frequency were obtained, each averaged over an integration time.
7. To obtain frequency stability for higher integration times, initial samples were averaged in groups and the allan deviation was calculated using equation (2).
8. Correlation measurements were performed by measuring the resonator's response at different frequencies within its bandwidth using a doubled measurement setup, with care taken to avoid cross-talk and keep the resonator in the linear regime.

2. Aspirin therapy is a prevention measure recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force to prevent heart attack and ischemic stroke. It can be used as both a primary and secondary prevention measure.
3. A study was conducted to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations for aspirin therapy for CVD prevention using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012.
4. Among adults aged 40 and older, 3435 individuals answered questions about aspirin use, representing 142,677,272 Americans. Less than a third of those eligible for aspirin as primary prevention reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin.
5. Among primary prevention patients, less than half of those with a high CHD risk level received a recommendation to take aspirin, while over three-quarters of those classified as low risk were also recommended to take aspirin. Of those told to take aspirin, the vast majority complied with the recommendation.
6. The study also examined differences in being told to take aspirin and whether they were taking it among low, intermediate, and high-risk diabetes patients. Among low-risk diabetes patients, 54.6% were told to take aspirin, compared to 72.8% of intermediate-risk and 56.2% of high-risk diabetes patients. However, there were no statistically significant differences in taking aspirin among these groups.

1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate signaling through posttranslational modification of proteins, including the oxidation of cysteine thiol groups.
2. ROS are converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by cellular superoxide dismutases, and oxidation of cysteine thiol groups results in formation of sulphenic acid, disulfide bonds, or sulfenyl amide bonds, changing protein function.
3. Cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms, similar to phosphatases, deubiquitinating enzymes, or histone deacetylases.
4. Mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generation is required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorigenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia.
5. Increased evidence suggests that mitochondria and mROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs, including stem cell differentiation.
6. Cellular mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity are increased when stem cells are induced to differentiate, and increased cellular ROS levels and oxidation products correlate with differentiation of various stem cells.
7. Hematopoietic stem cells contain significantly lower levels of ROS than more differentiated cells, and low mitochondrial mass and oxidant content correlate with stem cell maintenance.
8. In the epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium, mROS act as pro-differentiation signals and are key upstream regulators of stem cell fate decisions, promoting signaling through pathways required for differentiation of mammalian stem cell populations in vivo.

2. In the present study, an in situ hybridization (ISH) technique was established using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAI) for detecting HCV-RNA in FFPE tissue sections of the liver.
3. Positive controls were obtained from humanized liver specimens of HCV-infected chimeric mice, and 13 humanized liver specimens and 11 needle biopsy liver specimens were used in the study.
4. The ISH technique involved quenching endogenous peroxidase activity, digesting with proteinase K, heat-treating, hybridizing with the LNA-modified oligonucleotide probe, and visualizing the reaction products.
5. The study demonstrated that the ISH technique using the LNA-modified oligonucleotide probe and CSAI can be applied to detecting HCV-RNA in liver biopsy specimens, with a sensitivity comparable to in situ RT-PCR.
6. The method is relatively simple, requires no special equipment, and seems suitable for demonstrating the HCV genome in FFPE sections, making it a valuable tool for routine histopathological diagnosis of HCV infection using FFPE liver biopsy specimens.

2. The OECD and EPA established guidelines for investigating thyroid toxicity using frog metamorphosis due to their susceptibility to contaminants and the role of thyroid hormones in their development.
3. Thyroid hormones (THs) are secreted by the thyroid gland and converted to the more active form, triiodothyronine (T3), mainly in peripheral tissues.
4. THs are transported in the blood bound to transport proteins, primarily transthyretin (TTR), with conjugation and degradation occurring in the liver.
5. Several processes influence TH balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation, which can be disrupted by environmental contaminants.
6. Inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake and suppression of thyroidal peroxidase activity can disrupt TH synthesis and secretion.
7. Induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes and competitive binding to thyroid transport proteins are other potential targets for environmental contaminants.
8. Sulfation and glucuronidation are important pathways for TH elimination, but their activity can be inhibited by various chemicals.

1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (eETs) are a group of autacoids involved in various physiological functions, including blood pressure regulation, nociception, adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory activity, organ regeneration, insulin potentiation, and podocyte integrity. The most prominent eET isomer, 14,15-eET, arises from the metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes p450, particularly the 2c and 2j families. The ratio and stereocomposition of eET isomers are dependent on the specific cytochrome p450 isoform and species.
2. The stability and therapeutic utility of eETs are limited due to their susceptibility to aerial or auto-oxidation and inactivating enzymatic processes such as esterification, metabolism by other arachidonate cascade pathways, conjugation, oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide. Hydration by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a major determinant in maintaining steady state levels of 14,15-eET, which has a half-life of seconds to minutes. Inhibition of sEH can elevate eET levels both in vitro and in vivo, offering a potential means for pharmacologic intervention.
3. Researchers have developed eET surrogates with improved stability to address some of the limitations of natural eETs. These surrogates modify the free carboxylic acid of previous generation eET mimics while retaining key structural features. Conjugating the carboxylate with a short poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) unit improved both vasorelaxation and the EC50 for vasorelaxation, regardless of the type of epoxide bioisostere. Linking the carboxylate to the nitrogen of glycine or aspartic acid resulted in a modest boost to vasoactivities while significantly dropping the SEH IC50.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients had significantly higher serum serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations than normal, with the vast majority having elevated levels above the normal range. SAA is an acute-phase protein released in response to inflammation and infection, and its production is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, TNF, and IFN-. SAA not only plays a role in cholesterol metabolism but also contributes to the proinflammatory cascade in RA, impairing the protective function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and secondary amyloidosis.
2. The mean SAA concentration was significantly higher in men than in women, and men had higher inflammatory parameters, unfavorable lipid profiles, higher CVD risk markers, and higher cystatin-C (Cys-C) concentrations. SAA was also significantly higher in patients with high disease activity (HDA), currently treated with glucocorticoids (GCs), and advanced atherosclerosis. Women treated with biological DMARDS had significantly lower SAA concentrations than those treated only with synthetic DMARDS, indicating better therapeutic effects.
3. Elevated SAA levels were found not only in patients with HDA but also in those with low or moderate disease activity, suggesting that sustained inflammation persists in most RA patients and may be connected with disease complications. SAA may play a pathogenic role locally in joint destruction and cartilage damage by inducing cell growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and migration of cells, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and matrix metalloproteinases. SAA may also serve as a biomarker of persistent synovial inflammation resistant to therapy, and high levels during anti-TNF treatment might indicate the need for alternative treatment strategies.

2. Polyhalite is associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides. Its crystal structure was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, in 1970.
3. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4MgSO4H2O at temperatures above 70°C.

1. Oxidative stress, caused by an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defense, is a critical factor in several systemic diseases.
2. Propofol, a lipid-soluble anesthetic, has antioxidant properties and protects against oxidative stress in various organs.
3. This study investigated the effects of propofol on lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and antioxidant indices in rodents.
4. Propofol was administered intraperitoneally to male Wistar rats at doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for four weeks.
5. The study found that propofol significantly increased serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol levels while decreasing HDL-cholesterol levels.
6. The increased cholesterol levels may be due to increased alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coA reductase activity or decreased fatty oxidation.
7. Propofol also increased hepatic GSH levels and the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, enhancing the detoxifying potential of the liver.
8. The study showed that propofol increased serum LDH and CK-MB activities, suggesting cardiac muscle damage.
9. The insignificant effects of propofol on ALT, AST, and creatinine levels indicate that the drug has no adverse effect on hepatic and renal tissues, but its use in patients with cardiovascular or lipid disorders should be carefully reviewed.

Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have revealed that the genome is folded into hierarchical structures called topologically associating domains (TADs), which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size and exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions. TADs are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions, and their boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences.
2. Brg1, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, contributes to TAD boundary strength. Brg1 regulates nucleosome occupancy and possibly ctfC localization at TAD boundaries, which may prevent long-range interactions from surpassing the boundary. Brg1 knockdown results in reduced nucleosome occupancy around ctfC sites and weaker TAD boundaries.
3. The orderly positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes at TAD boundaries may be achieved by enriched ctfC binding, which positions 20 nucleosomes around its binding sites. Brg1 loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and preclude the binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries.
4. Topoisomerases play a role in TAD organization by regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly ctfC localization. Brg1 interacts with topoisomerases IIA and IIB, and is required for their recruitment to chromatin. The atpase activity of brg1 is essential for the recruitment of topoisomerase proteins.

1. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The characteristics of SPIONs, including their superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated, enable MPI to provide high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios. Potential applications of MPI include cardiovascular imaging and guidance of interventions.
2. In the context of cardiovascular MPI, the pharmacokinetics of SPIONs, particularly their blood half-life, are important. Resovist, an approved T2 contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is the most commonly used benchmark material for MPI. However, its blood half-life in MPI may differ significantly from that in MRI due to the different imaging principles and the fact that not all resovist particles contribute equally to the MPI signal.
3. The present study aimed to evaluate the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and compared the performance of two different versions of resovist, one distributed by Bayer Pharma AG and the other by Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. The study found that the signal for resovist from Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd showed a faster decay below noise level than that from Bayer Pharma AG, which was statistically significant. However, there was no significant difference in the absolute signal strength of the baseline blood MPI signal or in the mpi signal decay between the two compounds in the dilution series.

Blood samples were collected at various time points after injection, and the MPI signal was evaluated using MPS. The study found that the average MPI signal in blood declined to 30% of the baseline signal 5 minutes after injection, and was below the noise level of the MPS within 30 minutes for both types of resovist.

1. The control of appetite is complex and involves inputs from both physiological and environmental sources. Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue, forming the glucostatic, aminostatic, and lipostatic hypotheses.
2. More recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, along with sensory features of food. Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones like ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the GI tract or associated organs.
3. A new formulation explains how body composition and energy expenditure (EE) regulate hunger and appetite based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects.
4. An alternative approach to appetite control comes from the study of energy balance and the interrelationships between EE and energy intake (EI). Any increase in EE will be met with an equivalent increase in EI, but daily EE can fluctuate, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest and most stable component of total daily EE.
5. RMR, as a measure of EE, reflects a physiological demand for energy that acts as a driver of food intake, as proposed by Edholm et al. (1955).
6. Prolonged exercise displays a dual-process action by stimulating hunger (an effect that is highly variable between individuals) but also by increasing post-prandial satiety signaling through an effect on GI peptides.
7. The formulation proposes that ffm and rmr contribute to a physiological demand for energy that influences appetite, and leptin could act as a major tonic inhibitory signal and also as an energostatic factor through its influence on ffm.
8. The influence of ffm and rmr upon food intake is a physiological way of achieving energy balance, but a high rmr could influence weight gain by maintaining a high level of hunger, depending on the energy density and palatability of the diet.

1. Phas are intracellular energy and carbon storage compounds produced by a wide variety of microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. The accumulation of phas increases the survival capabilities of these microorganisms in extreme environments or when nutrient availability is poor.
2. Phas are divided into two groups based on the number of constituent carbon atoms in their monomer units: short-chain-length (SCL) phas and medium-chain-length (MCL) phas. SCL-phas consist of monomers with 35 carbon atoms, while MCL-phas consist of monomers with 614 carbon atoms.
3. The surface of pha granules is coated with phospholipids and proteins, which play a major role in pha synthesis, degradation, and regulation. The type of pha produced and accumulated in the granules depends on the metabolic pathway of the particular microorganism, but pha synthase always plays the main role.
4. Pha synthases were classified into four classes based on their substrate specificities and subunits organization. Classes I, III, and IV prefer to synthesize SCL-phas, while class II is responsible for MCL-pha synthesis. Class I of pha synthase consists of single subunit enzymes, while classes III and IV consist of two different types of subunits. Class II of pha synthase is also built by single subunit but it is coded by two forms of gene, phac1 and phac2, with similar nucleotide composition but different substrate specificity.

1. Microglia, once considered immune privileged cells in the central nervous system (CNS), now play a crucial role in innate immunity within the CNS. They are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and develop into immature and mature cells before invading the developing brain at e9.5. Microglia are multifunctional and involved in immune surveillance, inflammatory response, phagocytosis, synaptic refinement, and angiogenesis.
2. The glymphatic system, an interstitial fluid/cerebrospinal fluid exchange system, facilitates immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid. This system enables communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes, allowing for the clearance of interstitial solutes and the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid into meningeal lymphatic vessels.
3. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of depolarization and electrical silence in the brain, can be elicited by various stimuli and is accompanied by secondary changes in cerebral blood flow. CSD can initiate inflammatory activation of microglia, which in turn can lower the threshold for CSD induction, forming a positive feedback mechanism. Microglia express voltage-sensitive ion channels and can sense electrical activity pertaining to CSD.

1. Transposable elements (TES), including retroelements and DNA transposons, have long been considered as selfish and junk elements in genomes, but recent evidence suggests they serve important roles in genetic innovation and organismal evolution. For instance, retroelements like retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons can form new cellular protein-coding genes through molecular domestication.
2. One prominent example of such genes is the mart gene family, which originated from the gag gene of Ty3/Gypsy elements. These genes encode structural proteins with nucleic acid binding properties and have essential functions in placenta development and cell proliferation and apoptosis in mammals. Two autosomal mart genes, peg10 (mart2) and peg11/rtl1 (mart1), are subject to genomic imprinting and are expressed from the paternal allele.
3. Another example is the scan family of dna binding proteins derived from the gag protein of a Gmr1-like gypsy/Ty3 retrotransposon. These proteins have been shown to regulate diverse biological processes such as hematopoiesis, stem cell properties, or cell proliferation and apoptosis in vertebrates. One member of this family, fv1, is of retroviral origin and controls replication of the murine leukemia virus in the mouse.

1. Progressive diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, affect an increasing number of people and have high societal costs due to their ability to amplify and propagate misfolded protein aggregates.
2. Misfolded proteins can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function by perturbing membrane integrity, creating novel signaling platforms, trapping molecular chaperones, and recruiting soluble forms of the same protein.
3. Protein aggregates made of fibrillar material are the hallmarks of these diseases and can be propagated in a prion-like manner between cells.
4. Molecular chaperones play a central role in opposing protein misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation, but under stress conditions, their capacity can be exceeded, leading to the formation of intracellular or extracellular protein deposits.
5. The ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy are the primary mechanisms for clearing misfolded proteins, but their failure can result in the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.
6. Small molecules, such as polyphenols and neurotrophic factors, and neural stem cell-based treatments are being explored as potential therapeutic strategies for targeting protein aggregation, clearance, and disease propagation.

1. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa with a prevalence of about 1-2%, characterized by a dense subepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes, increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and degeneration of basal keratinocytes.
2. The interleukin-23/interleukin-17 (IL-23/IL-17) axis is a newly discovered proinflammatory signaling pathway, with IL-23 and IL-17 being two pivotal cytokines. IL-23 functions as an important driving factor in the immune response and induces the differentiation of a novel subset of CD4+ T cells, called Th17, which produces IL-17.
3. In OLP lesions, both erosive and reticular forms showed increased expression and distribution of IL-23p19 and IL-17 compared to normal oral mucosa. IL-23p19 was predominantly expressed in the epithelium and extracellular matrix of the lamina propria, while IL-17 was mainly found in the cytoplasm of infiltrated lymphocytes.
4. The upregulation of IL-23 in OLP lesions is positively correlated with the increased expression of IL-17 in the reticular subgroup, suggesting a potential regulatory role of IL-23 in the early stages of OLP lesion development.
5. IL-17 selectively regulates the expressions of some inflammatory mediators in oral keratinocytes, such as HBD-2, HBD-3, IL-8, CCL-20, and TNF-, indicating the selectively regulatory role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the immune network in OLP lesions.
6. Further investigations are needed to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of the overexpression and regulatory effects of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in OLP lesions and its interaction with other signaling pathways, as well as the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this axis for the prevention and management of OLP.

1. Valerie Oppenheimer's influential articles emphasized the role of men's socioeconomic position in demographic change, specifically in the declining rates of marriage and the tendency to postpone or forego marriage (Oppenheimer, 1988, 2000, 2003; Oppenheimer et al.).
2. The economic perspective argued that more symmetrical economic roles of men and women would lead to a decline in the gains to marriage and undermine marital solidarity, while the cultural perspective emphasized the importance of ideological change and individual autonomy in the decline of marriage (Becker, 1981; Espenshade, 1985; Farley, 1988; Parsons, 1949; Lesthaeghe & Van de Kaa, 1986, 1988).
3. Oppenheimer criticized both perspectives, noting that there were no signs of an ""independence effect"" and that women's employment and education had an effect on fertility and divorce but not on marriage timing (Oppenheimer, 1994, 1997).
4. The economic position of young men in the United States had deteriorated quickly in the 1980s and 1990s, especially for those with little schooling, providing an important potential explanation for the decline of marriage (Oppenheimer, 1988).
5. Oppenheimer's theory had a more optimistic implication for the future of marriage than the other theories, as it focused on the economic position of young men and the potential for improvement in the economic prospects for this group (Oppenheimer, 1988).

1. Malaria is caused by parasites belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, family Plasmodiidae, and genus Plasmodium, with the most prevalent species being Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. The natural transmission occurs through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, with Anopheles darlingi being the most prevalent species. The Brazilian Ministry of Health provides free antimalarial medicines and directs therapy through the Unified Health System (SUS).
2. Chloroquine is used to treat malaria caused by P. vivax and P. ovale, with a dose of 30 mg/kg divided into three days and primaquine in a dose of 30 mg/day for 7 days or 15 mg/day for 14 days. Pregnant women and children under 6 months of age receive only chloroquine. Primaquine is the only antimalarial drug with effective activity against all the species' gametocytes and latent forms responsible for relapses. However, it has hemolytic effects, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
3. Common side effects of chloroquine include retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, neuromyopathy, and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting, ototoxicity, tingling, itching, and change in skin color, in addition to seizures, insomnia, and paresthesia. Primaquine side effects include hemolytic anemia, jaundice, choluria, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The occurrence of symptoms specifically related to antimalarial drugs and the overlap of symptoms of malaria with side effects may decrease adherence to treatment.

1. The text discusses the correlation between lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in elderly men, with several studies showing a strong association between the two conditions. The proposed hypothesis suggests that overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system may be a common cause for both LUTS and ED.
2. The study aimed to examine the effects of a combination of the alpha-blocker tamsulosin and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin on erectile function in patients with LUTS/BPH and ED. The inclusion criteria were male patients aged 40 years or older with an IPSS total score > 12, an IPSS-QOL score > 3, and an IEF-5 score < 20.
3. The results showed that both groups, which received either tamsulosin alone or tamsulosin and solifenacin, had significant improvements in IPSS total, IPSS-VD, IPSS-ST, and IPSS-QOL scores after the 3-month treatment. However, only the group receiving tamsulosin had a significant improvement in the IEF-5 score associated with the degree of improvement in the IPSS-ST domain.

1. miRNAs, particularly the mir-200 family, have been shown to play crucial roles in cancer development and progression. They can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, and their expression profiles differ between normal and cancerous tissues. miRNAs can affect protein expression, including those involved in pathways relevant to cancer, such as apoptosis, migration, and metastasis. They hold promise as biomarkers for various types of cancer.

The mir-200 family, consisting of five members (mir-200a, -200b, -200c, -141, and -429), is highly homologous and can repress both zeb1 and zeb2. Originally, mir-200c was reported to directly bind zeb1 and cause its degradation, leading to e-cadherin upregulation. However, subsequent studies revealed that all members of the mir-200 family can repress zeb1 and zeb2. Mir-200c represses not only zeb1/2 but also a program of transcripts normally expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin.

2. miRNAs, specifically mir-200c, can impact cancer cell behavior in various ways. In breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, mir-200c represses zeb1, leading to decreased migration and invasion, independent of e-cadherin expression. Mir-200c also represses tubb3, a common mechanism of resistance to microtubule-targeting agents in many types of cancer, and restores sensitivity to paclitaxel. The double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1 allows for plasticity between the epithelial and mesenchymal states.

1. The transobturator approach to treating female stress urinary incontinence was first described by Delorme using an outside-in approach, and later by de Leval using an inside-out approach to reduce potential injuries to the urethra and bladder. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator muscle procedures.
2. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective, but traditional dissections do not allow for studying the relationship between the tape and the urethra. This study aimed to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both approaches using CT scan image analysis.
3. The study revealed that the mus tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior, and the out-in tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the in-out tapes. Qualitative assessment demonstrated a safe distance from the tapes to the obturator canal for both techniques, but distances to individual obturator nerve branches could not be determined.
4. The mean full inner angle of the in-out mus measured 122 (95%ci: 107-136) degrees, while the out-in mus measured 144 (95%ci: 131-151) degrees (p = 0.02). The differences between the tapes' inner angles were significantly different, with a mean difference of 19.8 (median 19.0) degrees (wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.008).

1. Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, testified before the Children, Young People and Education Committee regarding the impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. He emphasized the significance of the HE system in Wales, which contributes about £5 billion annually and creates 50,000 jobs. Uncertainty surrounding relationships and arrangements with Europe is causing difficulties for university management. The HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income from the EU, including EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding. Applications from EU students and international students have decreased, and collaborative research activities have become more challenging.
2. Bethan Owen, the Director of Institutional Engagement, provided details on the decreases in EU and international student applications. UCAS data shows an 8% decrease in EU-domiciled applicants and a 9% decrease in international non-EU applicants. The reasons for these decreases include the change in student support arrangements for EU students and the attractiveness of institutions based on their investment in facilities and infrastructure.
3. The universities are planning for various scenarios, including the possibility of a lack of investment in capital infrastructure due to financing arrangements and the fee regime in recent years. They are also considering the need for more significant investment in capital if they are to raise the game and be more competitive. The Diamond dividend, which is expected to release more cash into Welsh universities, is not yet clear in terms of the amount or the proportion that will be released to HEIs. The sector is currently managing deficits and is working to strengthen their position before the Diamond dividend is implemented.
