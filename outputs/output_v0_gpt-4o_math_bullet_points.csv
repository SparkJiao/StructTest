**Step 1**: Define the initial number of vacuum cleaners.

- Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

**Step 2**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house.

- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

**Step 3**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house.

- After selling at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 4**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house.

- Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.

**Step 5**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house.

- After selling at the red house, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 6**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house.

- She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

**Step 7**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house.

- After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 8**: Set up the equation for the remaining vacuum cleaners.

- We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we set up the equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
  \]

**Step 9**: Solve the equation for \( x \).

- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
  \]

- Add 2 to both sides:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{3} = 12
  \]

- Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
  \[
  2x = 36
  \]

- Divide by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 18
  \]

**Step 10**: Verify the solution.

- Initially, Melanie had 18 vacuum cleaners.
- She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) at the green house, leaving her with 12.
- She sold 2 at the red house, leaving her with 10.
- She sold half of 10, which is 5, at the orange house, leaving her with 5.

25,"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to set up an equation based on the total cost of all the items she purchased. Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1** Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal.

- The chicken meal costs $12.

**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the milk packs.

- Each pack of milk costs $3.
- Marie ordered 5 packs of milk.
- Total cost for milk = \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the apples.

- Each apple costs $1.50.
- Marie ordered 4 apples.
- Total cost for apples = \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

**Step 4** Set up the equation for the total cost.

- Let \(x\) be the number of boxes of pizza.
- Each box of pizza costs $8.50.
- Total cost for pizza = \(8.50x\).
- The total amount paid by Marie is $50.
- Equation: \(12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50\).

**Step 5** Simplify the equation.

- Combine the known costs: \(12 + 15 + 6 = 33\).
- The equation becomes: \(33 + 8.50x = 50\).

**Step 6** Solve for \(x\).

- Subtract 33 from both sides: \(8.50x = 50 - 33\).
- Simplify the right side: \(8.50x = 17\).

**Step 7** Divide by 8.50 to find \(x\).

- \(x = \frac{17}{8.50}\).
- Calculate \(x\): \(x = 2\).

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints12MathFormat'}

### 1. Understand the ratio

- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is given as 7:11.
- This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts.

### 2. Define variables

- Let Darrell's age be \(7x\).
- Let Allen's age be \(11x\).

### 3. Set up the equation

- The total of their ages is given as 162.
- Therefore, the equation is: \(7x + 11x = 162\).

### 4. Simplify the equation

- Combine like terms: \(18x = 162\).

### 5. Solve for \(x\)

- Divide both sides by 18: \(x = \frac{162}{18}\).
- Calculate \(x\): \(x = 9\).

### 6. Calculate Allen's current age

- Allen's age is \(11x\).
- Substitute \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age: \(11 \times 9 = 99\).

### 7. Determine Allen's age 10 years from now

- Add 10 years to Allen's current age: \(99 + 10 = 109\).

50,"# Calculating Lloyd's Weekly Earnings from Egg Sales

1. **Calculate Daily Dozens of Eggs**  
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.  
   - Since a dozen equals 12 eggs, divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:  
     \[
     \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens}
     \]

2. **Determine Daily Earnings**  
   - Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2.  
   - Multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find daily earnings:  
     \[
     21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate Weekly Earnings**  
   - There are 7 days in a week.  
   - Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to find weekly earnings:  
     \[
     42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

4. **Final Result**

51,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to return at a different speed. Let's break it down step by step.

### 1

Calculate the duration of Tom's initial journey. 

- Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM.
- The duration of this journey is \(4 - 1 = 3\) hours.

### 2

Determine the distance Tom travels during this time.

- Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
- Distance traveled is calculated as speed multiplied by time.
- Therefore, the distance is \(10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

### 3

Calculate the time it takes for Tom to return.

- Tom returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour.
- The distance he needs to travel back is 30 miles.
- Time is calculated as distance divided by speed.
- Therefore, the time taken to return is \(\frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}\).

### 4

State the final result.

- The time it takes Tom to get back is \(\boxed{5}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

53,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

### 1. Calculate Thursday's Revenue

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires on Thursday.
- The charge for each truck tire is $60.
- Therefore, the revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires on Thursday.
- The charge for each car tire is $40.
- Therefore, the revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- The total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

### 2. Calculate Friday's Revenue

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday.
- The charge for each car tire is $40.
- Therefore, the revenue from car tires on Friday is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires on Friday, so there is no revenue from truck tires.
- The total revenue for Friday is \(480\) dollars.

### 3. Compare the Revenues

- Thursday's total revenue is $520.
- Friday's total revenue is $480.
- Thursday has the higher revenue.

### 4. Calculate the Difference in Revenue

- The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

- The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds.
- The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
- Therefore, the maximum additional weight the truck can carry is \(5000 - 3755 = 1245\) pounds.

**Step 2** Determine the weight of one box.

- Each box weighs 15 pounds.

**Step 3** Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Start by identifying the square footage of the top level of the sandcastle. According to the problem, the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.

### 2

Understand the pattern: each level has half the square footage of the level below it. Therefore, to find the square footage of the level below the top level (level 3), you need to multiply the square footage of level 4 by 2.

### 3

Calculate the square footage of level 3. Since level 4 has 16 square feet, level 3 will have \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet.

### 4

Repeat the process for level 2. Multiply the square footage of level 3 by 2 to find the square footage of level 2. Thus, level 2 will have \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet.

### 5

Repeat the process for level 1. Multiply the square footage of level 2 by 2 to find the square footage of level 1. Thus, level 1 will have \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet.

### 6

Now, calculate the total square footage of all levels combined. Add the square footage of each level: \(128 + 64 + 32 + 16\).

### 7

Perform the addition: \(128 + 64 = 192\), \(192 + 32 = 224\), \(224 + 16 = 240\).

### 8

Calculate the average square footage per level by dividing the total square footage by the number of levels. There are 4 levels, so divide 240 by 4.

Perform the division: \(240 \div 4 = 60\).

84,"To solve the problem of determining how many games the football team won, we can follow these steps:

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( x \) be the number of games the team lost.
- Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \( x + 8 \).

### 2. Set Up the Equation

- The total number of games played is 22. Therefore, the sum of the games won and lost should equal 22.
- This gives us the equation: 
  \[
  x + (x + 8) = 22
  \]

### 3. Simplify the Equation

- Combine like terms in the equation:
  \[
  2x + 8 = 22
  \]

### 4. Solve for \( x \)

- Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x = 14
  \]

- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 7
  \]

### 5. Calculate the Number of Wins

- Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, substitute \( x = 7 \) into the expression for wins:
  \[
  x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
  \]

### 6. Verify the Solution

- Check that the total number of games (wins + losses) equals 22:
  - Wins: 15
  - Losses: 7
  - Total: \( 15 + 7 = 22 \), which matches the given total.

- The outer dimensions of each box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.

### 2. Calculate the inner dimensions of one box

- Since the walls are 1 inch thick, subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).
- Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches.
- Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches.
- Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches.

### 3. Calculate the inner volume of one box

- Use the formula for volume: Volume = length × width × height.
- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

### 4. Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes

- Multiply the inner volume of one box by the number of boxes.

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( q \) represent the number of queen bees.
- Let \( b \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( w \) represent the number of worker bees.

### 2. Establish Relationships

- According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so \( b = 2q \).
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( w = 2b \).

### 3. Express Total Bees

- The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of queens, babies, and workers: \( q + b + w = 700 \).

### 4. Substitute Relationships

- Substitute \( b = 2q \) into the total equation: \( q + 2q + w = 700 \).
- Substitute \( w = 2b \) into the equation: \( q + 2q + 2b = 700 \).

### 5. Simplify Equation

- Replace \( b \) with \( 2q \) in the equation: \( q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700 \).
- Simplify the equation: \( q + 2q + 4q = 700 \).

### 6. Solve for \( q \)

- Combine like terms: \( 7q = 700 \).
- Divide both sides by 7: \( q = 100 \).

### 7. Calculate \( b \)

- Since \( b = 2q \), substitute \( q = 100 \): \( b = 2 \times 100 = 200 \).

Start by defining the variables for the number of flowers Sandra ordered. Let \( x \) represent the number of white carnations.

### 2

According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 5x = 200 \]

### 3

Solve the equation for \( x \) to find the number of white carnations:

\[ x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

### 4

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Since she ordered 40 white carnations, the number of red roses she ordered is:

\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

184,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two different events and then compare them. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

- A six-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6.
- The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
- There are 3 numbers greater than 3 out of 6 possible outcomes.

### 2. Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

- The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
- Probability = 3/6 = 1/2.

### 3. Calculate the probability of rolling an even number

- The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
- There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

### 4. Determine the probability of rolling an even number

- The probability of rolling an even number is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
- Probability = 3/6 = 1/2.

### 5. Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

- To find the probability of two independent events both occurring, multiply their probabilities.
- Probability of first even number = 1/2.
- Probability of second even number = 1/2.
- Probability of two even numbers in a row = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

### 6. Compare the probabilities

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 1/2.
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/4.

### 7. Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3

- To find how much more likely one event is compared to another, divide the probabilities.
- (1/2) / (1/4) = 2.

### 8. Express the result as a percentage

- The result of 2 means that rolling a number greater than 3 is twice as likely as rolling two even numbers in a row.
- To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100.
- 2 * 100 = 200%.

### 1. Determine the Cost Price per Bag

- The trader buys each bag at $20.
- The transportation cost per bag is $2.
- Therefore, the total cost price per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

### 2. Determine the Selling Price per Bag

- The trader sells each bag at $30.

### 3. Calculate the Profit per Bag

- Profit per bag = $30 - $22 = $8.

### 4. Use the Total Profit to Find the Number of Bags Sold

- The total profit made by the trader is $400.
- Since the profit per bag is $8, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.
- Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag = $400 / $8.

- Mr. Bert allows the removal of the lowest score from the average.
- Therefore, only 5 scores will be considered for the average.

**Step 3** Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.

- The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
- The lowest score is 71.

**Step 4** Calculate the sum of the scores after removing the lowest score.

- Remove the lowest score (71) from the sum of the first five scores.
- New sum = 438 - 71 = 367.

**Step 5** Set up the equation to find the required score on the sixth test.

- Let \( x \) be the score needed on the sixth test.
- The average of the five highest scores should be 93.
- Equation: \(\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93\).

**Step 6** Solve the equation for \( x \).

- Multiply both sides by 5: \( 367 + x = 465 \).
- Subtract 367 from both sides: \( x = 465 - 367 \).
- Calculate \( x \): \( x = 98 \).

### 1. Determine the weight of one chocolate bar

- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

### 2. Calculate the total weight of all chocolate bars

- Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
- Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 chocolate bars × 40 grams/chocolate bar = 1000 grams.

### 3. Determine the weight of one candied apple

### 1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes

- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and Sara wants 2 pairs.
- Total cost of shoes = \(2 \times 20 = 40\).
- Total cost for jacket and shoes = \(30 + 40 = 70\).

### 2. Calculate Sara's earnings from babysitting

211,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given and solve for the number of red chickens. Let's break it down step by step.

### 1

Define variables for the number of chickens:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

### 2

Set up the equation for the total number of eggs produced per day:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so they produce \( 3r \) eggs in total.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs each, so they produce \( 5w \) eggs in total.
- The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, so the equation is:
  \[
  3r + 5w = 42
  \]

### 3

Use the information about the relationship between the number of chickens:
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so:
  \[
  w = r + 2
  \]

### 4

Substitute the expression for \( w \) from Step 3 into the equation from Step 2:
- Replace \( w \) in the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \) with \( r + 2 \):
  \[
  3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
  \]

### 5

Simplify and solve the equation:
- Distribute the 5:
  \[
  3r + 5r + 10 = 42
  \]
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  8r + 10 = 42
  \]
- Subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[
  8r = 32
  \]
- Divide by 8:
  \[
  r = 4
  \]

### 6

Verify the solution:
- If \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 6 \).
- Check the total number of eggs: \( 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \), which matches the given total.

### 1

First, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. We know from the problem statement that John has twice as many candies as Robert. We are also told that John has 54 candies.

### 2

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{(Robert's candies)} = 54 \]

To find the number of candies Robert has, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

### 3

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. The problem states that James has 6 more candies than Robert.

### 4

To find the number of candies James has, we add 6 to the number of candies Robert has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

### 5

Finally, we need to determine how many more candies John has than James. We know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies.

### 6

To find the difference, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Thus, John has \(\boxed{21}\) more candies than James.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

242,"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we can break down the problem into several steps:

### 1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike currently has.

- Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
- Therefore, the number of pen pals he currently has is \(5 - 2 = 3\).

### 2. Determine the number of letters Mike sends and receives each week.

- Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week.
- Since Mike has 3 pen pals, he receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters per week.
- Mike responds to each letter he receives, so he also sends 6 letters per week.

### 3. Calculate the total number of letters Mike writes each week.

- Mike writes 6 letters in response to the 6 letters he receives.

### 4. Determine the total number of pages Mike writes each week.

- Each letter is 5 pages long.
- Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes each week is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages.

### 5. Calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week.

- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, the time to write 30 pages is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

### 6. Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours.

- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the total time in hours is \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

- Determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood tree.
- Since the tree is 200 feet tall, divide the total height by the height of each section: \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.

### 2

- Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any wood is eaten by termites.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

### 3

- Determine the percentage of the tree that remains after the termites have eaten 30% of the wood.
- If termites ate 30%, then 70% of the tree remains: \( 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \).

- The time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the time it takes to heat from room temperature to 300 degrees.
- The initial heating time is 20 minutes.
- 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.4 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
- Therefore, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

**Step 2** Calculate the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

- The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees and the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees.
- This is \(20 + 28 = 48\) minutes.

**Step 3** Calculate the cooking time.

- The cooking time is 5 minutes less than the total time to heat the oil.
- The total heating time is 48 minutes.
- Therefore, the cooking time is \(48 - 5 = 43\) minutes.

**Step 4** Calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

- The total time is the sum of the total heating time and the cooking time.

1. **Define Variables**  
   - Let \( R \) represent Ruby's current age.  
   - Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age.

2. **Set Up the First Equation**  
   - According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.  
   - This gives us the equation:  
     \[ R = 6S \]

3. **Set Up the Second Equation**  
   - In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.  
   - In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).  
   - This gives us the equation:  
     \[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

4. **Substitute the First Equation into the Second**  
   - Substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:  
     \[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

5. **Simplify the Second Equation**  
   - Distribute the 3 on the right side:  
     \[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

6. **Solve for \( S \)**  
   - Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:  
     \[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]  
   - Subtract 9 from both sides:  
     \[ 3S = 18 \]  
   - Divide both sides by 3:  
     \[ S = 6 \]

7. **Verify the Solution**  
   - If \( S = 6 \), then \( R = 6 \times 6 = 36 \).  
   - In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \).  
   - Check if Ruby's age is 3 times Sam's age:  
     \[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]

### 1

Calculate the total number of team members and coaches:
- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Total team members and coaches = 12 + 3 = 15 people.

### 2

Calculate the total number of guests:
- Each team member brings 2 guests.
- Total guests = 12 team members × 2 guests per team member = 24 guests.

### 3

Calculate the total number of people attending the game:
- Total people = Total team members and coaches + Total guests = 15 + 24 = 39 people.

### 4

Determine how many pizzas are needed:
- Each pizza serves 3 people.
- Total pizzas needed = Total people ÷ People per pizza = 39 ÷ 3 = 13 pizzas.

### 5

Calculate the total cost of the pizzas:
- Each pizza costs $15.
- Total cost = Number of pizzas × Cost per pizza = 13 × $15 = $195.

Therefore, the total amount Maddy will spend on pizza is \boxed{195}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones in the necklace. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 gemstones per necklace, the total length occupied by the gemstones is:

\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

### 2

Determine the remaining length that needs to be filled with sterling silver beads. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones occupy 8 inches, so the remaining length is:

\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

### 3

Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed to fill the remaining length. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads required is:

\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

### 4

Verify the calculation by considering the total length of the necklace. The length occupied by the topaz gemstones and the sterling silver beads should add up to the total length of the necklace:

- Length of gemstones: 8 inches
- Length of beads: \( 68 \times \frac{1}{4} = 17 \text{ inches} \)

Total length: \( 8 \text{ inches} + 17 \text{ inches} = 25 \text{ inches} \)

The calculation is consistent with the total length of the necklace.

- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
- To find Joey's weekly weight loss, divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks: \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \).

**Step 2** Understand Sandy's weight loss rate relative to Joey's.

- Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week.
- Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

**Step 3** Calculate the total time Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds.

- Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, calculate how many 4-week periods are needed to lose 8 pounds.
- Divide the total weight Sandy needs to lose by the weight she loses in 4 weeks: \( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \text{ periods of 4 weeks} \).

### 1. Calculate the number of junior programmers

- The problem states that junior programmers make up \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
- The total number of employees is 100.
- Therefore, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

### 2. Calculate the number of senior programmers

- Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

### 3. Determine the monthly salary of junior programmers

- Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.

### 4. Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers

- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
- Therefore, each senior programmer is paid \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \) dollars per month.

### 5. Calculate the total monthly payment for junior programmers

- There are 40 junior programmers, each earning $2000 per month.
- The total payment for junior programmers is \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \) dollars.

### 6. Calculate the total monthly payment for senior programmers

- There are 60 senior programmers, each earning $2400 per month.
- The total payment for senior programmers is \( 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \) dollars.

### 7. Calculate the total monthly payment for all programmers

- The total payment for all programmers is the sum of the payments for junior and senior programmers.
- Therefore, the total payment is \( 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \) dollars.

Here are the steps:

### 1. Calculate earnings from the first job

- Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job.
- She works 20 hours at this job.
- Her earnings from the first job are calculated as follows:

359,"**Step 1** Determine the total amount Billy spends on gumballs.

- Each gumball costs $0.05.
- Billy buys 40 gumballs.
- Total cost for gumballs = 40 gumballs × $0.05/gumball = $2.

**Step 2** Calculate the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs.

- Billy spends half of his change on gumballs.
- Let \( x \) be the amount of change before buying gumballs.
- Half of \( x \) is spent on gumballs, so \( \frac{x}{2} = $2 \).
- Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = $4 \).

**Step 3** Calculate the total amount Billy spent on candy.

- Billy's total change before buying gumballs was $4.
- Therefore, the amount he spent on candy = Total money - Change before gumballs = $10 - $4 = $6.

**Step 4** Determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

- The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
- Total amount spent on candy = $6.
- Pounds of candy bought = Total amount spent on candy / Cost per pound = $6 / $1.5 per pound = 4 pounds.

Define the variables for the problem:

- Let \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- Let \( y \) be the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting.
- Let \( z \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
- Let \( w \) be the number of customers kicked out for other reasons.

### 2

Set up the equations based on the problem statement:

- From the problem, we know that \( y = 4x - 5 \).
- We also know that \( z = 3y \).
- The total number of people kicked out is 50, so \( x + y + z + w = 50 \).

### 3

Substitute the expressions for \( y \) and \( z \) into the total equation:

- Substitute \( y = 4x - 5 \) into \( z = 3y \) to get \( z = 3(4x - 5) = 12x - 15 \).
- Substitute \( y = 4x - 5 \) and \( z = 12x - 15 \) into the total equation:  
  \( x + (4x - 5) + (12x - 15) + w = 50 \).

### 4

Simplify and solve the equation for \( x \):

- Combine like terms:  
  \( x + 4x + 12x - 5 - 15 + w = 50 \)  
  \( 17x - 20 + w = 50 \).

- Solve for \( w \):  
  \( 17x + w = 70 \).

### 5

Determine the value of \( x \) and solve for \( w \):

- Since \( x \) must be a non-negative integer, test values for \( x \) that satisfy \( 17x + w = 70 \) and keep \( w \) non-negative.
- If \( x = 4 \), then:  
  \( 17(4) + w = 70 \)  
  \( 68 + w = 70 \)  
  \( w = 2 \).

### 6

Verify the solution:

- Calculate \( y \) and \( z \) using \( x = 4 \):
  - \( y = 4(4) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \).
  - \( z = 3(11) = 33 \).
- Check the total:  
  \( x + y + z + w = 4 + 11 + 33 + 2 = 50 \).

### 1. Calculate the number of shoes sold on Saturday

- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
- Therefore, the number of shoes sold on Saturday is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \).

### 2. Calculate the number of shoes sold on Sunday before returns

- On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday.
- Therefore, the number of shoes sold on Sunday before returns is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).

### 3. Calculate the number of shoes returned on Sunday

- Six people returned their pairs of shoes on Sunday because they didn't fit.
- Therefore, the number of shoes returned is 6.

### 4. Calculate the net number of shoes sold on Sunday

- The net number of shoes sold on Sunday is the number sold minus the number returned.
- Therefore, the net number of shoes sold on Sunday is \( 14 - 6 = 8 \).

### 5. Calculate the total number of shoes sold over the weekend

- Add the number of shoes sold on each day to find the total.
- Total shoes sold = (Friday's sales) + (Saturday's sales) + (Net Sunday's sales)
- Total shoes sold = \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \).

### 1. Determine the total amount needed

- Mark wants to buy a bike that costs $300.
- He currently has $50 in his bank account.
- Therefore, the additional amount he needs is $300 - $50.

### 2. Calculate the additional amount needed

- Subtract the current amount in Mark's bank account from the cost of the bike.
- $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (current savings) = $250.

### 3. Determine Mark's daily earnings

- Mark earns $10 per day at his work.

### 4. Calculate the number of days needed to save the additional amount

- To find out how many days Mark needs to work to save $250, divide the additional amount needed by his daily earnings.
- $250 ÷ $10 per day = 25 days.

### 5. Verify the calculation

- Multiply the number of days by the daily earnings to ensure it equals the additional amount needed.
- 25 days × $10 per day = $250.

### 6. Confirm the total savings after the calculated days

- After 25 days, Mark will have saved an additional $250.
- Adding this to his initial $50, he will have $300, which is the cost of the bike.

### 1

Nancy saw 90 spiders. This is the first piece of information we have, and it directly gives us the number of spiders.

### 2

Nancy saw \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders. Since there are 90 spiders, we calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

\[
\text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

### 3

The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We already calculated the number of millipedes to be 30, so we can find the number of stink bugs:

\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

### 4

Now, we sum up the number of each type of bug to find the total number of bugs Nancy counted:

- Spiders: 90
- Millipedes: 30
- Stink bugs: 48

\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.

### 2

Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.

### 3

Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

### 4

Joanne's total apple count is the sum of apples from the tallest, shortest, and average trees: \( 30 + 15 + x \).

### 5

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.

### 6

Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

### 7

Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees, so her total apple count is \( 60 + 45 = 105 \).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, the equation is:

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

### 1

Define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

### 2

Set up the first equation based on the number of heads:
- Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is the sum of camels and dromedaries.
- Therefore, the equation is:  
  \[
  c + d = 180
  \]

### 3

Set up the second equation based on the number of humps:
- Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.
- The total number of humps is given as 304.
- Therefore, the equation is:  
  \[
  2c + d = 304
  \]

### 4

Solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination:
- Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
  \[
  (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
  \]
  \[
  c = 124
  \]

### 5

Substitute the value of \( c \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):
- Using \( c + d = 180 \):
  \[
  124 + d = 180
  \]
  \[
  d = 56
  \]

### 6

Verify the solution by checking the total number of humps:
- Calculate the total humps using the found values:
  \[
  2c + d = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304

Next, calculate the total savings. Cole saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans.

### 3

Determine how much of the savings came from the jogger jeans. Since 1/3 of the total savings came from the jogger jeans, we calculate:

**Step 1**: Define the variables.

- Let \( x \) be the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny originally had.

**Step 2**: Determine the number of cards Kenny sells.

- Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells the remaining \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.

**Step 3**: Calculate the revenue from selling the cards.

- Each card is sold for $1.5, so the revenue from selling \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x \).

**Step 4**: Set up the equation based on the problem's conditions.

- Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and $50 for spending cash, totaling $150. Therefore, the revenue from selling the cards should equal $150:
  \[
  1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 150
  \]

**Step 5**: Simplify and solve the equation.

- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 150 \implies x = \frac{150}{1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}}
  \]

- Calculate the denominator:
  \[
  1.5 \times \frac{2}{3} = 1

- Substitute back into the equation:
  \[
  x = \frac{150}{1} = 150

**Step 6**: Verify the solution.

- If Kenny had 150 cards, he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \times 150 = 100 \) cards.
- Selling 100 cards at $1.5 each gives him $150, which matches the amount needed for the ticket and spending cash.

- Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is \(3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}\).

**Step 2** Use the area to find the width of the room.

- The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: \(\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}\).
- We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet.
- Therefore, the width can be calculated as \(\text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}\).

### 1

Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional loose eggs. Since a dozen equals 12, we calculate the total eggs from the dozens and add the loose eggs:

\[
4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[
48 \text{ eggs} + 2 \text{ eggs} = 50 \text{ eggs}
\]

### 2

Determine how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with the eggs she has. Each glass requires 5 eggs. Therefore, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

### 3

Calculate how many trays Rozanne can put out. Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. Therefore, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

### 4

Verify the calculations to ensure accuracy. Rozanne has 50 eggs, which allows her to make 10 glasses of eggnog. Since each tray holds 5 glasses, she can indeed put out 2 trays.

\[
10 \text{ glasses} \div 5 \text{ glasses/tray} = 2 \text{ trays}

### 1

Define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
- The number of cookies Matt can have is \(\frac{c}{2} + 2\).

### 2

Set up the equation based on the problem statement:
- Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.
- Therefore, the equation is \(\frac{c}{2} + 2 = 5\).

### 3

Solve the equation for \( c \):
- Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
  \[
  \frac{c}{2} = 5 - 2
  \]
  \[
  \frac{c}{2} = 3
  \]

### 4

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):
  \[
  c = 3 \times 2
  \]
  \[
  c = 6
  \]

### 5

Verify the solution:
- If Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, he can have \(\frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\) cookies.
- This matches the number of cookies Matt wants to eat.

Thus, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is \(\boxed{6}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

- We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers.
- We need to find the total number of students at that grade level.

**Step 2** Define the variables

- Let \( x \) be the total number of students at that grade level.
- According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of these students have a desktop computer.

**Step 3** Express the relationship

- If \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the students have a desktop computer, then \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the students do not have a desktop computer.
- We know that \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the students equals 20 students.

**Step 4** Set up the equation

- Since \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the students equals 20, we can write the equation: \(\frac{1}{4} \times x = 20\).

- Let's define the cost of the lot as \( x \).

### 2

- According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot. Therefore, the cost of the house is \( 3x \).

### 3

- The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:  
  \[
  x + 3x = 120,000

### 1

First, determine how long it takes for one person to paint a whole house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house.

- Time for one person to paint a whole house = 5 days * 2 = 10 days.

### 2

Next, calculate how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people are working together, they can complete the work 5 times faster than one person.

- Time for 5 people to paint a whole house = 10 days / 5 = 2 days.

### 3

Convert the number of days into hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, calculate the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint the house.

- Total hours = 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours.

### 4

Verify the calculation by considering the work rate. One person paints half a house in 5 days, so their rate is 1/10 of a house per day. Therefore, 5 people have a combined rate of 5/10 = 1/2 of a house per day.

- Time for 5 people to paint a whole house = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days.

### 5

Convert the verified days into hours again to ensure consistency.

- Total hours = 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours.

Thus, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \boxed{16}.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

### 1

- Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Therefore, the number of sofas Ophelia has is \( C_O - 2 \).

### 2

- We know Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- So, we can set up the equation: 
  \[
  C_O - 2 = 20
  \]

### 3

- Solve the equation for \( C_O \):
  \[
  C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
  \]
- Ophelia has 22 chairs.

### 4

- Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
- According to the problem, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
- Therefore, \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).

### 5

- Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Therefore, the number of sofas Jenna has is \( C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

### 6

- Now, calculate the total number of sofas:
  - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
  - Jenna has 64 sofas.
  - Total sofas = \( 20 + 64 = 84 \).

### 7

- Calculate the total number of chairs:
  - Ophelia has 22 chairs.
  - Jenna has 66 chairs.
  - Total chairs = \( 22 + 66 = 88 \).

### 8

- Finally, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
  - Total = Total sofas + Total chairs = \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

541,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis should save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half.

### 1. Determine the number of days in April

- April has 30 days.

### 2. Define the savings variables

- Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
- Therefore, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2x \) each day.

### 3. Calculate the total savings for each half of the month

- In the first half of April (15 days), Elvis saves a total of \( 15x \).
- In the second half of April (15 days), he saves a total of \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

### 4. Set up the equation for the total savings

- The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

### 5. Set the equation equal to the monthly target

- According to the problem, Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we have the equation:  
  \[
  45x = 1125
  \]

### 6. Solve for \( x \)

- Divide both sides of the equation by 45 to find \( x \):  
  \[
  x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
  \]

### 7. Calculate the daily savings for the second half

- Since Elvis saves twice as much daily in the second half, the amount he saves each day in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Thus, the amount Elvis has to save for each day in the second half of the month is \(\boxed{50}\).",0,False,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}

- Verna bought five oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 oranges × $0.80/orange = $4.00.

**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the peaches.

- Verna bought six peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 peaches × $0.75/peach = $4.50.

**Step 4** Calculate the total cost of all the fruits.

- Add the total costs of apples, oranges, and peaches.

Jeff's work is 3 miles away from his home. This means he walks 3 miles to get to work.

### 2

Since Jeff also walks back home, he covers another 3 miles on his return journey.

### 3

Each day Jeff works, he walks a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home. Therefore, he walks 3 + 3 = 6 miles per day.

### 4

Jeff works 5 times a week. To find out how many miles he walks in a week, we need to multiply the miles he walks per day by the number of days he works.

### 5

Multiply the daily walking distance by the number of workdays: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

### 1. Determine the actual temperature when set to 450

- Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

### 2. Calculate the percentage error

- The percentage error can be calculated using the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Percentage Error} = \left(\frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}}\right) \times 100
  \]
- Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \text{Percentage Error} = \left(\frac{468 - 450}{450}\right) \times 100
  \]

### 3. Simplify the percentage error calculation

- Calculate the difference: \(468 - 450 = 18\).
- Divide by the set temperature: \(\frac{18}{450}\).
- Convert to percentage: \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

### 4. Apply the percentage error to the new recipe temperature

- The recipe calls for 520 degrees. We need to find the set temperature \(x\) such that the actual temperature is 520 degrees.
- Since the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature is 104% of the set temperature.

### 5. Set up the equation for the new set temperature

- The equation is: 
  \[

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 90 \text{ contacts/box} = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

### 2

Next, calculate the total cost of 2 boxes before the discount. Each box costs $100.00, so:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$100.00/\text{box} = \$200.00 \]

### 3

Now, apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount on $200.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$200.00 = 0.10 \times \$200.00 = \$20.00 \]

### 4

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost after the discount:

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( s \) represent the number of sheep.
- Let \( g \) represent the number of geese.

### 2. Set Up Equations for Heads

- Each animal has one head.
- Therefore, the total number of heads is given by the equation:
  \[
  s + g = 20
  \]

### 3. Set Up Equations for Legs

- Sheep have 4 legs each, and geese have 2 legs each.
- Therefore, the total number of legs is given by the equation:
  \[
  4s + 2g = 70
  \]

### 4. Simplify the Legs Equation

- Divide the entire legs equation by 2 to simplify:
  \[
  2s + g = 35
  \]

### 5. Solve the System of Equations

- We now have two equations:
  1. \( s + g = 20 \)
  2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)

- Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( g \):
  \[
  (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
  \]
  \[
  s = 15
  \]

### 6. Verify the Solution

- Substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( g \):
  \[
  15 + g = 20
  \]
  \[
  g = 5
  \]

- Check the legs equation with these values:
  \[
  4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70

- Both equations are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

First, determine the total number of days Christina has recorded her mood. According to the problem, she has recorded her mood for thirty days.

### 2

Identify the number of good, bad, and neutral days from the information given:
- Good days: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: The rest of the days are neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\).

### 3

Understand the sequence of moods over the thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

### 4

Calculate the number of days left after the first 24 days (8 good, 8 bad, 8 neutral). Since 24 days have been accounted for, there are \(30 - 24 = 6\) days left in the month.

### 5

Consider the mood for the next three days as given in the problem:
- Day 25: Good
- Day 26: Neutral
- Day 27: Good

### 6

Add these three days to the previous count of good days. Initially, there were 8 good days in the first eight days. With the additional good days on Day 25 and Day 27, the total number of good days becomes \(8 + 2 = 10\).

### 7

Determine how many good days are left in the month after Day 27. Since there are 12 good days in total and 10 have already occurred by Day 27, there are \(12 - 10 = 2\) good days left in the month.

- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

**Step 2** Set up the equation for Katarina's cookies.

- We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).

**Step 3** Set up the equation for Max's cookies.

- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so \( K = M - 5 \).
- Substitute \( K = 68 \) into the equation: \( 68 = M - 5 \).

**Step 4** Solve for Max's cookies.

- Add 5 to both sides of the equation: \( M = 68 + 5 \).
- Therefore, \( M = 73 \).

**Step 5** Set up the equation for the Cookie Monster's cookies.

- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation: \( 73 = C + 12 \).

**Step 6** Solve for the Cookie Monster's cookies.

- Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: \( C = 73 - 12 \).
- Therefore, \( C = 61 \).

**Step 7** Set up the equation for Summer's cookies.

- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so \( S = M + 23 \).
- Substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation: \( S = 73 + 23 \).

**Step 8** Solve for Summer's cookies.

- Therefore, \( S = 96 \).

**Step 9** Calculate the total number of cookies.

- Add up all the cookies: \( K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \).

- Adam has collected 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
- Calculate 30% of Adam's points: \( 0.3 \times 50 = 15 \).
- Add this to Adam's points to find Betty's total: \( 50 + 15 = 65 \).

**Step 2** Determine Tom's points.

- Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
- Subtract 30 from Betty's points: \( 65 - 30 = 35 \).

**Step 3** Determine Martha's points.

- Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
- Multiply Tom's points by 3: \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \).

**Step 4** Calculate the total points collected by the class.

- Add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom.
- Total points: \( 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 \).

### 1. Calculate the total number of fireworks in the city's display.

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

### 2. Determine the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display.

- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- Fireworks Hannah can see from the city = 40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

### 3. Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard.

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks Hannah sets off = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

### 4. Add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city to the fireworks she sets off herself.

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = Fireworks from the city she can see + Fireworks she sets off.
- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 (from the city) + 15 (her own) = 135 fireworks.

726,"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is given in feet and inches, and we have a relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### 1

Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches only. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

- Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches.
- Convert 8 feet to inches: \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches.
- Add the additional 4 inches: \(96 + 4 = 100\) inches.

### 2

Set up the equation based on the relationship given in the problem. The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.

- Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
- According to the problem, the equation is: \( 9x + 10 = 100 \).

### 3

Solve the equation for \( x \).

- Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: \( 9x + 10 - 10 = 100 - 10 \).
- Simplify: \( 9x = 90 \).

### 4

Divide both sides by 9 to find \( x \).

- \( x = \frac{90}{9} \).
- Simplify: \( x = 10 \).

### 5

Verify the solution by checking if the calculated length of Bobby's shoe satisfies the original condition.

- Calculate 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe: \( 9 \times 10 = 90 \).
- Add 10 inches: \( 90 + 10 = 100 \).
- This matches the length of Topher's shoe, confirming our solution is correct.

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 2y \]

## 3. Total Votes Equation

The total number of council members is 33, which means the sum of votes in favor and against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + y = 33 \]

## 4. Substitute Relationship into Total Votes Equation

**Step 1** Determine the number of extra-small shirts needed.

- Krissa needs to order shirts for 11 students in size extra-small.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of small shirts needed.

- Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
- Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

**Step 3** Calculate the number of medium shirts needed.

- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
- Therefore, the number of medium shirts needed is \(22 - 4 = 18\).

**Step 4** Calculate the number of large shirts needed.

- Half as many students need size large as size medium.
- Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

**Step 5** Calculate the number of extra-large shirts needed.

- Six more students need size extra-large than large.
- Therefore, the number of extra-large shirts needed is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

**Step 6** Calculate the total number of shirts ordered.

- Add up all the shirts needed for each size: 
  - Extra-small: 11
  - Small: 22
  - Medium: 18
  - Large: 9
  - Extra-large: 15
- Total shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\).

### 1

Identify the fraction of Pomeranians that are girls. We are told that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.

### 2

Use the information that there are 6 Pomeranian girls to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{(Total Pomeranians)} = 6
\]

### 3

Solve the equation from Step 2 to find the total number of Pomeranians. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

### 4

Determine the fraction of all puppies that are Pomeranians. We are told that two thirds of all puppies are Pomeranians.

Set up the relationships between the variables based on the problem statement:

- The first house needs half of what the second house needs: \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \).
- The third house needs double what the first house needs: \( z = 2x \).

### 3

Express the total number of cases needed for all three houses. According to the problem, the total is 250 cases:

\[ x + y + z = 250 \]

Substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) from the relationships into the total equation:

- Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) into the equation: 
  \[ \frac{1}{2}y + y + z = 250 \]

- Substitute \( z = 2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2}y = y \) into the equation:
  \[ \frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250 \]

### 5

Simplify the equation:

- Combine like terms:
  \[ \frac{1}{2}y + y + y = \frac{1}{2}y + 2y = \frac{5}{2}y \]

- Set the equation equal to 250:

775,"To solve the problem of determining how many wheels will be left after assembling the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for both the cars and motorcycles and then subtract this from the total number of wheels Henry has. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

**Step 1** Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars.

- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Henry needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \).

**Step 2** Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles.

- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Henry needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \).

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of wheels needed for all the toys.

- Add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles.
- Total wheels needed = \( 228 + 146 = 374 \).

**Step 4** Determine how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys.

- Henry has a total of 650 wheels.
- Subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels Henry has.
- Wheels left = \( 650 - 374 = 276 \).

- Mike has a total of 600 movies.
- A third of these movies are in series.
- Number of series movies = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \).

**Step 2** Calculate the cost of replacing the series movies.

- The cost of a series movie is $6.
- Total cost for series movies = \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \).

**Step 3** Calculate the number of remaining movies.

- Total movies = 600.

- Remaining movies = \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).

**Step 4** Calculate the number of older movies.

- 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
- Number of older movies = \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \).

**Step 5** Calculate the cost of replacing the older movies.

- The cost of an older movie is $5.
- Total cost for older movies = \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \).

1. **Determine the hiking speed.**

   - The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed.
   - The driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - Half of the driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the hiking distance.**

   - The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Using the hiking speed of 20 miles per hour, the hiking distance is \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.

3. **Determine the total travel time.**

   - The total travel time (driving and hiking) is 6 hours.
   - Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the driving time is \( 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the driving distance.**

   - The driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - With a driving time of 4.5 hours, the driving distance is \( 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot.**

   - The total distance is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = 225 miles (driving) + 30 miles (hiking) = 255 miles.

780,"### 1. Define the scoring system

- Each enemy jumped on gives 10 points.
- Each berry collected gives 5 points.
- Each second left on the timer gives 30 points.

### 2. Define variables for Ava and Emma

- Let \( E_A \) and \( E_E \) be the number of enemies Ava and Emma jump on, respectively.
- Let \( B_A \) and \( B_E \) be the number of berries Ava and Emma collect, respectively.
- Let \( T_A \) and \( T_E \) be the seconds left on the timer for Ava and Emma, respectively.

### 3. Establish relationships between Ava and Emma's actions

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_A = E_E + 8 \).
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_A = B_E + 3 \).
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T_A = T_E - 4 \).

### 4. Write the score formulas for Ava and Emma

- Ava's score: \( S_A = 10E_A + 5B_A + 30T_A \).
- Emma's score: \( S_E = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E \).

### 5. Substitute the relationships into Ava's score formula

- Substitute \( E_A = E_E + 8 \), \( B_A = B_E + 3 \), and \( T_A = T_E - 4 \) into Ava's score formula:
  \[
  S_A = 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + 30(T_E - 4)
  \]

### 6. Simplify Ava's score formula

- Expand and simplify:
  \[
  S_A = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + 30T_E - 120
  \]
  \[
  S_A = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E + 80 + 15 - 120
  \]
  \[
  S_A = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E - 25
  \]

### 7. Calculate the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores

- The difference \( D \) is \( S_A - S_E \):
  \[
  D = (10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E - 25) - (10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E)
  \]
  \[
  D = -25
  \]

### 8. Interpret the result

- The negative difference indicates that Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score.

### 1. Determine the fraction of TVs that are not smart or analog.

- One-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the TVs sold are analog TVs.
- Therefore, the fraction of TVs that are either smart or analog is \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} \).

### 2. Calculate the combined fraction of smart and analog TVs.

- To add the fractions \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{8} \), find a common denominator, which is 8.
- Convert \( \frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{2}{8} \).
- Add \( \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \).

### 3. Determine the fraction of TVs that are OLED.

- Since \( \frac{3}{8} \) of the TVs are either smart or analog, the remaining fraction must be OLED TVs.
- Subtract \( \frac{3}{8} \) from 1 (the whole) to find the fraction of OLED TVs: \( 1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8} \).

### 4. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold.

- The total number of TVs sold is 40.
- Multiply the total number of TVs by the fraction that are OLED: \( 40 \times \frac{5}{8} \).

### 1

First, calculate the total number of groups formed. Since there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people, divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

### 2

Next, determine how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. Calculate this fraction of the total number of groups:

\[
\text{Groups that brought seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6

### 3

Now, calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each member of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 members, calculate the total number of seashells for one group and then multiply by the number of groups:

\[
\text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

### 4

Finally, multiply the number of seashells per group by the number of groups that brought back seashells to find the total number of seashells:

First, calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Add these numbers together:  
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals.

### 2

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying these goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

### 3

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation to represent this is:  
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.3 \]

### 4

Solve the equation for \( x \):

Multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \) to eliminate the fraction:  
\[ x = 0.3(14 + x) \]

Distribute the 0.3:  
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.3x \]

Subtract \( 0.3x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):  
\[ x - 0.3x = 4.2 \]

Combine like terms:  
\[ 0.7x = 4.2 \]

### 5

Divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for \( x \):  
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.7} \]

Calculate the division:  
\[ x = 6 \]

- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as salt, sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.

### 2. Establish Relationships

- The problem states that oil is twice as much as salt: \( o = 2s \).
- Salt is twice as much as zest: \( s = 2z \).

First, determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the first day. According to the problem, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

### 2

Next, calculate the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day. The problem states that she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, she walked \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours on the second day.

### 3

Now, add the hours Sandy walked on both days to find the total number of hours she walked. This is \( 8 \) hours (first day) + \( 4 \) hours (second day) = \( 12 \) hours in total.

### 4

Convert the total walking time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, multiply the total hours by 60. Thus, \( 12 \) hours \(\times 60\) minutes/hour = \( 720 \) minutes.

Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has. 

### 2

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, we can express Smendrick's cards as \( 3P \).

### 3

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. Therefore, Becca's cards can be expressed as \( 3P + 12 \).

### 4

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341
\]

### 5

Simplify the equation:

\[
P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341
\]

\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

### 6

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( P \):

\[
7P = 329

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

### 1. Calculate the refund amount

- Milly will receive a refund of 75% of the book's purchase price.
- The book cost $32, so the refund is \( 0.75 \times 32 = 24 \).

### 2. Calculate the shipping cost per pound

- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- The book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost is \( 0.35 \times 4 = 1.4 \).

### 3. Calculate the shipping cost per mile

- The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost is \( 0.08 \times 20 = 1.6 \).

### 4. Calculate the total shipping cost

- Add the cost per pound and the cost per mile to get the total shipping cost.
- Total shipping cost is \( 1.4 + 1.6 = 3 \).

### 5. Calculate the total loss

- Milly's total loss is the original cost of the book minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.
- Total loss is \( 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \).

   - We have 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, taking 18 hours to cross a highway.
   - We need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same highway.

2. **Determine the Speed of One Kangaroo**  
   - Since the kangaroos travel together and take 18 hours, the time taken is independent of the number of kangaroos. 
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is the same as the speed of the group.

3. **Calculate the Speed of One Turtle**  
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
   - Therefore, the speed of one turtle is half the speed of one kangaroo.

4. **Relate Time and Speed**  
   - The time taken to travel a certain distance is inversely proportional to the speed when the distance is constant.
   - If a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance.

5. **Calculate the Time for One Turtle**  
   - Since a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take 2 times the time taken by a kangaroo to cross the highway.
   - Therefore, one turtle will take 18 hours * 2 = 36 hours to cross the highway.

6. **Consider the Number of Turtles**  
   - The number of turtles does not affect the time taken for one turtle to cross the highway, as they are traveling independently at the same speed.
   - Therefore, 4 turtles will also take 36 hours to cross the highway, just like one turtle.

Calculate the total time allocated for each group to perform, including getting on stage and exiting.

- Each group has 2 minutes to get on stage.
- Each group performs for 6 minutes.
- Each group has 2 minutes to exit the stage.

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

### 2

Determine the total duration of the concert.

- The concert is scheduled to last for 2 hours.

Convert the concert duration from hours to minutes:

2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes.

### 3

Account for the intermission time in the concert schedule.

- There is a 10-minute intermission during the concert.

Subtract the intermission time from the total concert duration:

120 minutes (total concert time) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes available for performances.

### 4

Calculate the number of groups that can perform within the available time.

- Each group requires 10 minutes to complete their performance cycle.

Divide the available performance time by the time required per group:

110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

### 5

Verify the calculation to ensure accuracy.

- Total time for 11 groups: 11 groups × 10 minutes per group = 110 minutes.
- Add the intermission time: 110 minutes + 10 minutes = 120 minutes, which matches the total concert duration.

847,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, given that she invested $300 at a simple interest rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

Here are the steps to find the solution:

### 1. Determine the Simple Interest Rate

- The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.
- Therefore, the interest rate per year is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 \).

### 2. Calculate the Annual Interest

- Calculate the annual interest by multiplying the original amount by the interest rate.
- Annual interest = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \).

### 3. Calculate the Total Interest for 3 Years

- Since the interest is simple, it remains the same each year.
- Total interest over 3 years = Annual interest \(\times\) Number of years.
- Total interest = \( 225 \times 3 = 675 \).

### 4. Calculate the Total Amount After 3 Years

- The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the original investment and the total interest earned.
- Total amount = Original investment + Total interest.
- Total amount = \( 300 + 675 \).

### 5. Final Calculation

- Add the original investment to the total interest to find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years.
- Total amount = \( 300 + 675 = 975 \).

**Step 1**: Understand the relationship between gold and silver coins.

- We are told that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

**Step 2**: Define the variables.

- Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
- Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins \( G \) can be expressed as \( G = S + 30 \).

**Step 3**: Use the given information about the number of gold coins.

- We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \( G = 70 \).

**Step 4**: Substitute the known value into the equation.

- Substitute \( G = 70 \) into the equation \( G = S + 30 \) to find the number of silver coins: 
  \[
  70 = S + 30
  \]

**Step 5**: Solve for the number of silver coins.

- Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to solve for \( S \):

**Step 6**: Calculate the total number of coins.

- The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins:
  \[
  \text{Total coins} = G + S = 70 + 40

**Step 7**: Compute the final result.

- Add the number of gold and silver coins to find the total:

### 1. Determine the weight of the sweet potatoes

- Daisy bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes.
- The potatoes weighed 5 pounds.
- Therefore, the weight of the sweet potatoes is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
  \]

### 2. Calculate the weight of the carrots

- The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes.
- We already calculated that the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds.
- Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:
  \[
  \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}

868,"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups required, the number of boxes needed, and then the total cost. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

### 1. Calculate Total Jello Cups Needed

- Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups.
- Therefore, the total number of jello cups needed is calculated as follows:

  \[
  30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups}
  \]

### 2. Determine Number of Boxes Required

- A single three-ounce box of jello makes 10 small jello cups.
- To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of cups one box makes:

  \[
  \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
  \]

### 3. Calculate Total Cost

- Each box of jello is on sale for $1.25.
- To find the total cost, multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:

  \[
  12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00
  \]

- Calculate 60% of $400: \( 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \).

**Step 3** Calculate Keenan's share of the grocery cost.

- Since Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
- Subtract Madeline's share from the total: \( 400 - 240 = 160 \).

**Step 4** Determine the number of weeks in the month.

- The problem states it is a four-week month.

### 1. Define the variables

- Let \( x \) be the duration of Elaina's usual concerts in minutes.

### 2. Express the final concert's duration

- The final concert is twice as long as a usual concert, plus an additional 15-minute encore. Therefore, the duration of the final concert can be expressed as \( 2x + 15 \).

### 3. Set up the equation

- We know from the problem statement that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2x + 15 = 65
  \]

### 4. Solve for \( x \)

- Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

- Simplify the right side:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Let the number of notebooks Martha initially had be \( x \).
   - Therefore, Joseph initially had \( 3x \) notebooks because he had 3 times as many as Martha.

2. **Martha's New Total**
   - Martha bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7.
   - Therefore, the equation for Martha's notebooks is: 
     \[
     x + 5 = 7
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**
   - Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 7 - 5 = 2
     \]
   - Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

4. **Joseph's Initial Count**
   - Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha initially:
     \[
     3x = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - Joseph initially had 6 notebooks.

5. **Comparison of Current Totals**
   - Martha now has 7 notebooks.
   - Joseph still has 6 notebooks.

6. **Calculate the Difference**
   - The difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph is:
     \[
     7 - 6 = 1
     \]

7. **Conclusion**
   - Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

### 1. Determine the distance Dijana rowed.

- Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

### 2. Calculate the additional distance Anis rowed compared to Dijana.

- Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.
- To find the additional distance, calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \).

### 3. Perform the calculation for Anis's additional distance.

- \( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \) miles.

### 4. Calculate the total distance Anis rowed.

- Anis rowed 50 miles (same as Dijana) plus the additional 10 miles.
- Total distance Anis rowed = \( 50 + 10 = 60 \) miles.

### 5. Calculate the combined total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis.

- Add the distance Dijana rowed to the distance Anis rowed.
- Total distance = \( 50 + 60 \).

949,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Leo's age based on the given information about Marcus and Deanna. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Determine Deanna's Age

- We are given that Deanna is 26 years old.

### 2. Determine Marcus's Age

- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
- Therefore, Marcus's age is calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21
  \]

### 3. Relate Marcus's Age to Leo's Age

- We are told that Marcus is half of Leo’s age.
- Therefore, we can express Leo's age in terms of Marcus's age:  
  \[
  \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
  \]

### 4. Solve for Leo's Age

- Using the relationship from step 3, we substitute Marcus's age:  
  \[
  21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
  \]
- To find Leo's age, multiply both sides by 2:  
  \[
  \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42

- Courtney reported that the audience was 48 people.
- Kelly claims that Courtney overstated the number by 20%.

## 2. Calculating the Overstatement

- An overstatement of 20% means that the reported number is 20% more than the actual number.
- To find the overstatement amount, calculate 20% of the actual number of attendees.

## 3. Setting Up the Equation

- Let the actual number of attendees be \( x \).
- The reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number.
- This can be expressed as: \( 1.2x = 48 \).

## 4. Solving for the Actual Number

- To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

### 1

Convert the width of each flower from inches to feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a flower that is 12 inches wide is equivalent to 1 foot wide.

### 2

Calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between plants. Each plant is 1 foot wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Therefore, each plant requires \(1 + 1.5 = 2.5\) feet of space.

### 3

Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant: \(\frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4\). Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

### 4

Calculate how many more plants Pat needs to buy. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy \(44 - 17 = 27\) additional plants.

### 5

### 1. Determine the number of easy questions

- The quiz has a total of 60 questions.
- 40% of these questions are easy.

\[
\text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
\]

### 2. Determine the number of average and difficult questions

- The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions.
- Since 40% are easy, 60% are either average or difficult.

\[
\text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 0.60 \times 60 = 36
\]

### 3. Divide the average and difficult questions equally

- The 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult.

\[
\text{Number of average questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
\]

\[
\text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
\]

### 4. Calculate the number of easy questions Aries is sure to get correct

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.

\[
\text{Easy questions correct} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18

### 6. Calculate the number of difficult questions Aries is sure to get correct

- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.

\[
\text{Difficult questions correct} = 0.50 \times 18 = 9

1042,"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Calculate the amount won in the second race

- Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race.
- He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
- Twice the amount lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
- Therefore, the amount won in the second race is \(10 + 1 = 11\).

### 2. Calculate the amount lost in the third race

- Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
- The amount won in the second race is $11.
- Therefore, the amount lost in the third race is \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

### 3. Calculate the total amount lost

- The total amount lost is the sum of the losses from the first and third races.
- Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).

### 4. Calculate the average loss

- There were three races in total.
- The average loss is the total loss divided by the number of races.
- Average loss = \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\).

- According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person.
- Therefore, the share of the second person can be expressed as \( x + 80 \).

### 3

- The third person took twice what the second person took.
- Thus, the share of the third person is \( 2(x + 80) \).

### 4

- The total amount shared among the three people is $1920.
- Therefore, the equation representing the total amount is:
  \[
  x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
  \]

### 5

- Simplify the equation:

1046,"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters. Here's how we can do it step by step:

### 1. Calculate the total number of days worked.

- The team worked for 3 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of days worked is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

### 2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.

- The team worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

### 3. Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over the entire period.

- Multiply the fraction of a day worked each day by the total number of days: 
  \[
  \frac{3}{8} \times 21 = \frac{63}{8}
  \]
  This is the total fraction of a day worked by the team over the entire period.

### 4. Convert the total fraction of a day into hours.

- There are 24 hours in a day.
- Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
  \[
  \frac{63}{8} \times 24 = 189 \text{ hours}
  \]

### 5. Calculate the total hours worked by each painter.

- There are 4 painters in the team.
- Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
  \[
  \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

### 2. Express the First Set in Terms of the Second Set

- According to the problem, Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).

### 3. Express the Third Set in Terms of the Second Set

- The problem states that Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

### 4. Set Up the Equation for Total Balls Retrieved

- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, the equation is:
  \[
  (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
  \]

### 5. Simplify the Equation

- Combine like terms:
  \[
  2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
  \]

### 6. Eliminate the Fraction

- Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  4x + 8 + x = 38
  \]

### 7. Combine and Solve for \( x \)

- Combine the terms:
  \[
  5x + 8 = 38
  \]

- Subtract 8 from both sides:
  \[
  5x = 30
  \]

- Divide by 5:
  \[
  x = 6
  \]

### 8. Calculate the Number of Balls in the First Set

- Since \( x = 6 \), the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \).

1067,"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage for sending out the coupons, we need to calculate the total cost for both the small and big coupons. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. Determine the number of big coupons

- Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons.
- Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is \( 2 \times 700 = 1400 \).

### 2. Calculate the cost of mailing small coupons

- Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.
- The total cost for mailing 700 small coupons is \( 700 \times 5 = 3500 \) cents.

### 3. Calculate the cost of mailing big coupons

- Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.
- The total cost for mailing 1400 big coupons is \( 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \) cents.

### 4. Calculate the total postage cost

- Add the total cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons.
- The total postage cost is \( 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \) cents.

### 5. Convert the total cost to dollars (optional)

- Since the problem asks for the total cost in cents, we can leave it as is.
- However, if needed, the total cost in dollars is \( 24500 \div 100 = 245 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is \(\boxed{24500}\).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}

First, determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

### 2

Calculate the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

So, there are 28 meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches.

### 3

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Calculate how many sub sandwiches Sidney has left after Mark ate 4 of them.

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

So, Sidney has 3 sub sandwiches left after Mark ate 4.

### 4

Calculate the number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches.

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 meatballs in the 3 remaining sub sandwiches.

### 5

Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. Calculate the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now.

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

So, Sidney now has 6 sub sandwiches.

### 6

Calculate the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches.

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches.

Start by determining the total number of trucks that Mr. Hezekiah dispatched for delivery. According to the problem, he dispatched 20 trucks.

### 2

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, calculate the total amount of fertiliser initially dispatched by multiplying the number of trucks by the amount each truck carried:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

### 3

Next, identify the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. Calculate this by dividing the total number of trucks by 4:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ trucks}}{4} = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

### 4

Subtract the number of trucks that had mechanical failures from the total number of trucks to find out how many trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} - 5 \text{ trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

### 5

Finally, calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers by multiplying the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser by the amount each truck carried:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

- The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

### 3. Velociraptors Scavenging

- The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

### 4. Remaining Meat

- After the velociraptors ate, the remaining meat is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \).

- The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
- The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour (since half of 60 is 30).

**Step 2**: Determine the time duration for which the trains are traveling.

- Both trains are traveling for 3 hours.

**Step 3**: Calculate the distance traveled by each train.

- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.

- Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = $20,000.

**Step 2** Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs during retirement.

- Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary during retirement.
- Annual retirement need = 40% of $100,000 = $40,000.

**Step 3** Calculate the total amount Lauren needs for retirement.

- Lauren plans to retire for 20 years.
- Total retirement savings needed = 20 years × $40,000/year = $800,000.

**Step 4** Determine how many years Lauren needs to save to reach her retirement goal.

- Let \( x \) be the number of years Lauren needs to work.
- Total savings after \( x \) years = $20,000/year × \( x \) years.
- Set this equal to the total retirement savings needed: $20,000 × \( x \) = $800,000.

**Step 5** Solve for \( x \).

- Divide both sides by $20,000:

**Step 6** Calculate how many more years Lauren needs to work.

- If Lauren has already been working and saving, subtract the number of years she has already saved from 40 to find how many more years she needs to work.
- Since the problem does not specify how many years she has already saved, assume she is starting now.
- Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to reach her retirement goal.

Each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

### 3

Now, take one of the 25-centimeter parts and divide it into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, divide 25 centimeters by 5:

### 1. Calculate the initial number of male fishes

- Tate initially has 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes.
- Total initial male fishes = 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = 7 male fishes.

### 2. Calculate the initial number of female fishes

- Tate initially has 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes.
- Total initial female fishes = 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12 female fishes.

### 3. Calculate the number of male fishes after purchase

- Tate buys 2 more male guppies and 2 more male goldfishes.
- Additional male fishes = 2 (male guppies) + 2 (male goldfishes) = 4 male fishes.
- Total male fishes after purchase = 7 (initial) + 4 (additional) = 11 male fishes.

### 4. Calculate the number of female fishes after purchase

- Tate buys 1 more female guppy and 3 more female goldfishes.
- Additional female fishes = 1 (female guppy) + 3 (female goldfishes) = 4 female fishes.
- Total female fishes after purchase = 12 (initial) + 4 (additional) = 16 female fishes.

### 5. Calculate the difference between the number of female and male fishes

### 1. Determine Sofie's total walking distance

- Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}\).

### 2. Establish the relationship between Sofie's and Brian's walking distances

- According to the problem, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
- Therefore, if Brian walks \(x\) miles, Sofie will walk \(2x\) miles.

### 3. Set up the equation based on the relationship

- From step 1, we know Sofie will walk 70 miles.
- Set up the equation: \(2x = 70\).

### 4. Solve the equation for Brian's walking distance

- Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \(x\): 
  \[
  x = \frac{70}{2} = 35
  \]

### 5. Verify the solution

- If Brian walks 35 miles, then Sofie, walking twice as far, would indeed walk \(2 \times 35 = 70\) miles, which matches the given information.

- The order is for 400 toys.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of toys produced by the first two workers.

- Each of the first two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours, so each produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

**Step 3** Calculate the number of toys produced by the next two workers.

- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours, so each produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of toys produced by the four workers.

- The first two workers produce 120 toys, and the next two produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

**Step 5** Determine the number of toys still needed after the shift.

- By the end of the shift, 20 more toys are needed to complete the order.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

**Step 6** Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker.

- The total number of toys produced by the four workers is 200.
- The fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

**Step 7** Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

**Step 2** Set up equations based on the problem statement.

- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = M \).
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so \( C + S = 30 \).
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

**Step 3** Solve for the number of eggs Sarah painted.

Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.  
Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.  
Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.

### 2. Establish Relationships

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:  
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( r = 4b \).  
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( b = y - 7 \).

### 3. Set Up the Equation for Total Length

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:  
\[ b + y + r = 37 \]

### 4. Substitute Known Relationships

Substitute \( r = 4b \) and \( b = y - 7 \) into the total length equation:  
\[ (y - 7) + y + 4(y - 7) = 37 \]

### 5. Simplify the Equation

Simplify the equation:  
\[ y - 7 + y + 4y - 28 = 37 \]  
Combine like terms:  
\[ 6y - 35 = 37 \]

### 6. Solve for \( y \)

Add 35 to both sides:  
\[ 6y = 72 \]  
Divide by 6:  
\[ y = 12 \]

### 7. Find the Length of the Blue Rope

Substitute \( y = 12 \) back into the equation \( b = y - 7 \):  
\[ b = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

### 8. Calculate the Length of the Red Rope

Use the relationship \( r = 4b \) to find the length of the red rope:  
\[ r = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

1170,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### 1

First, understand the total amount of paint used in the mural. According to the problem, the mural used 12 pints of paint in total.

### 2

Next, note that half of the mural is yellow. This means that the yellow paint accounts for half of the total paint used. Therefore, calculate the amount of yellow paint:

\[
\text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

### 3

Now, determine the amount of paint used for the other colors: red, white, and purple. Since yellow paint accounts for 6 pints, the remaining paint for red, white, and purple is:

\[
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

### 4

According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, divide the remaining 6 pints equally among the three colors:

\[
\text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
\]

### 5

Finally, verify the solution by checking the total paint used. The amounts are 6 pints of yellow and 2 pints each of red, white, and purple, which sums up to:

\[
6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 \text{ pints}
\]

This confirms that the calculations are correct.

So, Thomas initially has 50 $20 bills.

### 2

Thomas loses 10 bills on his way home. Subtract the lost bills from the initial number of bills:

- The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
- On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk.
- Calculate the length of chalk used: \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.

**Step 2** Determine the remaining length of chalk after Monday.

- Subtract the length of chalk used from the initial length: \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.
- The teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk remaining.

**Step 3** Calculate the daily usage of chalk for the following days.

- The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
- Calculate the daily usage: \( 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \) inch per day.

**Step 4** Determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches.

- The teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk remaining.
- He will recycle the chalk when it is less than 2 inches.
- Calculate the length of chalk that can be used before recycling: \( 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 \) inches.

**Step 5** Calculate the number of days the teacher can use the remaining chalk.

- The teacher uses 1 inch per day.
- Determine how many full days he can use the chalk before it is less than 2 inches: \( \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \) days.
- Since he cannot use a fraction of a day, he can use the chalk for 0 full days before it is less than 2 inches.

**Step 6** Consider the possibility of using the chalk for one more day.

- If the teacher uses the chalk for one more day, he will use 1 inch, leaving him with \( 2.75 - 1 = 1.75 \) inches.
- Since 1.75 inches is less than 2 inches, he cannot use the chalk for one more full day without recycling.

1189,"To solve the problem of how many slices of apple Doxa and her siblings ate, we can break it down into the following steps:

### 1. Identify the number of slices Doxa ate.

- Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.

### 2. Determine the number of slices her sister ate.

- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa.
- Therefore, her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

### 3. Calculate the number of slices her brother ate.

- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister.
- Therefore, her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

### 4. Sum the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother.

- Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices.
- The total number of slices eaten is \(1 + 2 + 3\).

1190,"**Step 1** Determine the number of bandages used on the second day.

- On the first day, 38 bandages were used.
- On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day.
- Therefore, the number of bandages used on the second day is \(38 - 10 = 28\).

**Step 2** Calculate the number of bandages used on the third day.

- On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages.
- Since each pack contains 50 bandages, half a pack is \(50 \div 2 = 25\) bandages.

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days.

- Total bandages used = bandages used on the first day + bandages used on the second day + bandages used on the third day.
- Total bandages used = \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\).

**Step 4** Determine the total number of bandages ordered.

- On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- Total bandages ordered = \(50 + 100 = 150\).

**Step 5** Calculate the initial number of bandages.

- Let \(x\) be the initial number of bandages.
- The equation based on the problem is: initial bandages + bandages ordered - bandages used = bandages left.
- Therefore, \(x + 150 - 91 = 78\).

**Step 6** Solve for the initial number of bandages.

- Simplify the equation: \(x + 59 = 78\).
- Subtract 59 from both sides: \(x = 78 - 59\).
- Therefore, \(x = 19\).

**Step 1**: Determine the number of red pen packs.

- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.

**Step 2**: Calculate the total number of red pens.

- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}\).

**Step 3**: Determine the number of black pen packs.

Start by defining a variable to represent the unknown quantity. Let \( x \) be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

### 2

Translate the problem statement into an algebraic equation. The phrase ""four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be expressed as \( 4x \).

### 3

The phrase ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" translates to \( 4x + 8 \).

### 4

According to the problem, this expression is equal to 40. Therefore, set up the equation: 

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

### 5

Solve the equation for \( x \). Start by subtracting 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]

\[ 4x = 32 \]

### 6

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

### 7

Verify the solution by substituting \( x = 8 \) back into the original expression \( 4x + 8 \) to ensure it equals 40:

\[ 4(8) + 8 = 32 + 8 = 40 \]

The equation holds true, confirming the solution is correct.

### 1. Calculate the number of visits per year

- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

### 2. Determine the total number of years

- Pauline visits the museum for a total of 8 years.

### 3. Calculate the total number of visits

- Total visits = 3 visits/year * 8 years = 24 visits.

### 4. Determine the cost per visit for the first 5 years

- The cost per visit for the first 5 years is $2.

### 5. Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years

- Total visits in the first 5 years = 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits.
- Total cost for the first 5 years = 15 visits * $2/visit = $30.

### 6. Calculate the cost increase after 5 years

- The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years.
- New cost per visit = $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

### 7. Calculate the total cost for the remaining 3 years

- Total visits in the remaining 3 years = 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits.
- Total cost for the remaining 3 years = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45.

### 8. Calculate the total amount spent over 8 years

- Total amount spent = Total cost for the first 5 years + Total cost for the remaining 3 years = $30 + $45 = $75.

**Step 1** Define the variables.

- Let \( x \) be the length of the shorter piece in feet.
- Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, the longer piece will be \( 4x \) feet long.

**Step 2** Set up the equation.

- The total length of the board is 40 feet. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must equal 40 feet.
- This gives us the equation: 
  \[
  x + 4x = 40
  \]

**Step 3** Simplify the equation.

- Combine like terms in the equation:
  \[
  5x = 40
  \]

**Step 4** Solve for \( x \).

- Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
  \]

**Step 5** Determine the length of the longer piece.

- Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, calculate the length of the longer piece:
  \[
  4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
  \]

**Step 6** Verify the solution.

- Check that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces equals the original board length:
  - Shorter piece: 8 feet
  - Longer piece: 32 feet
  - Total: \( 8 + 32 = 40 \) feet, which matches the original board length.

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

### 2. Set Up Equations

- We know the total number of animals is 20:  
  \[
  c + w = 20
  \]

- We know the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs:  
  \[
  2c + 4w = 70
  \]

### 3. Simplify the Second Equation

- Simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:  
  \[
  c + 2w = 35
  \]

### 4. Solve the System of Equations

- We now have the system of equations:  
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  c + w &= 20 \\
  c + 2w &= 35
  \end{align*}
  \]

- Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):  
  \[
  (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
  \]

- Simplify the result:  
  \[
  w = 15
  \]

### 5. Find the Number of Chickens

- Substitute \( w = 15 \) back into the first equation:  
  \[
  c + 15 = 20
  \]

- Solve for \( c \):  
  \[
  c = 5
  \]

### 6. Verify the Solution

- Check the total number of legs:  
  \[
  2c + 4w = 2(5) + 4(15) = 10 + 60 = 70
  \]

- The solution satisfies both the total number of animals and the total number of legs.
