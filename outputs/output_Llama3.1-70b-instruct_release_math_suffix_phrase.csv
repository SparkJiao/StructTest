First, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day: 16 eggs.

Next, we subtract the eggs Janet eats for breakfast (3 eggs) and the eggs she uses for baking muffins (4 eggs): 
16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she sells (9 eggs) by the price per egg ($2):

2,"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and then subtract the total cost from it.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = Cost of the house + Cost of repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, let's calculate the selling price of the house. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

Original value = $80,000
New value = 250% of $80,000
New value = 2.5 * $80,000
New value = $200,000

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. To find the selling price, we need to add the cost of repairs to this value.

Selling price = New value + Cost of repairs
Selling price = $200,000 + $50,000 (this is incorrect as the $50,000 is already included in the 150% increase)
Selling price = $200,000 

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Selling price - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

James runs 3 sprints in a day, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total meters he runs in a day is:
3 sprints/day * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/day

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed required per day is:
3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups

Now, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi has already given to her chickens in the morning and afternoon meals:
Morning meal: 15 cups
Afternoon meal: 25 cups
Total feed given so far: 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total amount of feed required per day:
60 cups (total required) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to get the number of pairs of glasses, which is 8.

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

First, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the 2 hours of standstill traffic. Since he wasn't moving, the distance is 0 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the half-hour (0.5 hours) of driving at 30 mph. We can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, at a speed of 80 mph. We can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The total distance John traveled during the 4 hours is the sum of the distances traveled during each segment:

Total Distance = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles
Total Distance = 135 miles

However, we need to find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours. Since he initially drove 3 hours at 60 mph, he was 3 x 60 = 180 miles away from home. Then, he turned around and drove 135 miles towards home. So, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:

The total cost consists of the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) and the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year).

The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons, which is the number of lemons grown per year (7) multiplied by the selling price per lemon ($1.5).

Let's calculate the total revenue and total cost for each year:

Year 1:
Total revenue = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.50
Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93
Since the total cost is greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 2:
Total revenue = $10.50 (previous year) + $10.50 (current year) = $21
Total cost = $93 (previous year) + $3 (current year) = $96
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 3:
Total revenue = $21 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $31.50
Total cost = $96 (previous years) + $3 (current year) = $99
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 4:
Total revenue = $31.50 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $42
Total cost = $99 (previous years) + $3 (current year) = $102
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 5:
Total revenue = $42 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $52.50
Total cost = $102 (previous years) + $3 (current year) = $105
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 6:
Total revenue = $52.50 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $63
Total cost = $105 (previous years) + $3 (current year) = $108
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 7:
Total revenue = $63 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $73.50
Total cost = $108 (previous years) + $3 (current year) = $111
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Total revenue = $73.50 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $84
Total cost = $111 (previous years) + $3 (current year) = $114
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 9:
Total revenue = $84 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $94.50
Total cost = $114 (previous years) + $3 (current year) = $117
Since the total cost is still greater than the total revenue, Carlos is not earning money yet.

Year 10:
Total revenue = $94.50 (previous years) + $10.50 (current year) = $105

2. She sold 2 more to the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. To find out how many vacuum cleaners were left after the green and red houses, we subtract the number of vacuum cleaners sold at those houses from the initial number: x - x/3 - 2.

The first friend's guess is 80.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40. 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Since the total number of coins is the sum of the number of silver coins and the number of gold coins, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 x 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

First, let's calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we can calculate the cost per yogurt as follows:
Cost per yogurt = $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, we can multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt to find the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days:

37,"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling his Lego sets and then determine how much he spent on video games.

John has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each, so he made a total of 13 x $15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent a total of 8 x $20 = $160.

Since he has $5 left, we can calculate that he spent a total of $195 - $5 = $190 on video games and other expenses.

However, we already know that he spent $160 on video games, so the remaining amount must have been spent on other expenses or he didn't sell all his lego sets.

Since he spent $190 in total and $160 on video games, he must have spent $190 - $160 = $30 on other expenses or he didn't sell 2 lego sets.

Since each lego set is $15, $30 is equal to 2 lego sets.

Therefore, John still has 2 lego sets.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) on the other two days. So, the total time he spends running is:

3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

Now, let's calculate his average speed. We know that John runs 60 miles a week. To find his average speed, we can divide the total distance by the total time:

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2.

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends:

Time running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Distance running = Running speed * Time running
Distance running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance running = 12 miles

Distance walking = Walking speed * Time walking
Distance walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance walking = 6 miles

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

Now, we subtract the dragon's reach (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin (1200 feet) to find out how far outside of the reach she can stand:

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. To find out how many calories you have left, we subtract the calories you have already consumed from your daily target:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories. To do this, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since the bag has 5 servings and weighs 300g, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving. To do this, we divide the weight of the bag by the number of servings:

First, let's calculate the number of blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties

Now, let's calculate the cost of each red tie. We know the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. 

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid the initial amount of $140 per month. So, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
6 months * $140/month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To calculate the new monthly charge, we need to calculate 10% of the initial monthly charge and subtract it from the initial monthly charge:
10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
New monthly charge = $140 - $14 = $126

So, the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
6 months * $126/month = $756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

64,"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank.

Total miles per tank = mpg * Total gallons in tank
Total miles per tank = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total miles per tank = 300 miles

   - Total time spent per session: 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours

2. Calculate the total time spent per week:
   - Jim does this 3 times a week
   - Total time spent per week: 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players per school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has 2 coaches (1 for each team). 

So, the total number of people per school is 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools competing, we multiply the total number of people per school by the number of schools: 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people.

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds:
   Rubies = Diamonds - 35
   Rubies = 175 - 35
   Rubies = 140
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we multiply the number of rubies by 2:
   Emeralds = 2 * Rubies
   Emeralds = 2 * 140
   Emeralds = 280

Now, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems:

Total students = 120 (boys) + 60 (girls) = 180.

We are also given that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:

Level 4 (top): 16
Level 3: 2 * 16 = 32
Level 2: 2 * 32 = 64
Level 1 (bottom): 2 * 64 = 128

Now, we can find the total square footage of all levels by adding up the square footage of each level:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240

Since there are 4 levels, we can find the average square footage of a level by dividing the total square footage by 4:

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.833 per flower, the better price is the package of 2 flowers for $1.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the worse price (package of 3 flowers for $2.50), the cost would be:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
$15 - $9 = $6

Expected attendees = Total invited friends - (1/4 * Total invited friends)
Expected attendees = 16 - (1/4 * 16)
Expected attendees = 16 - 4
Expected attendees = 12

Now, Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, but since we calculated the expected attendees, we will use that number instead of the total invited friends.

Total gift bags needed = Expected attendees * 0.75
Total gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75

114,"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up an equation to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

   Let x be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   Then, 6x = 1800 (since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs)
   x = 1800 / 6
   x = 300

   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let y be the number of birds (ducks) in Jamal's photograph.

   Then, 50y = 300 (since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds)

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, so the total cost is 10 x $10 = $100.
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, so the total cost is 5 x $16 = $80.
- The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, Sasha will sell the lumber at 150% of the original price.

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards were bought for $10 each, so she will sell them for $10 x 1.5 = $15 each. The total amount she will get from selling these boards is 10 x $15 = $150.
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards were bought for $16 each, so she will sell them for $16 x 1.5 = $24 each. The total amount she will get from selling these boards is 5 x $24 = $120.
- The total amount she will get from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $270 - $180
Profit = $90

We are given that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we need to find out how many groups of 20 parts are in 120. We can do this by dividing 120 by 20.

120 ÷ 20 = 6

This means that there are 6 groups of 20 parts in 120. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar in each group is 7. Therefore, the total number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 x 6 = 42.

119,"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to first find their salaries four years ago, then calculate the increase in their salaries.

Four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000. Since Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to find Lylah's salary:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769 (approximately)

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and his salary increased by 40% four years later. To find his new salary, we can calculate the increase:

Increase in Adrien's salary = 40% of $40000
= 0.4 * $40000
= $16000

Adrien's new salary = $40000 + $16000
= $56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we can assume her salary also increased by 40% (although the problem doesn't explicitly state this, it's a reasonable assumption given the context). To find her new salary, we can calculate the increase:

Increase in Lylah's salary = 40% of $30769
= 0.4 * $30769
= $12307 (approximately)

Lylah's new salary = $30769 + $12307
= $43076 (approximately)

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= $56000 + $43076
= $99076

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:

147,"To find out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's break down the information step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive. 1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left the hive but haven't returned yet. Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still outside. Then, 60 more bees left, so the total number of bees outside is 15 + 60 = 75.
5. However, we are interested in the bees that left before the last 6 hours and hadn't already returned. This number is 15 (the bees that left in the first 6 hours and hadn't returned) + 60 is not included because it is the bees that left in the 3rd 6 hour period, so we only need the 15 bees that left in the first 6 hours and hadn't returned yet, plus the bees that left in the 2nd 6 hour period and hadn't returned yet. In the 2nd 6 hour period 30 bees left and 15 returned so 30 - 15 = 15 bees that left in the 2nd 6 hour period hadn't returned yet. So the total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours and hadn't already returned is 15 + 15 = 30.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 30.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting at his house before Tim finishes the race, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time:

After 2 months, the new price is $20 + $4 = $24.

After another 2 months (4 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. The new price is $24 + $4 = $28.

After another 2 months (6 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. The new price is $28 + $4 = $32.

We can see a pattern here. Every 2 months, the price increases by $4. Since we want to find the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the number of 2-month periods:

Number of pink calla lilies = 5 * Number of white carnations
200 = 5 * Number of white carnations

To find the number of white carnations, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

Number of white carnations = 200 / 5
Number of white carnations = 40

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses she ordered. We are told that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

Number of red roses = 4 * Number of white carnations
Number of red roses = 4 * 40
Number of red roses = 160

The well-rounded team has each member running their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by this team is:

Total time (well-rounded team) = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has their first runner running their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for each runner are:

Runner 1: 60 seconds
Runner 2: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Runner 3: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Runner 4: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:

Total time (less well-rounded team) = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, we can find the difference in time between the two teams:

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

P(rolling an even number) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 0.5. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities:

P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = P(rolling an even number) × P(rolling an even number) = 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25

Now, we can compare the probabilities. To find the difference in percentage, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, and then multiply by 100:

Difference in percentage = (P(rolling a number greater than 3) - P(rolling two even numbers in a row)) × 100
= (0.5 - 0.25) × 100
= 0.25 × 100

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now that we know Jenna picked 10 apples, we can find the total number of apples they both picked by adding Jenna's share to her mom's share.

Let's start with the hamsters. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:

10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces

Next, let's consider the rabbits. There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is:

20 pieces

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and we have already calculated the number of pieces given to the hamsters and rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:

160 pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces

Since there are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can set up the following equation:

3 cages * x rats/cage * 6 pieces/rat = 90 pieces

where x is the number of rats in each cage.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

18x = 90

Dividing both sides by 18, we get:

x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

Let's assume the trader bought x bags of wheat from the farmer.

The cost price of each bag is $20, so the total cost price of x bags is 20x.

The transportation cost for each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for x bags is 2x.

The total cost incurred by the trader is the sum of the cost price and the transportation cost, which is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The selling price of each bag is $30, so the total selling price of x bags is 30x.

The profit made by the trader is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the trader made a total profit of $400, so we can set up the equation:

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost:
Half a dozen = 6 plates
Total cost of plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:
Total cost of cups = Total cost of plates - $1200

Since twenty dozen cups cost $34800, we need to find the cost of one cup. There are 12 cups in a dozen, so twenty dozen cups will have:

210,"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn. She already had $10 and earned $20 from babysitting, so she has $10 + $20 = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, and Sara already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

211,"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can express 'w' in terms of 'r':

w = r + 2

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

212,"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the total distance he walks and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so Gary will walk along the perimeter, which is the sum of all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length (L) = 6 miles
Width (W) = 1.5 miles

Perimeter = 2 × (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 × 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour. To find the time he spends walking, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the local park.

Now, let's add the number of customers from the first two days: 
100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

214,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost from each pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in each pool after 4 minutes:

Small pool: x - 16 gallons
Big pool: 2x - 16 gallons

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up an equation based on this:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. 
The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these points to find the total points scored by these three students: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to create 1 new pen. Since he has 25 pens initially, he can create:

25 / 5 = 5 new pens (using the ink from the initial 25 pens)

Now, Ram has a total of:
25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

However, the ink will eventually run low in these 30 pens as well. Ram can then mix the ink from 5 empty pens to create 1 new pen again. Since he has 30 pens now, he can create:

30 / 5 = 6 new pens (using the ink from the 30 pens)

Now, Ram has a total of:
30 (previous pens) + 6 (new pens) = 36 pens

We can continue this process, but we'll notice a pattern. Each time Ram creates new pens, the number of new pens decreases by 1 (5, 6, ...). This is because the number of empty pens available for mixing decreases.

To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we can sum the initial pens and the additional pens created in each iteration:

25 (initial pens) + 5 (first iteration) + 6 (second iteration) + ... 

However, since the number of new pens created in each iteration decreases by 1, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total number of pens:

Total pens = 25 + (5 + 6 + 7 + ... + n)

where n is the number of iterations.

Since the number of new pens created in each iteration decreases by 1, we can rewrite the series as:

5 + 6 + 7 + ... + n = 5 + (5+1) + (5+2) + ... + (5+(n-1))

This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 1. The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula:

Sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)

where a is the first term (5), d is the common difference (1), and n is the number of terms.

Since the number of new pens created in each iteration decreases by 1, the number of terms (n) is equal to the number of iterations. We can find the number of iterations by dividing the total number of pens by 5:

25 / 5 = 5 iterations

However, this is not the correct number of iterations, as we can continue creating new pens from the empty pens. To find the correct number of iterations, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 and round up to the nearest integer:

However, we can see that the number of iterations is increasing rapidly, and the number of new pens created in each iteration is decreasing by 1. To find the correct number of iterations, we can use the fact that the total number of pens is equal to the sum of the initial pens and the additional pens created in each iteration.

Let's assume that the total number of pens is x. We can write an equation based on the fact that the total number of pens is equal to the sum of the initial pens and the additional pens created in each iteration:

x = 25 + (5 + 6 + 7 + ... + n)

where n is the number of iterations.

We can rewrite the equation as:

x = 25 + (5 + (5+1) + (5+2) + ... + (5+(n-1)))

This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 1. The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula:

Sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)

where a is the first term (5), d is the common difference (1), and n is the number of terms.

Substituting the values, we get:

x = 25 + (n/2)(2(5) + (n-1)(1))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 25 + (n/2)(10 + n - 1)

x = 25 + (n/2)(9 + n)

x = 25 + (9n + n^2)/2

Since x is the total number of pens, it must be an integer. Therefore, the expression (9n + n^2)/2 must be an integer.

We can rewrite the expression as:

(9n + n^2)/2 = (n(9 + n))/2

This expression is an integer if and only if n is even.

Let's assume that n is even. We can write n as 2k, where k is an integer.

Substituting n = 2k into the equation, we get:

x = 25 + (9(2k) + (2k)^2)/2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 25 + (18k + 4k^2)/2

x = 25 + 9k + 2k^2

Since x is the total number of pens, it must be an integer. Therefore, the expression 25 + 9k + 2k^2 must be an integer.

We can rewrite the expression as:

25 + 9k + 2k^2 = 25 + 9k + 2(k^2)

This expression is an integer if and only if k^2 is an integer.

Since k is an integer, k^2 is also an integer.

Therefore, the expression 25 + 9k + 2k^2 is an integer.

Now, we need to find the value of k that satisfies the equation.

We can start by trying different values of k.

For k = 1, we get:

x = 25 + 9(1) + 2(1)^2

x = 25 + 9 + 2

x = 36

For k = 2, we get:

x = 25 + 9(2) + 2(2)^2

x = 25 + 18 + 8

x = 51

For k = 3, we get:

x = 25 + 9(3) + 2(3)^2

x = 25 + 27 + 18

x = 70

We can continue trying different values of k until we find the value that satisfies the equation.

However, we can see that the value of x is increasing rapidly as k increases.

To find the correct value of k, we can use the fact that the total number of pens is equal to the sum of the initial pens and the additional pens created in each iteration.

Let's assume that the total number of pens is x. We can write an equation based on the fact that the total number of pens is equal to the sum of the initial pens and the additional pens created in each iteration:

x = 25 + (9n + n^2)/2

Since x is the total number of pens, it must be an integer. Therefore, the expression (9n + n^2)/2 must be an integer.

We can rewrite the expression as:

(9n + n^2)/2 = (n(9 + n))/2

This expression is an integer if and only if n is even.

Let's assume that n is even. We can write n as 2k, where k is an integer.

Since x is the total number of pens, it must be an integer. Therefore, the expression 25 + 9k + 2k^2 must be an integer.

We can rewrite the expression as:

25 + 9k + 2k^2 = 25 + 9k + 2(k^2)

This expression is an integer if and only if k^2 is an integer.

Since k is an integer, k^2 is also an integer.

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can calculate the sum of their ages:

So, the number of students remaining after exit A is:
1000 - 300 = 700 students

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) x 700 = 420 students

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week.

We know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing in a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call this number x. So, Griffin now has 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

257,"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the weight of the entire tree by dividing the total height by 10 and multiplying by the weight of each section.

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall. To find the number of 10-foot sections, we divide 200 by 10, which equals 20 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find the weight after the termites ate 30%, we need to calculate 30% of the total weight and subtract it from the total weight.

30% of 8000 pounds is 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract 2400 pounds from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. On top of that, there are two additional fees: the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. To calculate this, we multiply the selling price by 0.05 (which is the decimal equivalent of 5%).
Brokerage fee = $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. To calculate this, we multiply the selling price by 0.12 (which is the decimal equivalent of 12%).
Transfer fee = $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

Now, we add the selling price and the two fees to get the total price of the house.
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Finally, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price to find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees:
Transfer fees = 3% of the selling price
Transfer fees = 0.03 x $400,000
Transfer fees = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of the selling price
Brokerage fee = 0.05 x $400,000
Brokerage fee = $20,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount Mr. Tan paid in fees:

Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000
Total fees = $32,000

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. So, the total amount he paid is:

1. Heating the oil to 300 degrees takes 20 minutes.

2. Heating the oil from 300 to 400 degrees takes 40% longer than heating it to 300 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which is 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.

3. The total time it takes to warm up the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, we subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

291,"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets of chocolate bars and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars per packet:
   Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

2. Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Since there are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars per adult:
   Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

3. Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the total chocolate bars for adults from the total chocolate bars:
   Total chocolate bars for children = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars for adults
   Total chocolate bars for children = 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

4. Finally, we need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get. Since there are 8 children and they will share the remaining chocolate bars equally, we divide the total chocolate bars for children by the number of children:
   Chocolate bars per child = Total chocolate bars for children / Number of children
   Chocolate bars per child = 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour (0.5 hours), so we subtract that from the total time.

Total time = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to minutes:

Total time in minutes = 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we divide the total time in minutes by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works:

Number of 10-minute intervals = 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval:

Total earnings = 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's distribute the extra points. Every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point: 18 points.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:

0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last by dividing the total weight of the bag by the weekly consumption:

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per day:
Distance to work: 30 miles
Distance back home: 30 miles
Total miles driven per day: 30 + 30 = 60 miles

Since John goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is:
60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week

Since John works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is:
300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
Cost per mile: $2
Total miles driven per year: 15,000 miles
Total cost of driving per year: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

When the paper is folded vertically, the left and right sides are created. The pages are then arranged in a specific order, with page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front.

Since the pages are arranged in this way, we can see that each piece of paper will have 4 pages printed on it: 2 on the front (left and right) and 2 on the back (left and right).

To find the total number of pieces of paper used, we can divide the total number of pages (32) by the number of pages printed on each piece of paper (4).

We also know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90 books.

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and the current year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
Daily earnings = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked per day
Daily earnings = $10 * 10 hours
Daily earnings = $100 per day

Since Watson works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

Weekly earnings = $100 * 5 days
Weekly earnings = $500 per week

In addition to his hourly wage, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings are:
Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings + Weekly bonus
Total weekly earnings = $500 + $300
Total weekly earnings = $800 per week

Since April has 4 weeks, Watson's total earnings for the month are:

Weekly weight loss for Joey = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss for Joey = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week by the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the total weight.

Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey = Number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the total weight * Number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week

323,"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we can multiply the number of ice cubes by 12 to find the total weakening effect of the ice cubes:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. To find the total weakening effect, we can add the effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Since 5 people left with 7 new records between them, we can find the average number of new records per person by dividing 7 by 5. However, we don't actually need to do this calculation because we know that each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new one.

Since 7 new records were obtained in total, and each new record requires 2 old records, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records.

325,"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and then the number of senior programmers. 

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
Number of junior programmers = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we don't know how many of the remaining employees are programmers. Let's assume the remaining employees are a mix of senior programmers and non-programmers. We will assume all the remaining employees are senior programmers for the sake of this calculation.

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of senior programmers = 60

However, this is not correct as the problem doesn't state that all the remaining employees are programmers. Let's rephrase the problem to state that 2/5 of the total number of employees are junior programmers and the remaining employees that are programmers are senior programmers.

Let's assume the total number of programmers is x. Then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * x and the number of senior programmers is x - 2/5 * x = 3/5 * x.

We know that the total number of employees is 100, and 2/5 of the total number of employees are junior programmers, so the total number of programmers is a subset of the total number of employees.

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100
Number of junior programmers = 40

Let's assume the total number of programmers is x. Then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * x = 40.

2/5 * x = 40
x = 40 * 5/2
x = 100

So the total number of programmers is 100, which is the total number of employees. This is not possible as the problem states that the company has 100 employees, not all of whom are programmers. Let's rephrase the problem to state that 2/5 of the total number of employees are programmers, and 2/5 of the programmers are junior programmers.

Number of programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
Number of programmers = 2/5 * 100
Number of programmers = 40

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Number of programmers
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 40
Number of junior programmers = 16

Number of senior programmers = Number of programmers - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 40 - 16
Number of senior programmers = 24

Now we know the number of junior programmers and senior programmers. We also know that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.

Salary of senior programmers = Salary of junior programmers + $400
Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
Salary of senior programmers = $2400

Now we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
Total amount = (16 * $2000) + (24 * $2400)
Total amount = $32000 + $57600
Total amount = $89600

1. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is x + 5.

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.

4. We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20.

The phone is currently at 60% charge, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can multiply the remaining charge needed by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards of $1 each, totaling $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, so the price becomes $43 - $4 = $39.

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

The total number of guns is the sum of the guns each person has:
DJ has 8 guns
Nick has 10 guns
RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun
Richard has 5 guns

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names. Since RJ is also known as Richard, we will assume that RJ and Richard are the same person, and the correct number of guns Richard has is 1 (RJ) or 5 (Richard). We will use the higher number for our calculation to avoid confusion, but we will also note that there might be an error in the question.

Total number of guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + Richard's guns
Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

However, we used Richard's guns as 5 for our calculation. If we use 1 instead, the total would be:

First, let's calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in a day. It travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city to the first city, for a total of 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles per trip.

Next, we are told that a number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, we are told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as follows:

3 * 7 = 21

So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of customers kicked out.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. So, the cost for David is $30.

Dasha buys tickets, and each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket. So, the cost per ride for Dasha is 2 x $2 = $4. Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is 9 x $4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money David saves. To do this, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. 

Let's assume that Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles. 

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, we can set up the equation:

Now that we know x, we can find out how many popsicles each of them has:

Betty has 5x = 5(15) = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6(15) = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: Half of 4 hours, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

We need to convert the time spent editing from minutes to hours to make it consistent with the other times. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, we can find the total time spent on the song:

Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
= 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
= 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
= 0.2 * 100

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate 1/4 of 12 by dividing 12 by 4. 
1/4 of 12 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices

Now, let's add up the slices that Jenny gave away: 
4 slices (to Bill) + 3 slices (to Mark) = 7 slices

Jenny also eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices that are gone is: 
7 slices (given away) + 2 slices (eaten by Jenny) = 9 slices

First, let's calculate the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage of 8 hours a day:
Energy = Power x Time
Since the power is given in watts, we'll convert it to kilowatts by dividing by 1000 (1 kW = 1000 W).
Power = 900 W / 1000 = 0.9 kW
Time = 8 hours/day x 30 days = 240 hours

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we can multiply the number of sandwiches by the amount of meat and cheese required per sandwich:

Meat required: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese required: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we can multiply the amount of meat and cheese required by their respective costs:

1. First, we need to calculate the number of cats carried away by the boats. Since there were 4 boats and each carried away 5 cats, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

2. Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats on the rock. So, 50 - 20 = 30 cats remained on the rock.

3. Next, we need to calculate the number of cats that ran after the mouse. Since 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, we multiply 3/5 by the number of remaining cats (30). This gives us (3/5) * 30 = 18 cats that ran after the mouse.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the number of remaining cats on the rock. So, 30 - 18 = 12 cats were left on the rock.

1. The introductory period is 6 months, and the cost is $8 per month. So, the total cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

2. After the introductory period, the normal rate of $12 per month kicks in. This rate lasts for 8 months. So, the total cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

3. After the normal rate period, the price increases to $14 per month. Since we're calculating the cost for 2 years (24 months), we need to find out how many months are left after the introductory and normal rate periods:
24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months

So, the total cost for the increased rate period is:

The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24. To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $28 + $4 = $32.

Kenny went to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash and the ticket cost $100. This means he spent the $100 ticket price and had $50 left over, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold:

$150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards

We know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his original cards, so the cards he sold are 2/3 of his original collection. Let's call the original number of cards ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We already know that he sold 100 cards, so we can set up the equation:

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (18 guests) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared:

- 18 guests x 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs
- 18 guests x 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs

Total hotdogs prepared = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is:

- 40 guests x 2 hotdogs = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there is a shortage of hotdogs. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs requested:

80 (hotdogs requested) - 54 (hotdogs prepared) = 26 hotdogs

Since each guest is requesting one additional hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage of hotdogs.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

2. Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can multiply the number of gallons per container by 1/4 to get the number of gallons Josey needed.

3 gallons/container * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

3. Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we can multiply the number of gallons by 8 to get the number of pints.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, the amount he actually spent is:
$5 - (1% of $5) = $5 - $0.05 = $4.95

We need to convert this amount to cents:
$4.95 = 495 cents

Now, we subtract the amount he spent on chips from the total amount he spent:
495 cents - 120 cents = 375 cents

Weight of 1 piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
Weight of 1 piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of 1 piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, the total weight they ate is:

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive at the theater is 4W.

The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled in the first part of the trip is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

The car then drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled in the second part of the trip is:

Total hours a week = Total miles a week / Running speed
Total hours a week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour

487,"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

1. First, we need to find the total number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of puppies by 2/3.

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

2. Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of Pomeranians by 1/3.

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

First, let's calculate the total cost of the razors. Since they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will get 2 packs of razors for the price of 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00, and she also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost will be:

$4.00 (cost of 1 pack) - $2.00 (coupon) = $2.00

Since she is buying 2 packs, the total number of razors is:

2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors

Now, we can calculate the cost of each individual razor:

Total cost / Total number of razors = $2.00 / 8 razors

The second level consists of 3 girls who are also 64"" tall. Since they are standing on top of the bottom level, we need to add their height to the height of the bottom level. 

The third level consists of 2 girls who are 64"" tall. Again, we add their height to the height of the second level.

The top level consists of the shortest girl who is 60"" tall. We add her height to the height of the third level.

Now, let's calculate the total height:

Bottom level: 4 girls * 64"" = 256"" (but we only need the height of one level, so we use 64"")
Second level: 64"" + 64"" = 128""
Third level: 128"" + 64"" = 192""
Top level: 192"" + 60"" = 252""

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ashley brought:
Ashley has 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought:
Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is the sum of the oranges Ashley and Brianne brought:
Total oranges = 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make:
Number of pies = Total oranges / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40.

The total cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, and since food is already included, the total cost is simply 25x.

Since we want to find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

Let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found:
- Let L be the number of insects Lily found.
- Let D be the number of insects David found.
- Let B be the number of insects Bodhi found.

We know that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write an equation:
L + D + B = 43

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write another equation:
L = D + 7

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write a third equation:
D = B/2 or B = 2D

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the first equation:
L + D + 2D = 43
Combine like terms:
L + 3D = 43

Next, we can substitute the second equation into the above equation:
(D + 7) + 3D = 43
Combine like terms:
4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:
D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many Lily found by using the second equation:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
12 kilowatts per hour * 24 hours per day = 288 kilowatts per day

Since a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, Ada's daily electric bill before adding the new device is:
288 kilowatts per day * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour = $432 per day

To find her weekly electric bill, we multiply her daily bill by 7:
$432 per day * 7 days per week = $3024 per week

Now, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device:
12 kilowatts per hour * 24 hours per day = 288 kilowatts per day (from the original devices)
2 kilowatts per hour * 24 hours per day = 48 kilowatts per day (from the new device)
Total daily electric consumption = 288 kilowatts per day + 48 kilowatts per day = 336 kilowatts per day

Ada's daily electric bill after adding the new device is:

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:

Ophelia's sofas: 20

Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Number of CDs = Cost of headphone set / Cost of CD
Number of CDs = $44 / $4
Number of CDs = 11

Since Tom already bought 1 CD, we need to add that to the number of CDs he could have bought.

Total number of CDs Tom could have bought = Number of CDs + 1
Total number of CDs Tom could have bought = 11 + 1
Total number of CDs Tom could have bought = 12

However, the question asks how many more CDs Tom could have bought, so we need to subtract the 1 CD he already bought.

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400

Now, we know that the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Cost of computer + 2 x Cost of monitor + Cost of printer = $2,400
$1,100 + 2 x Cost of monitor + $700 = $2,400

Combine like terms:

$1,800 + 2 x Cost of monitor = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:

2 x Cost of monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2:

Cost of monitor = $300

Each boy brought back 60 shells, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 x 600 = 2400). So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 + 2400 = 3000.

554,"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 + 2 * 16 = 2 + 32 = 34 minutes.

However, the problem asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day, we will assume that the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day is the same as the time it takes him to swim a mile on a warm day, which is 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, it takes Ray 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles. On a hot day, it takes Ray 3 * 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

555,"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate how much he earns per week and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings:
Daily earnings = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked per day
Daily earnings = $2 * 5 hours
Daily earnings = $10 per day

Next, let's calculate John's weekly earnings:
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $10 per day * 4 days per week
Weekly earnings = $40 per week

Now, let's divide the amount John wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take him to save:
Number of weeks = Amount to save / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $80 / $40
Number of weeks = 2

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle from the ground to the sun is also 32 degrees.

The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. This means that the angle from the ground to the sun will increase by 5 degrees every hour.

Since the sun moves for 10 hours, the total increase in the angle from the ground to the sun will be:
10 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 50 degrees

Now, we add the initial angle of 32 degrees to the increase in angle:
32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be 82 degrees.

21 lemonades * $4/lemonade = $84

Now, we know that Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

$84 (Mitchell's earnings) - $63 (Liam's earnings) = $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he can buy $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day for 4 days. Therefore, he will buy 2 * 4 = 8 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he can buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day for 3 days. Therefore, he will buy 5 * 3 = 15 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures: 8 + 15 = 23.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.
Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total roses ordered per week by 4:
Total roses ordered per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
Ford grows 40 roses per week. 
Total roses grown per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses per month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses grown per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
Roses lacked per month = Total roses ordered per month - Total roses grown per month

Katina removes $100 from the account every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, she will remove a total of $100 x 12 = $1200 in a year.

Since we want to find out how much money will be remaining after 2 years, we need to multiply the amount she removes in a year by 2:

574,"To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

The total revenue is the amount of money the food truck earns from selling the sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, the total revenue is:

10 sandwiches x $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

The total cost is the amount of money the food truck spends on bread, cheese, and condiments. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is:

$3.00/loaf x 1 loaf/10 sandwiches = $3.00

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the total cost is:

$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so she has a total of 3 * 64 = 192 crayons. Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we'll assume each crayon can be broken down into multiple small pieces. However, the exact number of small pieces per crayon isn't provided. 

We do know that Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. So, we'll divide the total number of small pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons.

Since we don't know the exact number of small pieces per crayon, let's assume each crayon can be broken down into 'x' small pieces. Then, the total number of small pieces would be 192 * x.

The total number of muffin crayons would be (192 * x) / 8. 

However, we can simplify this by realizing that the number of small pieces per crayon (x) doesn't affect the overall calculation as long as it's consistent. We can simply divide the total number of crayons by the number of small pieces needed to make one muffin crayon, which is 8.

So, the total number of muffin crayons would be 192 / 8 = 24.

Since Kate can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is 24 * $1.50 = $36.

Area = Length * Width
Area = 18 * 12
Area = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet:
Cost of new carpet = Area * Cost per square foot
Cost of new carpet = 216 * $12
Cost of new carpet = $2592

Next, let's calculate the cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = Area * Cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 * $2
Cost of padding = $432

Now, let's calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
Cost of removing old carpet = Area * Cost per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = 216 * $4
Cost of removing old carpet = $864

Finally, let's calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
Cost of installing new carpet = Area * Cost per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = 216 * $34
Cost of installing new carpet = $7344

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total cost:

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage error = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we know that the oven is malfunctioning by 4% for any recipe. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven at, so that the actual temperature is 520 degrees.

Let's call the set temperature 'x'. Since the oven is malfunctioning by 4%, the actual temperature will be 4% more than the set temperature.

Actual temperature = Set temperature + (4% of Set temperature)
= x + (0.04x)
= 1.04x

We know that the actual temperature should be 520 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
2 boxes * $90.00 per box = $180.00

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and lasts Pete 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 boxes * 90 contacts per box = 180 contacts

Since Pete uses 1 pair of contacts per day, the total number of days the 2 boxes will last is:
180 contacts / 2 contacts per day = 90 days

However, we are interested in the cost per pair of contacts, not the cost per day. Therefore, we can simply divide the total cost by the total number of pairs of contacts:
Total cost = $180.00
Total pairs of contacts = 180 contacts / 2 contacts per pair = 90 pairs

600,"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the weight after increasing the original weight by 50%. To do this, we calculate 50% of the original weight (8 pounds) and add it to the original weight.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

New weight = original weight + 50% of original weight
New weight = 8 pounds + 4 pounds
New weight = 12 pounds

2. Since the new weight is too heavy, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. So, we subtract 2 pounds from the new weight.

Weight Jamaal now uses = new weight - 2 pounds
Weight Jamaal now uses = 12 pounds - 2 pounds
Weight Jamaal now uses = 10 pounds

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply the amount Ruiz makes in 1 hour by 12 to find out how much he makes in 12 hours:

60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find out how much Marissa makes in 1 hour:

First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so in a year (12 months), he drives 400 * 12 = 4800 miles.

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the total number of rotations in 4800 miles is:
4800 miles / 2 miles * 725 rotations = 4800 * 725 / 2 = 1740000 rotations per year.

Now, let's divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the yearly rotations (1740000):

Total number of pumps = 2 pumps/washing * 120 washings = 240 pumps

Now, we know the total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we can divide the total cost by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 per pump

Since we need to find the cost in cents, we can convert the cost from dollars to cents by multiplying by 100.

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% = 0.30).

Discount amount = $60 * 0.30 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45), the funding per month is 50% more than the initial funding. To find the initial monthly funding, we divide the initial funding by the initial duration: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

50% more than $20,000 is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

First, we know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Since he bought 16 snowflake stamps, he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

Next, we know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since he bought 19 truck stamps, he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we can add up the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Max bought:

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed:

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula:

The total cost of the classes is $60, and there are 10 total classes. Manny's parents are willing to pay up to $10 per class. 

First, let's calculate the maximum amount Manny's parents are willing to pay for 10 classes: 
10 classes * $10/class = $100

However, the total cost of the classes is only $60. Since Manny's parents are willing to pay up to $10 per class, we can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for with the given budget:
$60 / $10/class = 6 classes

This means Manny's parents are willing to pay for up to 6 classes. Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss:

First, let's find the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of one apple:

$5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30 per apple

Now, let's find the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of one orange:

$3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10 per orange

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can calculate the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:

5 apples × $1.30 per apple = $6.50

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he has to dig through 24 feet of soil. To find the time, we can divide the distance by the rate:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay. To find the time, we can divide the distance by the rate:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour

Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money that each person has: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

We also know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. To find the Cookie Monster's cookies, we subtract 12 from Max's cookies:

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode, it took him half of 60 minutes, which is 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. It takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, so it took him half of 40 minutes, which is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

687,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of all the children are:

T + T + t + t + t = 44

Combine like terms:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, substitute the expression for T from the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expand and simplify:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

We know that 5 lollipops cost $0.40 each, so the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Since the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, we can subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies. 

$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This is the cost of 4 candies. To find the cost of one candy, we divide the cost by 4:

$1.20 / 4 = $0.30

Now we know that one candy costs $0.30. 

To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10 and the cost of one candy by 10, then add the two costs together:

10 * $0.40 = $4.00 (cost of 10 lollipops)

20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year

Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, we can calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month as follows:

2/5 * 20 coins/month = 8 coins/month

Now, we add this to the number of coins Rong saves per month to find the total number of coins Neil saves per month:

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

We know that the total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check. So, we can write the equation as:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

The cost of each scoop is $1.50. So, the cost of 2 scoops is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.

Since Erin has $6.00, we can divide this amount by the cost of 2 scoops ($3.00) to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy:

748,"To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to first find out how many marbles each of them has.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can multiply the number of marbles Sean has by 4 to find the number of marbles Carl has.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

We are also given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This means Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. We can multiply the number of marbles Sean has by 2 to find the number of marbles Cal has.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now that we know how many marbles Carl and Cal have, we can add their marbles together to find the total number of marbles they have combined.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles

54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many students will be in 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by 12.

9 students per group × 12 groups = 108 students

However, we only have 54 students. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to find out how many groups we can form with 54 students, given that each group should have 9 students.

54 ÷ 9 = 6 groups

We already have 6 groups, but the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we have from the number of groups required.

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
   Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
   Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

4. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
   She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

5. Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. 
   She has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. 
   Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons for easier counting. 
   29 large buttons is equal to 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. 
   Adding the 60 small buttons she got from trading large stickers, she has a total of 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Let the number of votes against the new regulation be x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, and each person votes either in favor or against the new regulation. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the number of people on the council, which is 33.

Since each person votes either in favor or against, the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against. We can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation by multiplying x by 2:

Number of votes in favor = 2x
= 2(11)
= 22

Points from berries for Ava = 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Let's assume Emma finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava has 'z - 4' seconds left.

Points from time for Emma = 30z
Points from time for Ava = 30(z - 4) = 30z - 120

Now, let's calculate the total points for Emma and Ava:

Total points for Emma = 10x + 5y + 30z
Total points for Ava = (10x + 80) + (5y + 15) + (30z - 120)
Total points for Ava = 10x + 5y + 30z - 25

The difference between their two scores = Total points for Ava - Total points for Emma
= (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
= -25

Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as x. Since they cost the same amount, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2x.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

We can set up the equation:

2x + 60 = 64

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us:

2. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. On usual days, they ride 3 times. Twice of 3 is 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since this happens for 2 days, the total number of times they ride in these 2 days is 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride in the 5 days and the 2 days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. This is 15 + 12 = 27 times.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

He then bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which we'll denote as x orange and y white. Since the total number of fish he bought is 17, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 17

Now, after adding these new fish to his pond, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the total number of orange fish as O and the total number of white fish as W. We know that initially, O = 3 and W = 4.

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish becomes O + x = 3 + x, and the total number of white fish becomes W + y = 4 + y.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + x = 2(4 + y)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3 + x = 8 + 2y

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:

x = 5 + 2y

Now, we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation x + y = 17:

(5 + 2y) + y = 17

Combine like terms:

3y + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3y = 12

Divide by 3:

y = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

1. Calculate the total distance traveled per week:
Since the one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
He travels to work from Monday to Friday, so the total distance traveled per week is 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles per week.

2. Calculate the total amount of fuel consumed per week:
Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the total amount of fuel consumed per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons per week.

3. Calculate the total amount of money spent on gas per week:
The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money spent on gas per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 per week.

811,"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to first find out the total number of branches he climbed during the week. 

Since Felix charges $.25 per branch and he made $105 during the week, we can divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($.25) to find the total number of branches he climbed.

Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $.25
Total branches = 420

Now that we know Felix climbed 420 branches during the week, we can find out how many branches he climbed per day on average by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7).

Average branches per day = Total branches / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

1. The first set of flowers has 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so the total number of petals is 3 * 5 = 15.
2. The second set of flowers has 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so the total number of petals is 4 * 6 = 24.
3. The third set of flowers has 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so the total number of petals is 5 * 4 = 20.
4. The fourth set of flowers has 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so the total number of petals is 6 * 7 = 42.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals from all the sets of flowers: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101.

Since Rose dropped 1 flower from each set, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers. The dropped flowers have 5, 6, 4, and 7 petals respectively. So, the total number of petals to be subtracted is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22.

First, let's calculate the number of quarters Jack uses. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is equal to 240 minutes, Jack will use:

240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters

Now, let's calculate the number of quarters the two friends who are worse than Jack use. They can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter. They will use:

240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each

Since there are two friends, they will use a total of:

24 quarters per friend * 2 friends = 48 quarters

Now, let's calculate the number of quarters the friend who is better than Jack uses. He can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter. He will use:

240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used:

12 quarters (Jack) + 48 quarters (two friends) + 8 quarters (better friend) = 68 quarters

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2z. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2z.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2z = 4z.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. We can write an equation to represent this:

z (zest) + z (fragrance) + 2z (salt) + 2z (sugar) + 4z (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:

z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10

1. Determine the number of cars Joe initially had.
2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold.
3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave to his mother.
4. Subtract the total number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars.

Step 1: Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe initially had 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Step 2: Joe sold 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Step 3: Joe gave away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gave away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Step 4: Now, we subtract the total number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars. Joe initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has 30 socks, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

3. Peter has half the number of dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount.

So, the correct calculation for the third year is that the total number of homes will be 48 * 2 = 96 homes, but this includes the homes built in the first two years. To find the number of homes built in the third year, we subtract the homes built in the first two years: 96 - 48 = 48 homes.

3. Since I am 2 years older than my sister, we can express my sister's age in terms of my age: S = A - 2.

4. Since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, we can express my mom's age in terms of my brother's age: M = 3B - 1.

5. When you add all our ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation: A + B + S + M = 87.

6. Now, let's substitute the expressions we found earlier into this equation:
   (B - 3) + B + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

7. Simplify the equation:
   B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

First, let's calculate the points she scores in the multiple-choice questions:
She correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, which is 0.8 x 10 = 8 questions.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points in the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points she scores in the true/false questions:
She correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, which is 0.9 x 20 = 18 questions.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points in the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points she scores in the long-answer questions:
She correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, which is 0.6 x 5 = 3 questions.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find out how many chickens he will sell, we multiply 300 by 3/5.

300 * (3/5) = 300 * 3 / 5 = 900 / 5 = 180 chickens

Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken. To make a profit of $2000, we first need to find the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens.

Total money from selling chickens = Number of chickens * Price per chicken
Total money from selling chickens = 180 * 50
Total money from selling chickens = 9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we subtract the profit from the total money to find the cost price.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the old rope:
Profit = Length of the rope x Price per meter
Profit = 20 meters x $2/meter
Profit = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
Cost of new rope = Length of the new rope x Price per meter
Since Sarah wants to use the profit to buy the new rope, the length of the new rope will be determined by the profit she makes. Let's assume the length of the new rope is x meters.
Cost of new rope = x meters x $1.5/meter

Since Sarah will use the profit to buy the new rope, the cost of the new rope will be equal to the profit:
$40 = x meters x $1.5/meter
x meters = $40 / $1.5/meter
x meters = 26.67 meters

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
Cost of new rope = 26.67 meters x $1.5/meter
Cost of new rope = $40

Since the cost of the new rope is equal to the profit, Sarah will not have any money left over after buying the new rope. However, she will have a new rope that is 6.67 meters longer than the original rope.

2. In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Again, since Joe paid her $6, this means she mowed Joe's lawn once. Therefore, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns:

- She mowed Joe's lawn once for $6.
- She mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, but the amount she was paid is not given. However, since the problem states that Joe paid her $6, we can assume that this is the standard rate for mowing a lawn. Therefore, she made 3 * $6 = $18 from mowing Kamala's lawn.

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Now, substitute D = 60 into the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Since Colby works for 8 hours a day, the total number of packages he completes in a day is:
40 packages per hour * 8 hours = 320 packages per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earns in a day. Colby earns $0.20 per package, so the total amount he earns in a day is:

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes to solve. Since an extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long, we can calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle as follows:

Time to solve extreme sudoku = 4 * Time to solve normal sudoku
Time to solve extreme sudoku = 4 * 45 minutes
Time to solve extreme sudoku = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we can calculate the number of bottles he drinks in 180 minutes as follows:

Number of bottles = Total time / Time interval
Number of bottles = 180 minutes / 30 minutes
Number of bottles = 6

2 pieces/red balloon * 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of red and yellow balloons. To find the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:

58 pieces (total) - 40 pieces (at red balloons) = 18 pieces (at yellow balloons)

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:

18 pieces / 3 pieces/yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

Let's denote the age of Peter as P, the age of Paul as L, and the age of John as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can write the equation:

P + L + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write the equation:

L = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write the equation:

P = L + J

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

P + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

P + 2J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2J = 90

Now, substitute the third equation into this equation:

(L + J) + 2J = 90

Substitute the second equation into this equation:

(J + 10 + J) + 2J = 90

Combine like terms:

4J + 10 = 90

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:

L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know Paul's and John's ages, we can find Peter's age:

P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

943,"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he saved with the discount, the amount he got back from selling 5 CDs, and then subtract the total amount he got back from the total cost.

1. Total cost of the CDs: James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost is 10 x $15 = $150.

2. Discount: James got a 40% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: $150 x 0.4 = $60.

3. Amount James paid: After the discount, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the 10 CDs.

4. Amount James got back: James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he got back 5 x $40 = $200.

However, James only sold 5 CDs, and he still has 5 CDs that he didn't sell. To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid for the 5 CDs he sold, and then add the cost of the 5 CDs he didn't sell.

The cost of the 5 CDs James sold is 5 x $15 = $75. After the discount, the cost of the 5 CDs James sold is $75 - ($60 / 10) * 5 = $75 - $30 = $45.

The cost of the 5 CDs James didn't sell is also 5 x $15 = $75. After the discount, the cost of the 5 CDs James didn't sell is $75 - ($60 / 10) * 5 = $75 - $30 = $45.

Now, let's calculate how much money James was out: James paid $90 for the 10 CDs, and he got back $200 for the 5 CDs he sold. However, he only got back $200 for 5 CDs that cost him $45 after the discount, and he still has 5 CDs that cost him $45 after the discount.

So, James was out $90 - $200 + $45 = -$65. Since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually made $65. However, the question asks how much money James was out, so we need to subtract the amount he made from 0.

945,"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swam at his initial pace. Since he swam 60% of the distance, we can find the distance as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we can calculate the time it took James to swim this distance at his initial pace of 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time. Therefore, the resting time is:

Resting Time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim:

Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance Already Swum = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Since James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed, his new speed is:

New Speed = 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

Now, we can calculate the time it took James to swim the remaining distance:

Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Finally, we can find the total time it took James to cross the lake by adding the swimming time, resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance:

Total Time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- The cost of each New York Times is $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sold 6 copies, so the total commission from the New York Times is 6 * $5 * 10% = 6 * $5 * 0.1 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- The cost of each Wall Street Journal is $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sold 10 copies, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 * 8% = 10 * $15 * 0.08 = $12.

Now, let's add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:

Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To solve for Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, the points scored by Bahati as B, and the points scored by Dinar as D.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored. This can be written as:
B = A + 20

We also know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar. This can be written as:
B = D + 10

Since Bahati scored the most points, we can equate the two expressions for B:
A + 20 = D + 10

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45. This can be written as:
A + B + D = 45

Now, we can substitute the expressions for B into the equation for the total points:
A + (A + 20) + D = 45

Combine like terms:
2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:
2A + D = 25

Now, we can substitute the expression for D from the equation A + 20 = D + 10:
2A + (A + 10) = 25

Combine like terms:
3A + 10 = 25

Subtract 10 from both sides:

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

Now, if he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

Number of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write the equation:
A = S + 5

We are also given that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write the equation:

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 
Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) 
Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days:

Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

2. Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years (24 - 19 = 5), we need to subtract 5 years from his dad's age at that time to find his dad's current age. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants.

1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants (because we can't have a partial plant, and we already have 17 plants, so we will round down to 44 to avoid having to buy more plants than needed).

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

2. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
3. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.

Let's denote the average age of the group as 'x'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, her age is 2x.

We also know the ages of Akbar (3 years) and Alessandro (4 years). Let's denote Wilfred's age as 'w'.

The total age of the children is 20, so we can set up the equation:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20
3 + 4 + 2x + w = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + 2x + w = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x + w = 13

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, the sum of the ages of the four children is 4 times the average age (because Helene's age is 2x, and the other three children's ages add up to 2x). We can set up another equation:

4x = 20

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 5

Now that we know the average age is 5, we can find Helene's age:
Helene's age = 2x

First, we calculate the number of female porcupines:
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * Total population
= 3/5 * 50
= 30

Next, we calculate the number of babies born each month:
Number of babies born each month = Number of female porcupines * Number of babies per female

Let's start with the last 3 hours, where the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Charge after 3 hours = Charge before 3 hours - (7% x 3)
28% = Charge before 3 hours - 21%

Now, we can solve for the charge before 3 hours:

Charge before 3 hours = 28% + 21%

First, let's calculate the number of bottles he can place in his driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

Number of bottles = Width of driveway / Distance between each bottle
= 24 feet / 3 feet
= 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to move to 7 more bottles to set off all the soda fountains.

Now, let's calculate the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, so we can multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes him to move between each bottle:

Total time = Number of bottles to move to x Time to move between each bottle

The total amount of money Jim borrowed in loans is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:

$50,000/year x 4 years = $200,000

The total amount of money Jim lost by not working while in school is the amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working at his $25,000 per year job for 4 years, which is:

$25,000/year x 4 years = $100,000

So, the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and make up for the lost income is:

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric pieces to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to the length and 2 feet to the width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece by multiplying the new length and new width.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

So the glee club ate 14 pizzas. To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract 14 from 20:

20 - 14 = 6

The glee club has 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is:

40 x 0.8 = 32

So the football team ate 32 pizzas. To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract 32 from 40:

40 - 32 = 8

The football team has 8 pizzas left.

To find out the total number of pizzas left, we add the number of pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

6 + 8 = 14

1067,"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
Number of small coupons = 700
Cost per small coupon = 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = Number of small coupons * Cost per small coupon
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 3500 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total cost for small coupons to dollars:
Total cost for small coupons = 3500 cents / 100
Total cost for small coupons = 35 dollars

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
Number of big coupons = Twice the number of small coupons
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700
Number of big coupons = 1400
Cost per big coupon = 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = Number of big coupons * Cost per big coupon
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents
Total cost for big coupons = 21000 cents

Converting the total cost for big coupons to dollars:
Total cost for big coupons = 21000 cents / 100
Total cost for big coupons = 210 dollars

Now, let's add the total cost for small coupons and big coupons to find the total cost of postage:
Total cost of postage = Total cost for small coupons + Total cost for big coupons
Total cost of postage = 35 dollars + 210 dollars
Total cost of postage = 245 dollars

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means Mark ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

4. After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

5. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. Now, Sidney has 3 (remaining) + 3 (newly ordered) = 6 sub sandwiches.

6. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

There were 20 trucks initially, but a quarter of them had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

1070,"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you can buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price for one pound and half price for the other.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three sets of two pounds. For each set of two pounds, he will pay full price for one pound ($4.00) and half price for the other pound ($4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00). The total cost for each set of two pounds is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs three sets of two pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:
- 25 classmates

- 13 family members
Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, we subtract them from the total:
Total guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, and there's an additional $6 for each guest beyond 20. To find the additional cost, we subtract 20 from the total number of guests attending:
Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we multiply the number of additional guests by the additional cost per guest:
Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the initial rental fee to the additional cost to find the total cost of the party:
Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of bananas by 7 to find the number of bananas eaten in a day:

315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat in a day. The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:

10 bananas + 4 bananas = 14 bananas per day

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is:

10 bananas + 14 bananas = 24 bananas per day

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 45, and the first and second monkeys eat 24 bananas, the third monkey eats:

45 bananas - 24 bananas = 21 bananas per day

2. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves in 30 minutes, the second train will arrive in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves in 65 minutes, the third train will arrive in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves in 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:

Price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch = 75% of $2000
= 0.75 x $2000

Now, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. Since he sold it at 120% of the price that he bought it, we can calculate it as follows:

Price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend = 120% of $1500

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled after 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

First, let's find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which gives us 10 days off.

Now, we subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Number of people per car = 3
Total number of people in private cars = Number of private cars * Number of people per car
Total number of people in private cars = 20 * 3
Total number of people in private cars = 60

Next, let's calculate the number of people who arrived in the buses:

For the biggest slide, we can calculate the time it takes to ride by dividing the length of the slide (300 feet) by the speed at which people slide down (60 feet/minute).

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide, we can calculate the time it takes to ride by dividing the length of the slide (240 feet) by the speed at which people slide down (80 feet/minute).

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. She wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. 

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
Desired annual retirement income = 0.4 * $100,000
Desired annual retirement income = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll multiply her desired annual retirement income by the number of years to get her total desired retirement savings.

Total desired retirement savings = Desired annual retirement income * Number of years
Total desired retirement savings = $40,000 * 20
Total desired retirement savings = $800,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She's saving 20% of her annual salary, which is $100,000.

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
Annual savings = 0.2 * $100,000
Annual savings = $20,000

To find out how many years Lauren needs to work to reach her desired retirement savings, we'll divide her total desired retirement savings by her annual savings.

1130,"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons x 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of the crayons to pounds by dividing by 16:

200 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 12.5 pounds

Next, let's calculate the weight of the boxes. Nik wants to separate his crayons into groups of 8, so he will need:

200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes x 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Again, we can convert the weight of the boxes to pounds by dividing by 16:

200 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 12.5 pounds

Finally, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to find the total weight:

First, we calculate the total length of the tree that can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we multiply the total length of the tree by 0.8:

80 ft * 0.8 = 64 ft

Next, we calculate the number of logs John can make from the tree. Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the tree that can be used to make logs by the length of each log:

64 ft / 4 ft = 16 logs

Then, we calculate the total number of planks John can make from the logs. Since he can make 5 planks from each log, we multiply the number of logs by 5:

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price of each plank:

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 times Valerie's salary:
Brother's salary = 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month

Their combined salary is:
Valerie's salary + Brother's salary = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
Mother's salary = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money they all have together:
Total amount = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's start by finding her speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we can divide the distance by the time:

Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

Speed on the sidewalk = 2 x Speed on the beach = 2 x 1/20 miles per minute = 1/10 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time she spends walking on the beach and the time she spends walking on the sidewalk:

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = 5 ounces * 40 degrees (minimum temperature)

Simplifying the equation:

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. For three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The total number of chickens brought in a week is 10 * 7 = 70. For three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks

For large-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 5 per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes. To find the number of days it will take her to complete this task, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:

45 large-sized scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days

For medium-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 6 per day. She needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes. To find the number of days it will take her to complete this task, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:

36 medium-sized scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days

For small-sized picture scenes, Lauren can draw 7 per day. She needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes. To find the number of days it will take her to complete this task, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:

Now, we need to find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete all the tasks. Since she can't work on all tasks simultaneously, we add the number of days it will take her to complete each task:

9 days (large-sized scenes) + 6 days (medium-sized scenes) + 7 days (small-sized scenes) = 22 days

However, this calculation assumes that Lauren works on one task at a time. To optimize her work, she can work on multiple tasks simultaneously. Let's calculate the total number of days it will take her to complete all tasks if she works on multiple tasks per day.

We can calculate the total number of days by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes her to complete each task. However, in this case, we can simply add the fractions of days it will take her to complete each task.

To do this, we can calculate the fraction of days it will take her to complete each task:

Large-sized scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
Medium-sized scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
Small-sized scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Now, we can add these fractions of days:

Day 15: Lauren draws 7 small-sized scenes per day, but she only needs to draw 7 - 1 = 6 scenes and then 8 more are left, so she will draw 7 scenes and then have 7 left.

In 1 day, she completes:
- 7 small-sized scenes (7 scenes per day * 1 day)

Remaining tasks:
- 0 large-sized scenes (0 - 0)
- 0 medium-sized scenes (0 - 0)

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need 5 juices to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand (100% / 20% = 5).

Now, we need to find out how many juices are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 
We multiply the number of people by the number of juices required per person: 
2300 people * 5 juices/person = 11500 juices.

Now, we know that Hortex can produce 4200 bottles of juices every day. 
To find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies (octuplets), 3/4 of them wear purple, and 1/4 wear blue.

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies with bows.

Percentage chance = (Number of purple-wearing babies with bows / Total number of babies with bows) * 100

Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. 

He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. So, he earned $50 from selling 40 square meters.

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. So, he earned $30 from selling 20 square meters.

Now, he has sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land. He has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land left.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 x $3 = $60 from selling the remaining 20 square meters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is '4(y - 7)' or '4y - 28'.

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:
y + (y - 7) + (4y - 28) = 37

Combine like terms:
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the new box costs the same as the regular box ($12), we can calculate the cost per pod as follows:

Cost per pod = Total cost / Total number of pods
Cost per pod = $12 / 120
Cost per pod = $0.10

Now, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1. Since each cycle uses 1 pod and each pod costs $0.10, we can calculate the number of cycles as follows:

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. To find out how much chalk is left, we need to calculate 45% of 5 inches and subtract it from 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we subtract 2.25 inches from 5 inches:

5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Now, we know that the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. This means that the teacher can use up to 0.75 inches of chalk (2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches) before he has to recycle it.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to calculate how many days it will take to use up 0.75 inches of chalk. To do this, we can divide 0.75 inches by the amount of chalk used each day.

First, we need to calculate 20% of the original 5-inch chalk:

20% of 5 inches = 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch

Since the teacher uses 1 inch of chalk each day, we can divide 0.75 inches by 1 inch to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk:

0.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 0.75 days

However, this is not the correct answer because the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day. Since the teacher uses 1 inch of chalk each day, we can round up to the nearest whole number to find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk.

Since 0.75 days is less than 1 day, we can round up to 1 day, but we also need to consider that the teacher already used 45% of the chalk on Monday, so we need to add the remaining days to Monday.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, so the total number of cheese slices required is:
6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas required is:
36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, so the total number of pepperoni slices required is:
6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas required is:
24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

1187,"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of snowballs he builds per minute:

20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs/minute

Now, let's consider the melting rate. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so we can calculate the number of snowballs that melt per minute:

2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs/minute

Since Jay builds 1/3 snowballs per minute and 2/15 snowballs melt per minute, the net rate at which he gains snowballs is:

(1/3 - 2/15) snowballs/minute

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15:

(5/15 - 2/15) snowballs/minute = 3/15 snowballs/minute

Now, we can simplify this fraction:

3/15 snowballs/minute = 1/5 snowballs/minute

So, Jay gains 1/5 snowballs per minute. To find out how long it will take him to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the rate at which he gains snowballs:

60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs/minute) = 60 * 5 minutes = 300 minutes

We also know that John is currently 28 years old. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can assume that 20 years have passed since it came out. Therefore, John's age at that time would be 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Now, we can set up an equation using the information we have:

2x = 8

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 8/2
x = 4

So, Jim's age at the time Digimon came out was 4 years old. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age at that time:

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25). So, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, the remaining 3 bandages must have been left over from the first two days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. 

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as x. Then, the total number of bandages they had after ordering on the first day is x + 50.

After using 38 bandages on the first day, they had x + 50 - 38 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages, so they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

Since they had 3 bandages left over from the first two days, we can set up the equation x - 16 = 3.

Solving for x, we get x = 3 + 16 = 19.

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John bought 10 bottles for $600, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to find the cost per bottle:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of bottles of scotch
= $600 / 10
= $60

Now, let's find the cost of the cognac. John bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he bought 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle than scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is:

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + (50% of cost per bottle of scotch)
= $60 + (0.5 x $60)
= $60 + $30
= $90

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac x Cost per bottle of cognac
= 20 x $90
= $1800

Finally, we can find the total amount John spent by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

Now, we can calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:

Number of fish with blue stripes = Number of remaining fish * (5/11)
= 44 * (5/11)

2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people now is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. Now, the total number of people is 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people now is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are currently 180 people on the bus. To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity:

200 - 180 = 20

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. So, the cost per year is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 150/100) = $2 + $3 = $5. Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year, so the cost per year is now 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

Now that we know 'n', we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

1318,"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.

Total slices = Number of pizzas * Number of slices per pizza
Total slices = 7 * 8
Total slices = 56

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends) to find out how many slices each person can have.

Number of people = Henry + 3 friends = 1 + 3 = 4

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
Slices per person = 56 / 4
Slices per person = 14

The answer is: 14",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
