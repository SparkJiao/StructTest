0,"• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood.
• Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experiences directed transport.
• The interest in ratchet systems lies in extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems.
• Recent studies have focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.
• The behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is sensitive to system parameters.
• A specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle was studied by Mateos, who found that the current could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.
• Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in trajectory dynamics.
• However, later investigations by Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals can occur without bifurcations and proposed an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.",1,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 8, 'symbol': '•'}"

2,"• The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Higgs boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Higgs decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand.
• The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the Higgs pole.
• Taking these achievements into account, the physics of the Higgs boson will again play the central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Higgs factory comes true with the generated Higgs events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP.
• This factory can be realized in the GigaZ option of the International Linear Collider (ILC) by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
• Given the high luminosity of the GigaZ option, about 10^16 Higgs events can be generated in an operational year of 10^7, which implies that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of Higgs decay can be improved from 10^-3 at the LEP to 10^-5 at the GigaZ.
• In light of this, the Higgs boson properties, especially its exotic or rare decays which are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics, should be investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential in probing new physics.
• Among the rare Higgs decays, the flavor changing (FC) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics, and it was found that although these processes are severely suppressed in the SM, their branching ratios in new physics models can be greatly enhanced to 10^-3 for lepton flavor violation decays and 10^-4 for quark flavor violation decays.
• Besides the FC processes, the Higgs decay into light Higgs boson(s) is another type of rare process that was widely studied, e.g. the decay H→hh with the particle h denoting a light Higgs boson was studied in the 2HDM, the decay H→H+A with A denoting a pseudoscalar Higgs boson was studied in the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), and the decay H→ZZ was studied in a model independent way in 2HDM and also in MSSM.
• These studies indicate that, in contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decays in the SM,",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 24, 'symbol': '•'}"

* Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale.
* SUSY predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles, with masses below the TeV range, making them discoverable at the Tevatron or LHC.
* The mechanisms of SUSY breaking and mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology.
* The no-scale type Kähler potential is a scenario where SUSY breaking is mediated by gravity, with all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings (a-terms) vanishing as the cosmological constant vanishes.
* The only source of SUSY breaking in this scenario is gaugino masses, making it highly predictive with a few parameters.
* The separation of the hidden and observable sectors in the Kähler potential implies that couplings are flavor blind, and contributions of SUSY particles to flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) are suppressed.
* The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and sequestered sector scenarios in five-dimensional settings.
* The minimal scenario, where universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, is severely constrained by direct search bounds and cosmological constraints, leaving only a narrow allowed region for positive Higgsino mass parameter (μ).

* The source document discusses the stability of horizons formed in spacetimes of colliding plane waves (CPW), focusing on the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos (CX) solution and the Bell-Szekeres (BS) solution.
* The CX solution, unlike the BS solution, possesses a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity.
* Yurtsever showed that the CH in CPW spacetimes is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and a linear perturbation analysis by CX also revealed an analogous result.
* Any perturbation applied to a CPW spacetime turns the CH into an essential singularity.
* The electromagnetic (EM) field itself weakens the strength of a singularity in CPW, with the collision of pure EM waves having a special significance in singularity formation.
* The BS solution describes the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves, with the singularity formed in the interaction region removable by a coordinate transformation.
* Cross polarization and the EM field both play roles in the nature of resulting singularities, leading to the pursuit of these features together.
* The cross-polarized version of the BS (CPBS) solution was found long ago, with the Weyl scalars all regular in the interaction region.
* However, cross polarization does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries, and this paper chooses the CPBS solution as a test ground with various added test fields to justify the validity of a CH stability conjecture proposed previously by Helliwell and Konkowski (HK).

* Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with three main types: Bell-nonlocality, EPR steerability, and non-separability.
* Bell-nonlocality occurs when measurements violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality.
* EPR steerability is a weaker form of non-locality, where one party can demonstrate steering by showing that correlations cannot be described by a local hidden state model.
* Non-separability refers to states that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents.
* The paper focuses on EPR steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals (T-states) when Alice can make arbitrary projective measurements.
* The authors construct a local hidden state (LHS) model for Bob, which describes measurable quantum correlations for separable and many non-separable T-states.
* The model is constructed using the quantum steering ellipsoid and is optimal for Werner states.

7,"• The first proposal to use spin polarization of a single electron to encode binary information is undocumented.
• Feynman may have mentioned this idea in casual conversations around 1985, but concrete schemes for spintronic logic gates emerged in the mid-1990s.
• Encoding information in spin offers potential advantages, including lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation.
• In 1994, a scheme for a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed.
• The spin orientations of three conduction band electrons, each confined in a semiconductor quantum dot, serve as binary variables.
• The system's ground state exhibits anti-ferromagnetic ordering, encoding logic 1 as upspin (parallel to the magnetic field) and logic 0 as downspin (anti-parallel).
• The proposed NAND gate operates based on the tendency to preserve anti-ferromagnetic ordering and the influence of the magnetic field.
• However, these spintronic logic gates face challenges, such as metastable states and the need for unidirectional signal flow.
• Clocking techniques, like a three-phase clock, can enforce unidirectional signal flow but pose fabrication and energy dissipation challenges.",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"
8,"• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary, with the secondary filling its Roche lobe and transferring mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
• The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors are the lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the so-called period gap) and the sharp cut-off of the distribution at around 77 minutes.
• Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
• Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum reach a minimum period at around 5.7 minutes, but the probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region, leading to an accumulation of systems (a spike) at the minimum period.
• The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star, while thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius.
• The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and, in particular, by the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum (AM) losses. In this paper, the authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and investigate ways to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population.
• The authors study the effect of a form of consequential AM loss (CAML) where the AM is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary, and present detailed calculations of the long-term evolution of CVs, comparing the observed short-period CV period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions based on these calculations.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28, 'symbol': '•'}"

12,"• **Observational Evidence for Accelerated Expansion**: The first observational evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was obtained when supernovae type Ia were found to be fainter than expected. This fact has been confirmed by many independent observations such as temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, baryon acoustic oscillations, weak lensing, and gamma-ray bursts.

• **Dark Energy as the Driver**: Within the framework of general relativity, the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, termed dark energy. The nature of this unknown matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort to understand its properties. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of the dark energy driving the present epoch of the accelerated expansion of our universe, and a dark matter component giving rise to galaxies and their large-scale structures.

• **Coincidence Problem and Interacting Models**: The nature of the unknown matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort to understand its properties. The value of the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than what it was estimated in particle physics. It was suggested soon that dark energy could be dynamic, evolving with time. This new cosmological model suffers from a severe fine-tune problem known as the coincidence problem. Cosmological models where dark matter and dark energy do not evolve separately but interact with each other were first introduced to justify the currently small value of the cosmological constant and have been found to be very useful to alleviate the coincidence problem.

• **Future Observations and Constraints**: Current and future observations could and will be used to set up constraints on interactions between dark sectors and clarify the nature of dark matter/dark energy interactions. Observations of type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, redshift-space distortions, and the growth of cosmic structure probe the evolution of the universe at low redshifts.

  - Early experimental work did not verify these predictions, and it was suggested that impurity scattering or nonlocal effects may be responsible.

  - The goal of the current work is to compare in detail the differences between one-band and two-band s-wave superconductors in terms of their nonlinear response, as measured in the coefficients defined by Xu et al. and Dahm and Scalapino.

* The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is a crucial measure for understanding the hierarchical build-up of the universe over cosmic time. Large-scale simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high-mass galaxies, suggesting that some process must be able to stop or ""quench"" star formation before the galaxy grows too big. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are believed to play a role in this process by regulating the SFR through feedback mechanisms.
* The authors present a large sample of 313 Seyfert galaxies selected using ultra-hard X-ray observations with the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and imaged with Herschel/Spire. They focus on the overall luminosity distributions at the Spire wavebands and the Spire colors to determine the likely heating sources of cold dust in AGN host galaxies and to look for correlations with a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity.
* The study finds that Seyfert 2s are detected at a higher rate than Seyfert 1s, and after accounting for upper limits, Seyfert 2s have slightly higher Spire luminosities than Seyfert 1s. However, the effect is small, indicating that the global FIR properties of AGN are independent of orientation. The Spire luminosities are correlated with each other, suggesting that the process (or processes) producing the emission from 70-500 μm is connected. None of the Spire luminosities are well correlated with the 14195 keV luminosity, a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity.
* The study also finds anomalous colors for 6 BAT AGN, indicating that the FIR seds for these AGN are dominated by synchrotron emission from a radio jet rather than thermally heated dust. Another group of AGN with less anomalous colors but still removed from the main locus were analyzed by fitting the seds with a modified blackbody and calculating a 500 μm excess. The 500 μm excess is not related to radio loudness but is well correlated with the 14195 keV luminosity and the 3.4/4.6 μm color from WISE. The authors speculate that this is possibly related to the millimeter excess emission recently seen in AGN caused by coronal emission above the accretion disk.

* A main focus of interest is the central exclusive production (CEP) process, in which the protons remain intact and the central system is separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap.
* Observation of any particle in the central exclusive channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers.
* By detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately, it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products.
* The FP420 collaboration has proposed to install detectors in the region 420 m from the interaction points, which would allow the detection of central systems in the approximate mass range 70-140 GeV.
* Proposals also exist to upgrade the capabilities of ATLAS and CMS to detect protons in the 220 m region, which would extend the accessible mass range well beyond 140 GeV.
* In this paper, the focus is on the central exclusive production of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and a supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson, with a mass of 120 GeV.
* The CEP process is shown schematically in Figure [centralexclusive].

* The measurement of rotation curves (RCs) of disk galaxies is a powerful tool to investigate the nature of dark matter (DM), including its content relative to baryonic components and their distributions. Dwarf galaxies are particularly useful for this purpose as their kinematics are generally dominated by the dark component, down to small galactocentric radii.
* The Orion dwarf galaxy is examined in this study due to its extended disk, providing an important test of the DM density profiles arising in cold dark matter (CDM) numerical simulations. Recent studies suggest that kinematic data of dwarf galaxies are better fitted by a DM halo with a constant density core than one that is centrally peaked.
* The Orion dwarf's kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored profile, making it critically important for investigating the nature of DM particles and the evolution of DM halos. The galaxy's high-quality, high-resolution RC can be easily corrected for asymmetric drift and tested for non-circular motions, showing a large mass discrepancy at all radii.
* The Orion dwarf is modeled as consisting of two luminous components (stellar and gaseous disks) embedded in a dark halo. The stellar component is modeled as an exponential thin disk, while the gas component's contribution to the observed RC is derived from the total intensity map. Two different parametrizations of the mass distribution are considered for the dark halo: an NFW profile and the cored profile of the Halo Universal Rotation Curve (URCH).

* The trihydrogen dication (H3+) is a simple Coulomb system consisting of three protons and one electron, whose stability has been extensively studied.
* Conroy's work in the 1960s and 1970s concluded that H3+ is not stable based on potential energy surface analysis using a variational approach.
* Later studies by Schwartz and Schaad, Somorjai and Yue, and others also found no evidence of stable H3+.
* Shoucri and Darling, and Hernandez and Carb revisited the issue using more advanced methods but still found no bound state.
* Johnson and Poshusta, and Ackermann et al. performed further calculations, with the latter using the finite element method and excluding the possibility of stable H3+ in the electronic ground state.
* The present study aims to address the question of H3+ existence again, motivated by the possibility of a metastable state in a magnetic field.
* The study explores the stability of H3+ using two methods: a specialized variational approach with physically relevant trial functions and a standard variational approach using Gaussian trial functions.
* The specialized approach leads to lower variational energy values with fewer terms, but relies on careful optimization of non-linear parameters. The study concludes that H3+ does not exist in an equilateral triangular configuration in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

* The merger of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star are among the most important sources of gravitational waves (GW), due to the huge energy released in the process.
	+ The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) may radiate about 10^56 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.4 - 1.6 kHz, covered by most ground-based laser interferometers.
	+ The rate at which these mergings occur in the local universe is another parameter characterizing if these mergings are potential interesting sources of GW. Previous investigations have estimated a detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations.
* Besides the emission produced by the coalescence of the nearest DNS, the superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts will produce a stochastic background of GW.
	+ Different astrophysical processes susceptible to generate a stochastic background have been investigated, including distorted black holes, bar mode emission from young neutron stars, supernovas or hypernovas, and tri-axial rotating neutron stars.
	+ Populations of compact binaries, such as cataclismic variables, are responsible for the existence of a galactic background of GW in the MHz domain, which could represent an important source of confusion noise for space detectors like LISA.
* In this work, using the DNS merging rate estimated in a precedent study, the gravitational wave background spectrum produced by these coalescences was estimated.
	+ Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods were performed to determine the critical redshift beyond which the duty cycle condition required to have a continuous background is satisfied.
	+ The signal frequency is in the range 10 - 1500 Hz, covered by ground-based interferometers, and the paper discusses the detection possibility with laser beam interferometers.

While much is now well understood, some issues remain subjects of debate, particularly the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock.
• **Backreaction of Accelerated Particles**: The violation of the test particle approximation occurs when the acceleration process becomes sufficiently efficient to generate pressures of the accelerated particles comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure. This changes both the spectrum of the particles and the structure of the shock, making it intrinsically nonlinear.
• **Approaches to Backreaction**: There are three main approaches to account for the backreaction of particles upon the shock: numerical simulations, a fluid approach treating cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, and an analytical approach that treats the pressure of accelerated particles as a small perturbation.
• **Nonlinear Effects on Maximum Energy**: Recent studies have investigated the effects of the nonlinear backreaction of accelerated particles on the maximum achievable energy, along with the effects of geometry. The need for a practical solution of the acceleration problem in the nonlinear regime has been recognized.
• **Analytical Solutions**: Some promising analytical solutions of the problem of nonlinear shock acceleration have appeared in the literature, avoiding many of the limitations of previous approaches. Numerical simulations have been instrumental in identifying the dramatic effects of the particles' backreaction.
• **Nonlinear Effects on Spectrum**: The most visible effects of the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the shock appear in the spectrum of the accelerated particles, which shows a peculiar flattening at the highest energies. Analytical approaches reproduce well the basic features arising from nonlinear effects in shock acceleration.
• **Future Work**: Further investigation, particularly a detailed comparison of analytical results with numerical simulations of shock acceleration, is required to unveil the physical meaning of the multiple solutions for modified shocks. Phenomenologically, studying the implications of nonlinear shock reacceleration on astrophysical environments where the effect is expected to play an important role, such as supernova remnants, would be valuable.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21, 'symbol': '•'}"

The principal conclusion of their works was that @xmath0-invariant Hamiltonians, which are not necessarily Hermitian, may still give rise to completely real spectra, thus being appropriate for the description of physical settings. In the context of nonlinear optics, this concept has been experimentally realized through the work of Christodoulides and co-workers.
* The presentation of the results is structured as follows: Section [symmetry] contains a part of the analytical results, including a detailed analysis of the @xmath8 symmetry properties of the nonlinear Schrödinger type model, as well as the spectral properties of the linear Hamiltonian subsystems. Section [numerics] is devoted to the existence, stability, and dynamics of stationary modes in the nonlinear systems. Section [conclu] summarizes conclusions and discusses directions for future studies.
* The dynamics of the 2d plaquettes considered in this work is described by a multicomponent nonlinear Schrödinger equation (nlse) built over a transposition-symmetric linear Hermitian matrix Hamiltonian and an additional nonlinear matrix operator. The analysis can be built on techniques developed for other nonlinear dynamical systems with symmetry preservation.
* The work aims to make a basic step in the direction of introducing fundamental 2d plaquettes consisting typically of four sites (in one case, it will be a five-site cross). These configurations are inspired by earlier works on 2d Hamiltonian lattices described by discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations. The plaquettes proposed herein should be straightforwardly accessible with current experimental techniques in nonlinear optics, as a straightforward generalization of the coupler-based setting reported in ref. The work starts from the well-established Hamiltonian form of such plaquettes in the conservative form, gradually turning on the gain-loss parameter (@xmath2), as the strength of the @xmath0-invariant terms, to examine stationary states supported by the plaquettes, studying their stability against small perturbations and verifying the results through direct simulations.

108,"• **Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and their Origin:**
  - GRBs are believed to be of cosmological origin, as evidenced by the detection of x-ray, optical, and radio afterglows from well-localized events.
  - The fireball model is strongly favored to explain GRBs, suggesting that they are produced by ultra-relativistic outflows.
  - However, the nature of GRBs, whether they are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs, remains uncertain, making it difficult to determine their energetics.

• **Methods to Determine GRB Beaming:**
  - Three methods have been proposed to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs: analyzing optical afterglow light curves, measuring optical polarization, and searching for orphan afterglows.
  - The first method relies on the presence of a break in the optical light curve during the relativistic phase, but detailed numerical studies show that the break is usually quite smooth.
  - The second method involves measuring optical polarization, which can be strong for jetted GRBs, but requires specific conditions to be observed.
  - The third method involves searching for orphan afterglows, which are isolated fading objects not associated with any detectable GRB.

• **Orphan Afterglows and Failed GRBs (FGRBs):**
  - Orphan afterglows can be produced by both jetted GRBs and isotropic fireballs with initial Lorentz factors much less than 100, known as failed GRBs (FGRBs).
  - FGRBs can be produced by baryon-contaminated fireballs and may manifest as fast x-ray transients or x-ray-rich GRBs.
  - The detection of orphan afterglows does not necessarily mean that GRBs are highly collimated, as there could be many orphan afterglows even if GRBs are due to isotropic fireballs.

• **Discriminating Jetted GRB Orphans and FGRBs:**
  - Distinguishing between jetted GRB orphans and FGRBs is challenging due to the uncertainty in the trigger time and the difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory light curve.
  - The light curve of an orphan afterglow can be shifted along the x-axis (time) and y-axis (flux density) due to uncertainties in the trigger time and distance.
  - The late-time behavior of the light curve can be used to discriminate between the two types of orphans, but this requires a",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28, 'symbol': '•'}"

Various forms of these clouds have been considered, including isolated, clustered, and fractal, all involving dense gas of high column density in contrast to the diffuse gas in the interstellar medium.
• **Gamma-Ray Emission**: One of the fundamental predictions of a model featuring dense gas clouds is the gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray interactions within the clouds. Because of the potentially large total mass of gas involved, this process may yield a diffuse flux in the galactic plane comparable to the flux from known sources for photon energies around 1 GeV.

• **Gamma-Ray Constraints**: The low emissivity of dense gas means that the baryonic content of the galaxy's dark halo is not so tightly constrained by the gamma-ray data as had previously been thought. For column densities greater than about 10^23 cm^-2, the existing gamma-ray data, taken in isolation, do not exclude purely baryonic models for the galactic dark halo.

This behavior is observed for samples with densities well above the percolation threshold and fits the extended pair approximation model.
• **Onset Frequency**: The onset frequency, extracted from the frequency dependence measurement, increases linearly with the dc sheet conductance over about 4 decades. This linear proportionality is a characteristic feature of ac conductance in disordered solids, known as Taylor-Isard scaling.

• **Electric Field-Dependent Conductivity**: The electric field-dependent conductance shows nonlinear behavior, with a characteristic electric field at which nonlinear conductance begins to appear. This field increases with temperature and decreases with film thickness.
• **Length Scale**: The length scale, extracted from the electric field-dependent measurement, depends on the density of the swcnt networks. Thicker films with larger densities have smaller length scales.
• **Empirical Relation**: An empirical relation is developed between the onset frequency and the length scale, with consistent results from both frequency-dependent and electric field-dependent measurements.
• **Mobility Estimation**: The mobility of carriers on the swcnt network is estimated to be on the order of 10 cm²/V·s, much smaller than that of individual swcnts, due to randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport.

* It avoids tracking moving solid-liquid interfaces or grain boundaries by describing the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields.
* The phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods.
* The foundations of the phase-field method and its application to solidification have been well-documented in recent review articles.
* Several topics are discussed in the paper where robust phase-field modeling tools are not yet available due to some fundamental questions remaining open.
* In section 2, the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models is examined, and it is shown that the currently available approaches cannot in general eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness.
* In section 3, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification are discussed, and it is shown that the standard equation of motion usually written down for the orientation field is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
* Finally, in section 4, the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is reviewed, and it is shown that the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
* The common point of these topics is that they pose challenges or limitations for straightforward computations.
* A characteristic feature of the phase-field method is that its equations can often be written down following simple rules or intuition, but that their detailed properties become apparent only through a mathematical analysis that can be quite involved.
* Therefore, it is not always easy to perceive the limits of applicability of the method.

* To be useful for simulating microstructure formation in solidification, phase-field models need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of the physical solid-liquid interfaces and the typical scale of the microstructures.
* This is achieved by increasing the interface width in the model, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.

* **Spin Turbulence in Multi-Component BECs**: In multi-component BECs, there exists a velocity field and a (quasi) spin field, leading to novel turbulence with disturbed velocity and spin fields and various topological excitations. The authors previously studied spin turbulence (ST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, focusing on the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy.
* **Spin-Superflow Turbulence (SST) in Spin-1 Ferromagnetic Spinor BECs**: In this paper, the authors treat the problem of spin-superflow turbulence (SST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, focusing on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy. They theoretically and numerically find that the spectrum of the kinetic energy shows a Kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields. When the Kolmogorov spectrum is sustained, the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy exhibits a -1 power law simultaneously.

* **Model and Method**:
	+ The Kondo Lattice Model (KLM) is studied using Dynamical Cluster Approximation (DCA) with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) solver.
	+ The model describes localized magnetic moments coupled antiferromagnetically to a metallic host.
	+ DCA retains temporal fluctuations and neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size.
	+ The method allows for symmetry breaking antiferromagnetic order and maps out the magnetic phase diagram.
* **Results at Half-Filling**:
	+ At half-filling, the model exhibits a magnetic order-disorder transition between insulating states.
	+ The transition belongs to the three-dimensional Ising universality class.
	+ The DCA approach overestimates the critical value of the coupling constant due to small cluster sizes.
	+ The single-particle spectral function agrees well with exact lattice QMC results in both paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases.
* **Results Away from Half-Filling**:
	+ Away from half-filling, the model shows a continuous magnetic phase transition with decreasing coupling and increasing doping.
	+ The rkky interaction dominates over the kondo scale at lower couplings and higher dopings.
	+ The coherence scale is too low to guarantee convergence below a certain temperature.
	+ The limiting computational factor is the cubic scaling of the Hirsch-Fye algorithm, not the negative sign problem.
* **Fermi Surface Topology Change**:
	+ Within the magnetically ordered phase, there is a change in the fermi surface topology.
	+ The topology change corresponds to two continuous Lifshitz transitions in a mean-field model.
	+ The transition is associated with an enhanced effective mass on both sides.
	+ The energy scales required to resolve the nature of this transition are currently inaccessible within the DCA with a QMC solver.

* At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events exhibit rapidity gaps between jets, demonstrating the relevance of color singlet exchange effects in QCD events at high momentum transfers.
* The two-gluon exchange model, which assumes the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state, predicts a gap fraction of about 1%, but recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations do not support this prediction.
* The authors reconsider the basic ideas behind the two-gluon exchange model, demonstrate its limitations, and show that the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative.

• Low mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where the primary is a compact object and the secondary a low mass star.
• The secondary transfers mass via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk around the compact object that gives rise to the observed x-rays.
• Most LMXBs are neutron star systems that can be divided into two groups: Z-sources and atoll sources.
• Z-sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in x-rays and trace a Z-like shape in their x-ray color-color diagrams.
• Atoll sources have lower accretion rates and their color-color diagrams usually consist of fragmented island-like regions.
• The main physical difference between Z-sources and atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.
• LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z-source and is therefore thought to be a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit.
• It is one of the most x-ray luminous LMXBs known, but due to its extra-galactic nature, its x-ray flux is rather low.
• Its optical counterpart was identified by Pakull in 1978 as a blue star.
• Despite being x-ray luminous and having a known optical counterpart, little is known about the system parameters of LMCX-2.
• Estimates for the orbital period range from 6.4 hours to 12 days, and no periodic variability was detected in 6 years of MACHO data.
• In recent years, Steeghs and Casares developed a new technique to detect a signature of the donor star in persistent LMXBs.
• Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, they detected narrow emission lines in SCO X-1, especially in the Bowen blend.
• This discovery was followed by a survey of other LMXBs that are optically bright enough to also resolve these narrow components.
• In this paper, the authors apply the technique of Bowen fluorescence to LMCX-2.
• They show that it is possible to detect a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset that they identify as the orbital period.
• Similar to other X-ray binaries thus far, the Bowen region shows the presence of narrow emission lines that the authors identify as coming from the irradiated side of the companion.
• This gives the first ever constraints on the system parameters of LMCX-2.

• The microprocessor calculates respiratory airflow by subtracting instantaneous leak from mask flow, and low pass filters the respiratory airflow to remove cardiogenic airflow and other noise.
• The microprocessor determines mask on/off status by detecting an off-on transition when respiratory airflow first goes above 0.2 L/sec, and an on-off transition when mask pressure is less than 2 cmH2O for more than 1.5 seconds.
• The microprocessor calculates lead-in, which runs from zero if the mask is off or recently donned, to 1.0 if the mask has been on for 20 seconds or more.
• The microprocessor calculates the instantaneous jamming index J by determining the fuzzy extent to which the impedance of the leak has suddenly changed, and calculates the recent peak jamming index J PEAK by setting it to equal the instantaneous jamming index if it is larger, or low pass filtering the instantaneous jamming index with a time constant of 10 seconds otherwise.
• The microprocessor adjusts the time constant for leak conductance calculations based on J PEAK, which is a measure of the fuzzy extent that the leak has recently suddenly changed.
• The microprocessor calculates the instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle φ by identifying nine separate features on the waveform, calculating the fuzzy membership in fuzzy sets describing the instantaneous airflow and rate of change of airflow, applying fuzzy inference rules, and calculating the centroid of the resulting masses.
• The microprocessor estimates the mean duration of inspiration T I , expiration T E , cycle time T TOT , and respiratory rate RR by updating the estimated duration of inspiration or expiration based on the current phase, and calculating the observed mean duration of a breath and respiratory rate.
• The microprocessor calculates the desired instantaneous delivery pressure by adding the desired pressure modulation amplitude to the end expir",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30, 'symbol': '•'}"

It aims to address the limitations of existing rotary valves by providing a means for sanitizing the valve in place without disassembly.
• **Prior Art**: Existing rotary valves, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,808,317, 2,985,589, 3,268,604, 4,409,033, and others, do not provide sanitizable features. Known non-rotary sanitizable valves, like those granted to Mieth, Dolling, Ringo, and Pruett, do not have rotary designs. U.S. Pat. No. 4,921,015 and 4,625,763 describe rotary valves with sealing means but lack sanitizable aspects.
• **Invention Summary**: The invention is a novel type of rotary valve that combines elements from the valve art with a unique feature allowing partial separation of the rotor-stator faces for flushing and cleaning. It comprises a rotor with a thermoplastic elastomeric diaphragm molded to form multiple sealing ports and a stator with corresponding ports and gutters. The diaphragm has integral dynamic wipe sealing lips that maintain fluid-tight sealing engagement with the stator face even when the rotor is moved orthogonally away from the stator for sanitization.
• **Invention Operation**: The valve operates by rotating the rotor to index the ports, allowing fluid flow between the rotor and stator ports. For sanitization, the rotor is moved orthogonally away from the stator, breaking the seal between the rotor sealing ports and the stator face. Sanitizing fluid is then flushed across the sealing faces of the stator and the diaphragm, cleaning the port sealing faces. The valve also has a barrier fluid flow path to prevent accumulation of dried material and release of solution to the external environment.

• **Background and Problem**: Traditional methods using standpipes or monitoring wells can dampen true formation pressures and may not provide accurate measurements, especially in low permeability formations. Shrinkage of cement grout can also lead to longitudinal leakage paths, influencing the pressure measured by transducers.
• **Solution**: The invention proposes a method involving cementing a conduit fitted with a filter at its bottom end in a borehole at a desired location. The conduit is then pressurized to clear it of cement grout, and a valve is used to block backflow. After the cementing operation, the conduit is again pressurized to displace the cement grout around the filter, creating a fluid connection between the formation and the filter.
• **Alternative Process**: In an alternative process, the fracturing of both the grout and the formation can be accomplished following the filter washing and setting of the grout.
• **Cement Grout Placement**: The cement grout can be pumped through the borehole using either a grout pipe or a return tube, depending on the method of grouting.

* **Cooling System Challenges**: The water cooling system in rotary internal combustion engines faces significant challenges, particularly in the area surrounding spark plugs where combustion and expansion of working gases occur. Uneven heating can cause housing distortion, leading to improper functioning of gas and oil sealing elements. Sudden acceleration with a cold engine exposes the rotor housing and associated trochoid wall to repeated sudden and very large thermal loads, potentially causing thermal fatigue or thermal shock cracks.
* **Spark Plug Arrangement**: The use of in-line or dual spark plugs for a single rotor housing has been commercially accepted to improve engine output. However, this arrangement disrupts the flow of cooling fluid, allowing vapor films to collect and preventing the heat from being carried away in such a critical area. The spark plug bosses in a rotary engine are cast in close proximity to the circumference of each rotor housing, affecting a significant portion of the total heat of combustion, unlike reciprocating engines where each spark plug boss is affected by only a quarter of the total heat.

346,"• The present invention relates to an apparatus capable of controlling with high precision the recording and reproduction of signals by plural heads, and more particularly to a recording/reproducing apparatus in which a recording/regenerative integrated circuit with plural magneto resistive heads (MR heads) connected thereto can be controlled with high precision.
• An MR head, as it can detect magnetic information signals entered from a recording medium by variations in resistance, requires the supply of a detecting current (sense current). Furthermore, as such variations in resistance have a nonlinear characteristic with respect to the input magnetic field, an MR head also needs a bias current for keeping the operating point in a more linear region. Recently developed MR heads are designed to use these currents in combination.
• Where MR heads are to be used in a rotary head type magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus, a bias current circuit and a preamplifier circuit are mounted on the rotary drum. Therefore, power to drive these circuits needs to be supplied to the rotary drum side, and it is usually transmitted via a rotary transformer or a slip ring (contact).
• A technique to mount MR heads on a rotary drum and control bias currents to determine the operating points of the MR heads is described, e.g. in J-P-A No. 177924/1998. Further, J-P-A No. 105909/1998 discloses a bias current regulating apparatus capable of flowing optimal bias currents to individual MR heads. J-P-A No. 201005/1995 reveals a method by which optimal bias currents are applied to active MR heads at the time of executing each head switching command.
• For high density recording/reproducing apparatuses using a magnetic tape, the prevailing trend is to increase the number of magnetic heads (MR heads) mounted on the rotary drum in order to expand the capacity and enhance the transfer rate. Since each MR head differs in sensitivity and optimal operating point according to its element length from the sliding surface of the tape (MR height), it is preferable to individually optimize the bias current where plural MR heads are to be used. However, if it is necessary to provide the rotary transformer for controlling the MR bias currents with as many channels as the MR heads, it will become difficult to increase the number of MR heads to be mounted on the rotary drum. Furthermore, where control information is to be transmitted in analog signals, there will be another problem of difficulty to achieve high enough precision.

* **Program Overview**: The 287(g) program, established by Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), allows state and local law enforcement agencies to perform certain immigration enforcement functions under the supervision of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
* **Program Authority**: Participating agencies can interrogate individuals about their immigration status, arrest removable aliens, and transport them to ICE-approved detention facilities. They can also initiate removal proceedings by preparing a notice to appear in immigration court.
* **Program Models**: ICE has developed three models for state and local law enforcement participation: the jail model, task force model, and joint model. The jail model allows correctional officers to screen arrested individuals for immigration status, while the task force model allows officers in criminal task forces to do the same. The joint model combines both approaches.
* **Program Objectives**: The main objective of the 287(g) program is to enhance the safety and security of communities by addressing serious criminal activity committed by removable aliens. However, ICE has not clearly documented this objective in program-related materials.
* **Program Controls**: ICE has not documented the program's objectives in program-related materials, and MOAs lack specificity regarding the use of 287(g) authority and ICE supervision. Additionally, ICE has not defined what program information should be tracked or ensured that program information is consistently collected and communicated.
* **Performance Measures**: ICE has not developed performance measures to track the progress toward attaining the program's objective. However, ICE is in the process of developing performance measures and has initiated compliance inspections to monitor program implementation.
* **Program Resources**: ICE provides resources such as training, equipment, and supervision to participating agencies. State and local law enforcement agencies also provide resources, such as officers, space for equipment, and funding for other expenses. Some agencies have reported equipment-related problems and concerns about limited ICE supervision.
* **Program Activities, Benefits, and Concerns**: As of October 2008, ICE reported that about 43,000 aliens had been arrested under the 287(g) program authority, with about 34,000 detained and about 14,000 (41 percent) placed in removal proceedings.

• **Popular Itemized Deductions**: The most common deductions were for mortgage interest, state and local income taxes, and charitable gifts. The deduction for extraordinary medical and dental expenses was claimed by few tax filers, particularly at higher income ranges.
• **Income Share of Deductions**: Total itemized deduction claims as a share of income declined as income increased. For itemizers with AGI less than $200,000, mortgage interest comprised the largest share of income, while for those with AGI over $200,000, state and local income taxes comprised the largest share.

* The current law allows for the deduction of capital losses up to $3,000 against ordinary income, with any excess losses carried forward indefinitely.
* Historically, Congress has repeatedly attempted to address the asymmetrical treatment of capital gains and losses, with varying degrees of success.
* The loss limitation was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from minimizing their capital income tax liabilities by selectively realizing losses and holding gains.
* The current system allows for more generous tax savings for taxpayers with net long-term capital losses than a symmetrical tax rate on both capital gains and losses would.
* Empirical evidence shows that capital gains and losses are heavily concentrated in the upper income ranges, with the top 2% of the permanent income distribution realizing about two-thirds of gains and losses.
* Lower and middle income taxpayers are less likely to be affected by changes in capital loss restrictions, as they hold fewer stocks and more assets in tax-favored forms.
* Increasing the net capital loss deduction may not be an effective way to stimulate aggregate demand or restore confidence in the stock market, as the benefits would accrue mainly to higher income individuals.
* Achieving full symmetry in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses would require addressing the tax rate differential between short and long-term gains and losses during the netting process.

561,"• **Campus-Based Programs Overview**: The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs are collectively referred to as ""campus-based"" programs, with federal funds awarded directly to institutions of higher education (IHEs) for administration. These programs are unique in that the mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined according to institution-specific award criteria, rather than non-discretionary award criteria applicable to other federal aid programs.

• **Funding Allocation and Participation**: Funds for each campus-based program are allocated to IHEs through a two-stage process, with a base guarantee and a fair share component. In AY2016-2017, approximately 6,733 postsecondary institutions in the United States participated in Title IV programs, with 56% participating in FSEOG, 49% in FWS, and 21% in the Perkins Loan program. However, there has been an overall decline in participation in these programs over the last decade.

• **Student Participation and Aid Coverage**: In AY2015-2016, approximately 1.5 million students received aid through the FSEOG program, 635,000 through the FWS program, and 422,000 received a Perkins Loan. Students attending private nonprofit institutions were more likely to receive campus-based aid than those attending other sector schools. The average award amount across all campus-based programs was $1,676, while average total federal student aid was $8,233.

563,"• **Budget Authority and Appropriations Process**: The federal government's spending process begins with budget authority enacted by Congress, followed by agency obligations, and finally, outlays (actual payments). Budget authority can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year, and it determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts, while mandatory spending consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriations acts.

• **DHS Budget Composition**: DHS's gross budget authority is composed of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly, while mandatory spending consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriations acts. DHS's net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. The DHS budget features two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and the Coast Guard retired pay accounts, and offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds.

• **Budget Control Act and DHS Appropriations**: The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first governed by the Budget Control Act, which established discretionary security and non-security spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. Most of DHS's budget is considered nondefense spending, and the Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to raise the statutory caps. Three justifications for adjustments have played a role in DHS's appropriations process: emergency spending, overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror, and disaster relief. The disaster relief allowable adjustment for FY2017 was $8.129 billion, and the emergency designation was exercised in P.L. 115-56 to provide additional funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and HUD's Community Development Fund in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.

Since the 9/11 attacks, federal, state, and local governments, as well as private utilities, have conducted vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential threats. These assessments consider physical disruption, bioterrorism, cyber attacks, and other sources of harm.
* **Security Measures and Coordination**: Various security measures have been implemented to protect water infrastructure, such as restricted access to facilities, enhanced monitoring, and coordination with law enforcement and emergency response officials. The Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC) and the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) have been established to facilitate information sharing and communication among water utilities, government agencies, and other stakeholders.
* **Legislative Actions and Funding**: Congress has enacted several laws to enhance water infrastructure security, including the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act (P.L. 107-188) and the Chemical Security Act (Section 550 of P.L. 109-295). These laws have provided funding for vulnerability assessments, security improvements, and research. However, the extent of federal involvement and the allocation of resources remain topics of debate.
* **Challenges and Future Directions**: Despite progress in water infrastructure security, several challenges persist, such as securing large and complex collection systems, addressing chemical security concerns, and coordinating efforts among multiple agencies and stakeholders. Future directions may include expanding the use of inherently safer technologies, improving information sharing and analysis, and enhancing public-private partnerships to strengthen the resilience of the water sector.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 12, 'symbol': '*'}"

Its location made it a key ship resupply and sailor recruiting center for U.S. vessels, fostering a long-standing tradition of emigration to the United States.
• **Demographics and Language**: Most Cabo Verdeans are of mixed Portuguese and African descent and speak a Portuguese-African Creole. The country has a large expatriate population, with a significant presence in New England. Expatriates may vote in national elections, with their collective vote potentially constituting up to a fifth of all votes cast within the national territory.
• **Political System**: Cabo Verde became a democracy in 1991, transitioning from a one-party state ruled by the African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde (PAICV). It now has a multi-party system dominated by the PAICV and the Movement for Democracy (MPD). The president wields appointment and legislative veto powers, commands the armed forces, and represents the republic domestically and abroad as chief of state.
• **Economy and Trade**: Cabo Verde is classified as a lower-middle-income economy with a high literacy rate and generally high social services and health indicators. It imports about 80% of its grain supply and has been recovering from a drought-stricken harvest in 2014-2015. Tourism has grown rapidly, with a record 569,000 arrivals in 2015.

• LMR was first enacted in 1999 and has been reauthorized several times, with the most recent reauthorization in 2015.
• Before LMR, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price and related market information on a voluntary basis.
• The livestock industry had undergone changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, which made it difficult for producers to determine ""fair"" market prices for livestock going to slaughter.
• USDA estimated that the former voluntary system was not reporting a significant portion of transactions.
• Opponents of mandatory price reporting argued that it would impose costly new burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information.
• The LMR law mandated price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine and allowed USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales.
• USDA issued a final rule on December 1, 2000, implementing LMR, which included mandatory reporting for lamb despite it being optional in the LMR statute.
• LMR authority has lapsed several times, but Congress has reauthorized it each time, with the most recent reauthorization in 2015.

* Protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry have greatly improved, enabling qualitative and quantitative proteome comparisons.
* Current ion trap mass spectrometers are very sensitive and have fast analysis times, allowing for the identification of hundreds of proteins in a single LC-MS/MS analysis.
* However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from very complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present over wide concentration ranges.
* To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at either the protein level or peptide level, or both.
* Regardless of the initial fractionation methods used, the final step in most strategies involves analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS.
* Undersampling will occur if the complexity of tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer, leading to only a subset of peptides being identified.
* A common observation when complex proteomes are analyzed is that the lists of proteins identified are often quite variable, raising concerns about the reproducibility of proteomics for most applications.
* One strategy to achieve more comprehensive proteome coverage is to perform repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses on each sample, exploiting the variability in low-abundance protein identifications.
* Other strategies for increasing the number of proteins identified include prefractionating the proteome based on protein physical properties, improving separation of the peptide mixture at the HPLC separation step, modifying the ESI interface to enhance ionization, or adding an ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) interface before the ion trap.
* In this study, the effects of two commonly used strategies - gel-based LC-MS/MS with repetitive LC-MS/MS analysis and additional protein prefractionation - were compared and assessed for their effects on depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates.

Acute rejection episodes are a significant risk factor for CAI, and the transplantation of kidneys in Fischer-344 (F344) to Lewis rat strain combination is a well-established experimental model for human CAI.
• **Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in Acute Rejection**: TGM2, a protein involved in various cellular processes, is upregulated by mononuclear leukocytes accumulating in the lumina of allograft blood vessels during acute rejection. TGM2 might play essential roles in rejection, resolution, and the development of CAI. The study investigates TGM2 mRNA and protein expression in mononuclear blood leukocytes and renal tissue during acute rejection and after resolution.
• **TGM2 Expression and Function in Allografts**: TGM2 mRNA and protein are overexpressed by mononuclear leukocytes, predominantly by activated monocytes, which accumulate in the vascular bed of rat renal allografts on day 9 after transplantation. After resolution of acute rejection on day 42, TGM2 mRNA levels are lower but still moderately increased compared to respective isografts, which is not reflected in increased protein levels. TGM2's role in apoptosis and its potential contribution to the pathogenesis of CAI are discussed, but further investigation is needed.",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12, 'symbol': '•'}"
605,"• **Endothelial Microparticle (EMP) Isolation and Characterization**: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to produce EMPs. These were isolated, characterized, and quantified using flow cytometry based on CD31 and Annexin V positivity, with a size gate set at less than 1 µm. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was also used to confirm EMP size and structure.
• **EMP Introduction and Circulation**: EMPs were introduced into an IV bag containing 0.9% NaCl, mimicking a patient's circulation. The IV bag was connected to a primed Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration (CVVH) circuit, and the perfusate was circulated through the CVVH filter for 70 minutes. Aliquots were removed for flow cytometric analysis at 10-minute intervals.
• **EMP Clearance During Dialysis**: The decline in EMP levels due to dialysis was rapid, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes. Within 40 minutes, circulating EMP levels were reduced to 29% of the starting concentration, and this level remained relatively constant over the duration of the study.
• **EMP Levels in Dialysate**: The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis, indicating that the majority of EMPs were removed from the circulation but not passing through the filter into the dialysate.
• **CVVH as a Therapeutic Intervention**: The data demonstrated that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical CVVH filter and under clinical conditions can remove EMPs from a modeled patient's circulation. Given previous evidence of EMP-induced acute lung injury (ALI), these findings support the idea of CVVH as a meaningful therapeutic intervention in ALI due to clearance of EMPs from the patient's circulation.
• **Limitations and Future Directions**: The observed EMP clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon, which would explain the relatively constant EMP concentration from 40 to 70 minutes and low dialysate EMP levels. Future work includes assaying patients pre- and post-dialysis to observe EMP concentration effects and applying dialysis to rodent models of EMP-induced ALI to examine efficacy in ongoing diseases and EMP thresholds associated with worse injuries.

  - HCC is the sixth most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related mortality, disproportionately affecting developing countries and males.
  - Risk factors include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C, excessive alcohol use, and environmental carcinogens like aflatoxin B.
  - HCC prognosis and treatment depend on underlying liver disease severity, with median overall survival of 58 months for advanced disease.
  - HCC is relatively refractory to chemotherapy due to multidrug resistance and p53 mutations, with sorafenib being the only approved systemic therapy.

• **HGF-CMET Axis in HCC:**
  - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, cMET, promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.
  - HGF-CMET signaling is critical for normal processes like embryogenesis and tissue repair but also drives HCC development and progression.
  - Dysregulation of the HGF-CMET axis in HCC occurs through mechanisms like aberrant ligand production, overexpression of HGF and cMET, and cMET gene mutations.
  - Overexpression of HGF and cMET is observed in 33% and 20-48% of human HCC samples, respectively, and correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive phenotypes.

• **HGF-CMET Inhibitors in HCC:**
  - Pharmacologic cMET inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC, targeting ligand-receptor interaction, cMET kinase activity, or cMET and adaptor protein interaction.
  - As of March 2013, selected HGF-CMET inhibitors in active clinical trials for HCC or advanced solid malignancies include biologic antagonists, cMET adaptor protein inhibitors, small-molecule downstream pathway inhibitors, and small synthetic cMET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
  - Tivantinib (ARQ 197) and cabozantinib (XL184) are two cMET TKIs showing promising results in phase 2 trials for HCC, with improved time to progression and overall survival in some patients.

However, DAT imaging alone cannot differentiate between various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy.
• **MIBG Scintigraphy**: Meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy assesses sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals, with decreased cardiac MIBG uptake in PD patients compared to other parkinsonian syndrome patients.

* Wheeler and Edmondson were the first to use the term CHFC and identified specific characteristics, including four typical layers, differentiating it from other hepatic cysts.
* CHFCs are rare, with approximately 103 cases reported worldwide since 1857, and are most commonly found in the left lobe of the liver.
* The average age of presentation is 52 years, with a slight female predominance, and many cases are incidentally found on imaging studies.
* CHFCs are typically asymptomatic, unilocular, and have a variable appearance on imaging, but pathologically they have four distinct layers.
* The main differential diagnosis is bronchogenic cyst, and simple cysts are usually located in the right hepatic lobe.
* Laparoscopic excision is the recommended treatment for CHFCs larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic, enlarging, or with wall abnormalities on imaging, and can be performed using a minimally invasive approach.

• **Estrogen's Role**: Estrogen's anti-inflammatory properties are mediated through estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ). While estrogen generally has anti-inflammatory effects, its role in vascular inflammation is controversial. Menopause-related estrogen reduction contributes to inflammation and metabolic remodeling.
• **Study Aim**: The study aimed to investigate whether a high-fat diet with or without ovariectomy promotes inflammation in rats by assessing pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and their receptors, as well as TLR4 protein content.
• **Methods and Findings**: Female Wistar rats were fed a control or high-fat diet for 4 weeks, followed by ovariectomy or sham surgery. After 8 weeks, body weight, food intake, and serum parameters were measured. Ovariectomy combined with a high-fat diet increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content, along with hyperleptinemia. Cytokine content decreased in mesenteric adipose tissue but remained unchanged in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle.
• **Implications and Conclusion**: The study suggests that a high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy may contribute to inflammation, particularly in adipose tissue. After menopause, women should reduce fat consumption to mitigate these effects.

• The study aimed to investigate the acute hemodynamic response (AHR) of the implanted system and alternative LV endocardial pacing sites in patients clinically not responding to CRT.
• Twenty-four non-consecutive patients, 23 males, age 72.8 ± 9.1 years, mean ejection fraction 22.5 ± 7.1%, agreed to undergo an acute hemodynamic study.
• Ten patients were considered possible candidates for LV endocardial pacing, and five of them finally agreed to LV endocardial implant at the optimal LV site as indicated from the acute study.
• All five patients improved clinically with a reduction of at least 1 class in the NYHA score after 6 months of follow-up.
• The study demonstrated the importance of lead location, as the clinical response improved with a posterolateral position of the lead instead of the original apical or anterolateral lead location.",1,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 9, 'symbol': '•'}"

* **ADPKD Disease Facts**: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 individuals, with no racial or ethnic predilection. It may not manifest clinically until the third or fourth decade, and half of patients may progress to renal failure. Risk factors for rapid progression include hypertension, renal hemorrhage, multiple pregnancies, male gender, and PKD1 disease genotype.
* **Pregnancy Complications**: Pregnant women with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis face complications like maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, infected renal and hepatic cysts, pyelonephritis, and cerebral artery aneurysm rupture. However, spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section with careful monitoring.
* **Patient Case**: An 80 kg, 35-year-old primigravida with ADPKD and oligohydramnios underwent emergency LSCS at full term. She was diagnosed in the seventh month and dialyzed thrice weekly to maintain acceptable BUN, serum creatinine, and potassium levels.
* **Preoperative Parameters**: The patient's heart rate was 102/min, blood pressure 120/74 mmHg, CVP 1-2 cm H2O. Preoperative investigations showed Hb 10.2 gm%, normal leucocyte count, mild proteinuria, and normal liver function tests. Biochemical profile revealed BUN 30 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.7 mg%, and normal coagulation profile.

The peak milk yield was attained in the 3rd or 4th fortnight, with normal cows peaking slightly later than mastitis cows.
* **Parity Effects**: The 4th parity had the highest milk yield in both normal and mastitis cows. Milk production increased up to the 4th fortnight in normal cows and up to the 3rd fortnight in mastitis cows before declining.
* **Lactation Curve Parameters**: Normal cows had higher initial milk yield (a) than mastitis cows in different parities. The peak milk yield was highest in the 4th parity for both groups. The descending slope parameter (c) was higher in the 4th parity for normal cows and in the 5th and above parity for mastitis cows.
* **Persistency of Lactation**: Persistency of lactation was higher in the 1st parity and declined till the 5th and above parity in all cows. The fortnights of peak milk yield ranged from 4.53 to 6.15 fortnights in normal cows and from 4.49 to 5.88 fortnights in mastitis cows.
* **Model Accuracy**: The gamma type function used to predict milk yield had a high coefficient of determination (r) ranging from 84.88% to 98.18% in normal cows and from 83.93% to 97.68% in mastitis cows. The root mean square error (RMSE) was minimum in the 3rd parity for normal cows and in the 5th and above parity for mastitis cows.
* **Comparison with Previous Studies**: The peak milk yield attained during the 3rd and 4th fortnights in both groups corroborates with earlier reports in cows. The lower initial milk yield (a) in the first parity and an increasing trend in subsequent parities have also been reported in normal KF cows and other breeds.

It consists of a pair of N-terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, and ending in a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain. MyoVa's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms, resulting in the motor's processive motion with each head taking 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.

• **Tethered Particle Microscopy (TPM) to Measure Flexural Stiffness**: The researchers used TPM to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains. By anchoring a MyoVa-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor, they could measure the motion of the tethered particle relative to a stationary reference particle. This allowed them to estimate the flexural stiffness of various MyoVa constructs and subdomains, including the lever arms, lever arm/coiled-coil junction, and distal rod domain. They found that the lever arm flexural stiffness decreased by 40% in the presence of calcium, which could negatively impact the motor's processivity. Additionally, they discovered that the lever arm/rod junction must be highly compliant to allow MyoVa to maneuver through actin intersections and switch tracks on actin bundles.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with the combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla.
• The combined technique involves injecting a radioactive tracer (Tc nanocolloid) and blue dye interstitially, either peritumorally or periareolarly, which are then detected within the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) by the surgeon using a handheld scintillation counter (gamma probe) and/or visually.
• The gamma probe is first used to transcutaneously localize the SLNs and determine the optimal incision site, and post-incision, both the blue dye and gamma probe guide the surgeon to the SLNs.
• After identification, the SLNs are removed and sent for histopathological examination, with an identification rate of 96% and a false-negative rate of 5-10%.
• The use of radioisotopes is subject to stringent regulations on training of staff and handling and disposal of radioactive material, and many hospitals worldwide do not have access to radioisotopes, leading to the search for other techniques not reliant on the use of radioisotopes.

• **Phosphatase-Catalyzed Phosphate Transfer**: Phosphatases offer an alternative to kinases, using cheap inorganic polyphosphates as activated phosphate donors. They are less substrate-specific and produce environmentally benign inorganic phosphate as a byproduct. However, the reversibility of phosphate transfer can lead to undesired hydrolysis.
• **Phosphatase Selection and Activity**: In this study, several phosphatases were selected for their ability to transfer a phosphate moiety onto various hydroxylated compounds. Phonse, phonsf, and piacp were found to be efficient catalysts for the phosphorylation of various alcohols, while phytase and aphast showed limited or no activity under the assay conditions.
• **Substrate Scope and Chemoselectivity**: The substrate scope of phonsf, phonse, and piacp was investigated, showing high chemoselectivity for alcohols over amines and other nucleophiles. They also displayed high regioselectivity for primary over secondary hydroxy groups. However, enantioselectivity was generally low.
• **Reaction Optimization and Scale-up**: To minimize product hydrolysis, reaction parameters such as pH and phosphate donor type were optimized. The use of a continuous flow reactor with immobilized enzymes was shown to be an efficient tool for maintaining high product levels and scaling up the reaction. The enzymatic phosphorylation of primary and secondary alcohols was demonstrated on a preparative scale, yielding phosphate monoesters as the sole products.",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24, 'symbol': '•'}"

* Biological invasions have been recognized as a significant global environmental change since the mid-1980s, with over 100 scientists worldwide contributing to research.
* Early research focused on impacts at the population and community levels, such as predation, competition, and disease transmission.
* Newer research has revealed ecosystem-level impacts and the role of genetics and evolution in invasions.
* Introduced species can alter nutrient cycles, fire cycles, hydrology, and other ecosystem processes, affecting many resident species.
* Molecular genetic techniques have shown extensive hybridization and introgression between introduced and native species.
* Introduced populations often combine genes from multiple source populations, creating novel genetic combinations.
* Invasional meltdown occurs when two or more introduced species facilitate each other's establishment or enhance impacts on native species.
* Lag effects, where full impacts lag behind initial arrival, are common and can make management challenging.
* Critics of invasion biology argue that the problems are overblown, native species cause similar impacts, and management efforts are futile or inhumane.

680,"• **Origin and Development of Nasopharyngeal Bursa:**
  - The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area where the notochord and foregut communicate, specifically from the pharyngeal endoderm.
  - It is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx, which typically disappears during the second month of fetal development.
  - In some cases, this remnant can become obstructed, leading to the formation of a Tornwaldt's cyst, or it can form crusts that adhere to the orifice without obstruction, resulting in the crust type.

• **Types of Nasopharyngeal Bursitis:**
  - There are two main types of nasopharyngeal bursitis: the cystic type and the crust type.
  - The cystic type is more common and can form part of the differential diagnosis for nasopharyngeal abscesses and cysts.
  - The crust type, although less understood, is characterized by periodic shedding of crusts from the nasopharynx, causing an offensive smell and unpleasant taste.

• **Symptoms of Nasopharyngeal Bursitis:**
  - Symptoms of nasopharyngeal bursitis can be due to a space-occupying lesion or rhinitis.
  - Space-occupying lesions can cause nasal obstruction, Eustachian tube obstruction with secretory otitis media, dysphagia, and cranial nerve paralysis.
  - Rhinitis symptoms can include choanal discharge, halitosis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, and gastritis.

• **Incidence and Demographics:**
  - The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, but it can appear at any age.
  - The peak incidence occurs between 15 and 30 years, with a Caucasian predominance and no gender predilection.
  - However, most published literature comprises selected case reports and describes the cystic type, with no estimates for the true incidence of the crust type.

• **Diagnosis and Treatment:**
  - Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx and computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging.
  - A surgical technique combining an endonasal and transoral approach, involving disruption of the bursa with electrocauterization, is performed for both types of bursitis.
  - This technique has shown good outcomes, with complete recovery and no recurrence of symptoms at more than one year postoperatively.

• **Clinical Presentation and Findings:**
  - The classical cyst type presents with postnasal discharge, throat irritation, and cough",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21, 'symbol': '•'}"

* **Incidence and Importance of Melanoma**: The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing, with an estimated 76,250 new cases in the USA in 2012, and Australia having one of the highest rates in the world. Melanoma is dangerous due to its ability to spread widely via lymphatic and blood vessels, making early diagnosis crucial.
* **Dermoscopy and Diagnostic Techniques**: Dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that enables visualization of morphological features not discernible by examination with the naked eye. Various techniques like solar scan, epiluminescence microscopy (ELM), cross-polarization ELM (CPL-ELM), and side transillumination (TLM) can enhance morphological details.
* **Dermoscopy's Impact on Diagnosis**: Dermoscopy enables better diagnosis compared to unaided eye, with an improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of 10-30%. However, it may also lower diagnostic accuracy in inexperienced hands, as it requires great experience to differentiate skin lesions.
* **Scoring Systems and Algorithms**: Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of less experienced clinicians. These include the ABCD-E rule, the seven-point checklist, the three-point checklist, and the Menzies method. However, they show problems with low within- and between-observer concordance.
* **Automated Analysis of Dermoscopic Images**: There's growing interest in the automated analysis of digitized images obtained by ELM techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions. This involves applying computational intelligence methods to process data faster and provide more reliable diagnoses.
* **Feature Extraction and Selection**: The next stage of image analysis is to extract important features of the image. Different feature extraction methods include statistical and model-based methods, with multichannel filtering being the most efficient and accurate. Feature selection is critical for distinguishing between malignant melanoma, benign, and dysplastic nevi.
* **Classification Techniques**: The classification phase involves making inferences about the extracted information to produce a diagnostic about the input image. Techniques include k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVMs). Each has its advantages and disadvantages.
* **Performance Evaluation Measures**: The quality of a classification model is assessed using discrimination (how well the two classes are separated) and calibration (how close the predictions are to the real underlying probability).

• The National Institute of Health (NIH) concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy, with no increase in morbidity or mortality.
• Laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces pain and disability, potentially leading to cost savings due to shortened convalescence.
• However, charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often exceed those of open cholecystectomy, primarily due to equipment and technical requirements.
• A study at Maricopa Medical Center (MMC) found excessive length-of-stay (LOS) and charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared to other regional hospitals.
• To determine the true charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients was conducted, comparing open and converted laparoscopic procedures.
• The average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922, while open cholecystectomies averaged $13,042, with the laparoscopy charge attributed to be $6,880.
• Decision tree analysis showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective, but reducing charges could make laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost-effective depending on the conversion rate.
• A sensitivity analysis found that a reduction of $3,331 in laparoscopic cholecystectomy charges would be needed to make it cost-effective if the conversion rate was 5%.
• Health care providers should evaluate charge data for each hospital and use matched-pair analysis, decision-tree, and sensitivity analyses to improve care, reduce charges, and become cost-efficient in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

• Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.
• Atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disease, characterized by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through the disease progression.
• In physiological conditions, endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins, maintaining a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules.
• However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts, leading to an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, further progressing the disease.
• These proinflammatory cytokines can induce oxidative stress by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by monocytes, macrophages, and leukocytes.
• PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response.
• Unsaturated fatty acids are referred to as PUFAs when two or more double bonds are present.
• There are two PUFA families, omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, which differ in the location of the last double bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule.
• The human body can produce almost all fatty acids, except linoleic acid (LA, C18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3n-3), which are considered essential fatty acids because the body cannot synthesize them.
• Endogenous conversion (elongation and desaturation) of the initial C18 PUFA precursors results in the synthesis of longer-chain counterparts such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the n-3 family, and dihomo",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40, 'symbol': '•'}"
701,"• **Historical Context**: The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is built on the work of three pioneering pathologists.
• **Virchow's Contribution**: Rudolf Virchow, a 19th-century Prussian physician-scientist, proposed that cancer arises from chronic irritation or inflammation.
• **Correa's Model**: Pelayo Correa, a Colombian pathologist, proposed a stepwise process for gastric cancer development, starting with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over 30-50 years.
• **H. pylori Discovery**: Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, setting the stage for its link to gastric cancer.
• **Initial Evidence**: Early studies in the 1980s and 1990s provided weak evidence for H. pylori's role in gastric cancer, but three large cohort studies with nested case-controls provided stronger evidence.
• **WHO Classification**: In 1994, the World Health Organization classified H. pylori as a definite (group 1) carcinogen based on these cohort studies.
• **Subsequent Research**: Further research confirmed H. pylori's role in gastric cancer, with key findings including its association with non-cardia cancers, diffuse-type cancers, and the increased risk of CagA-positive strains.
• **Eradication Studies**: Meta-analyses of eradication studies showed that H. pylori eradication decreases the risk of gastric cancer development by approximately 40% in primary prevention and 54% in tertiary prevention.
• **Future Directions**: Ongoing research focuses on identifying co-factors that promote gastric neoplastic development after H. pylori colonization, with the goal of creating personalized surveillance and prevention programs.",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"

It was a retrospective study evaluating patients treated between 2009 and 2011 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.
• **Patient Characteristics and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: Patients were aged 50 years or more, newly diagnosed with nAMD, and had received no treatments other than bevacizumab or ranibizumab alone. They had no retinal diseases other than nAMD, no previous intravitreal injections, and no history of photodynamic therapy or laser photocoagulation.
• **Treatment and Follow-up**: All patients received monthly doses of bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml) or ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) for the first three months, followed by monthly examinations and retreatment if certain criteria were met. The mean follow-up time was approximately 18 months.
• **Outcome Measures**: The primary outcome measures were changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) over time. BCVA was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, and CRT was measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT).
• **Results**: Both bevacizumab and ranibizumab groups showed significant improvements in BCVA and CRT compared to baseline at every time point. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of change in BCVA, change in CRT, number of injections, or complications.

* **Prevalence and Impact**: Preeclampsia (PE) affects 25% of pregnancies, causing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. It's often diagnosed by proteinuria, but studies show proteinuria isn't a significant predictor of adverse outcomes.
* **Incidence and Severity**: The incidence of PE has increased in China, but there's no indicator for severe PE. Severe PE is often associated with hypoalbuminemia, which may serve as an indicator of severity.
* **Causes and Effects**: Hypoalbuminemia occurs due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased angiotensin secretion, and damaged endothelial cells, leading to protein and fluid leakage, intravascular dehydration, and reduced hepatic blood flow.
* **Study Aim**: The study aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with PE, focusing on the predictive value of hypoproteinemia (albumin < 25 g/l).
* **Study Design**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 299 women with singleton pregnancies between January 2014 and June 2015 at the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Anhui Province.
* **Definitions and Exclusions**: PE was defined according to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy guidelines. Women with kidney diseases, preexisting proteinuria, essential hypertension, other maternal chronic conditions, or twin pregnancies were excluded.
* **Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes**: Maternal outcomes included delivery mode, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, hypertension, abnormal liver and renal function, ascites, oligohydramnios, thrombocytopenia, and abruptio placenta. Neonatal outcomes included perinatal deaths, preterm birth, neonatal asphyxia, and fetal growth restriction.
* **Findings and Conclusions**: Women with severe hypoproteinemia PE (albumin < 25 g/l) had worse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including higher rates of cesarean section, severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, abruptio placenta, preterm birth, low birth weight, and fetal growth restriction. Hypoproteinemia was a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes in PE.

* **Metabolic Phenotypes**: Young LCN2 mice on a regular chow diet (RCD) did not show significant metabolic differences from wild-type mice. However, they developed severe systemic insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia under an HFD.
* **Cold Intolerance**: LCN2 mice were cold intolerant and failed to maintain body temperature when acutely exposed to cold. They died after 12 hours at 4°C, while wild-type mice survived.
* **Thermogenesis**: LCN2 mice had lower body temperature under thermal stress conditions. Cold exposure stimulated UCP-1 and PGC-1 gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT), but they could not maintain body temperature.
* **Leptin and Thermogenesis**: Serum leptin levels were not different in LCN2 mice on an RCD, and they did not show a difference in body temperature in thermoneutral conditions. Leptin may partially contribute to LCN2-regulated thermogenesis.
* **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**: LCN2 mice had reduced expression of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function in BAT and skeletal muscle, contributing to decreased thermogenic capacity.
* **Insulin Resistance**: LCN2 mice had reduced insulin responsiveness in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver, indicating systemic insulin resistance. They also had increased hepatic glucose production.
* **Lipid Metabolism**: LCN2 mice on an RCD had higher serum triglycerides but lower serum triglyceride levels when fed an HFD. They had increased triglycerides synthesis and decreased VLDL secretion due to fatty liver development.

• **Quantum Dots (QDs) as an Alternative:** QDs, a type of inorganic fluorophore, offer ideal optical properties for biological use, including strong fluorescent signal emission, narrow and tunable emission spectra, and resistance to photobleaching. They have been successfully used in clinical biopsies for detecting multiple mRNAs and show promise for use in WISH protocols.
• **QD-Based WISH in Xenopus Embryos:** The authors demonstrate the use of QDs for non-amplified fluorescent WISH in Xenopus embryos, one of the most highly autofluorescent and demanding vertebrate developmental organisms. They show that QD detection of endogenous messenger RNAs is effective and provides higher resolution data than current techniques. Additionally, they successfully perform two-color in situ hybridization simultaneously using QDs.
• **Future Applications and Significance:** The use of QDs for non-amplified fluorescent WISH in Xenopus embryos suggests that QD-based WISH will find successful applications in most developmental models. This method expands the uses of QDs in biology and offers exciting possibilities for imaging and creating three-dimensional maps of expression at previously unattainable resolutions.",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 20, 'symbol': '•'}"

* Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease with the lowest survival rates among all cancers, accounting for over 37,000 deaths per year in the US. It is a heterogeneous disease, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) being the most common and aggressive subtype, having a median survival time of about four months.
* Several factors significantly impact the survival of PDAC patients, including demographic characteristics such as gender, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, and time period of diagnosis, as well as clinical factors like tumor size, nodal status, distant metastases, and surgical resection of the tumor. Cox proportional hazards regression models have been used to estimate the relative impact of these risk factors on survival.
* The authors developed a real-time prognostic tool using SEER data on 18,352 pathologically confirmed PDAC cases diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. This tool estimates survival and conditional survival probabilities, along with their corresponding standard errors, for patients with PDAC based on their unique clinicopathological profile and medical treatment. The tool's reliability and generalizability were proven by its calibration and discrimination abilities, validated using both internal and external datasets.

727,"• **Disease Information**: Human cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is a significant and widespread parasitic zoonosis. Humans acquire infection by ingesting the parasite's eggs from infected dogs, and the disease is common where there's close contact between intermediate (sheep) and definitive (dog) hosts.
• **Diagnosis and Treatment**: CE in humans typically presents with symptoms related to fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other viscera. Diagnosis is usually established through a combination of radiology and serology. Treatment involves antihelminthic drugs and surgical procedures, but there's a risk of postsurgical relapses or treatment failure due to nonradical surgeries or spillage of parasite material.
• **Post-Treatment Follow-Up**: Post-treatment follow-up of CE patients is necessary to detect newly growing or relapsing cysts. Serology has been used for post-operative control, but the long persistence of antibodies makes it challenging to diagnose relapses. There's a need for improved immunodiagnostic tools to meet clinical requirements.
• **Study Aim and Method**: This study aimed to examine the pattern of antigenic bands essential for CE serologic diagnosis using immunoblotting analysis and determine the post-operative evolution of patients. Blood samples were collected from 50 CE patients, 40 non-CE patients, and 20 healthy controls. All CE patients received antihelminthic treatment and underwent surgical procedures.
• **Findings**: The study found multiple immunoreactive bands ranging from 18-239 kDa in CE patients' sera. The major immunoreactive bands were 24, 39, 46, 52, 57, 60-61, and 63 kDa.

* Traditional methods like immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) have limitations in detecting HCV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues.
* The study established an ISH technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and a biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAII) for detecting HCV-RNA in FFPE liver tissues.
* The technique was validated using humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice and needle biopsy liver specimens from chronic hepatitis C patients.
* The LNA probe targeted the highly conserved 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the HCV genome, and the technique demonstrated clear cytoplasmic reactivity in infected hepatocytes.
* The LNA-based ISH detected HCV-RNA in 9 out of 11 chronic hepatitis C lesions, including three with diffuse cytoplasmic positivity and six with focal or partial positivity.
* HCV-RNA was undetectable in non-viral liver disorders, HBV-infected livers, and HCV-related HCC, except for one HCC case with partial positivity.

* Nonsurgical endodontic retreatment is the primary choice to eliminate or reduce microbial content from endodontically failed teeth.
* Well-compacted root fillings resist removal, restricting access to the apical foramen and impairing disinfection and complete reshaping.
* Various instruments like hand files, engine-driven rotary retreatment files, ultrasonic tips, and heat-carrying instruments are used for retreatment.
* Complete removal of root canal fillings is challenging, even with rotary files, leading to residual filling materials.
* Extruded irritants during retreatment can cause postoperative inflammation, flare-ups, and impaired healing.
* All instrumentation techniques exhibit some degree of apical extrusion of debris, varying with different techniques.
* The study evaluated the extrusion of debris after using ProTaper Universal rotary files (PTR) and different finishing files.
* ProTaper Next (PTN), WaveOne (WO), and Self-Adjusting File (SAF) were used as supplementary files to remove residual root canal fillings.
* The null hypothesis was that these three files would exhibit no significant differences in the amount of debris extruded.

• **TAD Function and Stability**: TADs, ranging from 100 kb to 1 Mb in size, exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions, and are stable across different species, cell types, and conditions. They are associated with replication timing, histone modifications, and gene expression.
• **TAD Boundaries**: TAD boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions, with strong boundaries limiting interactions between adjacent TADs. They are associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and replication timing domains in human cells, and combinatorial binding of insulators in Drosophila.
• **Brg1 and TAD Boundaries**: The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex's major ATPase subunit, Brg1, contributes to TAD boundary strength. Brg1 knockdown in mammary epithelial cells results in differential expression of genes related to extracellular matrix and lipid synthesis, as well as long non-coding RNAs involved in genome organization.
• **Brg1 Localization and Binding**: Brg1 primarily binds at genic regions, with intergenic peaks including super-enhancers. Comparison of Hi-C datasets reveals that more than 10% of TAD boundaries are unique to control or Brg1 knockdown cells, suggesting Brg1's role in TAD boundary integrity.
• **Brg1 Knockdown Effects**: Brg1 knockdown reduces the strength of TAD boundaries, increasing inter-TAD genomic interactions. Boundaries bound by Brg1 are stronger than those lacking Brg1 localization, indicating Brg1's role in regulating nucleosome occupancy and CTCF localization at TAD boundaries.
• **Brg1, CTCF, and Topoisomerases**: Brg1 interacts with CTCF and topoisomerases, promoting proper nucleosome occupancy and uncoiling of DNA at TAD boundaries. Loss or knockdown of Brg1 may reduce nucleosome occupancy at CTCF sites, altering boundary strength and chromatin stiffness. This interplay between Brg1, CTCF, and topoisomerases is crucial for TAD organization and function.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28, 'symbol': '•'}"

* **UVR Hazard in Arc Welding**: The light emitted during arc welding contains intense ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which can cause acute (e.g., keratoconjunctivitis, erythema) and delayed (e.g., cataracts, skin cancer) health effects. Many workers, including those not directly involved in welding, are exposed to UVR in welding workplaces.
* **Factors Affecting UVR Hazard**: The hazard of UVR in arc welding increases with higher welding currents and is influenced by the type of shielding gas and welding current (pulsed vs. non-pulsed). It is more hazardous at higher welding currents, with 80% Ar + 20% CO2 shielding gas being more hazardous than 100% CO2 at higher currents. Pulsed welding currents are more hazardous than non-pulsed currents.
* **Metal Transfer Mode and UVR Hazard**: The hazard of UVR also depends on the metal transfer mode. Spray transfer, which occurs at higher welding currents, is the most hazardous mode. Welding operators and supervisors should recognize these hazards and take adequate protective measures, especially when welding with pulsed current or under spray transfer conditions.

These microorganisms can survive longer and more efficiently utilize their reserve material when nutrient availability is poor.
• **PHA Types and Production**: PHAs are commonly divided into two groups based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units: short-chain-length (SCL) PHAs and medium-chain-length (MCL) PHAs. The former consists of monomers with 3-5 carbon atoms, while the latter consists of monomers with 6-14 carbon atoms. P(3HB) is highly crystalline, whereas MCL-PHAs are elastic with low melting temperatures.
• **PHA Synthases and Classification**: The enzyme responsible for PHA synthesis, called PHA synthase, is classified into four classes based on its substrate specificities and subunits organization. Classes I, III, and IV prefer to synthesize SCL-PHA, while class II is responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis. Class I PHA synthases consist of a single subunit, while classes III and IV consist of two different types of subunits.

Urinary tract obstruction, characterized by tubular atrophy or dilation, cell death, and increased matrix deposition, can occur due to various causes like benign prostatic hyperplasia, renal calculi, or neoplasms. The hydrostatic pressure from blockage initiates renal injuries, characterized by tubular changes, inflammatory infiltration, and progressive fibrosis. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in rats is an experimental model that mimics obstructive nephropathy.

It plays roles in ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, antioxidant properties, and cell cycle regulation. Paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, has been shown to ameliorate fibrosis in UUO rat kidney models and other kidney diseases. Both taurine and paclitaxel were studied for their potential to attenuate tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preserve normal renal histology in a rat model of UUO.

• **Study Design and Methods**: The study randomly divided rats into four groups: sham-operated, UUO, UUO + taxol, and UUO + taurine. After 28 days, the rats' kidneys were removed, and stereological surveys were conducted to investigate structural changes. Parameters measured included the volume of cortex, medulla, glomeruli, tubules, vessels, and fibrous tissue. Statistical comparisons were made using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests.

The protective effects of taxol and taurine may be due to their ability to modulate transforming growth factor-β signaling, prevent cell death and inflammation, and reduce oxidative stress.

* Chronic exposure to opioid drugs, including methadone, leads to impaired cognitive abilities in patients subjected to methadone maintenance programs.
* Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) are involved in controlling various cellular and physiological processes, including neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity.
* However, a dramatic increase in [Ca]cyt can switch the physiological calcium signal to a death signal, leading to delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) and ultimately cell death.
* In the present study, the mechanisms involved in methadone-induced rises in [Ca]cyt in SH-SY5Y cells were investigated.
* Methadone induced a rise in [Ca]cyt in most SH-SY5Y cells, with four different types of calcium recordings observed, suggesting that methadone may induce short or delayed calcium deregulation in these cells.

* Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa, with a prevalence of about 1-2% and a tendency to persist once established.
* The lesions are characterized by a dense subepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and degeneration of basal keratinocytes, with the lymphocytic infiltrate predominantly consisting of T cells.
* The etiology of OLP remains unclear, but immune dysregulation, especially T-cell-mediated immune response and abnormal production of inflammatory molecules, is thought to play a role in its pathogenesis.
* The interleukin-23 (IL-23)/interleukin-17 (IL-17) axis, a proinflammatory signaling pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, including OLP.
* The study found overexpression of IL-23 and IL-17 in OLP lesions, with a positive correlation between their expressions in reticular OLP lesions, suggesting a potential regulatory role of IL-23 in IL-17 expression in the early stage of OLP.
* IL-23 stimulation increased the percentage of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells (Th17) and IL-17 production in CD4+ T cells from OLP patients, indicating that IL-23 may contribute to the accumulation of Th17 cells and increased IL-17 levels in OLP lesions.
* IL-17 selectively regulated the expressions of certain inflammatory mediators, including human beta-defensins (HBD)-2 and -3, IL-8, CCL-20, and TNF-α, in oral keratinocytes, suggesting a unique regulatory role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the local environment of OLP lesions.
