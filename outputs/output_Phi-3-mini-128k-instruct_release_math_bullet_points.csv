<step-2>. Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

<step-3>. Since Wendi feeds each chicken three cups of feed in each meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for all the chickens in one meal is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

<step-4>. Now, we know that Wendi has already given 40 cups of feed to her chickens in the morning and afternoon. To find out how many cups of feed she needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount of feed needed for all the chickens in one meal.

<step-5>. The amount of feed needed for all the chickens in one meal is 60 cups, and the amount of feed already given is 40 cups. So, the amount of feed needed in the final meal is 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

- John has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.
- To find the total amount, we multiply the number of lego sets by the price per set: 13 * $15 = $195.

**Step 2**: Calculate the total cost of the video games John buys.

- John buys 8 video games for $20 each.
- To find the total cost, we multiply the number of video games by the price per game: 8 * $20 = $160.

**Step 3**: Calculate the amount of money John has left after buying the video games.

- John had $195 from selling his lego sets.
- He spent $160 on video games.
- To find the remaining amount, we subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount: $195 - $160 = $35.

**Step 4**: Verify the remaining amount with the given information.

- The problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games.
- However, our calculation shows that he has $35 left.
- This discrepancy suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or our calculations.

**Step 5**: Re-evaluate the problem statement and calculations.

- Upon re-evaluation, we realize that the problem statement might have a typo or error.
- If John has $5 left after buying the video games, then the total cost of the video games should be $195 - $5 = $190.

**Step 6**: Recalculate the total cost of the video games based on the corrected information.

- With the corrected total cost of video games being $190, we can now find the correct number of video games John bought.
- To find the number of video games, we divide the total cost by the price per game: $190 / $20 = 9.5.
- Since John cannot buy half a video game, we can assume that he bought 9 video games and the remaining $10 is due to a discount or other factors not mentioned in the problem statement.

**Step 7**: Confirm that John still has all his lego sets.

- The problem statement does not mention John selling any of his lego sets.
- Therefore, we can conclude that John still has all 13 lego sets.

**Step 8**: Final result

- John still has 13 lego sets.

The remaining calories that can be consumed are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.
</step-4>
<step-5>
Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories.

64," <step-1>. To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).

<step-2>. Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank and needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again.

<step-3>. To calculate her car's fuel efficiency, we divide the number of miles traveled by the number of gallons used: 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg.

<step-4>. Sophia's car has a 12-gallon tank, so we can now calculate how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas by multiplying her fuel efficiency by the tank size: 25 mpg * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per flower for each package

- For the package of 3 flowers at $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (rounded to four decimal places).
- For the package of 2 flowers at $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50.

### Step 2: Determine the better price per flower

- Comparing the cost per flower for each package, we see that the package of 2 flowers at $0.50 per flower is the better price.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using the better price

- Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers.
- Using the better price of $0.50 per flower, the total cost for 18 flowers is 18 * $0.50 = $9.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using the other price

- If Vincent were to buy the flowers using the package of 3 flowers at $2.50, he would need to buy 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages would be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

### Step 5: Calculate the savings

- The savings by buying 18 flowers at the better price is the difference between the total cost using the other price and the total cost using the better price.
- Savings = $15 - $9 = $6.

### The answer is: Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints1MathFormat'}

# Calculating the Inner Volume of a Box with Varying Wall Thicknesses

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
To calculate the inner volume of a box, you need to know the outer dimensions of the box and the thickness of its walls. The inner volume is the space available inside the box, excluding the thickness of the walls.

### Step 2: Calculate the Inner Dimensions
Subtract twice the wall thickness from each of the outer dimensions to get the inner dimensions. This accounts for the thickness on both sides of each dimension.

### Step 3: Calculate the Inner Volume
Multiply the inner length, width, and height to get the inner volume of the box.

## Detailed Example

### Step 1: Given Dimensions
Outer dimensions: 10 inches (length) x 8 inches (width) x 6 inches (height)
Wall thickness: 1.5 inches

### Step 2: Calculate Inner Dimensions
Inner length: 10 inches - 2 * 1.5 inches = 7 inches
Inner width: 8 inches - 2 * 1.5 inches = 5 inches
Inner height: 6 inches - 2 * 1.5 inches = 3 inches

### Step 3: Calculate Inner Volume
Inner volume: 7 inches * 5 inches * 3 inches = 105 cubic inches

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not accounting for wall thickness on both sides**: Remember to subtract twice the wall thickness from each dimension.
- **Miscalculating the inner dimensions**: Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
- **Forgetting to multiply the inner dimensions**: The inner volume is found by multiplying the inner length, width, and height.

## Summary of Key Points

- To calculate the inner volume of a box, subtract twice the wall thickness from each outer dimension to get the inner dimensions.
- Multiply the inner length, width, and height to find the inner volume.
- Common mistakes include not accounting for wall thickness on both sides, miscalculating the inner dimensions, and forgetting to multiply the inner dimensions.

# Calculating the Inner Volume of a Box with Varying Wall Thicknesses

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
To calculate the inner volume of a box, you need to know the outer dimensions of the box and the thickness of its walls. The inner volume is the space available inside the box, excluding the thickness of the walls.

### Step 2: Calculate the Inner Dimensions
Subtract twice the wall thickness from each of the outer dimensions to get the inner dimensions. This accounts for the thickness on both sides of each dimension.

### Step 3: Calculate the Inner Volume
Multiply the inner length, width, and height to get the inner volume of the box.

## Detailed Example

### Step 1: Given Dimensions
Outer dimensions: 10 inches (length) x 8 inches (width) x 6 inches (height)
Wall thickness: 1.5 inches

### Step 2: Calculate Inner Dimensions
Inner length: 10 inches - 2 * 1.5 inches = 7 inches
Inner width: 8 inches - 2 * 1.5 inches = 5 inches
Inner height: 6 inches - 2 * 1.5 inches = 3 inches

### Step 3: Calculate Inner Volume
Inner volume: 7 inches * 5 inches * 3 inches = 105 cubic inches

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not accounting for wall thickness on both sides**: Remember to subtract twice the wall thickness from each dimension.
- **Miscalculating the inner dimensions**: Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
- **Forgetting to multiply the inner dimensions**: The inner volume is found by multiplying the inner length, width, and height.

## Summary of Key Points

- To calculate the inner volume of a box, subtract twice the wall thickness from each outer dimension to get the inner dimensions.
- Multiply the inner length, width, and height to find the inner volume.
- Common mistakes include not accounting for wall thickness on both sides, miscalculating the inner dimensions, and forgetting to multiply the inner dimensions.

- First, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching 1-hour episodes. He watched 1-hour episodes on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, which totals to 4 hours.
- Next, we know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Subtracting the 4 hours spent on 1-hour episodes, we have 3 hours left for 30-minute episodes.
- We also know that Frankie watched a 30-minute show on Wednesday and Thursday. Since each show is 30 minutes, that's a total of 1 hour spent on 30-minute episodes.
- Subtracting the 1 hour spent on 30-minute episodes from the remaining 3 hours, we have 2 hours left for 30-minute episodes.
- Since each 30-minute episode is half an hour, we can divide the remaining 2 hours by 0.5 to find the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.
- Therefore, Frankie watched 4 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

Final result: Frankie watched 4 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and the rate at which her boat was taking on water.
</step-1>
<step-2>
Julia rowed for 64 seconds to reach the shore, and her boat took on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed.
</step-2>
<step-3>
First, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed. Since she rowed for 64 seconds and it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of 16-second intervals by 20 feet.
</step-3>
<step-4>
There are 64/16 = 4 intervals of 16 seconds in 64 seconds.
</step-4>
<step-5>
So, the total distance Julia rowed is 4 * 20 = 80 feet.
</step-5>
<step-6>
Now, we need to determine the rate at which the boat was taking on water. The boat took on two liters of water for every ten feet Julia rowed.
</step-6>
<step-7>
To find the rate, we can divide the amount of water taken on by the distance rowed. In this case, the rate is 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot.
</step-7>
<step-8>
Finally, we can calculate the total amount of water the boat took on by multiplying the rate by the total distance rowed.
</step-8>
<step-9>
The total amount of water taken on is 0.2 liters per foot * 80 feet = 16 liters.

- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

**Step 2**: Calculate the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

- Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we divide the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6.
- 1800 photographs / 6 = 300 photographs.
- Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 300 photographs.

**Step 3**: Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

- The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
- To find the number of birds, we divide the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.
- 300 photographs / 50 = 6 birds.
- There are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

**Step 4**: Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

- Since the question asks for the number of ducks, and we know there are 6 birds in the photograph, we can assume that the number of ducks is the same as the number of birds.

- The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- Total time spent by doctors on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

### Step 2: Convert the total time spent by doctors into hours
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Total time spent by doctors on patients per day in hours = 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of doctors' time per day
- The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
- Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from patients per day
- The hospital charges patients $200 an hour.
- Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * ($200/hour / 60 minutes/hour) = $40,000

### Step 5: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

188," <step-1>. To find the number of bags sold, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost.
<step-2>. The total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags sold by the selling price per bag, which is $30.
<step-3>. The total cost can be calculated by adding the cost of purchasing the bags and the transportation cost per bag. The cost of purchasing the bags is $20 per bag, and the transportation cost is $2 per bag.
<step-4>. The profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. We know that the profit is $400.
<step-5>. We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the total revenue, total cost, and profit: Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit.
<step-6>. Substituting the values we know, we get: (Number of Bags Sold * $30) - (Number of Bags Sold * ($20 + $2)) = $400.
<step-7>. Simplifying the equation, we get: (Number of Bags Sold * $30) - (Number of Bags Sold * $22) = $400.
<step-8>. Further simplifying, we get: Number of Bags Sold * ($30 - $22) = $400.
<step-9>. Solving for the number of bags sold, we get: Number of Bags Sold = $400 / ($30 - $22).

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. Therefore, the net number of trees planted each year is:

10 trees planted - 2 trees chopped down = 8 trees net planted per year

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees planted after 10 years
After 10 years, Tom will have planted:

8 trees net planted per year * 10 years = 80 trees

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees before considering the death rate
Tom starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, he will have planted 80 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees before considering the death rate is:

50 initial trees + 80 trees planted = 130 trees

### Step 4: Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years
After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. Therefore, the number of trees that die is:

30% of 130 trees = 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees

### Step 5: Calculate the final number of trees

- We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Therefore, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is `3r` and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is `5w`.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through each exit.
</step-1>

<step-2>
First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we multiply the total number of students by 30%:

1000 * 0.30 = 300 students
</step-2>

<step-3>
Next, we calculate the number of students who remained in the hall after exit A. We subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students:

1000 - 300 = 700 students
</step-3>

<step-4>
Now, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we multiply the number of remaining students by 3/5:

700 * (3/5) = 420 students
</step-4>

<step-5>
Finally, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit C. We subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the number of remaining students:

700 - 420 = 280 students

First, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's number of candies by 2 to find Robert's number of candies.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

### Step 2
Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. James has 6 more candies than Robert.

James's candies = Robert's candies + 6
James's candies = 27 + 6
James's candies = 33

### Step 3
Finally, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James.

Difference in candies = John's candies - James's candies
Difference in candies = 54 - 33

Now that we know there are 6,200 pennies in the stack, we need to convert this amount to dollars. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

<step-2>
Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

<step-3>
Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

<step-4>
Next, we need to find the monthly salary of a senior programmer. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

Monthly salary of a senior programmer = Monthly salary of a junior programmer + $400
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

<step-5>
Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the junior programmers per month:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of a junior programmer
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

<step-6>
Similarly, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the senior programmers per month:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of a senior programmer
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

<step-7>
Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total amount paid to junior and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

### Step 2
We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:
C + D = 180

### Step 3
We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can write the equation:
2C + D = 304

### Step 4
Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

### Step 5
From the first equation, we can express C in terms of D:
C = 180 - D

### Step 6
Now we substitute this expression for C into the second equation:
2(180 - D) + D = 304

### Step 7
Simplify the equation:
360 - 2D + D = 304

### Step 8
Combine like terms:
-D = -56

### Step 9
Solve for D:
D = 56

### Step 10

<step-3>
Next, let's calculate the total capacity of the 6 minibusses. Each minibus can hold 30 employees, so the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and wants to have $50 in spending cash. Therefore, he needs to earn $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his Pokemon cards.

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of cards Kenny needs to sell to earn $50.

Since Kenny sells each card for $1.5, he needs to sell $50 / $1.5 = 33.33 cards. Since he can't sell a fraction of a card, he needs to sell 34 cards to earn at least $50.

**Step 3:** Determine the fraction of cards Kenny keeps for himself.

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards for himself.

**Step 4:** Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with.

Let x be the total number of cards Kenny started with. Since he keeps 1/3 of them, he sells 2/3 of them. We know that 2/3 of x is equal to 34 cards (from Step 2). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x = 34

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 34 * (3/2)

### Step 2: Convert George's total spending to cents
George spent $5, which is equivalent to:

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining money after buying chips
Subtract the total cost of the chips from George's total spending to find the remaining money:

500 cents - 120 cents = 380 cents

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining money after buying chips and candy bars
George had 1% of his money left after buying chips and candy bars. To find the remaining money, we need to calculate 1% of his total spending:

1% of 500 cents = 0.01 * 500 cents = 5 cents

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the candy bars
Subtract the remaining money after buying chips and candy bars from the remaining money after buying chips to find the total cost of the candy bars:

### Step 6: Calculate the number of candy bars bought
Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars bought by dividing the total cost of the candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

<step-2>. Rory and her mom each have a piece of the cake, which means 2 pieces are taken from the total.
<step-3>. To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the 2 pieces from the total weight of the cake.
<step-4>. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces.
<step-5>. The weight of the 2 pieces taken by Rory and her mom is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 5 ounces.

- First, we need to find the width of the room in feet. Since the area of the room is given in square feet and the length is given in yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

**Step 2**
- Now that we have the length and the area of the room, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length. The width of the room in feet is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

**Step 3**
- To find the perimeter of the room, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. Since the room is rectangular, opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, the perimeter is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

442," ### Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase from baking
- Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and every hour the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees.
- Therefore, the total temperature increase from baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

### Step 2: Calculate the temperature decrease from opening the window
- Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
- Therefore, the total temperature decrease from opening the window is (30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees.

### Step 3: Calculate the final temperature
- The house's initial temperature is 40 degrees.
- The temperature increase from baking is 15 degrees, so the new temperature is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
- The temperature decrease from opening the window is 6 degrees, so the final temperature is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

- First, we need to determine the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH.

**Step 2**
- To do this, we convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60. So, 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours.

**Step 3**
- Next, we calculate the distance by multiplying the speed (32MPH) by the time (0.5 hours). This gives us a distance of 16 miles.

**Step 4**
- Now, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, we multiply the distance (16 miles) by 1/2. This gives us 8 bails of hay.

**Step 5**
- We then calculate the cost of the hay by multiplying the number of bails (8) by the cost per bail ($3). This gives us a total cost of $24.

**Step 6**
- Finally, we calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay. He has six 5 dollar bills, which equals $30. We subtract the cost of the hay ($24) from the total amount he has ($30). This gives us a change of $6.

- Jenna starts with 8 sapphires.
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- So, the total value of the sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna traded
- Jenna traded 3 sapphires.
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- So, the total value of the sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400.

- Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.
- The volume of one raised bed is calculated by multiplying the width, length, and height: 2 ft * 8 ft * 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all raised beds
- Bob has 10 raised beds.
- The total volume of soil needed is calculated by multiplying the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds: 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of potting soil needed
- Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
- The number of bags needed is calculated by dividing the total volume of soil needed by the volume of one bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil
- Each bag of potting soil costs $12.
- The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of bags needed by the cost per bag: 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

- Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat as `x`.

### Step 2
- According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as: `cookies = (1/2) * x + 2`.

### Step 3
- We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation: `5 = (1/2) * x + 2`.

### Step 4
- To solve for `x`, we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: `5 - 2 = (1/2) * x`.

### Step 5
- Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get: `3 = (1/2) * x`.

### Step 6
- To isolate `x`, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2: `2 * 3 = x`.

### Step 7
- Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get: `x = 6`.

### Step 8
- Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total.

<step-2>. Since each pack costs $4.00 and there are 4 razors in each pack, the cost of one razor is $4.00 / 4 = $1.00.
<step-3>. Therefore, the cost of 2 packs of razors is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.
<step-4>. Next, we need to apply the buy one get one free discount. Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she will get 2 * 4 = 8 razors for free.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as L and the cost of the house as H.

### Step 2
According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot. So, we can write this relationship as:
H = 3L

### Step 3
We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write this relationship as:
H + L = $120,000

### Step 4
Now, we can substitute the value of H from Step 2 into the equation in Step 3:
3L + L = $120,000

### Step 5
Combine the L terms:
4L = $120,000

### Step 6
To find the cost of the lot (L), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
L = $120,000 / 4
L = $30,000

### Step 7
Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting the value of L into the equation in Step 2:
H = 3L
H = 3 * $30,000
H = $90,000

### Step 2
- According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets 4B dollars.

### Step 3
- The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars.

### Step 4
- We can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money: B (Brad's amount) + 4B (Jeff's amount) = 100 dollars.

### Step 5
- Simplifying the equation, we get 5B = 100 dollars.

### Step 6
- To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: B = 100 / 5 = 20 dollars.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

### Step 2
According to the note, the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This can be represented as:
R = B - 0.01B
R = 0.99B

### Step 3
The note also states that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This can be represented as:
G = B + 0.01B
G = 1.01B

### Step 4
We know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. Therefore, we can write the following equation:
B + R + G = 4500

### Step 5
Substitute the expressions for R and G from Steps 2 and 3 into the equation from Step 4:
B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

### Step 6
Combine the terms with B:
2.99B = 4500

### Step 7
Solve for B:
B = 4500 / 2.99
B ≈ 1503.35

Since we cannot have a fraction of a jelly bean, we round B to the nearest whole number:
B ≈ 1503

### Step 8
Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans using the expressions from Steps 2 and 3:
R = 0.99B ≈ 0.99 * 1503 ≈ 1487.97 ≈ 1488 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
G = 1.01B ≈ 1.01 * 1503 ≈ 1518.03 ≈ 1518 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

### Step 9
To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

Since a cup of mushrooms (100 grams) has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms by setting up a proportion:
</step-2>
<step-3>
(3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms) = (x grams of protein / 200 grams of mushrooms)

- The plane cost James $150,000.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the hanger for the first year
- James pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger.
- In a year, he will pay $5000 * 12 = $60,000 for the hanger.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of fuel for the first year
- James spends twice as much as the hanger cost on fuel per month.
- So, he spends $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel per month.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year
- The total cost includes the cost of the plane, the hanger, and the fuel.

<step-4>. The first equation represents the total number of animal heads: S + G = 20
<step-5>. The second equation represents the total number of animal legs: 4S + 2G = 70

<step-5>. The percentage of blue spools is (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

<step-6>. Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

749," ### Step 1
- Identify the initial number of groups required for the activity, which is 12 groups.

### Step 2
- Determine the total number of students, which is 54 students.

### Step 3
- Calculate the number of students per group by dividing the total number of students by the initial number of groups: 54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group.

### Step 4
- Since it's not possible to have half a student in a group, round up the number of students per group to the nearest whole number, which is 5 students per group.

### Step 5
- Recalculate the number of groups needed with the new group size of 5 students per group: 54 students / 5 students per group = 10.8 groups.

### Step 6
- Round up the number of groups to the nearest whole number, which is 11 groups.

### Step 7
- Calculate the additional number of groups needed by subtracting the initial number of groups from the recalculated number of groups: 11 groups - 12 groups = -1 group.

### Step 8
- Since the result is negative, it means that no additional groups are needed. In fact, fewer groups are needed than initially required.

### Step 9

<step-2>. The monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total annual cost is $100 * 12 = $1200.

<step-3>. Jenna has 4 roommates, so there are a total of 5 people sharing the electricity bill.

<step-4>. To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to divide the total annual cost by the number of people sharing the bill.

<step-5>. The total annual cost is $1200, and there are 5 people sharing the bill, so each person will pay $1200 / 5 = $240 per year.

<step-2>. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x.

<step-3>. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be represented as 2x.

<step-4>. The total number of council members is 33.

<step-5>. The sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation should equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33.

- Since twice as many students need size small as extra-small, we multiply the number of extra-small shirts (11) by 2.
- **Result**: 22 students need size small shirts.

**Step 2**: Calculate the number of students needing size medium shirts.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so we subtract 4 from the number of size small shirts (22).
- **Result**: 18 students need size medium shirts.

**Step 3**: Find out the number of students needing size large shirts.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so we divide the number of size medium shirts (18) by 2.
- **Result**: 9 students need size large shirts.

**Step 4**: Calculate the number of students needing size extra-large shirts.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so we add 6 to the number of size large shirts (9).
- **Result**: 15 students need size extra-large shirts.

**Step 5**: Add up the total number of shirts ordered.
- We add the number of shirts for each size: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large).

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x.

### Step 2
According to the problem, the second house needs half the number of cases as the first house. So, the second house needs x/2 cases.

### Step 3
The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house. So, the third house needs 2x cases.

### Step 4
The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

x + x/2 + 2x = 250

### Step 5
To solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for the equation. The common denominator for x, x/2, and 2x is 2. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

2x/2 + x/2 + 4x/2 = 250

### Step 6
Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

(2x + x + 4x) / 2 = 250

7x / 2 = 250

### Step 7
Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 7x:

7x = 500

### Step 8
Divide both sides of the equation by 7 to solve for x:

x = 500 / 7

x ≈ 71.43

### Step 9
Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:

2x = 2 * 71.43 ≈ 142.86

To find the total distance of the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking.
</step-1>
<step-2>
First, let's calculate the distance covered by driving. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
</step-2>
<step-3>
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered by driving = 50 miles/hour x 6 hours = 300 miles
</step-3>
<step-4>
Next, let's calculate the average speed of hiking. The Llesis family hiked at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
</step-4>
<step-5>
Half of the driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
Average hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour
</step-5>
<step-6>
Now, let's calculate the distance covered by hiking. The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour.
</step-6>
<step-7>
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance covered by hiking = 20 miles/hour x 1.5 hours = 30 miles
</step-7>
<step-8>
Finally, let's calculate the total distance of the vacation spot by adding the distance covered by driving and hiking.

804," <step-1>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

<step-2>First, let's calculate the distance the first car travels in 2 hours. Since the first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

So, the distance the first car travels in 2 hours is:

Distance_1 = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

<step-3>Next, let's calculate the distance the second car travels in 2 hours. Since the second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour, we can use the same formula:

Distance_2 = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

<step-4>Now, we can find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:

Difference = Distance_2 - Distance_1

Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Let's denote the number of books Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have as S, A, and F respectively.

### Step 2
From the problem, we know that:
- S + A + F = 85 (total number of books)
- S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
- A = F + 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

### Step 3
We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:
(A + 25) + A + (A - 12) = 85

### Step 4
Simplify the equation:
3A + 13 = 85

### Step 5
Subtract 13 from both sides:
3A = 72

### Step 6
Divide both sides by 3:
A = 24

### Step 7
Now that we know Anne has 24 books, we can find out how many books Sofie and Fawn have:

- Identify the given information:
  - A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.
  - A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
  - A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

### Step 2
- Determine the speed of a thingamabob:
  - Since a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it is eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing 121 by 11.

### Step 3
- Calculate the speed of a thingamabob:
  - 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.

### Step 4
- Determine the speed of a whirligig:
  - Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

### Step 5
- Calculate the speed of a whirligig:

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha ended up with 7 notebooks, we can calculate Joseph's initial number of notebooks by dividing Martha's final count by 3.

<step-2>
Martha's final count of notebooks is 7. Therefore, Joseph's initial count of notebooks is 7 / 3 = 2.33. However, since the number of notebooks must be a whole number, we can round this down to 2 notebooks.

<step-3>
Now that we know Joseph had 2 notebooks initially, we can determine how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Since Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2, the difference is 7 - 2 = 5 notebooks.

<step-4>
Therefore, Martha now has 5 more notebooks than Joseph.

To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to find out how many miles Anis rowed and then add it to the miles rowed by Dijana.
</step-1>

<step-2>
We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles rowed by Anis as follows:

Additional miles rowed by Anis = 1/5 * 50 miles = 10 miles
</step-2>

<step-3>
Now, we can calculate the total miles rowed by Anis by adding the additional miles to the miles rowed by Dijana:

Total miles rowed by Anis = 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles
</step-3>

<step-4>
Finally, we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances:

Total distance rowed = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles
</step-4>

<step-5>
Therefore, the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles.

<step-3>. Now, we can calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in the total time Vince spent stapling reports. We do this by dividing the total time in minutes by the time it takes Vince to staple 30 reports (15 minutes). So, 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals.

<step-4>. Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can find the total number of reports he stapled by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval. So, 60 intervals * 30 reports = 1800 reports.

<step-5>. Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

- The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied.
- Therefore, the initial number of occupied beds is 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds.

**Step 2:** Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds.

- The initial number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the number of occupied beds.
- Therefore, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.

- There are 7 days in a week, so there are 2 * 7 = 14 days in 2 weeks.
- Each day, 50 patients are admitted, so the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks is 14 * 50 = 700 patients.

**Step 4:** Calculate the final number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

- The final number of occupied beds is the initial number of occupied beds plus the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.
- Therefore, the final number of occupied beds is 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

**Step 5:** Calculate the final number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

- The final number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the final number of occupied beds.
- Therefore, the final number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

**Step 2**: From the problem, we know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write this as A = S + 5.

**Step 3**: We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write this as S = 4D - 13.

**Step 4**: We know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write this as A + S + D = 339.

**Step 5**: Now we have a system of three equations:

1. A = S + 5
2. S = 4D - 13
3. A + S + D = 339

**Step 6**: We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for D:

(S + 5) + S + D = 339
2S + D + 5 = 339
2(4D - 13) + D + 5 = 339
8D - 26 + D + 5 = 339
9D - 21 = 339
9D = 360
D = 40

**Step 7**: Now that we know D, we can find S using the second equation:

S = 4D - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members in Mr. Roper's class.

<step-2>
First, let's find out how many football players there are. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students (30) by 20% (or 0.20):

30 * 0.20 = 6

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

<step-3>
Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. We can do this by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students:

30 - 6 = 24

So, there are 24 students who are not football players.

<step-4>
Now, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are in these groups, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of non-football players (24) by 25% (or 0.25):

24 * 0.25 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members in the class.

<step-5>
Finally, to find out how many students are leaving early, we need to add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members:

- The flower bed is 111 feet long. To convert this to inches, we multiply by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
- 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

### Step 2: Calculate the space needed for each plant
- Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space, which is equivalent to 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.
- Additionally, each plant grows 12 inches wide.
- Therefore, the total space needed for each plant is 18 inches (space between plants) + 12 inches (plant width) = 30 inches.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Pat can fit in the flower bed
- To find out how many plants Pat can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed in inches by the space needed for each plant.
- 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants
- Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- To fill the flower bed, she needs 44 plants in total.
- Therefore, she needs 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 additional plants.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the additional plants
- Each flowering plant costs $6.
- Pat needs 27 additional plants.
- Therefore, the total cost of the additional plants is 27 plants * $6/plant = $162.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.

### Step 2
His brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, which means his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

### Step 3
To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week.

### Step 4
There are 7 days in a week.

### Step 5
So, Edgar's brother eats 9 * 7 = 63 pretzels in a week.

### Step 3
The third person took twice what the second person took. Therefore, the third person took 2 * (x + $80).

### Step 4
The total amount of money shared by the three people is $1920. So, we can write the equation:

To find the total number of hours each painter put in, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.
</step-1>

<step-2>
First, we need to find the total number of days the team worked. Since they worked for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Total days worked = 21 days * (3/8) = 8.625 days
</step-2>

<step-3>
Next, we need to convert the total number of days worked into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total number of hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 8.625 days * 24 hours/day = 207 hours
</step-3>

<step-4>
Now that we have the total number of hours worked by the team, we can divide it by the number of painters to find the number of hours each painter put in:

Hours per painter = Total hours worked / Number of painters = 207 hours / 4 painters = 51.75 hours

1129," **Step 1**: Determine the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can represent the number of eggs they each painted as x. Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 2x.

**Step 2**: Determine the number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's represent the number of eggs painted by Sarah as y. Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs. The total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is y + (y + 12) = 30.

**Step 3**: Solve for y (the number of eggs painted by Sarah).

Combining the terms in the equation from Step 2, we get 2y + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2y = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that y = 9. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.

**Step 4**: Determine the number of eggs painted by Camden.

Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

**Step 5**: Determine the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. Since we already know the number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah (9 and 21, respectively), we can find the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline by subtracting the sum of Camden and Sarah's eggs from the total: 56 - (9 + 21) = 56 - 30 = 26.

**Step 6**: Determine the number of eggs painted by Arnold.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs painted by them (26) by 2 to find the number of eggs painted by Arnold: 26 / 2 = 13.

**Step 7**: Calculate the difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold.

To find the difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs painted by Arnold from the number of eggs painted by Camden: 21 - 13 = 8.

**Final result:** Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints11MathFormat'}
1130," <step-1>. Nik has 200 crayons.
<step-2>. He wants to separate them into groups of 8.
<step-3>. To find out how many groups he will have, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per group: 200 / 8 = 25 groups.
<step-4>. Each group of crayons will be put into a box.
<step-5>. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes will be: 25 groups * 8 ounces/group = 200 ounces.
<step-6>. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons will be: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.
<step-7>. To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes: 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.
<step-8>. To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by the conversion factor of 16 ounces per pound: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

- Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.

### Step 2
- Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.

### Step 3
- Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

### Step 4
- Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute.

### Step 5
- Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

### Step 6
- We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

### Step 7
- In 40 minutes, Grandma covers 2 miles on the beach.

### Step 8
- So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

### Step 9
- Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

### Step 10
- To cover 1 mile on the sidewalk, Grandma takes 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

### Step 11
- In total, Grandma takes 40 minutes on the beach + 10 minutes on the sidewalk = 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

1153," **Step 1**: Determine the number of seashells Carlos collected.

- Since Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, we can represent Carlos's seashells as x.
- Therefore, Jim's seashells can be represented as x + 5.
- We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation x + 5 = 27.

**Step 2**: Solve for x (Carlos's seashells).

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 5.
- Simplify: x = 22.
- Carlos collected 22 seashells.

**Step 3**: Determine the number of seashells Carrey collected.

- We know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so we can represent Carrey's seashells as y.
- Therefore, Carlos's seashells can be represented as 2y.
- We know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can set up the equation 2y = 22.

**Step 4**: Solve for y (Carrey's seashells).

- Divide both sides of the equation by 2: y = 22 / 2.
- Simplify: y = 11.
- Carrey collected 11 seashells.

**Step 5**: Calculate the total number of seashells collected.

- Add the number of seashells collected by each person: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60.
- The total number of seashells collected is 60.

**Step 6**: Divide the total number of seashells equally between the three people.

- Divide the total number of seashells by the number of people: 60 / 3 = 20.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20.

### Step 2
He sells the device for twice the original price, which is $20 * 2 = $40.

### Step 3
He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the total cost for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.

### Step 4
He sold all 2 devices from Monday for $40 each, earning a total of 2 * $40 = $80.

### Step 5
He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total cost for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.

### Step 6
He sold all 4 devices from Tuesday for $40 each, earning a total of 4 * $40 = $160.

### Step 7
The total profit from selling all devices bought on Monday and Tuesday is the total earnings minus the total cost, which is $80 (Monday) + $160 (Tuesday) - $40 (Monday cost) - $80 (Tuesday cost) = $120.

3 dozen eggs = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs

<step-2>. Next, we calculate the number of eggs found by Lamar, which is 5 eggs.

<step-3>. Stacy found twice as many eggs as Lamar, so we multiply the number of eggs Lamar found by 2:

Stacy's eggs = 2 * Lamar's eggs = 2 * 5 = 10 eggs

<step-4>. Charlie found 2 less eggs than Stacy, so we subtract 2 from the number of eggs Stacy found:

Charlie's eggs = Stacy's eggs - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 eggs

<step-5>. Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie, so we divide the number of eggs Charlie found by 2:

Mei's eggs = Charlie's eggs / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 eggs

<step-6>. Now, we add up the number of eggs found by all the children:

Total eggs found = Lamar's eggs + Stacy's eggs + Charlie's eggs + Mei's eggs = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs

<step-7>. Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden in the yard to find the number of eggs still hidden:

- The mural has four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.
- Half the mural is yellow.

### Step 2
- Since half the mural is yellow, the other half must be divided equally between red, white, and purple.
- This means that each of the three colors (red, white, and purple) occupies one-sixth of the mural.

### Step 3
- The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.
- Since each color occupies one-sixth of the mural, we can calculate the amount of paint used for each color by dividing the total amount of paint by 6.

### Step 4
- 12 pints / 6 = 2 pints
- Therefore, 2 pints of paint were used for each of the three colors: red, white, and purple.

Here's the reasoning behind the answer:


1. The cost of the regular box is given as $12.

2. The regular box contains 100 pods.

3. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box, so it contains 100 + (20% of 100) = 120 pods.

4. The special size box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12.

5. If each dishwashing cycle uses 1 pod, then the number of cycles that can be run with the special size box is equal to the number of pods in the box.

6. Therefore, with the special size box, you can run 120 dishwashing cycles for $12.

7. Since the question asks for the number of cycles for $1, we divide the number of cycles by the cost of the box: 120 cycles / $12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

8. However, the question asks for the number of cycles that can be run for $1, not per dollar.

9. Therefore, the final result is 120 dishwashing cycles for $12, which means for $1, you can run 120 / 12 = 10 cycles.

- We know that John is currently 28 years old.
- We also know that the time that has passed since Digimon came out is the same for both John and Jim.

**Step 4**
- Let's denote the time that has passed since Digimon came out as t.
- Therefore, John's age at that time was 28 - t, and Jim's age at that time was x - t.

**Step 5**
- According to the given information, John's age at that time was twice Jim's age.
- So, we can write the equation: 28 - t = 2(x - t)

**Step 6**
- Simplify the equation: 28 - t = 2x - 2t
- Rearrange the equation: 2x - 2t = 28 - t
- Combine like terms: 2x - t = 28

**Step 7**
- We also know that John's age at that time was 2x.

1220," **Step 1**: Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as `x`.

**Step 2**: According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length can be represented as `4x`.

**Step 3**: The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation `x + 4x = 40`.

**Step 4**: Simplifying the equation, we get `5x = 40`.

**Step 5**: To find the value of `x`, we divide both sides of the equation by 5, resulting in `x = 8`.

**Step 6**: Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying `x` by 4, which gives us `4 * 8 = 32`.

**Step 7**: Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

**Step 8**: We can check our answer by adding the lengths of the two pieces: `8 + 32 = 40`, which matches the total length of the board.

**Step 9**: Since our answer is consistent with the given information, we can be confident that our solution is correct.

1316," ### Step 1
- Mark finds a new radiator at a junk shop for 80% off the original price of $400.

### Step 2
- To calculate the discounted price, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $400 * 0.8 = $320.

### Step 3
- Mark pays $320 for the new radiator at the junk shop.

### Step 4
- The mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours of work to install the radiator.

### Step 5
- To calculate the total cost of the mechanic's work, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: $50 * 3 = $150.

### Step 6
- Mark pays an additional $150 for the mechanic's work.

### Step 7
- To find the total cost, we add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's work: $320 + $150 = $470.

1317," <step-1>. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.
<step-2>. Let's assume the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is W.
<step-3>. We have two equations based on the given information:
C + W = 20 (total number of animals)
2C + 4W = 70 (total number of legs)
<step-4>. We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:
C + 2W = 35
<step-5>. Now, we can subtract the first equation from the simplified second equation to eliminate C:
(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
W = 15
<step-6>. We know that there are 15 cows on the farm.
<step-7>. We can substitute the value of W into the first equation to find the number of chickens:
C + 15 = 20
C = 5
<step-8>. There are 5 chickens on the farm.
<step-9>. The final result is:
\boxed{5 chickens}",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}
