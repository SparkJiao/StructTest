1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems are not well understood, particularly in the context of ratchet systems, which are asymmetric periodic potentials where particles experience directed transport. Ratchet systems are of interest due to their potential to extract useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems. Recent studies have focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets. Chaotic systems are characterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions.

2. Chaotic systems often exhibit complex phase-space structures, consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas or coexisting attractors. These structures can change significantly as parameters are varied, leading to dramatic changes in transport properties. For example, stability islands can merge or break apart, and chaotic seas can pinch off or change. This complexity makes it challenging to understand the behavior of chaotic systems.

3. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the time-average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions, can be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics. However, this conjecture was later disputed by Barbi and Salerno, who argued that current reversals can occur without bifurcations. They proposed an alternative explanation related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.

4. Barbi and Salerno's results were based on the behavior of a single particle, which assumes ergodicity. However, chaotic systems are not always ergodic, and the behavior of an ensemble can depend sensitively on the statistics of the ensemble being considered. This has implications for experimental validation of results, as experiments are conducted over finite time, precision, and ensemble sizes. Understanding the ensemble dependence is crucial for characterizing the transport properties of chaotic ratchets.

5. The authors of this paper investigated the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the same system considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno. They showed that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and that it is essential to discard transients when quantifying the current. The authors also found that the current can be sensitive to the location of the initial ensemble, particularly in the chaotic regime. This sensitivity is more pronounced for small ensemble sizes.

6. The authors discussed the connection between bifurcation diagrams for individual particles and the behavior of the current. They",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 32}"

1. The study of extrasolar planets has revealed a wide range of eccentricities, with many planets having moderate or high eccentricities, unlike our own solar system.
2. The origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets has sparked several theories, including planet-planet scattering, stellar companions, and the Kozai mechanism.
3. The Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of a planet if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large.
4. The study focused on six highly eccentric planetary systems, including HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B.
5. The researchers used test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in each of the six systems considered.
6. The simulations showed that there are regions detectable by current surveys where additional objects can exist, and that protected resonances are also present in some systems.
7. The study combined the simulations with detection limits computed using new high-precision data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and other sources.
8. The results showed that additional short-period planets can be ruled out down to a few Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions of the HD 3651 and HD 45350 systems.
9. The study found no evidence for additional planets in any of the six systems considered, and the results have implications for the search for low-mass, short-period planets in these systems.

The LEP experiments at the resonance of the @xmath1-boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the @xmath1-decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousands. The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the @xmath1-pole. The physics of the @xmath1-boson will again play a central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation @xmath1 factory comes true.

The gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of the @xmath1 boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line. Given the high luminosity, @xmath14, and the cross section at the resonance of the @xmath1 boson, @xmath15, about @xmath16 @xmath1 events can be generated in an operational year of @xmath17 of gigaz.

The studies indicate that, in contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decays in the SM, the rates of these decays can be as large as @xmath18 in new physics models. The lightest CP-odd higgs boson @xmath0 plays a crucial role in the annihilation of the lightest neutralino @xmath107.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model, solving the naturalness problem and predicting gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles, which should be discovered at the Tevatron or LHC. The masses of these particles should be below the TeV range.

2. The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector is a crucial problem in SUSY phenomenology. This dynamics is often related to high-energy physics far above the electroweak scale, such as the GUT or Planck scale. Once the mechanism is specified, the mass spectrum and flavor structure of SUSY particles at the electroweak scale can be determined by a small number of parameters.

3. The No-Scale type Kähler potential is a type of Kähler potential that is highly predictive and can be a solution to the SUSY flavor problem. This scenario is characterized by the separation of the hidden sector and the observable sector, with the only source of SUSY breaking being gaugino masses. The No-Scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including string theory and supergravity.

4. The authors investigate the constraints on SUSY models with the No-Scale boundary condition, including the current Higgs mass bound and the B-physics constraint. They find that the minimal scenario is severely constrained, but the other two scenarios are not. They also discuss the possibility of observing SUSY signatures at the Tevatron Run 2 or the LHC, and the potential for measuring the compactification scale in the sequestered sector scenario.

1. The collision of plane waves in general relativity results in spacelike singularities, but the introduction of a relative cross polarization prior to the collision weakens these singularities.
2. A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) constitutes an example contrasting this category, possessing a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity.
3. The CX solution initiated a literature on the stability of horizons formed in spacetimes of colliding plane waves (CPW).
4. Yurtsever showed that the CH formed in spacetimes of CPW is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and a linear perturbation analysis by CX reveals an analogous result.
5. The addition of an electromagnetic (EM) field to the CPW spacetime weakens the strength of the singularity, and the collision of pure EM waves has a special significance in terms of singularity formation.
6. The Bell and Szekeres (BS) solution describes the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves, and the singularity formed in the interaction region is removable by a coordinate transformation.
7. The introduction of cross polarization in the BS solution does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries, and the stability of the resulting quasiregular (QR) singularities is investigated using the Helliwell and Konkowski (HK) stability conjecture.
8. The HK stability conjecture predicts that the QR singularities are unstable and will be transformed into scalar curvature singularities (SCS) when generic waves are added.

An exact back-reaction solution is constructed to test the validity of the HK stability conjecture, and the results show that the conjecture correctly predicts the nature of the singularity formed in the interaction region.</summary>",1,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 9}"

1. The study extends x-ray surveys to cosmologically interesting distances, detecting normal galaxies with high-energy emission not dominated by a luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN). These galaxies contribute significantly to the diffuse x-ray background (XRB) flux. The study aims to investigate the typical galaxy, whether its x-ray emission is dominated by x-ray binaries, hot interstellar gas, or a low-luminosity AGN. The data provide extremely deep x-ray coverage over the area, allowing for the detection of individually many normal galaxies.

2. The study focuses on galaxies at redshifts between 0.25 and 1.25, due to the extensive spectroscopic redshift coverage and superb imaging. The data are used to place observational constraints on the evolution of the ratio of x-ray luminosity to optical luminosity of normal spiral galaxies up to redshift 1.25. The study also places constraints on the fraction of the diffuse XRB explained by galaxies lingering just below the detection threshold. The spectroscopic redshifts for the galaxies are drawn from various catalogs.

3. The study uses a sample of galaxies with comparable optical luminosities at different redshifts, which is particularly important due to the non-linear relationship between x-ray luminosity and optical luminosity for some types of spiral galaxies. The study filters the catalog to keep only galaxies with spiral or merger morphology, and excludes galaxies with x-ray detections within 40 arcseconds. The study also uses the spectral energy distribution (SED) classifications to exclude galaxies of type E. The study finds that 70% of galaxies identified through the two methods are in common.

4. The study uses stacking to estimate the x-ray emission from the average galaxy at extremely faint flux levels. The study finds significant detections in the soft band for all redshift bins up to z=1.0, but not in the hard band. The study adopts a power-law spectrum for the calculation of x-ray fluxes and luminosities, assuming that the galaxies are similar to spiral galaxies in the local universe. The study finds that the average x-ray luminosity of the spiral galaxies in the shapley et al. (2001) sample is 1.24 x 10^40 erg/s.

1. Quantum systems can be correlated in ways that supersede classical descriptions, and these correlations can be classified into different types, including non-separability, Bell-nonlocality, and EPR-steering. Non-separability refers to states that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product-states of the constituents, while Bell-nonlocality is a phenomenon where measurement correlations can violate a Bell inequality. EPR-steering, on the other hand, is a phenomenon where one party can steer the state of the other party's system by measuring their own system.

2. The paper focuses on the EPR-steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals, known as t-states. These states are equivalent to mixtures of Bell states and form a tetrahedron in the space parameterized by the spin correlation matrix. The paper aims to determine the EPR-steerability of t-states using a deterministic local hidden variable (LHV) model.

3. The paper constructs a LHV-LHS model for t-states, which describes measurable quantum correlations for all separable and a large portion of non-separable t-states. The model is constructed using the steering ellipsoid and coincides with the optimal LHV-LHS model for Werner states. The model reproduces the steering scenario, where Alice's measurement collapses Bob's state to a corresponding point on the surface of the quantum steering ellipsoid.

4. The paper derives two sufficient general conditions for EPR-steerability, which are examples of EPR-steering inequalities. The first condition is based on a new EPR-steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix, while the second condition is based on a known nonlinear EPR-steering inequality. Both inequalities are asymmetric under the interchange of Alice and Bob's roles.

5. The paper shows that the linear EPR-steering inequality is satisfied by any LHS model for Bob, and this inequality is used to derive a sufficient condition for the EPR-steerability of t-states. The condition is relatively strong and is a tangent plane to the necessary condition at the point corresponding to Werner states.

6. The paper also derives a nonlinear EPR-steering inequality, which is used to obtain a sufficient condition for the EPR-steerability of t-states. This condition is stronger than the linear condition in some parameter regions and is used to plot the boundary of t-states satisfying this condition.

1. The concept of using a single electron's spin polarization to encode binary information has been attributed to Richard Feynman, but a conclusive identification of the visionary remains elusive.
2. Encoding information in spin may offer advantages such as lower power dissipation, immunity to stray electric fields, and potentially faster operation.
3. A proposed scheme for a classical universal logic gate using three spins in a weak magnetic field involves encoding logic 1 in the upspin state and logic 0 in the downspin state.
4. However, the system suffers from a severe shortcoming that prevents its use in pipelined architectures due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction, which can lead to metastable states.
5. To overcome this issue, a three-phase clocking scheme was proposed, where two adjacent barriers are lowered pairwise at the same time to propagate the input state through a linear array.
6. The use of reversible logic gates is also explored as a way to overcome the Landauer barrier and reduce energy dissipation, with a logically and physically reversible quantum inverter using two exchange coupled spins being proposed.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors include a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range and a sharp cutoff at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cutoff and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cutoff.

2. The orbital period evolution of CVs reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer, which perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star, and thermal relaxation, which reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius. The minimum period occurs where the two corresponding time scales, the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time, are about equal. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses. The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of values in the CV population.

3. The authors consider various mechanisms that could increase the bounce period for CVs from the canonical theoretical value to the observed value, including consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) mechanisms and tidal deformation of the secondary. They find that even a maximal efficient CAML mechanism cannot increase the bounce period sufficiently, and that an implausibly large deformation factor of around 1.18 is needed to obtain a bounce period of 78 minutes. The authors also consider the possibility that the bounce period problem is ignored, and find that in all synthesized model populations, except for the age limit model, a pronounced remaining feature due to the accumulation of systems near the bounce is present. The authors conclude that the period minimum problem and the period spike problem remain an open issue, and that it is possible to construct CV model populations where the period spike is washed out sufficiently so that it cannot be ruled out unambiguously on the basis of an objective statistical test against the observed CV period distribution.</summary>",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

1. Stephan's Quintet is a compact group of galaxies that has produced a highly disturbed intragroup medium through a complex sequence of interactions and harassment. This interplay has produced a large-scale intergalactic shock-wave, first observed as a narrow filament in the radio continuum.

2. The high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318B, with the intergalactic medium of the group is believed to be responsible for the shock-heating of the X-ray emitting gas. Optical emission line ratios and observed broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is powered by strong shocks and not star formation.

3. The main elements of Stephan's Quintet are shown in Figure 1, with the primary shock defined by the 20 cm radio continuum emission. The large Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 7318A, lies to the east of the shock, while the intruder galaxy, NGC 7318B, lies to the west.

4. The peculiar extranuclear star formation region, SQ-A, lies at the extreme northern end of the main shock wave. The unexpected discovery of extremely powerful, pure-rotational H2 line emission from the center of the shock has sparked intense interest in the SQ system.

5. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of the shock region in SQ was obtained using the IRS instrument onboard Spitzer, with observations done in low-resolution mapping mode using the short-low and long-low modules. The spectra were assembled into spectral cubes for each module using the software tool, Cubism.

2. The SLRI's spatially heterogeneous distribution could be reduced by a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk, which can transport and mix gas and particles through large-scale inward and outward transport.
3. The stable oxygen isotopes, on the other hand, appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation, with small refractory particles from comet 81p/Wild 2 showing a range of @xmath0 6% variations.
4. The leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula, which can lead to isotopic fractionation between gas-phase and solid-phase oxygen atoms.

The models show that a phase of marginal gravitational instability in disks and stars with a variety of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains, which can explain the discovery of refractory grains in comet 81p/Wild 2 and the relative homogeneity of @xmath4al/@xmath42al ratios derived from a supernova injection event.

1. The study of Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed a diversity of broad and narrow emission lines, providing insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized gas in the vicinity of the central massive object. Broad emission lines, such as Hα, are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk acting as the fuel reservoir for the central supermassive black hole. The study of these lines has led to the identification of two Type 1 AGN populations, A and B, which show distinct characteristics in their broad-line profiles and kinematics. Population A sources have smaller broad-line widths and are predominantly radio-quiet, while population B sources have broader lines and a mix of radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars.

2. The study of the Fe II emission lines in Type 1 AGN has also been a topic of interest, with some studies suggesting a systematic redshift of Fe II relative to Hα and [O III] emission lines. However, a recent study has challenged this finding, suggesting that the Fe II redshift may be an artifact of the analysis. The study found that the Fe II emission lines are often blended with other lines, such as He II, which can affect the accuracy of the Fe II shift estimates. The study also found that the Fe II emission lines are often too faint and broad to make reliable inferences about line shifts and widths.

3. The study used a combination of individual spectra and composite spectra to investigate the Fe II shift in Type 1 AGN. The analysis of individual spectra found that the Fe II shift estimates were often uncertain and not significantly different from zero. The analysis of composite spectra, on the other hand, found that the Fe II shift was not significantly different from zero, even when restricting the analysis to sources with large claimed Fe II shifts. The study also found that the Fe II emission lines are often affected by He II emission, which can produce a redshift of the Fe II blue blend.

4. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the Fe II emission lines in Type 1 AGN and the use of Fe II shift as an orientation parameter. The study suggests that small systematic shifts of Fe II with respect to the rest frame may be plausible, but a reliable analysis is only possible on spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio. The study also challenges the usefulness of Fe II shift as an orientation parameter, as the Fe II emission lines are often too faint and broad to make reliable",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. Nuclear multifragmentation is a phenomenon that is being intensely studied both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical calculations on this topic began in the early 1980s, while the first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the Aladin group. The caloric curve is a plot of temperature versus excitation energy, and it is a key indicator of the phase transition in nuclear matter. The Aladin group's experiment identified a wide plateau in the caloric curve at around 5 MeV temperature lasting from 3 to 10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy.

2. The plateau-like region in the caloric curve was associated with the possible existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter, which generated new motivations for further theoretical and experimental work. Similar experiments were conducted by the EOS and INDRA groups, but they obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region being absent in most cases. The discrepancies between the experiments were attributed to the precision of the experimental measurements and the finite-size effects of the caloric curve. The finite-size effects were manifested through the dependency of the equilibrated sources on the reaction type.

3. Recent reevaluations of the Aladin group's data on the kinetic energies of the emitted neutrons brought corrections of about 10^-6 in the case of the reaction 197Au+197Au at 600 MeV/nucleon. More importantly, it was proven that the energies of the spectator parts were growing with approximately 30^-6 in the bombarding energy interval 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon. The universality of the quantity subject to the bombarding energy variation suggested that for the above-mentioned reactions, the equilibrated sources sequence should be the same. Consequently, the necessity of accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and of the sequential secondary particle emission became imperative.

4. The SMm calculations suggested a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even in the case of the 600 MeV/nucleon bombarding energy reaction. The two widely used statistical multifragmentation models, SMm and MMmc, were not strictly satisfying the microcanonical rules, despite their success in reproducing some experimental data. The present paper described some refinements and improvements brought to the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation model proposed in a previous work. The improvements were presented in two parts: primary break-up refinements and inclusion of the secondary decay stage.

1. The quiet solar corona has been heated to a temperature of about 12 million kelvins for more than 60 years, while the visible surface of the sun is roughly 250 times cooler. This phenomenon has been recognized since the 1930s and 1940s by scientists such as Grotrian, Edlen, and Phillips. The primary energy source for this heating must lie in the convection zone below the solar photosphere.

2. The debate centers on whether the energy to heat the corona derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events giving rise to nanoflares. The interaction of the magnetic field with convective flows in or below the photosphere can produce two types of magnetic disturbances in coronal structures. These disturbances can be classified as either wave-heating or current-heating mechanisms.

3. The buffeting of magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere by granulation generates MHD waves, which can propagate into magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona. In coronal loops, the random motions of magnetic loop foot-points can produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines, generating field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively. Plasma inertia plays a key role in wave propagation but is unimportant for the dynamics of field-aligned currents along coronal loops.

4. Theoretical studies have shown that only high-frequency MHD waves are capable of significant heating. These waves have been sought using the Fe XIV green line at 530.3 nm and the Fe X red line at 637.5 nm. Observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations of coronal structures have been made by several researchers.

However, the size of the emitting regions at this frequency is typically a few milliarcseconds, and no information has been obtained on the role of H3O+ at large spatial scales. Other H3O+ lines have been detected from ground or airborne-based telescopes.

2. The 3.11-2.12 transition at 183 GHz has been used to map the emission of H3O+ at very large spatial scales, and a map of the Orion molecular cloud was obtained in 1994. This map is 6 orders of magnitude larger than the size of the spots detected at 22 GHz, and for the first time, an H3O+ abundance estimate was derived for the different large-scale components of the Orion molecular cloud. The abundance of H3O+ was found to be around 10^7.

3. The ISO satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared, and mapping of the SGRB2 molecular cloud has shown that water vapor is an ubiquitous molecule in molecular clouds. Maps of the emission of several H3O+ lines in Orion IRC2 have been obtained, and observations of the central position have been carried out by several groups. However, the ISO observations of H3O+ have drawbacks, including limited spectral resolution and high opacity.

4. The 325 GHz line of H3O+ was observed in the direction of Orion IRC2 and other molecular clouds, but no maps were obtained. However, the present data show the importance of ground-based observations of H3O+ in deriving the abundance of H3O+ in molecular clouds and providing useful constraints on the physical conditions of the emitting regions. The observations were performed with the 10.4 m telescope of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory.

5. The spatial distribution of the 325 GHz emission is shown in Figure 2, together with that of CH3OH (from the image sideband) and the 183 GHz emission from Cer94. Integrated intensity maps for selected velocity intervals are also shown in Figure 2.

1. Threshold nets are constructed by assigning weights from a distribution to each node and connecting nodes whose combined weights exceed a certain threshold, resulting in a wide variety of architectures.
2. These nets can be produced with arbitrary degree distributions, including scale-free, by choosing the weight distribution and threshold judiciously.
3. The study of threshold nets has recently gained attention from statistical and non-linear physicists due to their beautiful properties and potential applications.
4. A broader class of nets, called sequence nets, can be constructed from a sequence of letters and fixed rules of connectivity, offering more flexibility and analytical appeal.
5. Sequence nets retain many desirable properties of threshold nets, including modularity and easily computable structural measures, and can be designed with specific degree distributions and spectra.
6. The diameter of sequence nets grows linearly with the number of letters in the alphabet, making them comparable to many everyday life complex nets.
7. Two-letter sequence nets contain threshold nets and two newly discovered classes, which can be mapped to difference-threshold nets with interesting properties.
8. The study of sequence nets has numerous open questions, including the possibility of further reducing the number of types and finding systematic ways to map them to other types of nets.

1. The study of superconductivity has led to the proposal of novel experimental probes of order parameter symmetry, including the nonlinear current response of d-wave superconductors. The presence of nodes in the order parameter introduces a nonanalyticity in the current-velocity relation, leading to anisotropy in the nonlinear current. Early experimental work did not verify these predictions, but a recent reanalysis of experiments has claimed to confirm them. The study of nonlinear current response is important for device applications and for providing fundamental signatures of order parameter symmetry.

2. The study of one-band superconductors has shown that the nonlinear current response is a small effect on the plots, but it will be borne out in the paper that the nonlinear current does not show significant differences in the temperature dependence between 2D and 3D. The nonlinear current can be expanded to second lowest order in powers of the superfluid velocity, leading to a general formula for the current. The temperature-dependent coefficients in this formula follow from the solutions of the Eliashberg equations for the renormalized gaps and frequencies. The study of one-band superconductors has also shown that strong coupling increases the value of the nonlinear coefficient at low temperatures.

3. The study of two-band superconductors has shown that the nonlinear current response is affected by the presence of two bands, leading to a more complex behavior than in the one-band case. The study of mgb0, a two-band superconductor, has shown that the nonlinear coefficient is monotonically increasing with temperature, in contrast to a previous prediction. The increased nonlinearity due to the second band is best reduced by adding impurities to the second band. The study of two-band superconductors has also shown that the nonlinear current response is affected by the anisotropy in the fermi velocity ratio between the bands, leading to an increase in the nonlinearity.

1. The classification problem is a crucial task in time series data mining, and one of the best classifiers for time series data is the 1-nearest neighbor (1-nn) with dynamic time warping (dtw) distance. This approach is more accurate than other methods such as support vector machine (svm), artificial neural network (ann), and decision tree. The 1-nn classification is highly dependent on the selection of an appropriate distance measure, which is crucial in time series data. The Euclidean distance is commonly used, but it has been shown that dtw distance is more suitable.

2. Dynamic time warping (dtw) distance is a well-known similarity measure based on shape, which uses a dynamic programming technique to find all possible warping paths and selects the one with the minimum distance between two time series. The dtw distance matrix is created by calculating the cumulative distance of the minimum of three surrounding neighbors. The optimal path is chosen by selecting the path that yields a minimum cumulative distance. However, dtw may not give the best mapping according to our need, as it tries to find the minimum distance.

3. To resolve this problem, a global constraint is used to limit the permissible warping paths. Two well-known global constraints are the Sakoe-Chiba band and the Itakura parallelogram, and a recent representation is the Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (r-k band). The r-k band is a generalization of the global constraint model represented by a one-dimensional array. The size of the array and the maximum constraint value is limited to the length of the time series.

4. The Sakoe-Chiba band (s-c band) was originally used to speed up the dtw calculation and later introduced as a dtw global constraint. The width of the global constraint was fixed to be 10% of the time series length. However, recent work reveals that the classification accuracy depends solely on this global constraint, and the size of the constraint depends on the properties of the data. To determine a suitable size, all possible widths of the global constraint are tested, and the band with the maximum training accuracy is selected.

5. The Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (r-k band) has been introduced to generalize the global constraint model represented by a one-dimensional array. The r-k band allows great flexibility to adjust the global constraint, but a learning algorithm is needed to discover the best multi-r-k bands.

1. The Standard Model of elementary particles has been successful in describing the nature at the electroweak scale, but recent discoveries and anomalies, such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, suggest the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The muon anomalous magnetic moment has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions, showing discrepancies that are consistently more than 10 standard deviations.

2. The authors propose a new gauge interaction beyond the Standard Model, specifically in the muon sector, to explain the observed anomalies. They consider two possibilities where the washout of baryon asymmetry does not occur, either by having a small lambda or by having small Majorana masses.

3. The authors calculate the constraints on the parameters of the new gauge interaction and find that the condition for the washout not to occur is more severe when the Majorana masses are small. They also discuss the decay of the right-handed neutrinos and find that they decay before the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis begins, which does not affect it.

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems is a unique property that plays an important role in quantum information processing, and its study has attracted much attention in recent years due to its essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence.

2. The phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) has been observed experimentally, which is detrimental to the practical realization of quantum information processing using entanglement, but some studies have indicated that ESD is not always the eventual fate of qubit entanglement.

3. Researchers have found that the entanglement can revive again after some time of ESD, which has been observed in optical systems, and this revived entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.

4. The results show that the entanglement does not go away, but rather changes its location, and this is reminiscent of the work of Yonac et al., in which the entanglement dynamics has been studied in a double Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model.

5. The study of entanglement dynamics in a system consisted of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs has been conducted, and the time evolution of the system is given by a set of integro-differential equations.

6. The time-dependent reduced density matrix of the bipartite subsystem qubit1-qubit2 can be obtained by tracing over the reservoir variables, and the entanglement of each subsystem can be calculated using the concurrence.

7. The researchers have found that the entanglement dynamics and its distributions in the bipartite partitions are completely determined by the time-dependent factor of single-qubit excited-state population.

8. The population trapping phenomenon, which is responsible for the suppression of spontaneous emission of two-level systems in photonic bandgap (PBG) reservoirs, has been observed and is responsible for the formation of bound states between qubits and reservoirs.

9. The bound states between qubits and reservoirs have been found to play a crucial role in the entanglement distribution, and the stable entanglement distribution resulted from the bound states is a general phenomenon in open quantum systems when the non-Markovian effect is taken into account.

10. The study has significant implications for the study of the physical nature of entanglement under decoherence and provides an active way to protect entanglement from decoherence by modifying the properties of the reservoir via quantum reservoir engineering.

1. The origin of celestial gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains one of the most important astrophysical phenomena lacking an explanation, with possible explanations including the collapse of a massive star (hypernova) and the coalescence of a compact binary system. These events involve huge energy releases, up to 10^18 erg, and are associated with the emission of gravitational waves (GWs).

2. The detection of GWs from GRBs is challenging due to the limited sensitivity of current detectors, but the detection of a signal associated with the sum of many events could be more realistic. A program was launched to study the presence of correlations between GRB events and the output signals from GW antennas.

3. The analysis used an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors, which can cope with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts. The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, which have been used to search for correlations between GRB events and GW signals.

4. The experimental method and model for the averaged correlation at zero delay time were presented, and the values of GW amplitude consistent with the observation were inferred. The data were summarized by an observed average squared energy, which was related to the measured cross-correlation.

5. The probability density function of the GW amplitude was plotted, showing that the highest beliefs are for very small values, while values above a certain threshold are practically ruled out. An expected value and standard deviation for the GW amplitude were obtained, which fully account for the null result.

6. The Bayesian approach was used to provide a prior-independent result, and the likelihood for each hypothesis under investigation was calculated. The result was given in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound, which is considered the most complete and unbiased way of providing the experimental information.

1. The source document discusses the challenges of selecting high-quality scientific publications in a vast amount of research. It highlights the importance of citation mechanisms in discovering relevant publications. The number of citations is believed to be an estimate measure of scientific credibility, although it should not be taken too literally. This has led to an unspoken demand for the statistical analysis of citation data.

2. An empirical study on citation distribution showed that it follows a power-law form with an exponent. The power-law behavior is a consequence of highly cited papers being more likely to acquire further citations, identified as a preferential attachment process. The citation distribution of scientific publications is well-studied, and various network models have been developed to mimic its complex structure. However, these models often focus on the total number of citations without providing information about the issuing publications.

3. The document proposes a simple model that considers two research areas and referencing within and across each other. The model is applicable to the web of human sexual contacts, where interactions between males and females can be thought of as two coupled growing networks. The model is defined and analyzed using a rate equation approach, and the time evolution of the network is described. The model is used to investigate the growth mechanism of the network.

4. The model is built by considering two networks with initially no cross-links between the nodes. At each time step, two new nodes with no incoming links are introduced simultaneously, one belonging to each network. The new node attaches a fraction of its links to pre-existing nodes in its own network and the complementary fraction to pre-existing nodes in the other network. The attachments to nodes in either network are preferential, and the rate of acquiring a link depends on the number of connections and the initial attractiveness of the pre-existing nodes.

5. The document analyzes the time evolution of the network and derives the time-independent recurrence relation for the distribution of the average number of nodes with intra-links and cross-links. The recurrence relation is used to obtain the total in-degree distribution, which is found to be a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes. The document also analyzes the distribution of the average number of nodes with intra-links and cross-links, which are found to have power-law forms with exponents that depend on the coupling parameters. The model is flexible and can represent a variety of complex systems, including citation networks and the web of human sexual contacts.

1. The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally framed in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons and fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron. The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part makes use of fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically. However, this production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions. Instead, recombination of partons is shown to be the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.

2. The recombination model is a key link between shower partons and the observed hadron, and it is essential to determine the distributions of shower partons to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The shower partons are defined as the partons that recombine with other partons in the ambient environment, and their distributions are crucial for understanding the hadronization process in heavy-ion collisions. The recombination model has been shown to be successful in describing the fragmentation process, and it is essential to extend this model to include the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons. The shower parton distributions obtained from this model are useful in problems where the knowledge of the fragmentation functions alone is not sufficient to provide answers to questions concerning the interaction between a jet and its surrounding medium or between particles within a jet.

3. The shower parton distributions are determined from the fragmentation functions using the recombination model, and the resulting distributions are shown to be useful in describing the hadronization process in heavy-ion collisions. The recombination model is based on the idea that the shower partons recombine with other partons in the ambient environment to form hadrons, and the distributions of shower partons are essential for understanding this process.

1. The paper discusses a nonconvex semidefinite programming problem, where the objective function is convex, and the feasible set is a nonempty, closed convex set. The problem involves matrix-valued mappings and is nonconvex due to the bilinear term. The goal is to find a stationary point of the problem.

2. The authors propose a new method to solve this problem by approximating the nonconvex feasible set with an inner convex set. This method is based on convex-concave decomposition and linearization techniques. The algorithm exploits the convex substructure of the problem.

3. The main idea of the algorithm is to solve a sequence of convex semidefinite programming subproblems, where each subproblem is formed by using inner psd-convex approximations. The algorithm generates a feasible sequence to the original problem and is strictly descent with respect to the objective function. No globalization strategy is needed.

4. The authors prove the convergence of the algorithm to a stationary point under mild conditions. The assumptions used in the proof are weaker than the ones used in previous theorems. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed if the lower level set of the objective function is bounded.

5. The algorithm is applied to solve several classes of optimization problems arising in static output feedback controller design. These problems involve bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, which are nonconvex and NP-hard. The algorithm can be used to solve problems such as sparse linear static output feedback controller design, spectral abscissa optimization, and mixed synthesis.

6. The authors provide a particular way to compute the inner psd-convex approximation of a BMI constraint. This is done by using the psd-convex overestimate of a bilinear form, which is a psd-convex matrix mapping. The overestimate is used to approximate the bilinear term in the BMI constraint.

1. The Dirac-Kähler formulation of fermionic field theory has been of particular interest in extracting the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories, and a discrete differential geometry scheme is required to regularize calculations. However, defining such a scheme has proven to be challenging, especially with the difficulties exhibited by the Hodge star and the wedge product between forms.

2. Several discrete schemes have been proposed to address these difficulties, including the use of a lattice to define operators with desirable properties, but that were non-local. The introduction of a specific non-commutativity between the fields and discrete forms allowed the product rule to be fulfilled, but it became necessary to introduce a second orientation of form in order for their action to remain hermitian.

3. A proposal by Adams introduces two parallel lattices to maintain the locality of the Hodge star and uses a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product. This proposal describes a local, discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space, and its formal aspects have been thoroughly studied by De Beauc, Samik Sen, Siddartha Sen, and Czech.

4. The authors have shown how the two lattices of Adams' proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Kähler formulation and how the idea of using more than one lattice can be extended to describe an exact flavour projection. They have also evaluated the path integral for this formulation, considering the effects of chiral and flavour projection, and found that it leads to a form equivalent to that used in the quarter-root trick of lattice QCD.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

The beamforming design is formulated as a semidefinite programming problem, which can be solved using convex optimization techniques.

The authors provide numerical results to illustrate the performance of the proposed beamforming schemes, including the optimal beamforming design and the two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes. The results show that the sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes achieve near-optimal performance, especially in the high SNR regime.

1. The Maxwell equation's @xmath0-invariance was discovered by Cunningham and Bateman a century ago, but it is broken when using the Lorenz gauge for quantization due to gauge freedom. However, maintaining this symmetry during quantization in conformally flat spaces (CFS) can be beneficial. A classical @xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFS locally, so it is reasonable to maintain the @xmath0-invariance during quantization. This approach can lead to a free field living in a CFS behaving like in a flat space.

2. The work confirms that maintaining the @xmath0-invariance during quantization in a CFS can lead to a new and simple two-point Wightman function, which has the same physical content as the two-point function of Allen and Jacobson. The Faraday propagator is the same, and the two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts. The introduction of auxiliary fields and the use of the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme are necessary to deal with gauge freedom. The main result is a set of Wightman two-point functions for Maxwell and auxiliary fields.

3. The quantum field was explicitly constructed using the Gupta-Bleuler canonical quantization scheme, and the Wightman two-point functions were given. The price to pay for this simplicity and the maintaining of the @xmath0 invariance during the whole quantization process was the introduction of two auxiliary fields. The propagation must use all the Wightman functions and not only the ""purely"" Maxwell one. The calculations showed that only the Maxwell two-point function is involved in propagating the electromagnetic field generated by two charges of opposite sign placed at the two poles of a de Sitter space.

2. The game was introduced by Bitar and Goles in 1992 as a special case of the general chip-firing game, and it has been studied extensively in the context of graph theory and combinatorics. The game has been shown to have deep connections to number theory, algebra, and combinatorics.

3. The parallel chip-firing game can be used to simulate a pile of particles that falls whenever there are too many particles stacked at any point, and it has been used to model real-world phenomena such as self-organized criticality. The game is also an example of a cellular automaton, which has implications for biology, social science, and other fields.

2. The GRB 090510 was detected by several satellites, including Fermi, Swift, and Agile, and its position was determined with high accuracy. The host galaxy of GRB 090510 is a late-type galaxy with a low star-forming rate.

3. The prompt emission of GRB 090510 is best fitted by a comptonized component, which is interpreted as a convolution of thermal spectra originating in a dyadotorus. The dyadotorus is a newly formed BH surrounded by an optically thick baryon-loaded plasma.

4. The prompt emission is followed by a spiky structure, which is attributed to the interaction of the accelerated baryons with the circumburst medium (CBM). The analysis of the prompt emission allows for the determination of the inhomogeneities in the CBM.

5. The late X-ray emission of GRB 090510 does not follow the characteristic patterns expected in binary-driven hypernova events (BDHNE). The GeV emission occurs at the end of the prompt emission and is initially concurrent with the prompt emission.

6. The GeV emission is one of the most intense ever observed in any GRB and is attributed to the accretion of matter onto the newly formed BH. The accretion of crustal material from a NS-NS binary progenitor is assumed.

The fireshell theory provides a new classification of GRBs, with GRB 090510 being classified as a short GRB originating in a binary NS merger.

5. The non-decoupling property of the triplet is observed in the model, which means that the one-loop electroweak results cannot be split into a SM contribution plus a piece that vanishes as the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the weak scale. This fact has been overlooked in previous analyses of the littlest Higgs model.

The authors propose an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation, which is a computationally efficient algorithm for interpolating the self-energies for a whole range of dopings, degeneracies, and interactions. This approach is based on a set of constraints in the slave boson mean field method combined with the functional form of the atomic green function.

2. The authors test the accuracy of the interpolative method by comparing it with the results of the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, which is a sophisticated and numerically accurate impurity solver. The comparisons show that the interpolative method reproduces all trends in remarkable agreement with the QMC method.

3. The authors also discuss possible ways to further improve the accuracy of the method, including accounting for lifetime effects, modifying the slave boson scheme to account for fluctuations around the mean field solution, and adjusting the width of the quasiparticle band to match the QMC results. These improvements can help to reduce the residual discrepancies between the interpolative method and the QMC results.

1. The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions is a growing field of interest due to its applications in complex systems, including contact process, domain growth, catalysis, phase separation, and transport phenomena. Although there is no general theory for nonequilibrium model systems, some progress has been made in understanding stationary states using approximate analytical methods and simulations.

2. The ZGB model, proposed by Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad, describes the kinetic aspects of the oxidation of a catalytic surface and has been studied extensively. A modified version of the ZGB model has been introduced, incorporating a random distribution of inert sites on the catalytic surface.

3. The site approximation and pair approximation have been used to study the phase transitions in the ZGB model with inert sites. The site approximation does not give any continuous transition for all values of the concentration of inert sites, while the pair approximation shows a continuous transition line.

4. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to check the results obtained in the site and pair approximations. The simulations show a critical concentration above which the transition becomes continuous, which is different from the pair approximation.

5. The overall effect of inert sites is to reduce the production of CO2 molecules, and the maximum production rate of CO2 molecules moves towards the reactive window when the concentration of inert sites is greater than the critical value. The critical concentration of inert sites has been found to be 0.45, above which the transition becomes continuous.

1. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the hydrodynamic limit for interacting particle systems in the crystal lattice, which is a generalization of the classical lattice. The hydrodynamic limit is a scaling limit that captures the collective behavior of particles.

2. The paper extends the problems of the hydrodynamic limit from the Euclidean lattice to the crystal lattice, which has periodic global structures but inhomogeneous local structures. The crystal lattice is defined as an infinite graph that admits a free action of a free abelian group with a finite quotient graph.

3. The paper constructs a scaling limit of the crystal lattice by taking a finite index subgroup of the free abelian group and quotienting the graph by the subgroup-action. This results in a finite quotient graph, which is called the @xmath4-scaling finite graph.

4. The paper formulates the symmetric simple exclusion process and the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on the crystal lattice, which are particular cases of the gradient system. The weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process is a perturbation of the symmetric simple exclusion process.

5. The paper proves the replacement theorem, which allows us to replace local averages of a local function bundle by global averages of the empirical density. The replacement theorem is used to derive the hydrodynamic equation.

6. The paper proves the one-block estimate, which states that the local average of a local function bundle on a block is close to the global average of the empirical density. The one-block estimate is used to prove the replacement theorem.

7. The paper proves the two-blocks estimate, which states that the local average of a local function bundle on two blocks is close to the global average of the empirical density. The two-blocks estimate is used to prove the replacement theorem.

8. The paper proves the local ergodic theorem, which states that the local average of a local function bundle on a block is close to the global average of the empirical density. The local ergodic theorem is used to prove the replacement theorem.

9. The paper proves the main theorem, which states that the empirical density converges to a weak solution of the quasi-linear parabolic equation as the scaling parameter goes to infinity. The main theorem is proved by using the replacement theorem and the local ergodic theorem.

1. The study of harmonic maps was initiated by F. B. Fuller, J. Nash, and J. H. Sampson, and the first general result on the existence of harmonic maps is due to Eells-Sampson. Harmonic maps are extrema (critical points) of the energy functional defined on the space of smooth maps between Riemannian (pseudo-Riemannian) manifolds. The trace of the second fundamental form of such maps vanishes. Harmonic maps have been successfully applied in various fields, including computational fluid dynamics, minimal surface theory, string theory, gravity, and quantum field theory.

2. Harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds have been extensively studied, but the study of harmonic maps between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds is more restricted. The energy density of a harmonic map is defined as the smooth function given by the integral of the square of the norm of the derivative of the map. The energy density is a measure of the amount of energy required to deform the map. The energy density is used to define the energy functional, which is a measure of the total energy of the map.

3. The second fundamental form of a harmonic map is the symmetric map defined by the formula involving the Levi-Civita connections and the pullback metric. The second fundamental form is a measure of the curvature of the map. The tension field of a harmonic map is the section defined by the formula involving the second fundamental form and the Levi-Civita connections. The tension field is a measure of the ""tension"" in the map.

4. A map is said to be harmonic if its tension field vanishes identically. The Hessian of a harmonic map is defined as the bilinear form involving the second derivatives of the map. The index of a harmonic map is defined as the dimension of the tangent subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite. A harmonic map is said to be stable if its Morse index is zero and unstable otherwise.

The fundamental 2-form of an almost para-Hermitian manifold is defined by the formula involving the almost para-complex structure and the pseudo-Riemannian metric. An almost para-Hermitian manifold is called para-Kähler if the fundamental 2-form is closed. A para-Kähler manifold",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 32}"

1. The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is a crucial measure for understanding the hierarchical build-up of the universe over cosmic time. However, large-scale simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high-mass galaxies.

2. To address this issue, some process or processes must be able to stop or ""quench"" star formation before the galaxy grows too big. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to play a key role in this process.

3. SMBHs grow through accretion of cold material and emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, which can deposit energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This energy can heat the gas or remove it altogether, known as ""feedback"" processes.

4. Indirect evidence of this feedback has been observed through scaling relationships between the mass of the SMBH and properties of the host galaxy. These relationships suggest a strong coevolution of the host galaxy and SMBH.

5. However, the exact mechanism of AGN feedback and its role in galaxy evolution remains debated, particularly with new observations at low and high redshifts that deviate from established relationships.

6. To study the starburst-AGN connection, researchers have focused on the infrared (IR) regime, where dust re-emits stellar light from young stars. The IR regime is less contaminated by AGN emission than other wavelengths.

7. The Herschel Space Observatory has greatly expanded our knowledge of the IR universe, providing a window into the FIR properties of galaxies. The FIR regime is ideal for studying star formation in AGN host galaxies.

8. Researchers have assembled a large sample of AGN selected using ultra-hard X-ray observations with the Swift/BAT instrument. This sample focuses on moderate-luminosity Seyfert galaxies at low redshift.

9. The FIR emission from the AGN host galaxies is not strongly contaminated by AGN-related emission, as indicated by the small correlation coefficients between the FIR luminosities and the 14.195 keV luminosity.

10. The FIR colors of the AGN host galaxies are similar to those of normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting that the FIR emission is produced by cold dust in the ISM heated by stellar radiation. However, some AGN show anomalous colors, indicating the presence of synchrotron emission from a radio jet.

1. The fundamental group of the complement of plane curves is a topological invariant that can be computed for line arrangements, and it has various applications in mathematics, such as distinguishing between connected components of the moduli space of smooth projective surfaces. The Zariski-Lefschetz hyperplane section theorem states that the fundamental group of the complement of a hypersurface in a projective space can be computed using the fundamental group of the complement of a plane curve. The fundamental group of the complement of a line arrangement can also be used to compute the fundamental group of the complement of a hypersurface in a projective space.

2. Fan's result shows that if the graph associated to a line arrangement is acyclic, then the corresponding fundamental group has a conjugation-free geometric presentation. The conjugation-free geometric presentation is a type of presentation where the relations do not involve conjugations. The family of arrangements with a conjugation-free geometric presentation is important because the incidence lattice of the arrangement determines the fundamental group of the complement.

3. The authors prove that the fundamental group of a real affine arrangement without parallel lines, whose graph has a unique cycle of length 3 and has no line with more than two multiple points, has a conjugation-free geometric presentation. They also generalize this result to arrangements whose graphs are cycles of any length and have no line with more than two multiple points.

1. The source document discusses the concept of flavor symmetry in generating mass and mixing patterns of fermions, particularly in the leptonic sector. Researchers have explored various symmetries, including continuous and discrete symmetries, to describe the mass and mixing patterns of fermions. The discrete symmetry, specifically the exchange symmetry, has been successful in describing the mass and mixing patterns in the leptonic sector. The authors of the source document aim to investigate the generation of non-zero Dirac CP violation in a softly broken A4 symmetric model.

2. The A4 symmetry is a discrete symmetry that has been widely used to describe the mass and mixing patterns of fermions. The authors introduce a new symmetry, denoted as A1, which is a subgroup of the A4 symmetry. They propose a model that incorporates the A1 symmetry and investigate the generation of non-zero Dirac CP violation in this model. The model is based on the see-saw mechanism, which involves the introduction of right-handed neutrinos to generate the light neutrino masses.

3. The authors calculate the light neutrino mass matrix and the mixing angles in terms of the model parameters. They find that the mixing angles are independent of the complex phase, which is a characteristic of the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern. The authors also calculate the mass-squared differences and their ratio, which are used to constrain the model parameters. They find that the model can generate a non-zero Dirac CP violation, which is a key feature of the model.

4. The authors investigate the leptogenesis in the model, which is the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe. They calculate the lepton asymmetry parameters and find that they are related to the CP asymmetry parameters.

1. Organic molecular crystals are emerging as excellent candidates for fabricating nanoscale devices, particularly in electronics and optoelectronics. These devices have potential applications in areas such as solar energy harvesting, surface photochemistry, organic electronics, and spintronics. The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance. Understanding how charge transfers between the organic and inorganic components is essential.

2. The calculation of charge transfer energies between the organic and inorganic components is a challenging task, especially in the single-molecule limit. The electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change value upon adsorption on a substrate, which is expected due to the polarization of the substrate. A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle (QP) description. Within the QP picture, one ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons.

3. The adequacy of the QP description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). If the theory of choice is density functional theory (DFT), a number of observations should be made. Firstly, except for the energy of the HOMO, which can be rigorously interpreted as the negative of the ionization potential, in general, the Kohn-Sham orbitals cannot be associated with QP energies. This is commonly done in practice, and often, the Kohn-Sham QP levels provide a good approximation to the true removal energies, particularly in the case of metals.

4. Unfortunately, the situation is less encouraging for molecules, with the local and semi-local approximations of the exchange and correlation functional, namely the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), performing rather poorly even for the HOMO level. Such a situation is partially corrected by hybrid functionals or by functionals explicitly including self-interaction corrections. Extremely encouraging results have been recently demonstrated for range-separated functionals. The calculation of the energy levels alignment of a molecule in the proximity of a metal presents additional problems.

5. The formation of the image charge, although it is essentially a classical electrostatic phenomenon, has a completely non-local nature. This means that unless a given functional is explicitly non-local, it will in general fail in capturing such an effect.

1. The first step in describing the interaction between many particles is to determine their pair potential or the forces among a single pair, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of complex systems.
2. If the governing physical equations are linear, the approach of linear superposition of pair potentials yields a quantitatively reliable description of the physical system considered.
3. However, if nonlinearities are present, linear superposition of pair potentials is no longer accurate, and nonadditivity gives rise to many-body effects, which can lead to a strengthening or weakening of the total force acting on a particle.
4. Many-body effects appear in diverse systems, including nuclear matter, superconductivity, colloidal suspensions, quantum-electrodynamic Casimir forces, polymers, nematic colloids, and noble gases with van der Waals forces.
5. The authors study critical Casimir forces (CCFs) for a system composed of two equally sized spherical colloids immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture and close to a laterally homogeneous substrate.
6. They calculate the total normal and lateral forces acting on one of the colloids for several geometrical configurations of the system and various combinations of boundary conditions at the colloids.
7. The authors find that the scaling function of the total normal CCF acting on colloid (2) changes sign for a fixed value of the scaling variable as the distance between colloid (2) and the substrate increases.
8. They also find that the many-body contribution to the normal CCF acting on colloid (1) is directed towards the substrate if the colloids have the same boundary conditions, whereas for colloids with opposite boundary conditions, the many-body contribution is directed away from the substrate.
9. The authors compare their results with corresponding ones for quantum-electrodynamic Casimir interactions and find that the many-body contribution to the lateral CCF is always attractive, regardless of the boundary conditions.
10. They also compare their results with the corresponding ones for the case of two atoms close to the planar surface of a solid body and find that the many-body contribution to the lateral van der Waals force is repulsive while the corresponding many-body CCF is attractive regardless of the set of boundary conditions.

1. The MOPED algorithm is a patented method for compressing data and speeding up the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis. It is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix is dependent on the parameters of the model. However, it has limitations, such as guaranteeing only the maintenance of the Fisher matrix at a chosen point. This means that multimodal and degenerate distributions may present a problem.

2. The MOPED algorithm works by compressing the data into a set of independent and unit variance values, which simplifies the likelihood calculation. This compression is done by generating a set of weighting vectors from the theoretical model and data. The weighting vectors must be computed at some assumed fiducial set of parameter values. The choice of fiducial parameters is crucial, as it affects the accuracy of the MOPED likelihood.

3. The MOPED algorithm has the benefit of requiring only a single compression of the data, which can be reused for different parameter values. This makes it more efficient than the original likelihood calculation. However, the compression is done at the cost of potentially introducing degeneracies in the likelihood function. These degeneracies can lead to multiple peaks in the MOPED likelihood.

4. The MOPED algorithm assumes that the covariance matrix is independent of the parameters, which is not always the case. This assumption can lead to a speed reduction, but it is a necessary step before addressing a more complex noise model. The MOPED algorithm can be iterated to improve the accuracy of the likelihood function. However, this iteration can be computationally expensive.

5. The MOPED algorithm has been tested on a variety of astrophysical scenarios, including gravitational wave data analysis for the LISA detector. In these scenarios, the MOPED algorithm has been shown to provide orders of magnitude improvement in runtime. However, it has also been shown to produce erroneous peaks in the likelihood function. These peaks can impede parameter estimation.

6. The MOPED algorithm can create multiple peaks in the likelihood function due to degeneracies in the model. These degeneracies can interact with the model's intrinsic degeneracy, leading to multiple peaks. The set of intersections of contour surfaces determines where these additional peaks are located. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to find these contours.

1. Spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkalies have benefited from high-precision experimental techniques, allowing for measurements of energy separations with great accuracy. The hydrogen-like structure of these atoms makes interpretation of experimental results straightforward in terms of electromagnetic fields generated by the valence electron and nuclear moments. This has led to renewed interest in improving calculations in other states where theoretical methods are yet to be tested against experimental results.

2. Precise measurements in excited states, beyond the first one, have several experimental complications, including low population transfer to the intermediate level and the lack of readily available detectors at the desired frequency. Standard spectroscopic techniques rely on the high population of atoms in the ground state to guarantee a good signal-to-noise ratio of the fluorescence or absorption of the atomic sample. In two-step transitions, this is no longer the case.

3. Two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy is presented as a tool for studies of atomic properties of higher excited states, overcoming the two main inconveniences of direct absorption of the probing laser: low signal-to-noise ratio and non-availability of detectors at the desired wavelength. The method consists of two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapor, with one of the lasers modulated before being directed to the interaction region. The non-linear interaction of the lasers burns a hole in the atomic ground state population, generating spectra with sub-Doppler peaks and trademark sidebands.

4. The technique is illustrated with two ladder systems, where the amplitude of the probe laser is modulated in the first system and the pump frequency is modulated in the second system. The frequency modulation of the pump laser and good signal-to-noise ratio allow for locking the probe laser to the excited atomic resonance, making the probe laser modulation-free. This is highly desired since electronic modulation of the laser itself can carry unwanted effects.

The experimental setup consists of a coherent 899-01 Ti:Sapphire laser as the pump laser, a small amount of laser power from the pump laser is frequency modulated by a small bandwidth electro-optical modulator, and sent to a glass cell filled with rubidium at room temperature to lock the laser frequency to the crossover line of the hyperfine levels.

1. The zero-field Hall effect in chiral p-wave superconductors has drawn significant attention in recent literature due to the possibility of nonzero Hall conductivity in a broken time-reversal symmetry state. This phenomenon arises from the intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs and spontaneous surface currents.

2. The Hall conductivity in chiral p-wave superconductors has been studied in various contexts, including impurity effects and multiband superconducting structures, which can provide possible explanations for the observed polar Kerr effect in Sr2RuO4. In this work, the authors investigate the zero-field Hall effect in a chiral p-wave superconductor originating from another mechanism, namely the vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition.

3. The KT transition is a phase transition phenomenon in two-dimensional superfluid or superconducting films, where quantized vortices are realized as topological defects in the condensates. The authors generalize the Ahns' vortex dynamics in the chiral p-wave context to describe the vortex-antivortex bound pair dynamics.

5. The authors investigate the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor, treating the bound pair and free vortex contributions separately. They find that the Hall conductivity can be nonzero even in the absence of a magnetic field, arising from the vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process or from free vortex motion.

6. The authors also discuss the power dissipation in this dynamical picture, which is predicted to be finite in the high-temperature phase. They find that the Hall conductivity and power dissipation are strongly influenced by the dip-recouping shape of the transverse response function, which stems from the asymmetric angular response of pairs to the driving field.

1. The measurement of the rotation curves (rcs) of disk galaxies is a powerful tool to investigate the nature of dark matter (DM), including its content relative to the baryonic components and their distributions. Dwarf galaxies are good candidates to reach this aim as their kinematics are generally dominated by the dark component.

2. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a nearby system that harbors an extended disk, making it an important test of the paradigm that DM halos have a constant density core. The galaxy's kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored profile.

The Mond scenario advocates that the gravitational force at low accelerations leaves the standard Newtonian regime to enter a very different one, rather than postulating the existence of a dark halo made by massive collisionless elementary particles. This scenario has generally been successful in reproducing the rcs of spiral galaxies with only the observed luminous matter.

The Orion dwarf galaxy is a very useful laboratory for testing the Mond formalism due to its high-quality, high-resolution rc, which can be easily corrected for asymmetric drift and tested for non-circular motions. The galaxy's distance to the galaxy, which is critical for an unambiguous test of Mond, is estimated to be 5.4 ± 1.0 Mpc.

The neutral gas disk of the Orion dwarf shows rich morphological and kinematic structure at a physical resolution of 20, with column densities rising above the 5 × 10^17 cm^-2 level at intermediate radii. The disk is dominated by circular motion, with twisted iso-velocity contours at inner radii coinciding with the ""holes"" near the center of the disk.

6. The rc of the galaxy was derived by fitting a tilted ring model to the intensity-weighted mean velocity field, with the best-fitting parameters being v_rot = 50.3 ± 4.5 km/s and (l, b) = (05:45:01.66, 05:03:55.2) for the dynamical center. The inclination is not dependent on the radius, and the fit is shown in figure (inclusion).

7. The second-order moment map for the galaxy shows that the velocity dispersion is roughly constant at 7 ± 2 km/s throughout most of the disk, with a more complex behavior near the galaxy center and at the outermost radii. The velocity dispersion estimate allows us to derive the asymmetric drift correction to the rc yielded by the tilted ring model.

1. The trihydrogen dication, consisting of three protons and one electron, is a simple Coulomb system that has been studied intensely in the 1960s and 1970s. Conroy investigated the potential energy surfaces of the electronic ground state and the lowest excited states at linear and isosceles triangular configurations. He employed a variational approach and concluded that the trihydrogen dication is not stable. Conroy's results were later assessed by Berkowitz and Stocker, who searched for the ion through charge stripping experiments.

2. Berkowitz and Stocker could not find evidence of stable trihydrogen dication, and the issue was reconsidered from the theoretical side by Shoucri and Darling, who examined equilateral configurations with the variational linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method. Hernández and Carb studied two particular configurations with a more compact variational approach and obtained total energy values below those published before. However, no bound state has been determined in these calculations. The problem of the stability of trihydrogen dication was treated by Johnson and Poshusta, who reported another single-point calculation in the context of Gaussian basis set optimization.

3. About twenty years later, Ackermann et al. revisited the question about the existence of trihydrogen dication using the finite element method, which provided much higher accuracy than previously achieved. The authors excluded the possibility of stable trihydrogen dication in the electronic ground state. However, the explicit electronic energy data are reported only for one particular equilateral triangular configuration. The question of the stability of trihydrogen dication is thus addressed once again in the present study.

4. One of the motivations of the present study is related to the fact that trihydrogen dication in equilateral triangular configuration may exist as a metastable state in a magnetic field. The system consists of one electron and three protons that form an equilateral triangle of size R. The protons are assumed to be infinitely massive according to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation at zero order. The Schrödinger equation for the system is written as Hψ = Eψ, where H is the Hamiltonian operator.

5. Atomic units are used throughout, although energies are expressed in Rydbergs (Ry). The goal is to study the stability of the molecular ion trihydrogen dication. If such an ion exists, it implies the existence of the ground state of the system. Based on symmetry arguments, it seems evident",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40}"

1. Recent investigations of galaxy distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have revealed a complex relationship between galaxy properties and their environments.
2. Galaxy clustering is found to be a function of both star formation history and luminosity, with low-luminosity galaxies clustering strongly by color and luminous galaxies clustering strongly by luminosity.
3. The study of galaxy environments as a function of luminosity and color has shown that red galaxies tend to be in overdense regions, and this relationship persists down to low luminosities.
4. The dependence of mean environment on color persists to the lowest luminosities explored, with red, low-luminosity galaxies tending to be in overdense regions.
5. The study found that a correlation function with a stronger amplitude implies a correlation function with a steeper slope.
6. The overdensity on large scales does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of galaxies in regions of a given overdensity on small scales.

1. The source document discusses the role of transverse spin fluctuations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry. These fluctuations are gapless, low-energy excitations that play a crucial role in various macroscopic properties, such as the existence of long-range order and the magnitude of the order parameter. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are important in both two and three dimensions. They significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in two dimensions.

2. The document highlights the importance of transverse spin fluctuations in the strong-coupling limit, where spin fluctuations are strongest. In this limit, they reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in two dimensions to nearly 0.6 of the classical value. Similarly, the Néel temperature in three dimensions is reduced to nearly 0.7 of the mean-field result for the equivalent quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet (QHA). The document also mentions the recent interest in spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet.

3. The random-α model is introduced, where α is set to zero on a fraction of sites. The lattice-averaged AF order parameter appears to be enhanced for small α, presumably due to the suppression of quantum spin fluctuations. On the other hand, spin fluctuations are enhanced by strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies. In the strong disorder regime, the overlap of the two Hubbard bands leads to the formation of essentially empty and doubly-occupied sites, which act like spin vacancies.

4. The document describes a new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state. The method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model. The method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators. The time-ordered, transverse spin propagator for sites i and j at the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) level is written in frequency space as χ^(0)(ω)/[1 - uχ^(0)(ω)], where χ^(0)(ω) is the zeroth-order, antiparallel-spin particle-hole propagator.

1. The study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory, particularly in cosmology, has received significant attention in recent years, driven by the need to understand inflation and its dynamics.
2. Researchers have developed a formalism to address the dynamics of nonequilibrium, coupled, time-varying scalar fields, which can be renormalized by dimensional regularization, and have applied it to a two-field case to study the behavior of quantized mode functions and the effect of fluctuations on the zero mode equations of motion.
3. The study reveals that the fluctuations in a supersymmetric hybrid model do not grow if the back reaction of the fluctuations is taken into account in the mean field evolution, and that the production of particles from the vacuum fluctuations is not excessive, which requires a careful revaluation of the successes of the production of weakly interacting massive particles and baryogenesis via out-of-equilibrium decay in supersymmetric hybrid inflationary models.

1. The existence of dark matter (DM) has been established, and its thermal relic abundance has been determined by the WMAP experiment. The weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a promising candidate for DM if its essence is an elementary particle. The WIMP DM candidate can be accommodated economically by introducing an inert scalar field.

2. The imposed parity ensures the stability of the DM candidate, and phenomenology in such models has been studied. On the other hand, neutrino oscillation measurements have confirmed that neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses compared to the electroweak scale. Many models have been proposed to explain tiny neutrino masses.

3. The seesaw mechanism is the simplest way to explain tiny neutrino masses, where right-handed neutrinos are introduced with large Majorana masses. Another simple model for generating neutrino masses is the Higgs Triplet Model (HTM). However, these scenarios do not contain a DM candidate in themselves.

4. In a class of models where tiny neutrino masses are generated by higher orders of perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained. The HTM is extended by introducing a new scalar field that breaks lepton number conservation, which generates the DM candidate. The new scalar field is a complex singlet scalar with non-zero lepton number.

5. The DM candidate in our model is made from a real inert singlet scalar and a doublet scalar field. The interaction that is the origin of the neutrino masses is induced at the one-loop level while the interaction exists at the tree level. The model gives small neutrino masses naturally without using very heavy particles.

6. The suppression factor of the DM relic abundance is constrained by the WMAP experiment, and we have shown that it is possible to obtain a suppression factor of 0.1. The characteristic feature of the model is that the mass scale of the triplet field is not small while the parameter that generates the neutrino masses can be small. A possible collider signature that depends on the mass scale of the triplet field would be the final state with two charged leptons and jets.

7. The Higgs potential of our model is given by a set of coupling constants, and all coupling constants are real because the phases of the scalar fields can be absorbed. The mass eigenstates of two CP-even neutral scalars are obtained as a combination of the doublet and singlet scalar fields. The masses of the two scalars are given by a set of equations.

1. The introduction of new quantum mechanical technologies promises to fundamentally alter the way we communicate, with quantum key distribution (QKD) allowing for intrinsically secure communication.
2. However, new quantum communication technologies will require a new telecommunications infrastructure that is quantum-enabled, capable of properly accommodating the quantum properties that quantum communications inherently rely on.
3. A quantum network will contain many novel components, such as quantum memories, quantum repeaters, or quantum channels, which must each operate in a strictly quantum way.
4. To deal with imperfections in quantum technologies, we can shift our efforts into classical post-processing of data, but the question remains of how much imperfection can be tolerated before a device is no longer operating in a sufficiently quantum way.
5. To enforce a minimal quantum requirement on devices, we can insist that they do not act as measure and prepare channels, which destroy any quantum correlations in bipartite states.
6. To quantify the quantum behavior of a channel, we can use entanglement measures, such as the secret key rate, or ask how well the channel preserves quantum correlations in bipartite systems.
7. A strong quantum channel is one that preserves all or nearly all of the quantum correlations, and this idea corresponds to what we call the quantum throughput.
8. To estimate the quantum throughput of a device, we can use a method based on homodyne measurements, which allows us to determine the amount of effective entanglement observable in an optical system after transmission through an optical channel.

1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided a wealth of information on subatomic physics over the past 83 years. The pioneering work of Stern and the discovery of the large anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron laid the groundwork for the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the renormalizable theory of QED. The Dirac equation tells us that for spin-one-half point-like particles, the gyromagnetic ratio is 2, and is unity for orbital angular momentum. The anomaly arises from radiative corrections, which can be calculated through various orders.

2. The electron anomaly is now measured to a relative precision of about four parts in a billion, which is better than the precision on the fine-structure constant. The muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million. The relative contributions of heavier particles to the anomaly scale as the inverse of their mass, so the muon has an increased sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections. The muon anomaly is sensitive to physics at the 100 GeV scale.

3. The standard model value of the anomaly has measurable contributions from three types of radiative processes: QED loops containing leptons and photons, hadronic loops containing hadrons in vacuum polarization loops, and weak loops involving the W and Z weak gauge bosons. A significant difference between the experimental value and the standard model prediction would signify the presence of new physics. The hadronic contribution can not be calculated directly from QCD, but dispersion theory gives a relationship between the vacuum polarization loop and the cross section for e+e- annihilation. The factor in the dispersion relation means that values of at low energies dominate the determination of.

1. A recent paper by Li et al. presented a new design for an optomechanical system consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which has several attractive features, including universality and the ability to study reactive effects in optomechanical coupling. The origin of the reactive coupling lies in the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator.

2. The design enables the study of reactive effects without cooling the system to its ground state, which is desirable for studying quantum effects at the macroscopic scale. The authors examine other possibilities to investigate the effects arising from strong reactive coupling.

3. Since optomechanical coupling effects are intrinsically nonlinear, the authors examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields. They report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting.

4. In previous works on normal mode splitting in optomechanical devices, only dispersive coupling was used, whereas in this paper, the authors report on normal mode splitting due to reactive effects. The paper is organized into several sections to discuss the physical system, time evolutions, and expectation values of the system operators.

5. The authors consider a system where a microdisk cavity is coupled to a freestanding waveguide, and a strong pump field with frequency ω0 and a weak stokes field with frequency ω1 enter the system through the waveguide. The waveguide will move along the x-direction under the action of the optical force exerted by the photons from the cavity.

6. The Hamiltonian of the system is given by a combination of terms representing the energy of the cavity field, the energy of the waveguide, and the interactions between the waveguide and the incident fields. The latter two terms describe the coupling of the cavity field to the pump field and the stokes field, respectively.

7. The authors apply the Heisenberg equation of motion and add damping terms to obtain the time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators. They use the mean-field assumption and expand the cavity decay rate to the first order of the displacement of the waveguide.

8. The steady-state solution of the equations contains an infinite number of frequencies, but the authors simplify the solution to first order in the stokes field. They find that the expectation values of the system operators oscillate at three frequencies: ω0, ω1, and 2ω0.

The mission has found that small planets are nearly ubiquitous and that some of the most common planets have sizes between Earth-sized and Neptune-sized.

2. The Kepler pipeline assumes that all host stars are single, but this assumption can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions. The presence of a stellar companion does not necessarily invalidate a planetary candidate, but it does change the observed transit depths and the resulting planetary radii.

3. The authors have explored the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and the resulting derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample. They have considered six specific multiplicity scenarios, including single star, binary star, and triple star systems.

4. The authors have calculated the possible factor by which the planetary radii are underestimated for each Kepler candidate, taking into account the probability that a star may be a multiple star, the distribution of mass ratios, and the probability that a planet orbits any one star. They have found that the mean correction factor for each multiplicity scenario depends on the stellar temperature of the host star.

5. The authors have also explored the effectiveness of observational vetting, including radial velocity and high-resolution imaging, in reducing the radii corrections factors and the associated radii uncertainties. They have assumed that every Kepler candidate has been vetted equally, and all companions within the reach of the observations have been detected and accounted for.

6. The authors have found that if the Kepler objects of interest are all assumed to be single, then the fraction of Earth-sized planets may be overestimated by as much as 15-20% and the fraction of large planets may be underestimated by as much as 30%. However, if all of the Kepler candidates undergo vetting via radial velocity and high-resolution imaging, the fractional changes to these bin fractions are much smaller.

1. The range of HI column densities observed in nearby galaxies is similar to those seen in Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (DLAs). Mapping the HI gas of DLAs in 21-cm emission and measuring their total gas mass, disk extent, and dynamics would provide a direct link between DLAs and local galaxies. However, such studies are currently impossible with present technology.

2. The detection of DLAs as absorbers in background QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, as it depends on the brightness of the background source rather than the redshift of the absorber. The lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground due to the Earth's atmosphere being opaque to UV wavelengths. The redshift number density of DLAs decreases rapidly towards lower redshifts.

3. Due to the limitations of current technology, there are not many DLAs known whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present-day radio telescopes. Observers often resort to optical wavelengths to study DLAs, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been unsuccessful. A few positive identifications have been made, mostly using HST imaging.

4. Early surveys for low-redshift DLA host galaxies consisted of broad-band imaging without spectroscopic follow-up. Later studies aimed to measure redshifts to determine the association of optically identified galaxies with DLAs. There are now 11 known DLA galaxies at low redshift.

5. The galaxies span a wide range of properties, from inconspicuous LSB dwarfs to giant spirals and early-type galaxies. The identification of DLA host galaxies is difficult, as most are expected to be sub-luminous and many are dwarfs. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys have resulted in an accurate measurement of the HI mass function.

6. The HI mass function can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLA studies. However, due to the large beam widths of single-dish instruments, these surveys barely resolve the detected galaxies and are not useful in constraining the column density distribution function of HI.

1. The formation of stars is thought to occur primarily in star clusters, with only a small percentage of gas being converted into stars during the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud. This process is well understood theoretically, but its effects have received little consideration in observational studies of young massive star clusters. The initial phases of a star cluster's lifetime are characterized by a combination of gas and stars.

2. As stellar winds and supernovae explosions occur, enough energy is injected into the gas within the embedded cluster to remove it on timescales shorter than a crossing time. This process is expected to be instantaneous, occurring in less than a crossing time. The resulting cluster, devoid of gas, is far out of equilibrium due to the rapid change in gravitational potential energy.

3. The effects of gas expulsion on young clusters have been studied theoretically, but its effects have received little consideration in observational studies. Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying their internal dynamics. However, these studies have found discrepant results, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard Kroupa or Salpeter-type IMFs.

4. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, with younger clusters showing a significant scatter. They suggested that this is due to the youngest clusters being out of equilibrium, hence undercutting the underlying assumption of virial equilibrium. To test this scenario, the authors looked at the detailed luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters.

5. The authors observed the clusters M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1 using the Hubble Space Telescope and found that they display excess light at large radii compared to King or EFF profiles. This excess light is a signature of violent relaxation after gas expulsion. The authors suggest that this is due to the rapid removal of gas from the clusters.

6. The authors modeled the effects of gas expulsion on young clusters using N-body simulations and found that they produce the same excess light at large radii as observed in the clusters. They also found that gas expulsion can cause virial mass estimates to be significantly wrong for several tens of millions of years. This suggests that claims of unusual IMFs for young star clusters are probably in error.

1. The study explores the relationship between quantum fluctuations, tunneling, and decoherence in a one-dimensional double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field. The system exhibits both coherent and irregular motions, depending on the perturbation strength and the number of frequency components. The transition from coherent to irregular motion is characterized by a decrease in the degree of coherence.

2. The degree of coherence is used to estimate the difference between coherent and incoherent motions, and it is found to be almost the same as the unperturbed case in the coherent motion regime. In the irregular motion regime, the value of the degree of coherence becomes much smaller. The critical value of the perturbation strength that divides the behavior of the transition probability into regular and irregular motions depends on the number of frequency components.

3. Within the regular motion range, the period of the tunneling oscillation is reduced with an increase in the number of colors and/or the strength of the perturbation. This can be explained by the increase of the instanton tunneling rate due to the appearance of the stochastic layer near the separatrix. The perturbed instanton picture is one of the expressions for chaos-assisted tunneling.

4. In the irregular motion regime in the polychromatically perturbed cases, the growth of the uncertainty product initially increases and saturates at a certain level due to quantum interference. On the other hand, in the stochastically perturbed case, the uncertainty product grows unboundedly because the external stochasticity breaks the quantum interference in the internal dynamics. The growth of the uncertainty product is strongly related to the growth of the energy of the wave packet.

5. The quantum fluctuation is always large for classically chaotic trajectories compared to regular ones, implying that the quantum corrections to the evolution of the phase space fluctuation become more dominant for classically chaotic trajectories. The partial quantum fluctuation in the semiquantal approximation enhances the chaotic behavior, and simultaneously, the chaos enhances the tunneling and decoherence of the wave packet. The quantum fluctuation observed in the semiquantal picture is suppressed by the interference effect in the fully quantum motion.

6. The semiquantal picture cannot apply to the chaos-induced delocalized states. The classical phase space portraits in the polychromatically perturbed double-well system show chaotic behavior due to the oscillatory force. The classical stroboscopic phase space portrait changes with the perturbation parameters, and increasing the perturbation strength destroys the separatrix and forms a chaotic layer in the vicinity",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30}"

1. The study of dissipative quantum dynamics in complex environments is crucial in various sub-disciplines of physics and chemistry. The Caldeira-Leggett model and spin-boson model are two prototypical models that have been extensively studied, but they have limitations in predicting the behavior of systems in certain scenarios. More advanced models, such as the fermionic bath model, have been proposed to address these limitations.

2. The stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) is a fundamental equation that describes the dynamics of open quantum systems. The SLE can be used to derive deterministic numerical methods, such as the generalized hierarchical equations (GHE), to simulate the dynamics of open quantum systems. The GHE can be used to study various types of baths, including bosonic, fermionic, and spin baths.

3. The study of spin baths is particularly important, as they can exhibit very different physical properties from standard heat baths. The spin bath can be mapped onto an effective fermionic problem using the dual-fermion representation, which allows for the use of GHE to simulate the dynamics of the spin bath. This approach can be used to study the behavior of spin baths in various scenarios.

4. The GHE method has been applied to various numerical examples, including the pure dephasing model and the spin-star model. The results show that the GHE method can provide accurate accounts of quantum dynamics induced by spin baths, even in scenarios where the bath is composed of many identical spins. The GHE method can be used to study the behavior of spin baths in various scenarios, including the weak and strong coupling limits.

1. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics is a well-established theory, but the torque between anisotropic materials has received less attention, with only theoretical derivations and no experimental attempts to demonstrate the effect.

2. The authors propose a simpler experimental approach to measure the torque induced by quantum fluctuations between a birefringent disk and a batio8 plate immersed in liquid ethanol, where the disk would float on top of the plate at a small distance.

3. The force between the disk and the plate was calculated according to Lifshitz's theory, and the results show that the force is repulsive at large distances and attractive for smaller separations.

4. The authors calculated the expected torque between the disk and the plate in liquid ethanol as a function of angle and distance, and the results show that the torque varies as ω0 and has maximum magnitude at ω90 and ω5.

5. The authors propose an experimental set-up to measure the rotation of the disk, where a 100 mw laser beam is used to rotate the disk until ω90, and then the laser beam is shuttered to stop the light-induced rotation, allowing the disk to return to its equilibrium position solely driven by the torque arising from quantum fluctuations.

1. The study of complex networks has gained significant attention in recent years, with applications in various fields such as computer science, biology, social science, and finance. A central problem in network science is the study of random walks on a graph, particularly the relation between topological properties and diffusion properties. This subject has important implications for various scientific issues, including epidemics and web page classification.

2. The authors introduce a new framework for the study of topologically biased random walks on graphs, which allows for the efficient exploration of network structure. This approach is motivated by the idea that biased random walks can be efficiently used for community finding. The authors introduce a set of mathematical tools to investigate the ""bias parameters"" space and apply them to uncover details in the spectra of graph transition matrices.

3. The authors consider biases that are self-consistently related to graph topological properties, such as vertex properties (degree, clustering, etc.) or edge properties (multiplicity or shortest path betweenness). They choose a specific form for the weights, which tunes the strength of the bias, and derive the transition matrix entries. The authors find that this choice of bias permits a unique representation of any given network via the operator.

4. The authors introduce a symmetric matrix, which shares the same eigenvalues with the original matrix but has a different set of eigenvectors. This allows for the definition of a meaningful distance between vertices, which can provide important additional information in the problem of community partition of complex networks. The authors use perturbation theory to study the dependence of the spectrum on the bias parameter.

5. The authors study the behavior of the spectral gap, which measures how fast the information on the random walk initial distribution is destroyed and the stationary distribution is approached. They find that the spectral gap has a well-defined maximum, which implies that it is a stationary point for the function. The authors conclude that the local spectral maximum is achieved if the average difference between property and its expectation, with respect to a particular measure, in the neighborhood of vertex vanishes.

6. The authors propose a novel methodology for community detection using topologically biased random walks. They suggest that vertices belonging to the same community should have similar values of eigenvectors components, and relevant eigenvectors should have the largest eigenvalues. The authors test their approach on the Girvan-Newman benchmark and find that the number of communities is related to the number of eigenvalues in the ""community band"".

1. The source document discusses the concept of gravity as a universal and fundamental force, and how anything with energy creates gravity and is affected by it. The document also mentions that the smallness of Newton's constant often means that classical effects are too weak to be measurable. This leads to the discussion of quantum gravity and its effects on spacetime.

2. The document explains that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) breaks down for energies close to the Planck scale, resulting in a minimum measurable length. This prediction is largely model-independent and can be understood as the breakdown of the HUP for high energies. The Schwarzschild radius and Compton wavelength become comparable to the Planck length at this point.

3. The document discusses the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and its implications on the measurement of spacetime distances and the synchronization of clocks. The GUP is a modification of the HUP that takes into account the effects of quantum gravity. The document mentions that the GUP can influence almost any system with a well-defined Hamiltonian.

4. The document presents two formulations of the GUP, represented by equations [uncert1] and [comm01]. These equations imply a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum. The document also discusses the dimensionless parameter α, which is normally assumed to be of the order of unity.

5. The document explains that if α is not assumed to be of the order of unity, current experiments predict large upper bounds on it, which are compatible with current observations. This may signal the existence of a new length scale. The document also mentions that such an intermediate length scale cannot exceed the electroweak length scale.

6. The document discusses the doubly special relativity (DSR) theories, which predict maximum observable momenta. These theories also suggest a similar modification of commutators, which are consistent with string theory, black holes physics, and DSR. The document presents the commutators that lead to the GUP.

2. The authors discuss various approaches to computing couplings, including perturbative methods, integrability, and the AdS/CFT duality. They also consider the deformation of the CFT with a marginal or irrelevant operator, which introduces new divergences in the renormalized operators.

This scheme enables the Dirac equation to be solved within region i while accounting for the influence of region ii through an additional term added to the Hamiltonian for region i.

2. The scheme is derived using a trial function in which continuity in the small component across the surface @xmath1 is imposed variationally, and expanding the wave function in a basis set of separate large and small component spinors helps to avoid variational collapse. Calculating the spectrum of a confined hydrogen atom, the method is shown to be stable and converge to the exact eigenvalues.

1. Open dielectric resonators have received significant attention due to their various applications, including microlasers and sensors. They are also used as paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths. Wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength have been treated successfully with semiclassical methods.

2. These methods provide approximate solutions in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system. In the case of dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard. Inside the billiard, rays travel freely while, when impinging the boundary, they are partially reflected and refracted to the outside according to Snell's law and the Fresnel formulas. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard.

3. The semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics. One of the most important tools in semiclassical physics are trace formulas, which relate the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system. Recently, a trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators was developed. The trace formula was successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and with polymer microlasers of various shapes.

4. However, typical microlasers like those used in refs. are three-dimensional (3D) systems. While trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators. The main reason is the difficulty of the numerical solution of the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities. The case of flat microlasers is special since their in-plane extensions are large compared to the typical wavelength, whereas their height is smaller than or of the order of the wavelength.

5. Even in this case, complete numerical solutions are rarely performed. In practice, flat dielectric cavities are treated as 2D systems by introducing a so-called effective index of refraction. This approximation has been used in refs. and a good overall agreement between the experiments and the theory was found.

The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) may radiate about 10^46 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory.

2. The rate at which DNS coalescence events occur in the local universe is another parameter characterizing their potential as sources of gravitational waves. Despite the large amount of work performed in the past years, uncertainties persist in estimates of the DNS coalescence rate.

3. The authors have predicted a detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations. The superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts will produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves.

The simulations indicate that a truly continuous background is formed only when sources located beyond a certain redshift, including 96% of all events.

1. The phenomenon of diffusive acceleration at Newtonian shock fronts is extensively studied, and while much is well understood, some issues are still debated due to their theoretical and phenomenological implications. The backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock is a crucial aspect of this phenomenon, which occurs when the acceleration process becomes efficient enough to generate pressures comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure. This backreaction changes the spectrum of particles and the structure of the shock, making it an intrinsically nonlinear phenomenon. Theoretical and numerical approaches have been developed to account for this backreaction.

2. There are three viable approaches to account for the backreaction of particles on the shock: numerical simulations, fluid approaches, and analytical approaches. Numerical simulations allow for a self-consistent treatment of several effects, while fluid approaches treat cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid. Analytical approaches, such as perturbative and non-perturbative methods, provide a way to understand the physics of nonlinear effects in a way that is sometimes difficult to achieve through simulations. These approaches have been used to study the effects of backreaction on the maximum achievable energy of particles.

3. The analytical approach used in this work is a generalization of the method introduced in a previous paper to describe nonlinear shock acceleration with monochromatic injection of quasi-thermal particles. The approach is based on the diffusion-convection equation for cosmic rays, which is solved in the presence of seed nonthermal particles. The solution is obtained by introducing a quantity called the average fluid velocity experienced by particles with momentum p, which is instrumental in understanding the nonlinear backreaction of particles. This approach allows for the calculation of the spectrum of accelerated particles and the structure of the shock.

The solution is obtained by integrating the equation around a point far upstream and using the boundary condition at the shock. The resulting equation is an integral-differential nonlinear equation for the compression factor at the gas subshock.

The equation is solved by introducing a dimensionless quantity that represents the ratio of the cosmic ray pressure to the gas pressure at upstream infinity.

1. The universe's accelerating phase is supported by cosmological observations from type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large-scale structure. This result is attributed to the existence of dark energy, an exotic energy source with negative pressure. Dark energy eventually dominates over cold dark matter, driving the universe's accelerating expansion.

2. The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, which has an equation-of-state parameter. Although this model agrees with current observations, it is plagued by difficulties related to the small observational value of dark energy density. The cosmological constant problem arises from the discrepancy between the observed and expected values of dark energy density.

3. Over the past decade, several dark energy models have been proposed, including quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, and generalized chaplygin gas. These models aim to explain the universe's accelerating expansion and the observed properties of dark energy. However, they often suffer from theoretical and observational constraints.

4. An alternative approach to dark energy is to modify the gravitational sector itself, such as by introducing higher curvature invariants or coupling the Ricci scalar to a scalar field. These modifications can lead to effective dark energy without the need for a separate dark energy component. The teleparallel gravity approach is another alternative, which describes the gravitational field in terms of torsion instead of curvature.

5. Teleparallel gravity is closely related to general relativity, except for ""boundary terms"" that involve total derivatives in the action. The teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) is completely equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but is based on torsion instead of curvature. This approach has several attractive features related to geometrical and physical aspects.

6. The main advantage of teleparallel gravity is that the field equations are 2nd-order ones, making these theories simpler compared to extended theories of gravity. The aim of this paper is to explore the implications of teleparallel gravity on the formation of light elements in the early universe, specifically big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). BBN has occurred between the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang and a few hundred seconds later.

1. In standard cosmology, the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated based on measurements of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. This length scale, known as the ""standard ruler,"" can be used to measure the matter and energy content of the universe. By measuring this scale at low redshifts, such as in large galaxy redshift surveys, we can constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.

2. However, if the CMB measurements were misled by some new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, the misinterpretation could potentially spread to the low-redshift application and bias the inferences. Fortunately, the interpretation of the low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality. These quantities are robustly measured in the CMB.

3. The actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation, and only their ratio matters. This means that even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, the inferences for dark energy from the combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged. Knowledge of actual densities translates into improved constraints on the Hubble constant.

4. The acoustic peak method depends upon measuring the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination. Nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination. The sound horizon integral depends only on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma.

5. The sound speed depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and is well measured in the CMB. The baryon-to-photon ratio is also exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum by both the ratios of the odd and even acoustic peaks and by the Silk damping tail. This measurement is robust and insensitive to the cosmology.

6. The epoch of recombination is controlled by atomic physics and is very insensitive to the cosmology. For reasonable changes in the early universe and our current uncertainties of the theory of recombination, any shift in the epoch of recombination is negligible. The baryon-to-photon ratio is also well measured in the CMB.

The Super-Kamiokande experiment has provided positive indications of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, and similar indications have come from other experiments. The solar neutrino experiments have also provided independent evidence for neutrino oscillations. These experiments have played an important role in understanding neutrino masses.

2. The LSND experiment at Los Alamos has reported evidence for neutrino oscillation, and accelerator and reactor experiments have furnished strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters. The neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles are hoped to be determined from new experimental results. These parameters may help to infer the neutrino mass matrix, which is a possible gateway to a more fundamental theory beyond the Standard Model. The true answer to the question of neutrino masses is still unknown.

3. To make progress in this direction, various plausible ansatze for the neutrino mass matrix are being investigated. One such ansatz is proposed for the 3-generation neutrino mass matrix, which can be motivated from an SO(10) grand unified model. The ansatz corresponds to the well-known approximate signature of grand unification. It can be combined with experimental information to get an idea of the neutrino masses themselves and the ""texture"" of the mass matrix.

4. In the SO(10) grand unified model, each generation contains one light massive two-component neutrino and also a very heavy one, which is ""integrated out"" according to the ""seesaw mechanism"". The effective neutrino mass matrix takes the form of the sum of the mass matrices of the light neutrinos, heavy neutrinos, and heavy-light mixing. The second term, the seesaw term, is generally considered to dominate. However, the first term is assumed to be the dominant one for the present derivation of the ansatz.

5. The SO(10) model has Higgs mesons belonging to the 10, 120, and 126 representations, which can contribute to the fermion masses at tree level. The down quark, charged lepton, and light neutrino mass matrices are given by the product of the Higgs meson vacuum values and the Yukawa-type constants. The matrices are symmetric or antisymmetric, depending on the representation of the Higgs meson. The renormalization factors are used to compare the quark masses with the charged lepton masses at a low energy scale.

1. The contact pattern among individuals in a population is a crucial factor in the spread of infectious diseases. Deterministic models often use a contact rate function to model transmission, which depends on the contact pattern and the probability of disease transmission. However, network analysis methods can provide a more precise understanding of the contact structure and its effects on disease spread.

2. Scale-free networks, which show a power-law degree distribution, are common in real-world networks, including human sexual contacts. These networks have a high degree of heterogeneity, with many vertices having a low number of contacts and a few vertices having a high number of contacts. This heterogeneity can influence the potential risk of disease spread.

3. Epidemic models, such as the susceptible-infected (SI) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models, have been used to model the transmission dynamics of diseases in scale-free networks. These models can provide insights into how to prevent and control diseases. Simulating the spread of diseases on these networks can help identify effective strategies for disease control.

4. The authors generated scale-free networks using the Barabasi-Albert (BA) algorithm and other methods, such as the Molloy-Reed (MR) and Kalisky algorithms. These networks have distinct structural properties, including centrality and efficiency. The BA networks are more centralized and efficient than the other networks.

5. The authors developed routines to simulate the spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases in these networks using the SI and SIS epidemic models. The simulations were carried out using MATLAB, and the results were analyzed to determine the prevalence of the disease in each network. The simulations were repeated 100 times for each network.

6. The results showed that the disease spread independently of the value of the probability of infection used in the simulations. However, an increase in the probability of infection led to an increase in the prevalence of the disease. The prevalence tended to stabilize at a similar level despite the addition of vertices.

In contrast, the BA networks presented the lowest values of prevalence in the directed networks. The Kalisky networks tended to stabilize at a higher level of prevalence than the other networks.

2. For small values of @xmath0, the LC spacetime describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass, while for larger values, it becomes flat. However, the behavior of the spacetime for values of @xmath0 outside the range (0, @xmath10) is still unclear.

3. The LC spacetime has been interpreted as the field of a cylinder only if @xmath0 ranges within the (0, @xmath10) interval. However, interior solutions matching to LC exist with @xmath0 outside this range, which raises questions about the interpretation of the spacetime.

1. Quantum information processing has attracted significant interest in recent years, following Deutsch's investigations into the potentiality of a quantum computer. This has led to the development of quantum information carriers, enabling secret communication, quantum networks, and more efficient quantum algorithms. The application of quantum information processing has numerous possibilities, including quantum cryptography and quantum algorithms.

2. The transmission of quantum information from one party (Alice) to another (Bob) through a communication channel is a fundamental aspect of quantum information processing. In the most basic configuration, the information is encoded in qubits, which are perfectly protected from environmental influence. However, in the more realistic case, the qubits have a nontrivial dynamics during transmission due to their interaction with the environment.

3. Investigations have focused mainly on two subjects: determining the channel capacity and reconstructing schemes for the original quantum state under the assumption that the action of the quantum channel is known. However, this paper focuses on the problem of determining the properties of the quantum channel, which has not been extensively investigated. The reliable transfer of quantum information requires a well-known intermediate device, and the knowledge of the channel's behavior is essential to construct quantum codes.

4. The goal of channel estimation is to specify the parameter vector that characterizes the quantum channel. Alice and Bob agree on a set of quantum states, which are prepared by Alice and then sent through the quantum channel. Bob receives the states and performs measurements on them to deduce an estimated vector that should be as close as possible to the underlying parameter vector of the quantum channel.

5. To quantify Bob's estimation, two errors or cost functions are introduced: the statistical error and the fidelity error. The statistical error is the average of the squared differences between the estimated parameter vector and the true parameter vector. The fidelity error is the average overlap between two quantum channels, which is a measure of how well the estimated channel matches the true channel.

6. The phase-damping channel acts only on two components of the Bloch vector, leaving the third one unchanged. The parameter of the phase-damping channel appears in the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, and the protocol for estimating this parameter involves sending qubits with the Bloch vector in the x-y plane and measuring the spin along the z-axis.

1. The hadronic final state of collisions at 200 GeV may provide a reference for other high-energy nuclear collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Claims for novel physics at higher energies or in different collision systems should be based on an accurate and self-consistent phenomenology for conventional processes at 200 GeV.

2. Current theoretical and experimental descriptions of high-energy collisions appear to be incomplete, with several unresolved aspects of collisions being notable. These include the role of collision centrality in relation to the low-x gluon transverse structure of the proton.

3. The nature and systematics of the underlying event (UE) defined as complementary to contributions from an event-wise-triggered high-energy dijet are also unresolved. The systematics of minimum-bias (MB) dijet production manifested in spectra and angular correlations are another open issue.

4. A more detailed discussion of these issues is presented in Section [issues]. In the present study, we establish a more complete mathematical model for phenomenology based on the x dependence of single-particle (SP) spectra and -integral densities and -integral 2D angular correlations.

5. We confront several issues, including whether there is any connection between x and centrality, and whether centrality is a relevant concept. A nonjet (NJ) quadrupole component in collisions is the complement to jet-related and projectile-fragment correlations.

6. The phenomenological model should offer a conceptual context with two manifestations: (a) as a mathematical framework to represent data systematics efficiently, and (b) as a theoretical framework to provide physical interpretation of model elements via comparisons between data structures and QCD theory.

7. Preliminary responses to such questions were presented in Ref. [ref], and are supplemented here by new SP density and 2D angular-correlation measurements. We emphasize the x dependence of angular correlations from collisions, extending the two-component model (TCM) to include a NJ quadrupole component.

8. We establish x-dependent phenomenology for soft (projectile proton dissociation), hard (parton fragmentation to MB dijets), and NJ quadrupole components in a three-component model and explore possible correspondence with centrality, UE structure, dijet production, and the partonic structure of projectile protons.

1. The principle of quantum superposition plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, and its destruction and preservation are central to issues such as the quantum-to-classical transition and potential technological applications in quantum information, computation, and cryptography.
2. The loss of coherence in quantum systems is rooted in the pervasive action of the environment, and a careful mathematical treatment of this environmental action has been developed, including tracing-out methods and axiomatic approaches.
3. A novel attempt to derive master equations using stochastic methods and operator techniques has been developed, which can be applied to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes.
4. The main result of this work is that any Lindblad evolution with self-adjoint Lindblad operators can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution, which can be used to solve master equations and generalize intrinsic decoherence models.
5. This approach has been applied to the Jaynes-Cummings model with phase damping, and the results have been compared with experimental data in cavity QED and ion traps.

1. The study focuses on the localization length of light in one-dimensional disordered systems, specifically in homogeneous and mixed stacks of layers with different refractive indices. The researchers use numerical calculations to analyze the behavior of the localization length in these systems.

2. For homogeneous stacks, the study finds that the localization length exhibits a quadratic dependence on the wavelength for long wavelengths, and it saturates for short wavelengths. The researchers also find that the localization length is modulated by the transmission bands and that this modulation decreases with increasing disorder.

3. When left-handed metamaterials are introduced into the system, the localization length behavior changes, and for low-disordered mixed stacks, the localization length depends linearly on the wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers. The researchers also find that the localization length saturates for low wavelengths, being proportional to the inverse of the reflection coefficient.

4. The study also explores the effects of non-symmetric band distribution on the localization length, finding that it presents an irregular form in all the transmission spectrum, with changes being more sensitive in mixed stacks than in homogeneous structures. The researchers conclude that the localization length is an important parameter in understanding the behavior of light in disordered systems.

1. The concordance model of cosmology is supported by a wide range of observational data, including the abundance of light elements from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model suggests that ordinary matter, which makes up the stars, gas, and galaxies, accounts for only 4% of the total mass-energy density of the universe. The remaining 96% is composed of dark matter and dark energy.

2. Dark matter is thought to make up 23% of the universe's mass-energy density and is characterized by its ability to interact with normal matter only through gravity. The nature of dark matter is still unknown, and it is not clear what it is composed of. The remaining 73% of the universe's mass-energy density is attributed to dark energy.

3. The distribution of dark matter in the universe is thought to be responsible for the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Dark matter is also thought to play a crucial role in the rotation curves of galaxies, which are the rate at which stars and gas orbit around the center of the galaxy. The rotation curves of galaxies are often flat, indicating that the mass of the galaxy increases linearly with distance from the center.

4. The standard model of particle physics is unable to explain the existence of dark matter, and extensions to the model are needed to provide a viable explanation. One possible candidate for dark matter is the WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle), which is a type of particle that interacts with normal matter only through the weak nuclear force and gravity. The WIMP is thought to be a stable particle that was created in the early universe.

5. The existence of dark matter is supported by a wide range of observational evidence, including the rotation curves of galaxies, the distribution of galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe. The rotation curves of galaxies are often flat, indicating that the mass of the galaxy increases linearly with distance from the center. This is difficult to explain using only normal matter, and dark matter is thought to be responsible.

6. The Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory is an alternative explanation for the rotation curves of galaxies that does not require the existence of dark matter. MOND proposes that the law of gravity is modified at low accelerations, which is the regime in which galaxies operate. The MOND theory is able to explain the rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter.

1. The study of long chain macromolecules, particularly heteropolymers of biological significance, is a subject of considerable study due to their ubiquity in nature. However, there is a lack of understanding of their physical properties compared to homopolymers. From a biologist's perspective, the specific properties of a particular molecule are of interest, whereas a physicist's approach is to sacrifice specificity in the hope of gaining more general information from simplified models. Statistical descriptions of ensembles of molecules composed of a random linear sequence of elements with various interactions are of interest as examples of disordered systems.

2. The study focuses on simple models of heteropolymers, including the polyampholyte (PA) model, which is a flexible chain with each monomer having a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches. The polymer has a characteristic microscopic length, and the long-range nature of the Coulomb interactions combined with the randomness of the charge sequence produces effects distinct from systems with short-range interactions. The phase diagrams of quenched PAs in different dimensions are explored, and it is found that for a certain dimension, the behavior of PAs is similar to that of random chains with short-range interactions. In other dimensions, the spatial conformations of a PA strongly depend on its excess charge.

3. The study uses a continuum limit to describe the configurations of the PA, which are governed by the Boltzmann weights of an effective Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian includes terms for the entropic properties of the connected chain, the excluded volume interactions, and the electrostatic energy. The electrostatic energy is determined by the Coulomb interactions between the charges along the chain. The study focuses on the simplest ensemble of quenches, where each monomer takes a charge independent of all the others.

4. The study finds that the electrostatic energy of the excess charge, spread over the characteristic size of an ideal polymer, grows as the dimension of the space increases. This simple dimensional argument shows that for a certain dimension, weak electrostatic interactions are irrelevant. At high temperatures, the PA behaves as an ideal polymer with an entropy-dominated free energy. However, on lowering temperature, it collapses into a dense state, taking advantage of a condensation energy.

5. The study also explores the behavior of PAs with short-range correlations along the sequence, where neighboring charges satisfy a certain condition. The resulting ensembles continuously interpolate between the deterministic extremes of an alternating sequence and a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte.

1. A graph is considered closed if it has a closed labeling, which is a bijection from the vertex set to the set {1, ..., n} such that for any two distinct edges with either endpoint labeled with a smaller number, the other endpoint is labeled with a larger number. The labeling is closed if it satisfies this condition for all pairs of edges. A graph is closed if it has a closed labeling. Closed graphs were first encountered in the study of binomial edge ideals.

2. A binomial edge ideal of a labeled graph is the ideal in the polynomial ring generated by the binomials for all pairs of edges with endpoints labeled with consecutive numbers. A key result states that the binomials form a Gröbner basis of the ideal for lex order with a specific variable if and only if the labeling is closed. The name ""closed"" was introduced in a paper, and binomial edge ideals are explored in several other papers. A generalization of binomial edge ideals is studied in another paper.

3. The paper aims to characterize when a graph has a closed labeling in terms of properties that can be seen directly from the graph. The starting point is a result that every closed graph is chordal and claw-free. A graph is chordal if it has a perfect elimination ordering, and it is claw-free if it has no induced subgraph of the form K1,3. Besides being chordal and claw-free, closed graphs also have a property called narrow.

4. A connected graph is narrow if for every vertex and every longest shortest path, either the vertex is on the path or it is adjacent to a vertex on the path. A graph is narrow if every vertex is distance at most one from every longest shortest path. The paper proves that every connected closed graph is narrow. The narrowness of a graph is a key property that is used in the proof of the main result.

5. The main result of the paper states that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. The proof of the converse is harder and involves the construction of a labeling using an algorithm. The algorithm labels the vertices of the graph in a specific order, and the resulting labeling is shown to be closed. The proof of the main result is complete once the converse is proved.

1. Cosmic rays are elementary particles arriving at the Earth from outside, discovered in the early 20th century as a main source of natural radiation. The cosmic ray spectrum has been observed as a continuum at all energies since their discovery.

2. The high-energy tail of the spectrum corresponds to energies up to 3 EeV and rates of a few particles per km^2 per century, with a featureless power-law energy spectrum that decreases as approximately the cube of the primary energy.

3. For energies above a few hundred TeV, the observed flux requires techniques that take advantage of extensive air showers, which are successive secondary particles that cascade down into the atmosphere. Shower measurements allow the reconstruction of the arrival directions and the shower energy.

4. The nature of the primary particle is extracted by indirect methods, and for energies above a few tens of GeV, the detected particles have arrival directions with a remarkably isotropic distribution, understood in terms of diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields.

5. As the energy rises above a given value that depends on the charge of the particle, propagation in the galaxy should cease to be diffusive, and such high-energy particles are expected to be extragalactic. The observation of high-energy cosmic rays has been recently reviewed by Nagano and Watson.

6. There is increasing evidence for a different component of the high-energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum, combining data from five different experiments, which conclude that there is a clear signal of a change of the spectral slope in the region just above 2 EeV.

7. Composition studies have also given indications that there is a change to light element composition for energies above 3 EeV, although this conclusion is model-dependent to some extent. The highest energy events detected present a serious challenge to theory and little is known about their origin.

2. XB158 exhibits strong intensity modulation on a 12.78-hour period, which was confirmed in observations from 1991, 2000, and 2002, with the amplitude of modulation decreasing with increasing source intensity.
3. Analysis of the lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, with no evidence for dips in the two previous orbital cycles, suggesting that the disk was precessing.
4. The disk precession is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon observed in accreting binaries with a low mass ratio, where the disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the donor star.
5. The superhump phenomenon is characterized by periodic increases in the optical brightness on a period that is slightly longer than the orbital period, and is observed in systems with orbital periods shorter than 14.2 hours.
6. XB158 appears to be analogous to 4U 1916-053, a high-inclination neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with a 50-minute X-ray period and a 50.46-minute optical period.
7. The authors conducted a series of 30 Swift observations of XB158, spaced 11 days apart, to search for evidence of a super-orbital period, and found a sinusoidal variability with a period of 5.65 days.
8. The super-orbital period is 170% longer than predicted by the authors' 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, which may be due to a lower mass ratio of the donor to the accretor than assumed.
9. The authors suggest that XB158 may contain a particularly massive neutron star, with a mass greater than 2.2 solar masses, which would explain the hard photon index observed in the X-ray spectrum.

The authors analyzed the convergence properties of real basis-set methods to obtain resonance energies and lifetimes, finding that the increase of the basis-set size does not improve the accuracy of the value obtained for the resonance energy in some commonly used methods. This undesirable behavior comes from the fact that the procedure is not variational as in the case of bound states.

The authors presented a prescription to pick a set or bundle of states that has linear convergence properties for small width resonances, which is robust because the choice of different bundles results in very similar convergence curves and energy values.

1. The concept of PT-symmetric systems was initiated by Bender and collaborators as an alternative to standard quantum theory, where the Hamiltonian is postulated to be Hermitian. PT-symmetric systems can give rise to completely real spectra, making them suitable for describing physical settings. Recent developments in optics have led to the experimental realization of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians, primarily due to the work of Christodoulides and coworkers. This has resulted in the creation of optical waveguiding arrays that can be used to construct PT-symmetric complex potentials.

2. The authors propose a generalization of one-dimensional PT-symmetric nonlinear oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which can be used as fundamental building blocks for constructing PT-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. They introduce four basic types of plaquettes, three of which are four-site squares, and the final one is a five-site cross. The analysis is restricted to modes that can be found in an analytical form, while their stability against small perturbations is analyzed using numerical methods. The authors identify various effects, including the existence of solution branches that terminate at the critical points of the respective linear PT-symmetric systems.

3. The spectral stability of the different configurations is examined, and most frequently, the stationary modes are unstable, although stable branches are found in some cases. The evolution of unstable modes typically leads to the growth of amplitudes at gain-carrying sites and decay at lossy sites. The authors also observe that passive sites without gain or loss may be tipped towards growth or decay, depending on the particular solution and initial conditions. The next step in the analysis would be to search for more sophisticated stationary modes produced by the symmetry breaking of the simplest modes considered in this work.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

1. The cataclysmic variable (CV) HU AQR consists of a 0.80 white dwarf that accretes from a 0.18 main-sequence companion star. The transfer of mass in the tight orbit is mediated by the emission of gravitational waves and the strong magnetic field of the accreting star. The presence of two planets in the system has been suggested by irregularities in the observed-calculated variations.

2. Detailed timing analysis has led to the conclusion that the CV is orbited by two planets, a 5.7 planet in a 12-orbit with an eccentricity of 0.14 and a somewhat more massive (7.6) planet in a wider 15-orbit and eccentric 0.16 orbit. Although the two-planet configuration turned out to be dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year time scale, a small fraction of the numerical simulations exhibit long-term dynamical stability. The presence of planets in a CV system is peculiar, but it could be a natural consequence of the formation of binaries.

3. The planets in the HU AQR system can constrain the CV evolution and be used to reconstruct the history of the inner binary. The original binary lost probably more than half its mass in the common-envelope phase, which causes the reduction of the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude. The presence of planets in the system offers unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and the evolution of the system.

4. The presence of the inner planet in orbit around HU AQR allows us to break the degeneracy between the donor mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow, its radius, and the mass of its core. The outer planet allows us to validate this calculation and determine the conditions under which the CV was born. The requirement that the initial binary must have been dynamically stable further constrains the masses of the two stars and their orbital separation.

5. The observed white dwarf mass provides an upper limit to the mass of the core of the primary star at the moment of Roche-lobe contact, and therefore also provides a minimum to the companion mass. With the mass of the companion not being affected by the common envelope phase, we constrain the orbital parameters at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow by calculating stellar evolution tracks. The calculations are presented in Fig. [fig: amcoreformzams3msun].

1. The @xmath0 ncsm / rgm approach is a promising technique for treating both structure and reactions in light nuclear systems. It combines a microscopic cluster technique with realistic interactions and a consistent description of nucleon clusters. This method has been introduced in detail for two-body cluster bases and has shown efficiency in different systems. However, it cannot successfully study systems with a three-body cluster structure.

2. The extension of the ncsm / rgm approach to describe three-body cluster states is essential for studying nuclear systems with such configurations. These systems appear in structure problems of two-nucleon halo nuclei, resonant systems, and transfer reactions with three fragments in their final states. The @xmath1he nucleus is an ideal candidate to be studied within this approach. It is the lightest borromean nucleus, formed by an @xmath2he core and two halo neutrons.

3. The ncsm / rgm approach has been extended to include three-body dynamics, allowing the study of systems with three-body configurations. This new feature permits the study of a new range of systems that present three-body configurations. The obtained wave functions feature an appropriate asymptotic behavior, contrary to bound-state methods such as the ncsm. The computing support for this work came from the LLL institutional computing grand challenge program and from an INCITE award on the Titan supercomputer.

4. The results for the ground state of @xmath1he within a @xmath2he(g.s.)+n+n cluster basis and @xmath26 = 12 are compared to ncsm calculations in table [tab: a]. The binding energy calculations are close to convergence in both ncsm / rgm and ncsm approaches. The observed difference of approximately 1 MeV is due to the excitations of the @xmath2he core, included only in the ncsm at present. The inclusion of the excitations of the core will be achieved in a future work through the use of the no-core shell model with continuum approach (ncsmc).

Using continuum asymptotic conditions, the set of equations (rgmrho) is solved to obtain the low-energy phase shifts for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 channels in the continuum.

The core entropy of a polynomial is defined as the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its Hubbard tree, which is a finite topological tree that contains the forward orbits of its critical points. The core entropy is a measure of the complexity of the polynomial's dynamics.

2. The main goal of the paper is to prove that the core entropy function extends to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers. This result answers a question of W. Thurston, who first introduced and explored the core entropy of polynomials.

3. The authors develop an algorithm to compute the core entropy for rational angles, which is based on the idea of considering pairs of external angles instead of the topology of the Hubbard tree. They also extend this algorithm to countable graphs with bounded cycles, which allows them to compute the core entropy for any angle.

The authors prove that the core entropy function is continuous at all angles that are not purely periodic, and they also show that the function is Hlder continuous at angles that are purely periodic. This result is a consequence of the fact that the growth rate of the graph associated to the labeled wedge converges to the growth rate of the infinite graph as the angle approaches a purely periodic angle.

1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are mysterious events in the universe that last less than a minute and disappear shortly after. However, since the discovery of GRBs by the BeppoSAX satellite in 1997, it has been known that they also produce X-ray afterglows that can be detected for several hours or even days after the burst. The X-ray afterglows of GRBs are crucial for understanding the physics of these events. The X-ray afterglows can provide valuable information about the environment and the progenitor of the GRB.

2. The BeppoSAX satellite has detected several X-ray afterglows of GRBs in the last five years, and the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites have also observed some of these afterglows. The XMM-Newton satellite has observed two GRBs, GRB 011211 and GRB 001025, and has detected X-ray afterglows from both events. The X-ray afterglows of GRBs are typically detected in the 0.2-10 keV energy range. The X-ray afterglows can be used to study the physics of GRBs and their environments.

3. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 011211 was detected by the XMM-Newton satellite on December 12, 2001, and was found to be a point source with a power-law spectrum. The X-ray afterglow was detected in the 0.2-10 keV energy range and had a flux of 1.7 x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2. The X-ray afterglow was also detected in the optical band, and its spectrum was found to be featureless. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 011211 was observed for a total of 27 ks.

1. The layered organic material AI3 has been studied since the 1980s, but it has recently attracted renewed interest due to its low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure. Compared to graphene, AI3 is strikingly different in several respects, including the tilt of the Dirac cones and the anisotropy in the Fermi surface. The average Fermi velocity in AI3 is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that in graphene. This, together with an experimentally identified low-temperature charge-ordered phase at ambient pressure, indicates the relevance of electronic correlations.

2. The effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions is inversely proportional to the Fermi velocity, making it ten times larger in AI3 than in graphene. This suggests that AI3 opens the exciting prospect of studying strongly-correlated Dirac fermions that are beyond the scope of graphene electrons. The material AI3 also has the presence of additional massive carriers in the vicinity of the Fermi level, as recently pointed out in ab-initio band-structure calculations. However, the interplay between massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers has not yet been proven experimentally.

3. The authors present magneto-transport measurements of AI3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure larger than 3 GPa, where Dirac carriers are present. They show not only the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers but also prove experimentally the presence of low-mobility massive holes, in agreement with recent band-structure calculations. The interplay between both carrier types at low energy is the main result of their studies. Furthermore, they show that the measured mobilities for the two carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly-screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.

4. The authors analyze their data based on the study of the magneto-conductivity and compare it with the one presented in ref. for multi-carrier semiconductor systems. They extract the mobilities, zero-field conductivities, and carrier densities of each carrier type by analyzing the magneto-conductivity curves. The left axis shows the square (2D) conductivity of each BEDT-TTF plane, while the right axis shows the ""bulk"" (3D) longitudinal conductivity. The two ""plateaus"" observed in the magneto-conductivity curve indicate the existence of two different carrier types with significantly different mobilities.

1. Fe-based superconductors (FeBS) are a non-cuprate class of high-Tc systems with an unconventional superconducting state, and the origin of this state is still debated. FeBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides, with a square lattice of iron as the basic element. The Fermi surface (FS) of FeBS is formed by Fe d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets and two electron sheets.

2. The FS geometry of FeBS is crucial for understanding their superconducting properties, and the nesting between the hole and electron sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The random-phase approximation (RPA) with spin fluctuations (SF) approach gives an extended s-wave gap that changes sign between the hole and electron FS sheets. The orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have a sign-preserving d-wave symmetry.

3. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure of FeBS, and the measured dynamical spin susceptibility carries information about the gap structure. The common explanation for the peak in INS spectra is that it is the spin resonance appearing due to the s-wave state. However, recent measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy show that there are at least two distinct gaps present in FeBS.

4. The two-gap scenario raises questions about the spin resonance frequency in systems with two distinct gaps, and the naive expectation is that the frequency shifts to the lower gap scale. However, the observed peak in INS in Baco122 system at a frequency greater than the smaller gap scale cannot be the spin resonance. The peak could be coming from the d-wave state, where it forms at frequencies above the smaller gap scale.

5. To study the spin response of FeBS with two different superconducting gap scales, we use the RPA with local Coulomb interactions (Hubbard and Hund's exchange). The transverse dynamical spin susceptibility is the matrix in orbital (or band) indices, and it can be obtained from the bare electron-hole matrix bubble by summing up a series of ladder diagrams.

6. We consider two types of tight-binding models for the two-dimensional iron layer: a four-band model and a five-orbital model. The four-band model is a simple model that captures the essential features of the FS geometry, while the five-orbital model includes all five iron d-orbitals and is more realistic.

1. The presence of impurities in a quantum system can significantly modify its spectrum, coherence, and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, impurities in one and two dimensions lead to exponentially localized states, while in three dimensions, a mobility edge exists. However, if the impurity positions are correlated, delocalized states can appear in the spectrum.

2. The random dimer model (RDM) and its dual version (DRDM) have been studied in one dimension, demonstrating the effects of correlated disorder. In two dimensions, the effect of correlations is almost unexplored, except for the case of a speckle potential and pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions. Correlations in speckle potentials may mimic the presence of a mobility edge, but in the thermodynamic limit, all states are localized.

3. The DRDM introduces a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2D lattices, similar to 1D, due to its ""short-range"" feature, which is the decay of the correlation function. This feature is at the basis of the delocalization mechanism. The DRDM has been generalized to two dimensions, where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites.

4. Using a decimation and renormalization procedure, it has been shown that in the non-interacting regime, there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized. This resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and is the same as the DRDM in 1D. The 2D-DRDM has been introduced, where at each ""isolated"" impurity corresponds a structure of 4 hopping terms forming a cross.

5. The localization properties of the 2D-DRDM have been analyzed using the inverse participation ratio (IPR), which measures the extent of delocalization of a state. The IPR has been calculated for the 2D-DRDM potential and compared with the uncorrelated random disorder. The results show that the 2D-DRDM introduces a set of delocalized states even at higher dimensions.

1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is often said to be unconditionally secure, but it can be proven to be secure against any eavesdropping given that the users' devices satisfy certain requirements. These requirements include mathematical characterization of users' devices and the assumption that there is no side-channel. In practice, it is very difficult for practical devices to meet these requirements, leading to the breakage of the security of practical QKD systems. Some attacks on QKD have been proposed and demonstrated successfully against practical QKD systems.

2. To combat practical attacks, some counter-measures have been proposed, including device-independent security proof ideas. The device-independent security proof is very interesting from a theoretical viewpoint, but it cannot apply to practical QKD systems where loopholes in testing Bell's inequality cannot be closed. Recently, a very simple and very promising idea, called Measurement Device-Independent QKD (MDIQKD), has been proposed. In this scheme, neither Alice nor Bob performs any measurement, but they only send out quantum signals to a measurement unit (MU).

3. The basic idea of MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol, which is equivalent to EPR-based QKD in terms of security. MDIQKD is remarkable because it removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing the performance of standard QKD. It is shown that MDIQKD with infinite decoy states and polarization encoding can cover about twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD, which is comparable to EPR-based QKD. The only assumption needed in MDIQKD is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is almost perfect and carefully characterized.

4. The characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit since the characterization of the detection unit involves the estimation of the response of the devices to unknown input signals sent from Eve. With MDIQKD, we do not need to worry about imperfections of MU anymore, and we should focus our attention more to the imperfections of signal sources. One of the important imperfections of the sources is the basis-dependent flaw that stems from the discrepancy of the density matrices corresponding to the two bases in BB84 states. The security of standard BB84 with basis-dependent flaw has been analyzed, which shows that the basis-dependent flaw decreases the achievable distance.

1. Massive stars play a crucial role in driving the energy flow and material cycles that influence the physical and chemical evolution of galaxies. Despite receiving much attention, their formation process remains enigmatic. Observationally, the large distances to the nearest examples and the clustered mode of formation make it difficult to isolate individual protostars for study. Advances in instrumentation have enabled sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at wavelengths less affected by the large column densities of material.

2. Recent observations have uncovered the environment surrounding individual massive protostellar systems. From analysis of CO bandhead emission, Keplerian disks have been inferred very closely surrounding four massive young stellar objects. Interferometric, mm-continuum observations find the mass-function of protostellar dust clumps lies close to a Salpeter value down to clump radii of 2000 AU. These high-resolution observations point toward an accretion formation scenario for massive stars.

3. Further discrimination between the two competing models is possible by examining the properties, in particular the young stellar populations, of hot molecular cores. The mid-infrared (MIR) window offers a powerful view of these regions. Recent observations indicate that Class II methanol masers exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are generally either not associated or offset from UCHII regions. Class II methanol masers are found closest to the brightest MIR point source.

4. The authors have observed three of the M05 regions at high spatial resolution to uncover the embedded sources inside the cores at MIR wavelengths. The data were obtained with Michelle on the 8-m Gemini North telescope in queue mode. The spatial resolution calculated from standard star observations was 0.36"" at 10 μm and 0.57"" at 18.5 μm. The 32"" x 24"" field of view fully covered the dust emission observed by M05 in each region.

5. The authors have used the simple-harmonic model of ballistic motion to consider the motion of sources within the cores. Using the measured column density and radius from M05, the time required for migration from the edge to the centre is comparable to the predicted HMC lifetime. Any sources having migrated to the centre in this way would have acquired a velocity of 2 km/s with respect to the clump. Massive stars in clusters are observed to have a high companion star fraction.

1. Majorana fermions (MFS) are real solutions of the Dirac equation and are their own antiparticles. They have been proposed as a model for neutrinos but have recently been predicted to occur as quasi-particle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems. MFS obey non-Abelian statistics, which is an important factor in realizing potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.

2. The possibility of hosting MFS in exotic solid-state systems has focused on topological superconductors, and various realistic platforms have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect. However, observing the unique Majorana signatures experimentally is still a challenging task. MFS are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments, where they manifest themselves as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs).

3. Theoretical predictions of ZBPs have been observed experimentally in semiconductor nanowires (SNWs), which are interpreted as the signatures of MFS. However, these experimental results cannot serve as definitive evidence to prove the existence of MFS in condensed matter systems. It is also a major challenge in these experiments to uniquely distinguish Majoranas from conventional fermionic subgap states.

4. The first reason is that zero-bias conductance peaks can also appear due to other mechanisms, such as the zero-bias anomaly due to Kondo resonance and disorder or band bending in the SNW. The second reason is that Andreev bound states in a magnetic field can also exhibit a zero-energy crossing as a function of exchange interaction or Zeeman energy, giving rise to similar conductance features. Most experimental evidence for Majorana bound states relies on measurements of the tunneling conductance at present.

5. To obtain definitive signatures of MFS, alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFS are necessary. An all-optical scheme to detect MFS has been proposed, which benefits from recent advances in nanotechnology and nanofabrication. The scheme involves a hybrid system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) and a nanomechanical resonator (NR).

6. The QD is coupled to the NR via a dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted by several tens of nanometers. The QD is considered as a two-level system, and once MFS appear in the end of the iron chains and couple to the QD, the Majorana signature will be carried out via the coherent optical spectrum of the QD.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21}"

1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by strong Si lines in their spectra at maximum brightness and are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies. They are brighter than most other types of SNe and exhibit uniform light curves. A plausible explosion model for SNe Ia is the accreting white dwarf (WD) model, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion star and explodes when it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit. This model has been improved by introducing stellar wind from the WD while it accretes material.

2. The accreting WD model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. These channels suggest which companion stars lead to SNe Ia. However, the above evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia has not been confirmed by observations, which require the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site. The identification of the companion star is crucial to confirm the accreting WD model.

3. A study by @xcite argued that they identified a G2IV star as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) by measuring the velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the SNR. They concluded that this G2IV star was moving much faster than the other neighbor stars and that the distance to this star seemed consistent with the distance to Tycho's SNR. However, the thick disk star alternative is very unlikely due to the expected stellar mass in the thick disk stars within the cone with a 2.87 arcsec radius. The coincidence of the kinematic characteristics of Tycho G with its being at the position and distance of the SNR appears significant.

4. A direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta is proposed in this paper. A hint was dropped by observations for a star called S-M star discovered by @xcite near a Type Ia SNR 1006. @xcite proved that the S-M star was not the companion of this supernova by investigating features of Fe II absorption lines in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. The broad wings observed in both blue and red sides of the absorption lines are likely to be formed by Fe II in the ejecta of SNR 1006.

1. Quantum entanglement is a feature of quantum mechanics that has captured much recent interest due to its essential role in quantum information processing. It may be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization, and it obeys a set of conservation laws. As such, it is regarded and treated much like a physical resource. It proves useful in making quantitative predictions to quantify entanglement.

2. The problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system is one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment. Complicating the situation, the state of the environment is complex and unknown. Conventionally, the partial trace with respect to the environment is taken, yielding a mixed state for the bipartite system. If one wishes for a more complete characterization of the entanglement than provided by the above measures, somehow the inherent uncertainty of the mixed state description must be removed.

3. Quantum trajectory theory can provide answers to these questions by considering the conditional evolution of the system, given the history of detector 'clicks'. The system is described by a pure state which is dependent on (conditioned on) the counting histories, or records, of detectors 1 and 2. The evolution of the system is described by a pure state which evolves under the non-hermitian effective hamiltonian, interrupted at random times by quantum jumps. The jumps occur with probability given by the square of the norm of the state.

4. The quantum trajectory evolution tends to reinforce the establishment of the cycle, close to the antisymmetric cycle, the evolution between jumps is dominantly governed by one operator and is therefore relatively fast. This leads to frequent photon counts at detector 1. Close to the symmetric cycle, the between-jump evolution is dominantly governed by another operator, hence is relatively slow. Photon counts at detector 1 become much less frequent. The ensemble average state of the system is mixed, described by one of the density operators. The system state retains its purity, conditional on the classical information extracted from the box. With this extra information, we can extract more entanglement from the cascaded qubit system. The entanglement facilitated by eve's measurements is contextual, in the sense that there are many other ways in which eve could choose to measure her state, each producing a different unravelling of the qubit system and yielding a different value of entanglement. The results of this paper could be extended by employing quantum trajectories in a broader sense.

1. The unification scheme of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) explains the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN by angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region. The obscuring dusty medium, known as the ""dust torus,"" is optically and geometrically thick and extends from sub-parsec scales outward to several tens of parsecs. This dusty medium absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the received energy in the infrared.

2. Observations have shown that Type 1 AGN show significantly more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity. This is consistent with the picture where the face-on view onto the torus in Type 1 AGN exposes the innermost hot dust to the observer. On the other hand, in Type 2 AGN, the torus is seen edge-on, so that internal obscuration blocks the line-of-sight to the hot dust.

3. The authors aim to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of the AGN emission in the infrared using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars at z=0. The sample comprises 11 quasars and 8 radio galaxies, and the authors use high-spatial resolution observations to isolate the AGN emission. The average SEDs of each object type show that the radio galaxies are systematically lower in infrared emission than the quasars.

4. The authors test two possibilities to explain the observed anisotropy: extinction by a cold dust screen and absorption and emission in a warm dusty medium. They find that single extinction laws result in much worse fits, and that the observed anisotropy is more consistent with the intrinsic anisotropy caused by the dust torus. The clumpy torus model reproduces the observed type 1/type 2 ratio reasonably well.

1. The paper discusses the effect of local oscillator (LO) intensity fluctuation on the secret key rate estimation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems. The LO intensity fluctuation can compromise the secret key rate severely if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values. This is because the fluctuation of LO intensity can be exploited by Eve to attack the system.

2. The authors propose an attacking scheme exploiting the LO intensity fluctuation, which can be partially hidden by reducing the intensity of LO with a variable attenuator. This attack can be called a LO intensity attack (LOIA). The authors analyze the effect of LOIA on the secret key rate estimation for both reverse and direct reconciliation protocols.

3. The results show that Bob's estimation of the secret key rate will be compromised severely without monitoring LO or if his measurements do not scale with LO instantaneous intensity values. Eve can hide her attack partially by reducing the intensity of LO and even steal the total secret keys shared by Alice and Bob without being found by a small attenuation of LO intensity. This is especially true for reverse reconciliation.

They conclude that LO intensity fluctuation opens a loophole for Eve to attack the practical system, especially in the case of communication with low channel transmission or over long distance.

However, the simplicity is now less evident due to the long development period. The code offers flexibility in the choice of integration method and the ability to determine all frequencies of a given model in a given range of degree and frequency. The choice of variables describing the equilibrium model and oscillations was inspired by @xcite.

The code also provides extensive documentation, which is part of the distribution package jcd/adipack.n. @xcite provided an extensive review of adiabatic stellar oscillations, emphasizing applications to helioseismology, and discussed many aspects and tests of the Aarhus package. @xcite carried out careful tests and comparisons of results on polytropic models.

3. The code uses two different techniques for solving the differential equations: a shooting method and a relaxation technique. The shooting method involves integrating solutions from the inner and outer boundaries and matching them at a suitable inner fitting point. The relaxation technique involves solving the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions using a relaxation technique. The eigenvalue is then found by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point.

The normalized inertia is calculated as @xmath153, where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the distance of the innermost mesh point from the centre and the surface radius, respectively.

1. The highly structured HI distribution in gas-rich galaxies, marked by cavities, shells, and supershells, is an important manifestation of their internal activity. This feature was first discovered in the Milky Way by Heiles in 1979 and 1984. Similar features have been found in several spiral galaxies, including NGC 5775, NGC 4631, NGC 3044, and NGC 3556. The existence of these features in various galaxies suggests that they are a common phenomenon in gas-rich galaxies.

2. The supershells in these galaxies are often exceptionally large, extending across several kiloparsecs, and have been interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like or circular appearance in projection. The persistence of these features over a wide velocity range or evidence of expansion in position-velocity space supports this interpretation. The supershells are thought to be driven by internal or external sources of energy. The internal source model involves starbursts, driving stellar winds and subsequent supernova explosions.

3. The chimney model, proposed by Norman and Ikeuchi in 1989, attempts to explain disk-halo features and other halo gas via processes related to underlying star formation. This model is supported by the association between extraplanar Hα filaments and star-forming regions in the disk of NGC 891 and other correlations between halo emission and in-disk tracers of star formation. The chimney model suggests that stellar winds and supernovae are responsible for the HI supershells. However, the main difficulty with this model is the required input energies for the largest shells.

4. The starburst model for HI supershells faces significant challenges, including the required input energies for the largest shells. Using standard assumptions, the expanding supershells often require energy input from staggering numbers of spatially correlated supernova events. This was realized early on for our own galaxy, and for external edge-on galaxies, the energy deficit problem is exacerbated. Hundreds of thousands of clustered supernovae are required to explain the energy input for the largest shells.

Loeb and Perna (1998) suggest that HI shells are produced by gamma-ray bursts, while Efremov et al.

1. The first color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) obtained by Baade for the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) companions of the Milky Way, including the Draco system, showed features similar to those of globular clusters.
2. The presence of RR Lyrae stars led to the interpretation that dSph galaxies are essentially pure Population II systems, but Baade noted differences in stellar populations between dSph galaxies and globular clusters.
3. The discovery of carbon stars in dSph galaxies revealed an intermediate-age population, which has been confirmed in the CMDs of several dSph galaxies, including Carina, Fornax, and Leo I.
4. Leo I is a peculiar galaxy with a well-populated red clump but no evident horizontal branch, suggesting that its first substantial amount of star formation may have been delayed compared to other dSph galaxies.
5. The large galactocentric radial velocity of Leo I suggests that it may not be bound to the Milky Way, and its star formation history is distinct from other dSph galaxies.
6. The CMD of Leo I obtained from new HST data shows a broad range in magnitude in the main sequence turnoff region, indicating a large range in age of the stars populating the galaxy.
7. The CMD also shows a well-defined red clump, indicative of an intermediate-age stellar population, and a lack of discontinuities in the turnoff/subgiant region suggests continuous star formation activity.
8. The RGB of Leo I is relatively blue, characteristic of a system with low metallicity, and the metallicity derived from the RGB is [Fe/H] = 2.02 ± 0.10 dex.
9. The CMD of Leo I suggests that star formation has extended from at least 10^15 Gyr ago to less than 1 Gyr ago, with possible intensity variations over time but no big time gaps between successive bursts.
10. The determination of the strength of the star formation in Leo I at different epochs is important to assess whether it is possible that during intervals of high star formation activity, Leo I would have been as bright as the faint blue galaxies observed at intermediate redshift.

1. The article discusses a result by Berestycki et al. regarding the Laplacian perturbed by a divergence-free drift in dimensions 10. The result states that the principal eigenvalue remains bounded as the drift coefficient tends to infinity if and only if the equation has a solution, called a first integral of the vector field, such that the solution and its derivative are bounded. The result can be interpreted intuitively as functions satisfying the equation being constant along the flow of the vector field. The existence of non-trivial first integrals allows for flow lines that are contained in the domain.

2. The article aims to verify a similar property of the principal eigenvalue when the classical Laplacian is replaced by the fractional Laplacian with a parameter. The fractional Laplacian is defined as the closure of the operator with a specific kernel. Its Fourier symbol is given by a specific expression. The fractional Laplacian is the generator of the semigroup of the isotropic α-stable Lévy process on the Euclidean space.

3. The article considers a bounded domain with a 1-regular boundary that is simply connected. The domain is denoted by Ω. The vector field is assumed to be of zero divergence. The article aims to prove that the principal eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions remains bounded as the drift coefficient tends to infinity. The result is stated as a theorem, which is the main result of the article.

4. The article uses the Krein-Rutman theorem and compactness arguments to study the principal eigen-pair of the fractional Laplacian. The Krein-Rutman theorem is used to prove the existence of a unique non-negative principal eigenfunction. The compactness arguments are used to prove the existence of a unique principal eigenvalue. The article also uses the properties of the Green function and heat kernel of gradient perturbations of the fractional Laplacian.

5. The article defines the Green function of the fractional Laplacian for the domain Ω. The Green function is defined as the integral of the transition density of the Lévy process. The article also defines the Green operator, which is the integral of the Green function with respect to the function. The Green operator is used to define the principal eigen-pair of the fractional Laplacian.

6. The article proves that the Green operator is compact on the space of square-integrable functions. The compactness of the Green operator is used to prove the existence of a unique principal eigen",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 36}"

1. The authors discuss the challenge of inferring macroscopic properties of physical systems from their microscopic description, particularly at phase transitions, which often involve symmetry breaking processes. They highlight the need for new methods to identify parameters capable of describing phase transitions, such as those borrowed from machine learning.

2. The authors explore the application of machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, to identify phase transitions in physical systems. They demonstrate the use of unsupervised learning to reproduce Monte Carlo-sampled states of the Ising model and identify phase transitions using principal component analysis.

3. The authors transition to more powerful machine learning algorithms, including kernel principal component analysis and variational autoencoders, which can handle nonlinear data and scale well to large datasets. They show that variational autoencoders can be used to identify phase transitions without any information about the microscopic theory or order parameter.

4. The authors apply variational autoencoders to the Ising model and demonstrate that they can learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system, which coincides with the correct order parameter. They also show that the decoder network reconstructs the encoded configuration from its latent representation.

5. The authors find that the reconstruction error is more accurate in the ordered phase, suggesting the use of the reconstruction error as a universal identifier for phase transitions. They also demonstrate that the latent parameter is correlated with the magnetization and can be used to identify phase transitions.

6. The authors test the ability of variational autoencoders to handle models with continuous symmetries, such as the XY model, and find that they can embed all different realizations of the ordered phase into latent variables. They also show that the latent representation can be used to identify phase transitions in the XY model.

7. The authors compare different unsupervised learning algorithms, including principal component analysis, traditional autoencoders, and variational autoencoders, and find that variational autoencoders are the most accurate method for identifying phase transitions. They also demonstrate that the reconstruction loss can be used as a universal indicator for phase transitions.

8. The authors conclude that variational autoencoders can be used to predict unseen phases or uncover unknown order parameters, and suggest that deep convolutional autoencoders may be useful for further exposing the connection between deep neural networks and renormalization group. They also acknowledge the contributions of various researchers and references to related work in the field.

1. The main laws of quantum mechanics prohibit the perfect cloning of quantum states, but it is possible to carry out an approximate copying of the quantum states using quantum cloning machines (QCM).
2. QCM can produce identical or non-identical copies of the initial state, and the quality of the copying can be either identical for all states or depend on the state.
3. One possible application of QCM is an eavesdropping of the quantum channel, where the aim of such eavesdropping defines the main properties of the designing QCM.
4. In this paper, the authors intend to discuss some ""partial"" QCM, which copies one constituent of the two-partite states, and this approach gives the possibility to consider QCM for mixed states too.
5. The authors consider two-partite qubit states and construct QCM using a tensor product of three Hilbert spaces, where the first and third qubit components constitute a quantum state carrying information in the quantum channel.
6. The authors introduce a measure of the closeness of the initial and final states, called fidelity, and use it to determine the parameters of the QCM.
7. The authors find the parameters of the QCM that correspond to the minimal value of the fidelity, which implies that the vectors involved in the cloning process are parallel.
8. The authors discuss the cloning of mixed qubit states by using the ""purification"" of the mixed state and then applying the ""partial"" cloning machine.
9. The authors note that the choice of the parameters for the QCM is defined by the strategy of the eavesdropping and that there are many other variants for the QCM, such as asymmetric QCM.

1. The nature of dark matter remains one of the outstanding questions in modern astrophysics, with the cold dark matter cosmological model suggesting a major component of dark matter is an elementary particle.
2. However, the inventory of baryons observed locally falls short of the total inferred from cosmic microwave background fluctuations, leaving open the possibility of a significant baryonic component of dark matter.
3. Researchers have proposed models that include a large component of baryonic dark matter, with some suggesting that cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds could constitute a major component of dark matter.
4. These models predict gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray interactions within the clouds, which could be detectable by high-quality data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.
5. Previous investigations of this problem have neglected self-shielding and cascade phenomena, which can be important at high column densities, and have employed emissivities appropriate to the low-density limit.
6. The authors have used a Monte Carlo simulation code, Geant4, to derive gamma-ray production spectra from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds.
7. Their calculations show that the predicted spectra differ substantially between high and low column-density clouds, and that the emissivity of dense gas clouds is much greater than previously thought.
8. The gamma-ray data on the inner galactic disk indicate that all of the galaxy's dark halo could be made of dense clouds of column-density above 10^22 g/cm^2.
9. The existing gamma-ray data do not exclude purely baryonic models for the galactic dark halo, and the constraints on unmodeled emission are much weaker than previously thought.
10. The authors conclude that the gamma-ray data do not provide strong constraints on the baryonic content of the galaxy's dark halo, and that other lines of evidence are needed to determine the nature of dark matter.

Colloidal suspensions have the potential to develop novel materials through self-assembly, with colloidal crystals being of particular interest due to their optical properties and ability to generate iridescent colors. These crystals can be used to produce photonic crystals, lasers, and display devices, and recent advances have demonstrated the ability to tune their colors through control of lattice spacing with an external field. The well-defined thermodynamic temperature of colloidal crystals also allows them to be viewed as mesoscopic ""model atoms"".

2. The ability to tune colloid-colloid interactions has led to the observation of a wide variety of structures, including exotic crystal structures that are not observed in atomic and molecular systems. The introduction of a rotating AC field has opened up even more possibilities, with studies showing that it can produce disc-like patterns consistent with expectations. The interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field can be treated to first order as a circularly symmetric attraction.

3. The effective colloid-colloid interaction is central to the success of the one-component approach, and a simple numerical treatment has been used to predict the lattice spacing in the quasi-2D crystal from the electric field strength. Monte Carlo simulations have been used to compare the experimental data with the theory, with the results showing reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation. The lattice parameter has been found to be sensitive to the colloid diameter, with larger particles having a smaller lattice parameter for a given field strength.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 9}"

1. Soft X-ray transients (SXRTs) show properties similar to those of persistent low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star (LMXBs) when in outburst. The large variations in accretion rate in SXRTs allow the investigation of various regimes for neutron stars inaccessible to persistent LMXBs. The origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in the quiescent state of SXRTs is still unclear.

2. Aql X-1 is the most active SXRT known, with over 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts detected. The companion star has been identified as the K1V variable star V1333 Aql, with an orbital period of 19 hours. The outbursts of Aql X-1 are characterized by a fast rise followed by a slow decay.

3. The sharp flux decay of Aql X-1 leading to its quiescent state is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts, although there are differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra. The outburst evolution of low-mass X-ray transients presents important differences, with a steepening in the X-ray flux decrease and a sudden spectral hardening. The observed ratio of luminosity when a QPO was detected and the luminosity when the centrifugal barrier closes is consistent with the magnetospheric beat-frequency model.

4. The quiescent X-ray luminosity of Aql X-1 is likely powered by a radio pulsar enshrouded by matter outflowing from the companion star. The conversion efficiency of spin-down luminosity to X-ray is estimated to be around 10%. The observed X-ray spectrum in quiescence is consistent with shock emission from the interaction of a radio pulsar wind with the matter outflowing from the companion star.

1. On October 9, 2006, @xcite reported K. Itagaki's discovery of a possible supernova (SN) in UGC 4904. Although the SN was discovered after the peak, an upper limit of the magnitude was obtained at 820 days before the discovery. The transient was as faint as 9 and its duration was as short as 10 days. Since the event was faint and short-lived, they speculated that the transient was a luminous blue variable (LBV)-like event.

2. The spatial coincidence between the LBV-like event and SN 2006jc is confirmed by @xcite. Because of such an intriguing association with the LBV-like event, many groups performed follow-up observations of SN 2006jc in various wavebands: X-ray, ultra-violet (UV), optical, infrared (IR), and radio. Spectroscopic observations showed many broad features and strong narrow emission lines. According to the He detection, SN 2006jc was classified as Type Ib @xcite.

3. However, strange spectral features and their evolutions were reported. A bright blue continuum was prominent in the optical spectrum at early epochs @xcite. Such a bright blue continuum had also been observed in Type II SN 1988Z @xcite, but the origin of this feature is still unclear. As the blue continuum declined, the red wing brightened and the optical spectra showed ""U""-like shapes @xcite.

4. This is a distinguishing feature of SN 2006jc in contrast to the spectra of usual SNe that have a peak in optical bands. Photometric observations in optical and IR bands were performed continuously. The optical light curve (LC) showed a rapid decline from 50 days after the discovery, as in the case of SN 1999CQ @xcite. At the same epoch, near-infrared (NIR) emissions brightened @xcite.

5. The NIR brightness increased from 11 days to 12 days after the discovery and then declined @xcite. The epoch of the NIR brightening corresponds to that of the development of the red wing in the optical spectra @xcite. The NIR brightening, as well as the fact that the redder side of the He emission profile declined faster than the bluer side, has been interpreted as an evidence of an ongoing dust formation @xcite.

1. The study of the X-ray transient source IGR J170913624, believed to be a black hole binary, reveals that its faintness is likely due to its low or negative spin, in contrast to the high-spin black hole in GRS 1915+105. This conclusion is based on simultaneous spectral fitting of the source's spectra during different phases of its ""heartbeat"" oscillations.

2. The study suggests that the black hole spin may not play a significant role in generating the observed extreme variability, and that such behavior is generated mainly by a high accretion rate. The findings also indicate that IGR J170913624 would be the first known astrophysical source with a retrograde spin if its inclination angle is greater than 70 degrees.

The system is characterized by a large frequency range of gas and dust radiation, from radio to X-rays. The WD and RG stars interact through their winds, leading to various outbursts and changes in the system's behavior.

2. The Z And system has experienced several periods of activity, including outbursts in 1915, 1939, 1960, 1984, and 2000. These outbursts are non-uniform and can be classified as classical outbursts. The system's behavior is complex, with multiple factors contributing to the outbursts.

3. The 1984-1986 outburst is notable for its double-peaked structure and low brightness. The outburst was monitored closely, allowing for detailed modeling of the system's physical conditions. The modeling revealed that the outburst was caused by the collision of the WD wind with two ejected shells from the RG.

4. The collision of the WD wind with the shells led to the formation of shock fronts, which heated and ionized the surrounding gas. The ionization parameter, which is a measure of the system's ionization state, dropped significantly during the outburst. This drop was caused by the sudden increase in distance between the WD and the downstream nebula.

1. The electrical properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks have been studied for various applications, particularly as electronic materials. The networks can be viewed as a two-dimensional network of conducting one-dimensional rods, which are either metallic or semiconducting. The junction resistance between nanotubes is much larger than the nanotube resistance itself, leading to randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport. This behavior is observed in sub-monolayer networks, where the junction resistance dominates the overall resistance.

2. The frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks have been investigated, and it has been found that the onset frequency increases with film thickness. The correlation length, which is the distance between connections in the sample, decreases as the film thickness increases. The electric-field-dependent conductance of SWCNT films shows nonlinear behavior, which is more likely a consequence of poor electric conduction through inter-bundle junctions. The critical field, which is the electric field at which nonlinear conductance begins to appear, is larger for thicker samples and smaller for thin samples.

3. The length scale, which is the size of the regions with good conductivity, depends on the density of the SWCNT networks. For thicker films with larger SWCNT density, the length scale is smaller. The localization behavior may be affected by the properties of individual SWCNTs, but the observed behavior is more likely a consequence of poor electric conduction through inter-bundle junctions. The correlation length and the length scale have the same dependence on the sample thickness.

4. An empirical relation has been proposed between the onset frequency and the length scale, which is consistent with the experimental data. The parameter in the relation depends on the diffusion properties of carriers in the SWCNT films. The mobility of carriers on the SWCNT network is estimated to be much smaller than that of individual SWCNTs. The carbon nanotube film-based transistors have reported mobilities on the order of 10^3 cm^2/Vs, which is consistent with our estimation.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. The quantum algorithms work more efficiently than classical counterparts due to quantum superposition and interference. Grover's algorithm is an example of this, which can search for an item in an unsorted database in just two steps, compared to the classical counterpart's requirement of x steps. This represents a quadratic advantage over the classical counterpart. Grover's algorithm has been realized using various physical systems, including NMR, superconducting qubits, and atom-cavity QED systems.

2. The goal of this work is to implement three-qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level squids in cavity-QED. The scheme is based on resonant and off-resonant interactions of the cavity field with the transition of the squid and the application of resonant microwave pulses. This scheme does not require the adjustment of the squid level spacing during the implementation of Grover's search iteration, thus suppressing decoherence caused by this adjustment. The scheme also does not require identical coupling constants of each squid with the resonator and direct coupling between the levels.

3. The basic idea of Grover's algorithm is to prepare the input basis states in a superposition state using the Walsh-Hadamard transformation, then invert the phase of the desired basis state through a unitary operator (called the oracle), and finally invert all the basis states about the average. The implementation of Grover's algorithm in terms of quantum logic networks involves the use of quantum phase gates and single-qubit quantum gates. The single-qubit quantum gate for a qubit can be written in Dirac notation as U(θ) = e^(-iθσx/2), where σx is the Pauli rotation matrix. The three-qubit controlled phase gate can be expressed by U(θ) = e^(-iθσx/2) ⊗ e^(-iθσx/2) ⊗ e^(-iθσx/2).

4. The implementation of three-qubit Grover's algorithm involves the application of single-qubit gates and three-qubit quantum controlled phase gates. The single-qubit gate is carried out through a two-step process involving an auxiliary level via a method described in a reference. The desired arbitrary single-qubit gate can be achieved by choosing a proper interaction time and phase of the classical microwave pulse resonant to the transition. The three-qubit controlled phase gate can be implemented using four-level squids coupled to a superconducting resonator, which is faster than the conventional decomposition method.

1. In the 1970s, many-body theory flourished, and a topic of interest was the many-body effects on XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra from deep core levels in metals. The effects related to singularities that appeared near edges in absorption and emission spectra were also studied.

2. The conduction-band electrons can have many different effects on the XPS peak from the core level, including a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy due to screening of the core hole by the conduction electrons. However, if the excitation is not adiabatic, the core hole is left in a nonequilibrium state.

3. The sudden approximation is used to describe the excitation process, where the core-hole potential is turned on instantaneously, and the electrons do not have time to settle down and reach equilibrium. This results in shake-up effects in the form of single-particle (electron-hole pair) excitations and collective (plasmon) excitations.

4. The model Hamiltonian for the system is used to derive the Green's function, which is connected to the time-ordered and retarded Green's functions. The spectral function is the density of states for an unoccupied core-hole state.

5. The excitation spectrum of the electrons is given by the dynamical structure factor, which is related to the dielectric function. The structure factor is nonzero in two regions: one region is where electron-hole pairs are excited, and the other is on the plasmon dispersion curve.

6. The Hamiltonian is transformed using a unitary transformation, which diagonalizes the Hamiltonian and changes the interaction term into a constant energy term. This energy shift is the relaxation energy, which is the gain in energy when the electrons relax around the core hole.

7. The Green's function is used to derive the XPS spectrum, which reflects the density of states of the core electron. The spectrum is given by an integral over time, which includes the effects of the core-hole potential and the electron-hole excitations.

8. The dielectric function is used to calculate the XPS spectrum, and it is given by a complex expression that depends on the density of states at the Fermi level and the doping concentration. The dielectric function is used to calculate the XPS spectrum for pristine and doped graphene.

9. The XPS spectrum is compared to experimental results for pristine and doped graphene, and the agreement is quite good. The theoretical results show that the peak shape changes with doping concentration",1,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18}"

1. The processes underlying Darwinian evolution are selection, random genetic drift, and mutations, which have been analyzed in the simplest setting of two genotypes evolving under these processes.
2. In this setting, a genotype represents an individual's genetic makeup, completely determining all relevant properties of the individual, and the fitness of a genotype represents the selection pressure for the individuals.
3. Experimental studies have revealed that many natural systems exhibit frequency-dependent selection, which means that an individual's fitness not only depends on its genotype but also on its interactions with other individuals and hence on the frequency of the different genotypes in the population.
4. The authors derived the Fokker-Planck equation describing the dynamics of the number of individuals of genotype 1 in the limit of large population sizes, which is a well-established model to gain an understanding of the interplay of selection, mutation, and genetic drift in evolutionary dynamics.
5. The Fokker-Planck equation was used to analyze the stationary probability distribution, which contains contributions from genetic drift, mean mutation rate, mutation difference, and frequency-dependent selection effects.
6. The authors found that asymmetries in the mutation probabilities may not only induce the shifting of existing stable points of the dynamics to new positions but also lead to the emergence of new stable points.

1. The phase-field method has become a popular choice for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity. It avoids the cumbersome problem of tracking moving solid-liquid interfaces or grain boundaries by describing the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields. The phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods. This makes the phase-field method an efficient simulation tool for free boundary problems.

2. The foundations of the phase-field method and its application to solidification have been the subject of several recent review articles, and it seems of little use to repeat similar information here. Instead, the paper discusses several topics where robust phase-field modeling tools are not yet available because some fundamental questions remain open. The topics include the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification, and the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations.

A characteristic feature of the phase-field method is that its equations can often be written down following simple rules or intuition, but their detailed properties become only apparent through a mathematical analysis that can be quite involved. Therefore, it is not always easy to perceive the limits of applicability of the method. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been greatly enhanced in the last decade by a detailed control of their properties. Phase-field models are rooted in the mean-field description of spatially diffuse interfaces by order parameters.

4. To be useful for simulating microstructure formation in solidification, phase-field models need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of the physical solid-liquid interfaces and the typical scale of the microstructures. This is achieved by increasing the interface width in the model, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. However, this procedure magnifies any physical effect that is due to the diffuseness of the interface. Therefore, to guarantee precise simulations, all these effects have to be controlled and, if possible, eliminated.

5. The privileged tool to achieve this is the so-called thin-interface limit, where the equations of the phase-field model are analyzed under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale present in the problem. The procedure of matched asymptotic expansions then yields the effective boundary conditions valid at the macroscale, which contain all effects of the finite interface thickness up to the order to which the expansions are carried out. This procedure was pioneered by Karma and Rappel, who analyzed the symmetric model of",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 36}"

1. The study focuses on determining the fundamental parameters of FGK stars, including effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulence, using spectroscopic methods. The researchers utilize the RAVE survey data and develop a new method, nlte-opt, which combines the balmer line method for effective temperature estimation with nlte corrections for ionization balance. The nlte-opt method is compared to the widely-used lte-fe method, which shows significant systematic biases in the latter. The study highlights the importance of reliable effective temperature scales and nlte corrections for accurate stellar parameter determination.

2. The researchers find that the nlte-opt method provides more accurate stellar parameters, with differences ranging from 200 to 400 K in effective temperature, 0.5 to 1.5 dex in surface gravity, and 0.1 to 0.5 dex in metallicity. The study also explores the implications of these differences on the characterization of stars and abundance analyses. The researchers conclude that the nlte-opt method is essential for accurate stellar parameter determination, particularly for metal-poor stars. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the Milky Way's chemical and dynamical properties.

1. The effects of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure have been detected in several samples of high-redshift QSOs, intermediate-redshift galaxies, and BATSE GRBs. The detection of weak lensing in these samples suggests that it may be a significant effect in the universe.

2. The authors of the paper aim to determine if the observed fluxes of cosmologically distant SNe Ia have suffered significantly from lensing-induced (de-)amplifications. They use a sample of 55 SNe Ia from the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team.

3. The authors find a significant anti-correlation between the observed magnitudes of SNe Ia and the number density of foreground galaxies. This anti-correlation is consistent with the predictions of weak lensing theory, which would amplify SNe Ia found behind more nearby mass concentrations.

4. The authors also consider the possibility that the observed anti-correlation is due to galactic dust obscuration, which would make SNe Ia sources brighter and foreground galaxies more numerous in the directions devoid of galactic dust. However, they find that this interpretation is unlikely, as the observed rms in the number density of foreground galaxies is too small to explain the observed effect.

5. The authors conclude that the observed anti-correlation is likely due to weak lensing, and that it provides a cleaner probe of the mass distribution at intermediate redshifts than lensing-induced angular correlations. They suggest that a large uniform set of intermediate-redshift SNe Ia, such as those that would result from the SNAP mission and the LSST mission, would be invaluable for the study of mass clustering in the nearby universe.

1. The periodic anderson lattice (PAM) is a model for understanding heavy fermion metals, kondo insulators, and intermediate valence materials. The PAM is characterized by four independent dimensionless parameters, which determine the physical behavior of the system. The model is generically metallic, with non-integral level and band occupancies, extending from weakly correlated to strongly correlated regimes. The heavy fermion (HF) regime, characterized by a low-energy coherence scale, is of primary interest.

2. The local moment approach (LMA) is a theoretical framework used to study the PAM. The LMA is based on an underlying two-self-energy description, which naturally leads to a physically intuitive notion of local moments. This approach is capable of handling strong interactions and is formally exact in the large-dimensional limit. The LMA has been successfully applied to study the PAM and has provided a rich description of transport and optical properties.

3. The LMA has been extended to handle the generic asymmetric PAM, which is the focus of this paper. The approach has been used to study single-particle dynamics, d.c. transport, and optical conductivities. The LMA results for the thermal evolution of single-particle dynamics and scattering rates are presented, showing a universal scaling behavior in terms of the coherence scale. The LMA results for the d.c. resistivity are also presented, showing a crossover from the low-energy coherent fermi liquid to the high-energy incoherent regime.

4. The LMA results for the optical conductivity are presented, showing a universal function of the scaled frequency and temperature. The thermal evolution of the optical conductivity is shown, with the drude peak broadening and eventually merging into an optical pseudogap. The influence of the conduction band filling on the optical pseudogap is also presented, showing that the pseudogap becomes shallower with increasing conduction band filling. The LMA results for the optical conductivity are compared to the renormalized band picture, showing that the latter is qualitatively inadequate.

1. The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied for several decades, and recent attention has been drawn to its importance in biology, particularly in DNA loop formation, which is a basic process underlying genetic expression, replication, and recombination. DNA loop formation is crucial for the repressive regulation of genes, such as the lac genes in E. coli. The hairpin loop formation is also an elementary step in protein folding and RNA folding. A cell is a crowded environment with various subcellular structures, including globular proteins and RNAs, which interact with DNA.

2. The cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium, as indicated by the power spectrum of the fluctuating force exerted on the cytoskeleton, which is an order of magnitude larger than that expected from thermal equilibrium conditions. The advance of single-molecule experiment techniques has provided detailed information on DNA loop formation. Researchers have observed Laci-mediated DNA loop formation and dissociation by monitoring nano-scale Brownian motion. The effects of tension and torsion on DNA looping have also been studied.

3. Theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the effects of tension on DNA loop formation. Yan et al. developed a transfer matrix method to calculate the semiflexible polymer end-to-end distance distribution function and loop formation probability. Blumberg et al. studied the effects of static tension on protein-mediated DNA loop formation by modeling the DNA conformation as either looped or unlooped states. However, there is still a need for a unifying conceptual or theoretical framework to explain the variety of experiments.

4. In this study, Brownian dynamics simulations were performed to understand the basic physical mechanism of biopolymer looping. The simulations were combined with a one-dimensional theory of barrier crossing over the free energy of loop formation. The results showed that the looping time increases exponentially with tension, and the normalized looping time is insensitive to the value of the stretching stiffness. The study also found that the looping time has a resonant minimum at an optimum flipping time, which is a nontrivial extension of the resonant activation of single Brownian particles.

5. The study's results are consistent with recent experiments for both static and fluctuating tension cases. The effect of time-dependent tension is more significant for longer chains. The study suggests a possibility that a biopolymer can self-organize optimally utilizing the ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations. Further experiments using dichotomically fluctuating tension with various flipping times are called for to establish the resonant activation phenomena in polymer loop formation",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the dynamical processes of close binary systems, including star-star and star-planet systems. These interactions can lead to phenomena such as synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, and disruption of objects. The tidal interactions can also affect the orbital parameters of the binary system.

2. In this paper, the authors consider the tidal interaction of two bodies: a star and a point source, which can be a star or a planet. The point source is referred to as a planet, implying that it can also be a star. The authors aim to investigate the dynamical tides by taking into account the stellar evolution.

3. The authors chose three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses for their study. They considered all stars without allowance for their rotation and magnetic field, and touched on the stellar physics superficially. The star of one solar mass closely corresponds to our sun and has a radiative core and a convective envelope on the main sequence.

4. The other two stars of one and a half and two solar masses are more massive and have a more complex structure. They have a convective core and a radiative envelope on the main sequence. The problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to the problem of determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star-planet system.

5. The low-frequency g-modes of the stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides. The tidal interactions are fairly intense at small periastron distances of the planet. For a periastron distance of 4 au, the dimensionless excitation frequency is 0.5, which corresponds to g-modes.

6. The authors used the mesa software package to model the stars and obtained the data, which were then interpolated to two million points. They solved the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction problem and calculated the overlap integrals using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The data for the stars and overlap integrals were compared with those from Ivanov et al. (2013) and Chernov et al. (2013).

2. Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have pushed the resolution of far-field imaging down to the nanometer range, relying on the accurate localization of individual fluorescent markers.
3. A key issue affecting subwavelength imaging methods is the optical transparency of the media surrounding the light emitters, which can be turbid due to intense scattering of photons.
4. Techniques to measure the distance between individual nano-objects without imaging their position exist, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), but determining distances in a scattering medium remains a challenging problem.
5. A new approach is proposed to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light.
6. The method relies on the measurement of intensity fluctuations and the analysis of the intensity-intensity correlation function and the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources.
7. The speckle contrast measured in a single speckle spot contains the same information as the contrast of the total emitted power, and it is proportional to the fluctuations of the cross-density of states (CDOS) connecting the two sources.
8. The CDOS is a two-point quantity that encodes the distance between the two sources, and its fluctuations can be accessed from measurements of the directional intensity.
9. In a weakly disordered, homogeneous, and isotropic medium, an explicit approximate expression of the fluctuations of the CDOS can be given, allowing for the determination of the relative distance between the sources.
10. The results suggest the possibility of measuring the relative distance between two incoherent sources in a complex medium from the speckle noise recorded at a single point, providing an alternative to the two-point field-field correlation technique.

1. The glassy wormlike chain (GWLC) model is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike chain (WLC) model, which is a standard model of semiflexible polymers. The GWLC model describes the mechanics of an isolated semiflexible polymer in an isothermal viscous solvent. It assumes that the polymer network is constrained to eventually return to its original equilibrium state after a transient stretch. This assumption allows for a viscoelastic response in an operational sense, but the underlying stochastic process is fundamentally inelastic.

2. The GWLC model has been successful in describing a plethora of rheological data for polymer solutions and living cells over many decades in time with a minimum of parameters. However, all previous studies were primarily concerned with viscoelastic behavior, while recent investigations have underscored the glassy, fragile, and inelastic character of the mechanical response of living cells. The model has been extended to situations involving inelastic deformations, where the deformation does not alter the microscopic ground state. The protocol applied by Trepat et al. provides a paradigmatic example of reversible inelastic behavior.

3. The extended GWLC model has been used to study the nonlinear and non-equilibrium dynamic response of sticky biopolymer networks. The model predicts a pronounced fluidization response, which develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers. The fluidization response is accompanied by a cyclic softening or shake-down effect, which depends on the fraction of transiently broken bonds. The model also predicts that the yield force for the onset of fluidization is sensitive to the deformation rate, and that the fluidization response can be influenced by the prestressing force present in adhering cells.

These materials are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and contain heavy or rare metal elements.

2. However, the emergence of topological Mott insulators (TMIs) in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice is hampered by competing symmetry breakings such as charge density waves (CDWs), and the stability of TMIs is affected by quantum many-body fluctuations beyond the mean-field approximation.

3. To stabilize TMIs, researchers have found that reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones is crucial, and by introducing third-neighbor hopping, the Fermi velocity can be linearly decreased, leading to the emergence of TMIs in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. This finding offers a breakthrough in the realization of two-dimensional TMIs, and further analyses are needed for experimental methods of controlling the stability of TMIs and quantitative estimates of the stability for bilayer graphenes.

1. Graphene has garnered interest from various communities, including those aiming to create atomic-scale circuit devices and those searching for new topological phases. Both communities sought to gap the massless Dirac spectrum, and the realization of a gate-induced band gap in Bernal stacked bi-layer graphene brought the holy grail of graphene-based transistor one step closer to reality. However, the sub-gap conductance measured by @xcite introduced a new puzzle and obstacle.

2. The dominant transport along physical edges of the samples proposed earlier by @xcite was ruled out by Corbino geometry measurements, which observed two-dimensional variable range hopping type temperature dependence, independent of geometry. In this paper, the authors predict the existence of topological gapless channel of transport along recently imaged AB-Ba tilt boundary network, which solves the puzzle. The predicted topological edge state holds the promise of the first realization of topological surface(edge) state hosted by structural topological defect.

3. The lattice dislocations in three-dimensional crystals previously discussed occur deep in the sample and are not directly accessible. However, the tilt boundary of interest has recently been observed, and it is a structural topological line defect along which each neighboring layer is displaced by one inter-atomic spacing. Such a defect can occur due to the third dimension added by the stacking of the graphene layers.

4. The authors consider the electronic structure of tilt boundaries with pure strain and show that the bulk of each domain is gapped in the presence of inter-layer hopping and the external electric field. They present two separate microscopic calculations of the AB-BA tilt boundary electronic structure for pure strain, which shows gapless edge states. The charge distribution is prominent inside the domain wall but rapidly decays away from the tilt boundary.

5. The authors further carried out first-principles calculation using density functional theory (DFT) within the local density approximation (LDA) to address the issues of tilt boundary width and strain. They constructed a periodic supercell with two tilt boundaries characterized by Burger's vectors identical to the ones considered within tight-binding calculation, but the domain wall is set to have finite width.

1. Macromolecules containing ionizable groups dissociate into charged macromolecules and counterions when dissolved in a polar solvent such as water. Depending on the acidic or basic property of their monomers, ionizable polymers in solution can be classified into polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes. Polyelectrolytes contain a single sign of charged monomers, while polyampholytes bear charged monomers of both signs. These macromolecules are often water-soluble and have numerous industrial and medical applications.

2. Many biological macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins are charged polymers. In polymer science, charged polymers have been an important subject during the last several decades. Contrary to a polyelectrolyte chain, in a polyampholyte chain, attractive interactions between charged monomers of opposite sign tend to decrease the chain size. Oppositely charged monomers can be distributed randomly along a polyampholyte chain or charges of one sign can be arranged in long blocks.

3. With the same ratio of positively and negatively charged monomers (isoelectric condition), behaviors of a single polyampholyte and the solution of polyampholytes depend noticeably on the sequence of charged monomers on the chains. For example, it has been shown that the sequence of charged amino acids (charge distribution) along ionically complementary peptides affects the aggregation behavior and self-assembling process in the solution of such peptides. Also, using Monte Carlo simulations, it has been shown that charged monomers sequence of charge-symmetric polyampholytes affects their adsorption properties to a charged surface. The properties of the system of polymers anchored on a surface are of great interest both in industrial and biological applications and academic research.

4. With a sufficiently strong repulsion between the polymers, the chains become stretched, and the structure obtained is known as a polymer brush. Planar and curved brushes formed by grafted homopolymers have extensively been investigated by various theoretical methods. The anchored polymers of a brush may be consisting of charged monomers. In this case, the brush is known as a polyelectrolyte or a polyampholyte brush depending on the charged monomers of the chains being of the same sign or being composed of both signs.

The numerous candidates for these mesons cannot be accommodated in one nonet, and some are supposed to be glueballs, molecular states, and tetraquark states. The authors propose a new approach to study the nonet scalar mesons as tetraquark states using the QCD sum rules. They introduce the colored diquarks as point particles and describe them as basic scalar fields.

They perform the standard procedure of the QCD sum rules to study the nonet scalar mesons below 2 GeV. The numerical results show that the present predictions are compatible with the experimental data and theoretical estimations. The new sum rules can be extended to study other multiquark states, and the authors conclude that the diquark currents have the outstanding advantage to satisfy the two criteria of the QCD sum rules more easily.

The problem of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2D) has gained increasing interest in recent years, stimulated by proposals for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases. The experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps has opened up ways to realize these phenomena. Research on 2D quantum effects in condensed matter physics has a long history, including superfluid films, high-temperature superconductivity, and 2D materials like graphene. The theory of elementary quantum two-body systems and processes in the plane has also been developed.

2. The anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction pose significant challenges for describing the scattering process. The usual partial-wave analysis becomes inefficient due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial waves in the asymptotic region. Recent progress has been made in the analysis of 2D and quasi-2D scattering of dipoles, including the study of the dipole polarization directed orthogonally to the scattering plane and an arbitrary angle of polarization. The method developed in this work allows for the quantitative analysis of 2D quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer.

3. The method is based on the approach suggested for few-dimensional scattering, which was successfully applied to dipole-dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in 3D free space. The key elements of the method are described in Section II, and it is applied to the 2D scattering on a cylindrical potential with an elliptical base and the 2D dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles. The results of the calculations confirm the convergence of the scattering amplitude to the analytical value at the zero-energy limit. The method has been found to be highly efficient in all problems considered.

The remnant has a shell-like radio continuum morphology and emits thermal X-rays, making it a thermal composite supernova remnant. This classification is based on the combination of a shell-like radio continuum morphology with a centrally bright X-ray morphology. The thermal composite classification is a mysterious class of supernova remnants with more complex origins.

2. The remnant's true extent was revealed by an optical emission line survey of the galactic plane, which showed filaments circumscribing a 4x5x6.3 ellipse. The radio frequency data also suggested a similarly sized shell-type remnant. The remnant's age has been estimated as 23,000 years using radiative phase SNR relations. The distance to the remnant has been estimated as 2.1 kpc using the 19-d relation.

3. The remnant's X-ray emission was observed with the HEAO 1 and ROSAT PSPC instruments, which showed line emission characteristic of thermal emission from hot plasma. The ROSAT PSPC data were used to map the remnant and confirm that the emitting gas is extended and fills the remnant's outline. The ROSAT PSPC data also showed that the remnant lacks a bright shell and exhibits a slowly decreasing temperature gradient. The best-fit temperatures range from 2.5 to 3.5 keV and decrease slightly with radius.

4. The remnant's luminosity is 1.3 x 10^34 erg/s, and the electron density of the X-ray emitting gas is 0.02 cm^-3. The ambient density is expected to be about 10 times the density within the remnant's center, which is a reasonable value at the remnant's location 90 pc above the galactic plane. The electron density is lower than that of the archetypal thermal composite supernova remnant W44, causing the luminosity to be lower as well. The remnant's centrally concentrated SNR morphology is consistent with the radiative phase evolutionary hypothesis.

The evolutionary hypothesis suggests that these remnants have evolved beyond the adiabatic phase into the radiative phase, resulting in cool and non-X-ray emissive peripheries.

1. Permutations of integers are a basic building block for the succinct encoding of integer functions, strings, and binary relations. They can be trivially represented in 6 bits, which is within 7 bits of the information theory lower bound of 8 bits. Efficient computation of both the permutation and its inverse is required in many interesting applications.

2. The lower bound of 8 bits yields a lower bound of 10 comparisons to sort such a permutation in the comparison model. However, a large body of research has been dedicated to finding better sorting algorithms that can take advantage of specificities of each permutation to sort. Trivial examples of permutations that can be sorted efficiently include the identity, or containing sorted blocks or sorted subsequences.

3. Less trivial examples of permutations whose structure makes them interesting for applications include classes of permutations whose structure makes them interesting for applications. These classes of permutations can be sorted efficiently using specialized algorithms. For example, the Hu-Tucker algorithm can be used to sort permutations with a small number of runs.

4. Each sorting algorithm in the comparison model yields an encoding scheme for permutations. An adaptive sorting algorithm performs a small number of comparisons on many classes of permutations, making it a good choice for encoding permutations. However, the encoding scheme may not support the inverse of the permutation or the simple application of the permutation in reasonable time.

5. The authors describe several encodings of permutations that use a small number of bits while supporting the operations of permutation and its inverse in time proportional to the number of bits. These encodings are based on the structure of the permutation, such as the number of runs or the distribution of the sizes of the runs. The encodings are designed to be efficient for a wide range of permutations.

They attracted the interest of physicists in the 80s due to their analogy with disordered systems studied in statistical mechanics. The study of Kauffman networks has led to the discovery of a dynamical phase transition, which was found and studied in the framework of mean field theory. The phase transition is characterized by a change in the behavior of the system, from a chaotic phase to a frozen phase.

The relevant elements are identified using an algorithm that eliminates stable and irrelevant variables. The number of relevant elements was found to scale as a power law of the system size in the chaotic phase, and as a stretched exponential in the frozen phase. The study of Kauffman networks has also led to the discovery of finite-size effects, which are due to the periodic dynamics of the random networks.

In QT, many quantized vortices with quantized circulation are nucleated, forming tangles, which is drastically different from classical turbulence (CT) realized in classical fluids.

2. The study of SST in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) has found that both the -5/3 and 1 power laws appear in the spectrum of the superflow kinetic and the spin-dependent interaction energy. The -5/3 power law is generated by the nonlinear spin term in the velocity motion equation.

Numerical results of the spin-1 spinor Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a phenomenological small-scale energy dissipation term have confirmed the appearance of both power laws in the two-dimensional system. The inertial term is smaller than the nonlinear spin term in the range of the density coherence length.

The study has also discussed the dependence of the spectra on the relative velocity, finding that the period sustaining the Kolmogorov spectrum in the superflow kinetic energy becomes short when the relative velocity is large. The spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy, however, can exhibit the 1 power law independently of the relative velocity.

1. Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) reside in about 40% of nearby bright galaxies and occupy the majority of the population of AGNs. Their low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes.

2. The accretion model of optically-thin discs, such as the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), is often used to explain the low luminosities of LLAGNs. This model predicts a ""submillimetre bump"" in the spectral-energy distribution (SED) of LLAGNs.

3. The ADAF model is crucial in understanding the radio sources of LLAGNs, and observational evidence of the ADAF is essential to confirm its existence. However, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands.

4. The submillimetre bump means a highly inverted spectrum at centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelengths, which is a key feature of the ADAF model. Observations for LLAGNs have been carried out exclusively at centimetre bands due to their faintness.

5. About half of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERS) hold a compact radio core, and at least 25% of transition objects also hold a compact core. Most of the cores show nearly flat spectra, indicating jet domination.

6. The contamination from jets has prevented the ADAF from being revealed at centimetre bands, and high-frequency observations are promising to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF. The use of a beam as small as possible and estimations of every conceivable contamination are essential.

7. The present paper reports millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs, and the observational evidence of the ADAF is crucial in understanding the radio sources of LLAGNs. The high-frequency radio survey has greatly expanded the frequency range of submillimetre-bump hunting.

8. Our findings will encourage further LLAGN surveys at higher-frequency ranges with the coming Atacama Large Millimeter and Submillimetre Array (ALMA) to prove the ADAF. The existence of the ADAF will give radio astronomers a chance to make the direct imaging for accretion discs.

9. The ADAF model predicts a high brightness temperature of 10^12 K in radio bands, which is expected to be detected with future Very-",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. The scattering, absorption, and reradiation of photons by dust grains affect the propagation of starlight and play a key role in regulating the energy balance in the interstellar medium. Studies of these processes have provided a great deal of insight into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains.

2. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and this dependence can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law, also known as the reddening law. The ratio of total to selective extinction is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.

3. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, and while diffuse interstellar dust is observed to have a certain average value of the extinction law slope, this value is not universal and can vary significantly from one line of sight to another. Significant deviations from this canonical value are known to exist for a variety of interstellar dust clouds.

4. The extinction law slope can be measured using various methods, including the use of broad-band photometry in light of the fact that an extensive suite of photometric data sets is currently available. Three methods for measuring the extinction law slope are proposed in this paper.

5. The first two methods rely on accurate three-band optical photometry of cluster stars, while the third method relies on two-band optical photometry and a map of the dust thermal emission. All three methods are based on the premise that the width of the blue horizontal branch (HB) is minimized when the appropriate extinction law slope value is used to correct the photometry for extinction and reddening.

6. The methods are applied to NGC 4833, a low-latitude galactic globular cluster with variable extinction across its face. Realistic Monte Carlo simulations of the cluster data set are used to estimate the accuracy with which the extinction law slope can be recovered.

7. The results from the three methods are combined to give a mean extinction law slope of 2.74 for the line of sight towards NGC 4833. The scatter in the cluster HB is used to estimate the amount of small-scale structure in the dust complex in the foreground of NGC 4833.

1. The Kondo lattice model (KLM) is used to study the heavy fermion systems, which are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales. The KLM describes an array of localized magnetic moments coupled antiferromagnetically to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons.

2. The dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) is used to investigate the KLM ground state, and the results show that the quasi-particles of the heavy fermion liquid remain intact across the magnetic order-disorder transition. The DCA approach allows for antiferromagnetic order, enabling the computation of spectral functions across magnetic transitions and in magnetically ordered phases.

3. The single-particle spectral function is calculated using the DCA+QMC approach, and the results show that the quasi-particle weight decreases continuously across the transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state. The spectral function also shows a feature reminiscent of the heavy-fermion band, indicating the absence of kondo breakdown throughout the phase diagram.

4. The transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is continuous and is associated with the backfolding of the large heavy fermion Fermi surface. The Fermi surface topology change within the antiferromagnetic metallic phase corresponds to two continuous Lifshitz transitions, as suggested by a mean-field modeling of the quantum Monte Carlo results.

1. The recent discovery of a resonance at 125 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is compatible with the expectations for the Higgs particle, representing a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles. This discovery may also affect the field of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector. The Higgs field may be responsible for inflation and as a suppression mechanism for the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields.

2. The LHC experiments have provided upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons, and bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity may also be obtained by considering strong-gravity astrophysical objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and primordial black holes. The presence of a strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles. Nucleons are minimally affected by the strong curvature since most of their mass arises from the gluonic fields that are not coupled to the Higgs field at tree level.

3. Peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions and are strongly suppressed for molecular transitions in which the main role is played by the nuclei themselves, such as in vibrational or rotational spectroscopy. Due to the vanishing of the Ricci scalar for spherically symmetric objects, attention was focused on the possibility of couplings to the only non-zero curvature invariant, the Kreschmann invariant. The Kreschmann invariant plays an important role in quadratic theories of gravity and modified theories of gravity.

4. White dwarfs have been known since the 19th century and have had a prominent role in fundamental physics since the early 20th century. They have been used to verify general relativity by measuring the gravitational redshift of Sirius B and to study the dependence of the fine structure constant on gravity. White dwarfs can be used to obtain limits on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant by means of spectroscopic observations.

5. The analysis is complemented by considering data taken from the HST archive on a second white dwarf, Procyon B, in which Caii and MgII lines, in addition to the C3 bands, are also present. The search for coupling between the Higgs (or any scalar field permeating the whole universe) and spacetime curvature arises naturally within the framework of field theory in curved spacetime.",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27}"

1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into various phases, including hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium. Star formation appears to be restricted to cold dense gas, and the molecular gas content strongly correlates with the star formation rate. The link between star formation and molecular gas is not causal, but molecular gas represents an indispensable tracer of star-forming regions. Understanding these links is crucial for identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas develops.

2. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores that develop in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Young, massive stars are the main source of far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons that permeate the ISM and readily photodissociate interstellar molecules. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding have attenuated the interstellar radiation field. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, known as photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively both numerically and theoretically.

2. The authors' conclusion is supported by the presence of the VRC in all their LMC fields, its agreement with the time-averaged locus of the blue loops, and its relative stellar density consistent with the density on the main sequence and the assumption of continuous and constant star formation history in the LMC over the past 1 gyr.

1. The study investigates the dependence of star formation on cluster mass and location within a cluster in 69 local galaxy clusters. The cluster membership is determined from SDSS DR7 spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies brighter than m_r = 17.5, and star formation rates are determined with 22 μm photometry from WISE using the relations outlined in Jarrett et al. (2011). The study finds that both the fraction of demi-LIRGs and the mean specific SFR of cluster galaxies increase with projected distance from the cluster center. However, the fraction of demi-LIRGs remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.

2. The study also investigates the impact of cluster mass on star formation by presenting the total cluster SFR normalized by M_200 as a function of M_200. The results show no evidence of a correlation between the cluster specific SFR and cluster mass in this first uniform dataset to detect obscured star formation out to several times the virial radius in a large sample of low-redshift clusters. This indicates that cluster mechanisms which scale with cluster mass, such as ram pressure or harassment, are not likely to play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in local clusters. The study suggests that strangulation, a mechanism that is not strongly dependent on cluster mass, may be the dominant process for regulating star formation in dense environments.

3. The study uses data from WISE and SDSS DR7 to study the dependence of star formation on cluster mass and location within a cluster. The results show that the fraction of demi-LIRGs is suppressed at large radii, which may be due to galaxies being pre-processed in intermediate-density environments or the contribution of a ""backsplash"" population. The study also finds that the mean specific SFR of cluster galaxies increases with projected distance from the cluster center, but remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius. The results suggest that star formation is quenched in a significant population of galaxies within small groups or filaments.

4. The study's results are consistent with previous studies that have found no significant correlation between cluster specific SFR and cluster mass. The study's findings suggest that the dominant process for regulating star formation in dense environments does not depend on cluster mass, and hence must be efficient in small groups or filaments. The study's results also imply that even in low-mass groups, star formation has already been quenched to similar levels observed in clusters that are more massive",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. The frozen nucleon approximation is a method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic fermi gas model, which reduces the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1, making it a fast and efficient approach. This approximation assumes that the momenta of the initial nucleons can be neglected for high enough values of the momentum transfer. The method has been validated by comparing the approximate 2p-2h response functions with exact results in the rfg. The frozen approximation works well for momentum transfers above the fermi momentum.

2. The validity of the frozen approximation relies on the fact that the integrand inside the 2p-2h response is a function that depends slowly on the momenta of the two initial nucleons inside the fermi sea. However, the forward delta-excitation term requires a special treatment, and an effective propagator for the delta resonance has been introduced to average over the fermi gas. The frozen approximation has been compared with the shell model results and found to be in good agreement. The approach can be used to implement 2p-2h models in monte carlo event generators, making it a useful tool for neutrino oscillation experiments.",1,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. The mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is correlated with the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the galaxy. This correlation may imply an evolutionary relation between the growth of the SMBH and the host galaxy. To study the dependence of various observed phenomena of AGN on the black hole mass and cosmic evolution, independent and reliable estimates of the mass of the black holes are required. One independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole is using the reverberation mapping technique.

2. The reverberation mapping technique involves measuring the time lag between the variations of the broad emission line and the continuum emission. This time lag can be used to estimate the size of the broad line region (BLR) and the mass of the black hole. The technique has been used to make estimates of SMBH masses over a large range of redshift, but it is observationally taxing and requires a large amount of telescope time.

1. The broad emission iron lines found in active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries are thought to originate close to the black hole through the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc. The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in shaping the line, particularly in determining the position of the marginally stable orbit.

2. The Laor model, a widely used relativistic disc spectral line model, has been limited to a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, but this limitation has been relaxed in the Ky model. The Ky model allows for the dimensionless angular momentum to be fitted, providing more flexibility in data fitting procedures.

3. The Laor model can still be used to estimate the spin of the black hole by identifying the inner edge of the disc with the marginally stable orbit. However, the Ky model provides a more accurate representation of the relativistic line profile.

4. The Laor and Ky models were compared using data from the XMM-Newton satellite and artificial data generated for the XEUS mission. The results showed that the Ky model provides a better-defined minimum for the spin parameter and more regularly shaped confidence contour plots.

5. The Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, which affects the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line. The discrepancies between the two models are more visible, especially for lower values of the spin.

1. The ""displace, cut and reflect"" method is used to generate axially symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations, which can be used as models of galaxies or accretion disks. This method involves displacing a compact source of gravitational field, cutting it, and reflecting the remaining space to create a disk with a singularity. The method can be applied to any spacetime solution of the Einstein equations with or without a source. The resulting disk can have a positive energy density and equal radial and azimuthal pressures, making it a perfect fluid.

2. The method is applied to the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates to generate a disk with surface energy density and radial and azimuthal pressures given by specific equations. The total mass of the disk can be calculated using the Einstein equations, and the disk's surface energy density is always positive, satisfying the weak energy condition. The strong energy condition is also satisfied, indicating that the disk is made of matter with the usual gravitational attractive property. The velocity of sound propagation is also calculated, and the condition that it is less than the speed of light is satisfied.

3. The method is also applied to the Buchdahl solution, which represents a fluid sphere with no boundary, to generate a disk with energy density, pressure, and sound velocity given by specific equations. The conditions for the energy density and pressure to be positive are satisfied, and the velocity of sound is also calculated. The tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion is calculated, and the specific angular momentum is also determined. The stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane is studied using an extension of Rayleigh's criteria of stability.

4. The method is applied to other solutions of the Einstein equations, including the Narlikar-Patwardhan-Vaidya (NPV) solutions, to generate disks with halos. The NPV solutions represent a sphere of perfect fluid with a specific metric function, and the disk generated from these solutions has energy density, pressure, and sound velocity given by specific equations. The tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion is also calculated, and the specific angular momentum is determined. The stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane is studied, and regions of unstable orbits are found for certain parameters.

This technique has been used in various experiments, including ionospheric modification experiments by a high-power HF radio wave at Platteville in Colorado. The experiments demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation in ionosonde records, and excitation of spread F.

2. The interaction between powerful HF radio beams and the ionospheric plasma was first observed in 1970 in experiments conducted at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, using a scatter radar diagnostic technique. A decade later, it was found experimentally in Troms that strong, systematic, structured, wide-band secondary HF radiation escapes from the interaction region. This observation demonstrated complex interactions, including weak and strong EM turbulence, and harmonic generation.

3. Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence. Examples include analytical and numerical studies of Langmuir turbulence and upper-hybrid/lower-hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas. In this letter, a full-scale simulation study of the propagation of an HF EM wave into the ionosphere is presented.

4. The simulation involves realistic scale sizes of the ionosphere and the wavelength of the EM waves. The results suggest that such simulations will become a powerful tool to study HF-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level for direct comparison with experimental data. The simulation uses a vertically stratified ion number density profile and a constant geomagnetic field directed obliquely to the density gradient.

5. The EM wave is injected vertically into the ionosphere, with spatial variations only in the direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. The simulation neglects the EM field falloff, the Fresnel pattern created obliquely to the direction by the incident and reflected wave, and the influence on the radio wave propagation due to field-aligned irregularities in the ionosphere. The simulation uses a simple one-dimensional model and assumes a linearly polarized EM pulse.

6. The simulation results show that the EM pulse propagates without changing shape through the neutral atmosphere until it reaches the ionospheric layer. The initially linearly polarized EM wave undergoes Faraday rotation due to the different dispersion properties of the L-O and R-X modes in the magnetized plasma. The simulation also shows the reflection of the L-O and R-X modes at different altitudes and the mode conversion of the L-O mode into electrostatic Lang",1,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 18}"

1. The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid Mott-insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. The model has been successfully applied to cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, which has rekindled interest in the Mott-insulator transition. The possibility of directly manipulating and testing the many-body behavior of a system of trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is very attractive. Possible applications include the use of a Mott state of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice as a starting point to create controlled multiparticle entanglement.

2. The Mott-Hubbard model is described by a Hamiltonian that includes the kinetic energy of the bosons and the repulsive interaction between bosons on the same lattice site. The ratio of the onsite energy and the bandwidth forms the key parameter in the system, which can be easily controlled and varied by several orders of magnitude in optical lattices. Probing the system by taking absorption pictures to image the expansion patterns after a reasonable expansion time yields information about the momentum distribution of the state. This procedure was used to experimentally confirm the Mott transition in an optical lattice.

3. The Gutzwiller approach is based on an ansatz for the many-body ground state that factorizes into single lattice-site wavefunctions. However, this approach fails to describe the correct behavior of short-range correlations between different lattice sites, which are important for experimentally measurable observables. To get a satisfactory description of the short-range correlations, a perturbative approach is used to improve the Gutzwiller mean-field result. The perturbative corrections to the Gutzwiller result show important modifications to single-site observables as well as to the correlation function.

4. The perturbative corrections to the Gutzwiller result are particularly large in 1D, but get smaller with increasing dimension. The critical value is not modified within the present perturbative approach. The single-particle density matrix is of particular importance as it describes the correlation between the different lattice sites. The correlation function shows off-diagonal long-range order in the superfluid state, in contrast to the Mott-insulator phase where it decays exponentially.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

The method involves augmenting the target space to a larger space of lorentzian signature, where the logarithm of the scale factor plays the role of time. This is reminiscent of mini-superspace models of quantum cosmology, where the scalar fields are moduli fields for extra dimensions. The lorentzian metric on the augmented target space is induced from the Wheeler-DeWitt metric on the space of higher-dimensional metrics.

2. The authors present new photometry of HIP 115147, its known visual companion HIP 115147B, and LSPM J2322+7847, and obtain preliminary trigonometric parallax astrometry for the latter companion. The photometry was calibrated with an instrumental zero point term and a first-order airmass term. The calibration field was the standard field PG2213-006 from the NOMAD catalog. Additional photometric observations were subsequently obtained on UT 16 and 17 June 2007.

3. The photometric results are presented in Table 1, along with 2MASS photometry, proper motions from NOMAD, and parallax determinations. The estimated uncertainties in the J-band measures are 0.11 mag in the case of LSPM J2322+7847 and 0.04 mag for the HIP 115147 components. Since the August 2005 photometry indicated that LSPM J2322+7847 was most likely an M-dwarf at approximately the same distance as HIP 115147, it was added to the trigonometric parallax program at USNO's Flagstaff Station. A total of 66 acceptable CCD observations have been accumulated on this field, covering an epoch range of 1.65 years.

The star HIP 115147 was identified with the bright X-ray source H2311+77, which led to the suggestion of RS CVN-type activity.

1. The universe is believed to be flat, and its energy density is dominated by dark energy, which causes the cosmic expansion to accelerate.
2. Researchers have tried to understand the connection between dark energy and particle physics, and one model, the mavans scenario, proposes that relic neutrinos could form a negative pressure fluid and cause cosmic acceleration.
3. In the mavans scenario, an unknown scalar field called the acceleron is introduced, and neutrinos are assumed to interact through a new scalar force, causing the neutrino mass to depend on its number density and change with the evolution of the universe.
4. The equation of state parameter and dark energy density also evolve with the neutrino mass, depending on the model of the scalar potential and the relation between the acceleron and the neutrino mass.
5. A supersymmetric version of the mavans scenario is proposed, where supersymmetry is broken in the hidden sector at the TeV scale and its effect is transmitted to the dark sector through gravity.

1. The quark gluon plasma (QGP) is a phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where quarks and gluons are mostly liberated from their confinement within hadrons. This phase is currently being actively studied, and revealing its phase transition structure is a central aim of ongoing and future research. The QGP can be created in the early universe, at the core of super-dense stars, or in the initial stage of relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions in heavy ion accelerators. The QGP is a new state of matter that can be created in the laboratory.

2. The QGP can be created at high temperature or high baryon density, and the critical temperature and baryon density required for the transition to take place are currently being studied. The QGP is expected to be a weakly interacting system, and perturbative methods can be used to describe its behavior. The asymptotic freedom of the QGP suggests two procedures for its creation: at high temperature or at high baryon density. The QGP is a complex system that requires a detailed understanding of its thermodynamic properties.

3. The thermodynamic properties of the QGP can be calculated using the Landau Fermi liquid theory, which describes the behavior of relativistic systems such as the QGP. The energy density of the QGP can be evaluated using the Landau Fermi liquid theory, and the results can be used to calculate other thermodynamic properties such as the pressure and entropy. The QGP is an ultra-relativistic system, and its thermodynamic properties can be calculated using the relativistic partition function. The QGP is a complex system that requires a detailed understanding of its thermodynamic properties.

4. The phase diagram of the QGP can be extracted by solving the equation of state, which relates the pressure and energy density of the system.

1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the early 80s in the study of periodic advance of glaciers on Earth, and it refers to the effect of nonmonotone dependence of the response of a system on the noise when this noise is added to a periodic input signal. This phenomenon can improve the transmission of a signal by the addition of noise.

2. The problem of estimating a signal transmitted through a channel can be improved by adding noise, and the optimal level of noise is called stochastic resonance. The criterion applied to measure optimality of estimators are the Shannon mutual information or the Kullback divergence.

3. The Fisher information quantity has been proposed as a measure of optimality, and it can be maximized for certain noise structures. If there is only one global maximum, the corresponding noise level is the value for which we have stochastic resonance.

4. The authors study the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model where a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal are added with a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process. They propose two schemes of observations: observing only the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.

5. The authors propose two different estimators for the schemes and study their asymptotic properties. They show that the estimators proposed are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators.

6. The authors also study a problem of testing two simple hypotheses for the model discussed in the previous section using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion. They show that the decision rules for their model are similar to the one proposed by Chapeau-Blondeau in the i.i.d. setting.

7. The overall probability of error is a non-decreasing function of the signal, and the authors show that the effect of stochastic resonance can reduce sensibly the overall probability of making the wrong decision. This kind of behavior is not outlined in the work of Chapeau-Blondeau.

1. The order parameter in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) has been found to have mainly a d-wave pairing symmetry, which is confirmed by phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements. These measurements show that the predominant d-wave gap symmetry is present up to the superconducting critical temperature, with minor components smaller than 5% of that with the d-wave symmetry. The thermal conductivity measurements have also shown the predominance of this symmetry for the gap function. The fourfold oscillation in the thermal conductivity can be explained by considering both Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles.

2. The thermal conductivity measurements were performed on two single crystals of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) at different temperatures and angles, with a magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO2 planes. The measurements show that the angle dependence of the longitudinal thermal conductivity changes above 15 K, with a minimum at 45° (field parallel to the heat current) and a maximum at high angles. The observed behavior can be well reproduced by a model involving Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the two-dimensional Boltzmann transport equation for the thermal conductivity. The model assumes a d-wave pairing symmetry of the order parameter.

3. The numerical simulations using the Andreev scattering model and the two-dimensional Boltzmann transport equation for the thermal conductivity show a good agreement with the experimental results. The simulations reproduce the symmetry of the curves in the whole measured temperature range, and the calculated oscillation amplitude above 20 K increases up to 10 times that observed in the experiment. The factor used to fit the experimental oscillation amplitude is related to the inelastic scattering rate, which was not taken explicitly into account in the previous calculations. The temperature dependence of the inelastic scattering rate is given by the factor used to fit the experimental oscillation amplitude.

4. The thermal Hall angle measurements performed in the same YBCO twinned crystal show that the power law dependence obtained for the inelastic scattering rate is similar to that obtained for the longitudinal scattering rate assuming a d-wave pairing. The power law dependence is expected to be proportional to the density of quasiparticles, which is consistent with the simple two-fluid model. The spin-fluctuation scattering picture also predicts a power law dependence, but with a different exponent.

2. Two Dehn surgeries along a knot with distinct slopes are called purely cosmetic if the resulting three-manifolds are oriented manifolds. The cosmetic surgery conjecture states that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic.

3. The authors of the paper study purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere and show that for most knots, the resulting three-manifolds are not oriented manifolds for distinct slopes. They also provide a sufficient condition for a knot that admits no purely cosmetic surgery in terms of its Jones polynomial.

4. The main result of the paper gives a condition for a knot to have no purely cosmetic surgery, which is related to the second and third-order derivatives of the Jones polynomial. The authors also show that certain classes of knots, such as genus two knots and knots with a specific concordance invariant, do not admit purely cosmetic surgeries.

5. The authors use a surgery formula by Lescop, which involves a knot invariant that satisfies a crossing change formula. They also observe that this invariant is a finite type invariant of order 3 and use it to reformulate their main result.

6. The authors prove that the cosmetic surgery conjecture is true for all knots with no more than 10 crossings, except for a few exceptions. They also show that the conjecture is true for certain families of two-bridge knots and whitehead doubles.

7. The authors derive an explicit formula for the canonically normalized finite type knot invariant of order 3 for two-bridge knots in Conway forms. They use this formula to study the cosmetic surgery problem for two-bridge knots.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties, including calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor-invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariance. However, AMSB models suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, leading to tachyonic states. The original solution to this problem is to add a universal mass to the scalars.

2. The minimal AMSB model (MAMSB) has a parameter space given by m_0, m_3/2, A, and sign(μ). An alternative setup for AMSB is the hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMS) model, which uses a similar setup but with a strongly warped hidden region. In HCAMS, the anomaly mediation can become the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector.

3. In HCAMS, the mass of the bino, the gaugino of U(1) gauge symmetry, can be the only soft supersymmetry breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation. Depending on its size, the bino mass can lead to a small perturbation to the spectrum of anomaly mediation or dominate the contribution from anomaly mediation. The HCAMS model should be easily distinguishable from the MAMSB model at the LHC if μ is not too large.

4. The HCAMS model predicts a negative mass squared for the sleptons and features relatively heavy squarks, while pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms and features relatively heavy sleptons. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions. The HCAMS model has a parameter space given by m_0, m_3/2, A, and sign(μ).

5. In the HCAMS model, the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are of the form: m_1 = (3/5)g_1^2m_3/2, m_a = m_3/2, m_i^2 = -14(g_1^2 + g_2^2)m_3/2^2, and a_f = m_3/2.

This approach allows for the possibility of obtaining an exact solution of the scattering problem.

The DT can be defined on the basis of the covariance property of the Schrödinger equation with respect to a transformation of the wavefunction and potential. The DT can also be used to correct the ZRP model.

3. The DT can be used to dress the ZRP model, which improves its possibilities. The DT modifies the generalized ZRP (GZRP) boundary condition and creates a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum. The DT can also be used to add or remove poles of the matrix, which correspond to quasi-stationary states (resonances).",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 9}"

1. The phenomenon of rapidity gaps in hadronic collisions has been observed at both the HERA and Tevatron colliders. These gaps are regions of pseudorapidity without hadronic activity, and they are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons. The exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state is the simplest such model, and it has been used to predict the fraction of dijet events with rapidity gaps. The predicted gap fraction is of order one percent, which is consistent with the observed data.

2. The two-gluon exchange model predicts that the gap fraction should decrease with increasing jet transverse energy and pseudorapidity separation. However, the data from the Tevatron do not show this behavior, and instead suggest a slight increase in the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse energy. This casts doubt on the validity of the two-gluon exchange model, and suggests that non-perturbative effects may be important. The data are not yet precise enough to unambiguously distinguish between different scenarios.

3. The unitarized two-gluon exchange model is a more realistic description of the rapidity gap data, and it takes into account the non-perturbative effects of unitarity. The model predicts that the gap fraction should decrease with increasing pseudorapidity separation, and it is consistent with the data from the Tevatron. However, the model also predicts that the gap fraction should increase with increasing jet transverse energy, which is not observed in the data. The model's predictions are sensitive to the regularization parameters, which are not well-constrained by the data.

4. The unitarized two-gluon exchange model is able to describe the trend of the gap fraction with increasing pseudorapidity separation, and it is consistent with the data from the Tevatron. However, the model's predictions are not unique, and different choices of regularization parameters can lead to different results. The data are not yet precise enough to unambiguously distinguish between different scenarios, and further experimental and theoretical work is needed to clarify the situation. The unitarized two-gluon exchange model provides a more realistic description of the rapidity gap data than the two-gluon exchange model.

1. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where the primary is a compact object and the secondary is a low-mass star. The secondary transfers mass via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk around the compact object that gives rise to the observed X-rays.

2. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems that can be divided into two groups: the Z-sources and Atoll sources. Z-sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and have mass accretion rates that reach the Eddington limit.

3. Atoll sources have lower accretion rates, typically 2 orders of magnitude lower than Z-sources, and their color-color diagrams usually consist of fragmented island-like regions. The main physical difference between Z-sources and Atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.

This approach shows that the anomaly is related to the chiral limit and can be interpreted as an infrared effect.

1. The problem of salient object detection, which involves identifying the most important object in a scene, has been a topic of interest in computer vision. This problem is challenging because it requires a model to prioritize objects for high-level processing, similar to human attention. The goal of salient object detection is to simulate the capability of human attention in prioritizing objects. This capability has several applications in recognition, image and video compression, and other areas.

2. A large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past 7 years, but most of them have focused on scenes with single objects. These models have performed well on existing biased datasets, but it is unclear how they perform on complex cluttered scenes with several objects. The lack of suitable benchmark datasets and a widely-agreed objective definition of the most salient object has hindered the development of more advanced models. This paper aims to provide solutions to these problems.

3. The authors propose a simple baseline salient object detection model that involves two steps: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area. The first step uses a fixation prediction model to find spatial outliers in scenes that attract human eye movements and visual attention. The second step uses a superpixel segmentation algorithm to segment the object area. This model is designed to be simple and computationally efficient.

4. The authors exhaustively compared their model to 8 state-of-the-art methods, which have been shown to perform well on previous benchmarks. The comparison was done using two widely-adopted metrics: precision-recall curve and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The results showed that the authors' model performed well on the msra-5k dataset but struggled on the bruce-a and judd-a datasets. The authors attribute this performance drop to the models' inability to segment the wrong object as the most salient one.

5. The authors also analyzed the interplay between saliency detection, fixation prediction, and object proposal generation. They suggest that these models depend on each other and that correctly predicting where people look is critical to knowing which object is the most salient one. The authors also propose that labeled objects in scenes can help study how objects guide attention and eye movements.

6. The authors' model separates detection from segmentation, which allows it to be used for other purposes, such as segmenting interesting or important objects. The model can also be used as an active observer by incorporating a top-down fixation selection strategy.

1. The invention relates to novel calcium phosphate-coated implantable medical devices and processes of making same. The unique calcium-phosphate coated implantable medical devices minimize immune response to the implant. The coated implantable devices have the capability to store and release one or more medicinally active agents into the body in a controlled manner. This invention has the potential to save millions of lives annually around the world.

2. Cardiovascular stents are widely used in coronary angioplasty procedures to enlarge coronary arteries and thereby allow better blood circulation. Typically this is accomplished by a balloon angioplasty procedure wherein a contracted stent, usually in the form of a metallic mesh tube, is moved into the site of blood vessel narrowing along a guide wire. Once the stent is in place an internally situated balloon expands it radially. After expansion the balloon is deflated and removed from the vessel while the stent remains expanded in place.

3. The placement of metallic stents often leads to harmful side effects. A relatively large proportion of patients (up to half of the population, according to some statistics) experience an immune response to the implanted stent called inflammatory restenosis, and other negative effects, which lead to a re-narrowing of the vessel. This typically requires repeat surgical treatment within 1-2 years of the original balloon angioplasty operation. The mechanisms that lead to restenosis and other immune responses associated with the implantation of a medical device are initiated by damage to the vessel lining during the surgical procedure.

4. The most common surface modification of implanted medical devices is the application of a thin polymer film coating. These coatings are frequently impregnated with medically active agent(s) such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents and other, more complex drugs. These medically active agents are released from the coating through leaching to the arterial wall and the blood stream, often aided by dissolution of the carrier film. Typically, biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and others, frequently in combination with heparin and other anti-thrombogenic agents, are selected in such drug delivery systems.

5. In the past, polymeric materials have been used for drug delivery control and have enjoyed substantial clinical success for certain drug systems. Unfortunately, even biodegradable polymers, although more bio-friendly than the native metallic surface, are still recognized by living tissue as foreign objects. Therefore the bio-degradation process is frequently accompanied by inflammatory response of the tissue.

1. The present invention relates to nerve conduits for the regeneration of peripheral nerves, which can be used to treat peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) that can lead to a lifelong disability, such as paralysis. The most frequent causes of PNI include motor vehicle accidents, gunshot wounds, stabbings, and birth trauma. Current treatments for nerve repair, such as end-to-end suturing and application of autograft or allograft biological tissue, suffer from several limitations.

2. The present invention provides a fabricated implantable nerve guidance conduit (NGC) with an integrated spiral structured porous sheet decorated with surface channels and electrospun fibers. The NGC has superior mechanical strength compared to NGCs in the prior art, along with integrated multiple channels, stable aligned fibrous layers, good inter-cell communication, and high surface/volume ratios within the NGCs. The NGC also has chambers at the distal and proximal ends to provide additional space for fitting nerve stumps.

3. The NGC of the present invention comprises a three-dimensional (3-D) spiral structured porous sheet having two chambers at the ends thereof. The spiral structure includes a highly porous polycaprolactone (PCL) sheet, which may be formed as a spiral-wound sheet using known methods and decorated with surface channels on a surface of the spiral wound sheet. The NGC also has a dense layer of randomly-oriented fibers on the outside of the spiral structure to improve the mechanical properties of the NGC.

4. The NGC of the present invention has been tested in a 10 mm Sprague Dawley (SD) rat sciatic nerve defect to evaluate the effect of nanofibers on peripheral nerve regeneration through porous spiral NGCs. The results showed that the NGC with nanofibers (T-S-AF) had significantly greater cell proliferation than the NGC without nanofibers (T). The NGC with nanofibers also showed improved functional recovery and nerve regeneration compared to the NGC without nanofibers.

1. The present invention relates to a container of a blender, particularly to a set of high-speed blades mounted inside the lower portion of the container. The usage of blender has become popular today, and the configuration structure of a blender is mainly a set of rotatable blades disposed inside the container to mix the ice cubes, vegetables, and fruits until they become liquid. In early phases, the container of the blender was made of glass, but it had several drawbacks such as breakage and expansion due to temperature changes.

2. The container made of reinforced plastic was also not ideal as it resulted in nicks and debris being mixed into the liquid, leading to poor hygiene conditions. The inventors of the present invention encountered these problems and provided a metal lining (cylindrical member) to shield the inner wall of the receptacle. This metal lining was patented in TW580,899 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,786,440.

3. The conventional blender has a cup and a set of blades installed within the base of the cup. When the blades are rotated in high speed, the vegetable and fruit will be grated until they become liquid, and a whirlpool is formed in the receptacle. However, the whirlpool brings the rough and long fibers to the outer circle in contact with the inner wall by centrifugal force.

4. The present invention aims to provide a container of the blender that comprises a cup and a lining disposed inside the cup. The lining is formed as a shield inside the cup, and a number of teeth are projected from the inner wall of the lining for grinding the fibers of vegetable and fruit.

1. The present invention relates to cardiac assist systems, including cardiomyoplasty, for the treatment of patients needing augmented cardiac output. The invention provides a device and algorithm for a combined cardiomyostimulator and cardiac pacer-cardioverter-defibrillator.

2. Cardiac assist systems aid patients with chronically and unacceptably low cardiac output who cannot have their cardiac output raised to acceptable levels by traditional treatments. One particular type of cardiac assist system currently used is a cardiomyoplasty.

3. The cardiomyoplasty provides a muscle-powered cardiac assist system, where a surgically-modified muscle tissue, such as the latissimus dorsi, is wrapped around the heart. An implantable pulse generator is provided to stimulate the muscle tissue to contract in synchrony with the heart.

4. Patients with chronic cardiac output deficiencies face an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmic episodes, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. These arrhythmic episodes may be life-threatening and require treatment.

5. The present invention employs a sensor to monitor cardiac electrical activity and cardiac demand in a skeletal muscle-powered cardiac assist system. The system includes a pulse generator that delivers stimulation to a skeletal muscle grafted about a heart and senses depolarizations of the patient's heart.

6. The pulse generator measures the intervals separating successive depolarizations of the patient's heart and defines first and second interval ranges. The device determines the number of the measured intervals falling within the first and second interval ranges and inhibits the delivery of stimulation to a skeletal muscle grafted about a heart upon the sensing of a depolarization within the first or second interval range.

7. The present invention provides a cardiac assist system that permits the rapid detection of a cardiac arrhythmia and provides cardiac assistance during a cardiac arrhythmia. The system temporarily stops or inhibits skeletal muscle stimulation once the onset of an arrhythmia is sensed.

1. The present invention concerns a biological oil composition, formulations comprising the oil composition, and the use of the oil composition in dietary supplements, functional foods, and pharmaceutical products for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The oil composition is derived from a marine copepod, preferably a copepod of the genus Calanus, such as Calanus finmarchicus. The oil composition is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are believed to be particularly important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

2. The copepod oil composition of the present invention differs markedly from typical fish oil and krill oil in both gross chemical composition and fatty acid content. The oil composition comprises a high proportion of wax esters, which are esters with long chain alcohols. The wax esters constitute the major lipid component in the copepod oil of the present invention.

3. The copepod oil composition of the present invention has a unique fatty acid composition, with a very high stearidonic acid (SDA) content. The SDA content in the copepod oil is significantly higher than in other marine oils. The oil composition also contains a relatively high proportion of free fatty acids, low amounts of triglycerides, and high levels of astaxanthin and cholesterol.

4. The biological effects of the copepod oil of the present invention were recorded in mice deficient in apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The mice were fed a high fat and cholesterol diet, and the copepod oil was added to the diet at a concentration of 1%. The results showed that the copepod oil had a striking and statistically highly significant effect on reduction of plaque formation in the aortas of the mice.

1. The invention is a skin reflectance measuring apparatus that is specifically designed for measuring the reflectance of the skin. The apparatus is a continuation of a previous application and is intended to overcome the limitations of existing methods and devices for measuring skin reflectance. The invention finds applications in pathology, cosmetology, and other fields where skin reflectance is an important parameter. The apparatus is designed to provide accurate and reliable measurements of skin reflectance.

2. The apparatus comprises a probe, a measuring device, and a flexible connection in fiber optics that connects the probe to the measuring device. The probe is designed to be placed in contact with the skin and is equipped with an aperture that allows light to be emitted and reflected by the skin. The measuring device is connected to the probe via the flexible connection and is responsible for processing the reflected light signals. The measuring device is equipped with a micro-computer that controls the measurement process and processes the data.

3. The apparatus uses a relative measurement method that takes into account both specular and diffuse reflections. The specular reflection is measured by directing a light beam at the skin surface and measuring the reflected light intensity. The diffuse reflection is measured by directing a light beam at the skin surface at an angle and measuring the reflected light intensity. The relative measurement method provides a more accurate measurement of skin reflectance than the absolute measurement method.

4. The apparatus is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal positioning accuracy. The probe is small and lightweight, making it easy to handle and maneuver. The flexible connection in fiber optics allows for a high degree of flexibility and makes it easy to position the probe on the skin surface. The measuring device is equipped with a display screen that shows the measurement results in real-time.

5. The apparatus uses a logarithmic amplifier to process the reflected light signals. The logarithmic amplifier provides a higher dynamic range and makes it easier to measure the reflectance of the skin. The logarithmic amplifier also makes it easier to display the measurement results on the screen. The logarithmic amplifier is controlled by the micro-computer and is adjusted to provide the optimal measurement results.

6. The apparatus uses a synchronous detection method to measure the reflectance of the skin. The synchronous detection method involves measuring the reflected light intensity when the light source is turned on and off. The synchronous detection method provides a more accurate measurement of skin reflectance than the asynchronous detection method. The synchronous detection method is controlled by the micro-computer and is adjusted to provide the optimal measurement results.

1. The invention is a dental cleaning and massaging apparatus that provides a relatively simple and highly effective means for cleaning teeth and the gingival crevices and for massaging the gums. The apparatus comprises a mouthpiece having upper and lower channel members that fit over the upper and lower teeth, respectively, and fit snugly against the respective gums. The channel members are joined by a membrane structure and pneumatic means are provided to move the upper and lower channel members relative to the upper and lower gums, respectively, to thereby massage the gums. The apparatus also provides hydraulic means to clean the teeth and gingival crevices and to lubricate the gums during massaging.

2. The apparatus operates by providing air pulses to air-sacks located along a hose that extends between the upper and lower channel members. The air pulses are provided by an air pump in the control box, which alternately inflates and deflates the air-sacks. When the air-sacks are inflated, the upper and lower channel members ride up on the gums, and when they are deflated, they ride down. The elasticity of the membranes and air-sacks pulls the upper and lower channel members toward each other when the air-sacks are deflated.

3. The apparatus also provides a source of water and/or cleaning fluid through a hose that extends into the area formed by the membranes. The water and/or cleaning fluid flows through holes in the upper and lower channel members to clean and flush out the teeth and gums. The fluid serves as a lubricant during the massaging action and is preferably introduced into the mouthpiece as a gentle steady stream. The apparatus can be operated in three modes: with both air and water, with air only, or with water only, and can be controlled by a remote control device or the control box itself.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

1. The invention relates to methods and apparatus for providing ventilatory assistance matched to a subject's respiratory need, particularly for subjects who are either spontaneously or non-spontaneously breathing, or move between these breathing states. The invention is especially suitable for spontaneously breathing human subjects requiring long-term ventilatory assistance, particularly during sleep. The ventilatory assistance can be for subjects with severe lung disease, chest wall disease, neuromuscular disease, or diseases of respiratory control.

2. Most known ventilatory devices do not accurately match the amplitude and phase of mask pressure to the subject's spontaneous efforts, leading to discomfort or panic. Larger amounts of asynchrony also reduce the efficiency of the device. During sleep, there are changes in the neural control of breathing as well as the mechanics of the subject's airways, respiratory muscles, and chest wall, leading to a need for substantially increased ventilatory support.

3. The invention aims to simultaneously achieve three goals: while the subject is awake and making substantial ventilatory efforts, the delivered assistance should be closely matched in phase with the patient's efforts; the machine should automatically adjust the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum ventilation, without relying on the integrity of the subject's chemoreflexes; and it should continue to work correctly in the presence of large leaks.

4. The invention discloses a method for calculating the instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle as a continuous variable, including determining the phase based on airflow conditions such as small and increasing airflow, large and steady airflow, small and decreasing airflow, and zero and steady airflow. The method also includes selecting at least two identifiable features of a prototype flow-vs-time waveform and assigning weights to each feature.

5. The invention further discloses a method for providing ventilatory assistance in a spontaneously breathing subject, comprising the steps of ascribing a desired waveform template function, calculating the instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle, selecting a desired pressure modulation amplitude, calculating a desired instantaneous delivery pressure, and setting delivered pressure to subject to the desired delivery pressure.

6. The invention also discloses a method for calculating the instantaneous inspired volume of a subject, operable substantially without run-away under conditions of suddenly changing leak, including determining respiratory airflow approximately corrected for leak, calculating an index J varying from 0 to 1, identifying the start of inspiration, and calculating the instantaneous inspired volume as the integral of the corrected respiratory airflow multiplied by the fuzzy negation of the index J with respect to time.

1. The invention is related to surgical instruments, specifically an electro-surgical dissection and cauterization instrument for use in laparoscopic/endoscopic procedures. The instrument is designed to provide a clear view of the operation site and prevent unintentional cauterization of healthy tissue. The instrument includes a rigid insulating sleeve and a conductive rod that extends from the plug end to the distal end. The distal end includes a rigid arm that extends from the sleeve and includes portions laterally offset from the longitudinal axis of the sleeve.

2. The electro-surgical instrument is used to separate and remove diseased tissue from healthy tissue, and it is also used as a probe to move tissue about during exploratory surgery. The instrument includes a working tip electrode that is formed at the free end of the arm and is used to make direct contact with the patient at the internal operation site. The working tip electrode comes in many different shapes depending on the needs of the surgeon in a particular surgical application. The instrument is designed to provide maximum visualization of the surgical work site by the surgeon.

3. The instrument includes a thin jacket of insulating material that is disposed upon the arm from the point where it extends from the sleeve right up to, but not including, the working tip electrode. This prevents unintentional cauterization of healthy tissue surrounding the surgical work site. The instrument is designed to be used in laparoscopic procedures, where the surgeon views the internal operation site with a laparoscope. The instrument is also useful in open surgeries that do not include the use of an endoscope.

4. The instrument has three different embodiments, each with a different configuration of the arm and working tip electrode. In the first embodiment, the arm extends from the sleeve and includes portions laterally offset from the linear axis of the sleeve. In the second embodiment, the arm includes a third bend in an upwardly direction and extends linearly therefrom for a fourth length. In the third embodiment, the arm is entirely linear and extends from the sleeve along an axis that makes an acute angle with the linear axis of the sleeve.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. The present invention relates to a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus that allows exposures with the subject in at least two predetermined exposure positions, with at least one exposure taking place using predetermined adjustment parameters. The apparatus has a magnet with at least one patient receptacle and at least one support plate, as well as a predetermined number of transmit and/or receive coils.

2. In known magnetic resonance imaging apparatuses, for different exposure positions the associated exposure parameters must be modified at least partially, which requires a readjustment of the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus. This readjustment can take 10 to 90 seconds per exposure position.

3. The inventive solution aims to provide magnetic resonance imaging apparatus of the type described above that provides high-contrast exposures in a short time, even given an examination of larger body segments. This is achieved by determining the required adjustment parameters in a preceding adjustment process.

4. The required adjustment parameters are inventively determined in a preceding adjustment process, and the exposures are executed in a subsequent exposure process. The adjustment parameters are stored at least until the conclusion of the examination.

5. The inventive magnetic resonance imaging apparatus has a support plate that is arranged in longitudinally placeable fashion inside an examination volume of a magnet. The longitudinal displaceability of the support plate allows larger body sections of a patient to be examined.

6. The nuclear spin resonance apparatus has a predetermined number of transmit coils and a predetermined number of receive coils. The transmit coils can be connected to a generator by means of a transmit coil changeover switch.

7. The receive coils can be connected to a receiver by means of a receive coil changeover switch. The configurations of the transmit coils and the receive coils are supplied to an adjustment unit as inputs.

1. The present invention relates to fasteners for albums such as photographic albums and scrapbooks where it is required to add or replace album pages. The fasteners are designed to provide a releasable connection between the strap and each of the strap anchors to enable insertion and removal of pages at the front and back of the album.

2. The fasteners comprise a pair of strap anchors, one adapted to be attached to the front cover and the other to the back cover, a strap that passes through aligned apertures in the covers and album pages, and means for providing a releasable connection between the strap and each of the strap anchors.

3. Each strap anchor is in the form of a channel in which the strap is a snap lock to be releasably locked therein against displacement. The strap is snap-locked into the channel by snapping engagement beneath locking lips at an open side of the channel facing the base of the channel.

4. The strap anchors are moulded in a suitable plastics material and can be attached to the front and back covers of the album by adhesive such as an adhesive tape. The material of the strap is such that although it has sufficient flexibility to enable its projecting end to be bent into the channel and to be deflected past the lips, it also has sufficient rigidity to enable it to be easily inserted through the aligned holes in the covers and album pages therebetween.

5. The insertion of the straps through the sheets when adding or replacing sheets is significantly easier than insertion of the two-part fastening screws conventionally used. The straps also provide significantly greater versatility in increasing the size of the album as the only controlling factor of the thickness of the album is the length of the strap.

6. The fasteners can be produced inexpensively so that their overall cost can be maintained at a level comparable with that of the conventional fastening screws. This is quite important because albums of this type are cost-sensitive and need to be available at a price equivalent to that of albums with conventional screw-type fasteners.

7. In a modified embodiment of the invention, the co-operating ribs on the strap and on the base of the channel are of saw-tooth profile with the upright face of the profile orientated to prevent the strap from being pulled through the channel under the applied loading in the engaged condition of the strap.

The sulky is designed to be lightweight, easy-running, and strongly built to endure the specific strain during exercise and competitions.

2. Conventional sulkies have been manufactured as welded steel constructions, but attempts to build sulkies of aluminum have failed due to poor strength qualities and difficulties in welding light metals. The design of the conventional sulky is unsuitable for light metals as it requires welding.

3. The object of the present invention is to provide a new sulky construction that can be manufactured of light metal and other lightweight and yet durable materials. The sulky is designed to be assembled easily by a user himself from substantially flat elements requiring only a small space during storage and transportation.

4. The sulky has a stable construction as the shafts as well as the crossbar transfer substantially all the load to the wheel planes only. The sulky is designed to be assembled by the user himself by means of ordinary hand tools, and all the connections become secure without any play.

5. The sulky has a weight reduction of approximately 40% for the complete sulky, which has a total weight of approximately 18 kg in a ready-to-use state. The sulky is designed to be colored by applying color tapes in all recesses of the profiles, leading to an inexpensive and individual color display system.

6. The sulky is designed to be packed into a flat box for storing and transportation to distributors, and the user can buy the sulky as a construction kit and mount the parts himself in a quarter of an hour. The sulky has user qualities equal to those of traditional sulkies but with a lower total weight.

1. The present invention relates to rotating water feeds and a ventilation system therefor, particularly useful in connection with water-cooled generators with coaxial feed and discharge ducts. The invention aims to eliminate air enclosed in the cooling system to avoid undesired local overheating. This overheating can lead to the formation of steam bubbles that may clog the flow paths involved.

2. Prior to initiating operation of a rotating water feed, special attention must be paid to the elimination of air to avoid overheating. Air bubbles accumulating in the circuit or entering through manipulation of the apparatus by operating personnel will usually accumulate at the point of lowest pressure, which is usually at the axis of rotation. This can partially block the cross section of the flow paths involved.

3. In the case of a rotating machine, the point of lowest pressure is usually at the axis of rotation, and any air or gas bubbles will usually accumulate at this point. Despite the fact that these air bubbles will partially block the cross section of the flow paths involved, practically no attention is paid to them. This can reduce the efficiency of the cooling system.

4. In prior art techniques, a long, thin pipe extending in the axis of rotation is arranged in a stationary water feed pipe to remove air bubbles. However, this solution has been found to require considerable engineering effort due to the fact that these feeds must involve a great length in most cases. This can be impractical and inefficient.

5. The present invention aims to provide an arrangement that avoids the disadvantages of prior art techniques and permits automatic removal or reduction of air or gas bubbles accumulating in rotating pipes. The invention also aims to formulate a structural arrangement that is as simple in design as possible. This will enable efficient and effective ventilation of the cooling system.

6. The invention provides at least one bypass having at least one inlet and at least one outlet arranged between the feed duct and the discharge duct of the apparatus. The bypass has at least one inlet which opens into the space around the axis of rotation of the apparatus. This arrangement enables the rapid and complete removal of bubbles.

7. The advantages of the invention arise particularly because of the fact that by virtue of the aforementioned arrangement, all bubbles will be rapidly and completely removed by utilizing the pressure gradient between the inflow and outflow for automatic operation of the device. The invention also provides a ventilation system that is relatively simple in its design and construction. This will enable efficient and effective ventilation of the cooling system.

1. The invention relates to a steering column for a motor vehicle, which comprises a jacket unit supporting a steering shaft rotatably about its longitudinal axis and a retaining part, which the jacket unit is secured non-displaceably up to a limit value of a force acting onto the jacket unit parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft in the direction toward the front of the motor vehicle. If the limit value is exceeded, the jacket unit is displaceable parallel to the longitudinal axis in the direction toward the motor vehicle front. The jacket unit is connected with the retaining part, for one, across an energy absorption connection, which comprises at least one bending wire or strip that, upon a displacement of the jacket unit with respect to the retaining part parallel to the longitudinal direction toward the motor vehicle front, is deformed, and is connected, for another, across a break-away connection which, up to the limit value of the force, is closed and blocks a displacement of the jacket unit with respect to the retaining part and which is released if the limit value of the force is exceeded. The invention further relates to a method for the production of such a steering column.

2. Steering columns for motor vehicles are most often implemented such that they are adjustable so that the position of the steering wheel can be adapted to the seating position of the driver. Such adjustable steering columns are known in various embodiment forms. Apart from adjustable steering columns which are only adjustable in the length or height or inclination direction, steering columns are also known which are adjustable in the length as well as also the height or inclination direction. As a safety measure in the event of a vehicle crash, it is known and conventional to realize in steering columns for motor vehicles the steering shaft together with a jacket unit, rotatably supporting the steering shaft, in a section adjoining the steering wheel-side end such that it is displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the steering column (=parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft) with the absorption of energy.

3. A conventional implementation form provides for this purpose that a bracket unit, with respect to which in the opened state of the clamping mechanism the jacket unit is displaceable for setting the position of the steering column, is so connected with a mounting part attached on the vehicle chassis that the jacket unit with the absorption of energy is dislocatable with respect to the mounting part.

1. The invention is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 005,813 filed Jan. 21, 1987, and it relates to a disposable depressed center grinding wheel having an integral mounting hub. The mounting hub is permanently affixed to the grinding wheel without the use of adhesives. This allows for quick attachment and release to an appropriate portable power tool. The invention aims to provide a secure and efficient way to attach and detach the grinding wheel from the power tool.

2. The use of rotatably driven finishing articles is widespread, but one of the problems encountered is the provision of effective means for preventing undesired or accidental disassociation of the article from the shaft. This problem is particularly acute when the connection between the article and its driving shaft or spindle is intentionally detachable. To address this issue, various devices have been developed, including portable powered grinders with detachable grinding wheels. However, these devices often require the use of tools to remove the grinding wheel from the drive shaft.

3. In the prior art, devices have been developed to provide a disposable finishing article assembly with a permanent affixed mounting hub. However, these devices have certain inherent disadvantages, such as the use of adhesives, keying of parts, and the utilization of die-cast mounting hubs. These disadvantages add labor and cost to the manufacturing process and can result in a bulky and heavy product. Furthermore, the die-cast mounting hubs do not provide additional clamping force during rotation.

1. The invention is based on a generic hydraulic unit for a vehicle brake system, which is designed to be immersion-proof. The hydraulic unit has at least one pump with a piston, and the piston is indirectly drivable by an electric motor via an eccentric that is rotatable inside an eccentric chamber. The eccentric chamber is connected to a conduit that extends downward and opens to the atmosphere through a housing block. A check valve is built into the conduit to prevent pressure fluid from entering the eccentric chamber.

2. In a hydraulic unit known from International Patent Disclosure WO 96/13416, the electric motor is located above an eccentric chamber, and a conduit leads downward from the eccentric chamber to a central venting point. The central venting point has an element that is permeable to air but not to water from the environment, to equalize the pressure of the eccentric chamber. The unit also has a reservoir for temporarily receiving pressure fluid, which comprises a cylindrical hollow chamber closed off from the ambient atmosphere. The reservoir has a piston that divides the hollow chamber into a variable storage chamber and a spring chamber.

3. The invention aims to prevent pressure fluid from entering the eccentric chamber and impairing the operability of the electric motor. The pressure fluid is delivered to the at least one spring chamber, far from electrical components, and collected in that chamber. This allows the use of permeable elements at a central venting point or a check valve to be dispensed with. The invention yields cost savings and a hermetic seal of the unit from the environment.

4. The housing block together with the at least one pump can be immersed and submerged in salty water without the risk of damage. The provisions of the invention allow for advantageous refinements of and improvements to the hydraulic unit. The characteristics of the invention offer the advantage that because of dual utilization of conduit portions, the housing block can be produced economically. The housing block can be produced with fewer conduits and with easier cleaning.

5. The invention allows the use of a housing block known from EP 0 699 571 A1 for a hydraulic unit of a vehicle brake system without changing its size or its basic internal design. The only provision necessary is the disposition of the characteristics set forth in the invention. The engineer can decide how much pressure fluid entrained by the at least one piston of the at least one pump should be stored. The size of the container can be adjusted depending on the intended use of the hydraulic unit.

1. The invention relates to a grounding product for railroad car center plate assembly bowl liners of the all polymeric type. The product provides effective grounding without the use of conductive plates, clips, or shunts attached to the liner. The liner material used herein has similar mechanical properties to the liner as disclosed in Chierici and Murphy U.S. Pat. No. 4,075,951, but has improved electrical properties. The disclosures in Wulff U.S. Pat. No. 4,241,667 and Chierici and Murphy U.S. Pat. No. 4,075,951, are incorporated by reference.

2. Prior art rail car truck bowl liners come in several categories, including early liners made of hard metal alloys, recent liners composed of an ultra high molecular weight polymer, and hybridized composite liners that utilize metal reinforcement in a polymer matrix. These liners have various drawbacks, such as the need for lubrication or the addition of separate grounding apparatus. The present invention aims to provide a liner that eliminates these drawbacks. The liner is composed of a base ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) material with a conductive material additive.

3. The liner is designed to meet the static dissipation standards of the American Association of Railroads, which requires that railroad car center plate assemblies be arranged so that the body bolster center plate will be sufficiently grounded to the truck bolster bowl. The liner exceeds the NFPA standards by an order of magnitude, providing a high degree of electrical conductivity. The liner is also self-lubricating, eliminating the need for separate lubricating materials. This reduces wear and damage to the center plate assembly area of the car.

4. The liner is composed of a high density polymer of dry self-lubricating characteristics that is pliable but non-stretchable. The liner is free from distending or stretching characteristics and is sufficiently compaction resistant to resist any substantial compaction under compressive forces up to its elastic limit.

1. The invention deals with a valve used for controlling bulk dispensing of viscous substances such as sauces, salad dressings, and catsup. This valve is designed to be operated with one hand while the other hand holds the receiving vessel, making it suitable for use in fast-food restaurants and other similar settings.

2. The prior art provides two main types of valves for this purpose, but they have limitations such as being unable to be disassembled for cleaning and allowing for residue accumulation. These limitations are addressed by the present invention, which provides a gate valve that can be easily disassembled and cleaned.

3. The gate valve assembly of this invention includes a spout insert mounting sleeve that is slightly tapered to fit into the spout of a bag or pouch. The sleeve has a passage extending axially through it with a discharge outlet and a guide extending at a right angle to the axis of the passage.

4. The guide carries a reciprocable gate that can be moved between open and closed positions by engaging the fingers of one hand with cooperating lugs on the gate and guide. The gate and guide are curved complementally transversely so that the gate is drawn into sealing engagement with the outlet as it moves over it.

5. The gate valve member is reciprocated on the guide member by means of an integral upward guide and operating channel-like extension that has a flat-finger lug at its upper end and a similar but split lug at its inner end. The extension has opposed side guide flanges that slideably fit in an undercut guide slot in the wall of the guide member.

6. The valve assembly can be mounted on the spout of a bag by guiding the tapered sleeve into the spout until the outer edge of the spout is engaged by the guide plate. The interior surfaces of the spout will frictionally seal with the adjacent exterior surface of the sleeve, and at least one of the sealing ribs will be engaged.

1. The invention relates to a novel sanitizable rotary valve for use in liquid chromatographic columns and sanitary liquid handling systems to separate and purify biological macromolecules. The valve is designed to allow sanitizing fluid to be flushed across the process fluid-contacting surfaces without disassembling the valve. This is achieved through a unique diaphragm-like elastomeric seal that functions to both seal the two faces together in normal use and retain the sanitizing process fluids when the faces are partially separated for cleaning.

2. The valve consists of a rotor and a stator, with the rotor having a body and a diaphragm attached to its base. The diaphragm is made of a thermoplastic elastomer and has a first surface in contact with the rotor body and a second surface in direct contact with the fluids passing through the valve. The diaphragm also includes dynamic wipe sealing lips that form the physical delimitation between the first and second surfaces.

3. The rotor has a center with means to connect to an actuator shaft, and an elongated rotor drive slot extends through the center of the rotor and loosely engages matching actuator rotating flats. When the actuator shaft is rotated, the first and second rotor sealing ports are caused to move while remaining in sliding sealing engagement with the respective stator first port sealing ledge and second port sealing ledge. This actuation sequence is shown from an initial indexed position to a bridging make-before-break position and finally to a final indexed position.

4. The stator has connecting ports and ducts for all fluids entering and leaving the valve, and a plurality of paired first connection ports and second connection ports may be used to program the sequence of flow through the plurality of rotor carousel beds. In the embodiment shown, the stator connection ports are each fluidly connected to one end of a plurality of make-before-break grooves spaced equally about the top surface of the first and second sealing port ledges. This insures that in normal operation there is no unswept stagnant fluid volume in the process flowpath.

The present invention concerns streptavidin muteins, a process for the production of such proteins by means of recombinant DNA technology, and the use of these streptavidin muteins for the isolation, purification, and determination of biological substances. The biotin/streptavidin system is a widely used binding system in molecular biology, characterized by a specific affinity between biotin and streptavidin with an affinity constant of 10^13. This system is used in various fields of application, including separation and detection methods.

2. The conventional streptavidin/biotin system has some limitations, such as the requirement for biotinylated reagents or enzymes, which can be difficult to obtain in a pure form. Additionally, certain applications may not be possible or may be less easy to perform using the conventional system. To overcome these limitations, peptide ligands that bind specifically to streptavidin have been developed.

3. The peptide ligands are suitable for use in affinity chromatography and can be attached to the N- or C-terminus of a desired protein, allowing for the formation of a recombinant protein labeled with the peptide ligand. This approach has several advantages, including the ability to coexpress the peptide ligand and the desired protein, and the possibility of using mild elution conditions to release the bound protein.

4. However, the conventional peptide ligand system has a relatively low affinity, with an affinity constant of 2.7×10^4 M^-1. To improve the affinity of the system, the present invention concerns streptavidin muteins that have a higher binding affinity than wild-type streptavidin for peptide ligands.

The invention further relates to transgenic plants and to libraries of plants or plant seeds obtained or obtainable according to the processes of the invention. The invention also relates to vectors for these processes and to plants or plant cells transformed therewith.

However, these methods are time-consuming, inflexible, and restricted to simple excision of desired DNA fragments. The methods are also limited in combinatorial diversity, as they are restricted to simple manipulations with a limited number of known genes and regulatory elements.

The present invention relates to an improved method for producing 1,1,1-trifluoroethane (143a) by continuous gas phase hydrofluorination of 1,1-difluoro-1-chloroethane (142b) using heterogeneous catalysis. The process involves passing 142b and hydrogen fluoride (HF) through a catalyst bed in a reactor at specified conditions for reacting. The 143a product is then purified, and byproduct HCl and unreacted HF are removed by various methods. The process can be carried out using 142b as a feed and 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (141b), 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane (365) or HCl as a co-feed.

2. The catalyst used in the process is a chromium salt, supported or unsupported, and can be any chromium salt, supported or unsupported. The catalyst can also be a supported or unsupported co-catalyst, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese, and zinc. The preferred supports are Al2O3 and fluorided Al2O3. The process can be carried out at a temperature between 30° C. and 400° C., preferably between 30° and 280° C.

3. The molar ratio of HF to 142b is a critical factor in the process, and ideally, this ratio should be very close to 1 to minimize the need for downstream separation. However, at low HF ratios, non-selectives (unwanted by-products) are formed, including vinylidene fluoride (1132a), vinylidene chlorofluoride (1131a), and vinylidene chloride (1130a). These olefins are undesirable in the final product and must be either destroyed or removed from the reaction product. The HF/142b ratio should be greater than 1:1 to avoid olefin formation.

If distillation is used, a pressure distillation is needed to recover HCl with conventional refrigeration. The boiling point of HCl at 130 psig is -26° F.

1. The invention relates to an improved process for the deacylation and desulfurization of a compound having the formula: ##STR3##. This process employs hypophosphorous acid to improve product yield and reduce the yield of unwanted impurities. The use of hypophosphorous acid results in the formation of H2S by-product rather than sulfur. This makes it easier to remove the by-product from the reaction zone.

2. The compound in question is a pyrazolotriazole, which is useful as a magenta coupler for photographic products. However, it is difficult to synthesize and only a few synthetic routes are known. One of the preferred synthetic routes involves the preparation of triazolothiadiazines and their subsequent desulfurization. This process is not straightforward and generates unwanted impurities.

3. The triazolothiadiazines can be prepared in two ways: by reaction of 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-substituted(R)-1,2,4-triazoles with alpha-haloketones, or by reaction of 2-hydrazino-5-substituted-(R&#39;)-1,3,4-thiadiazines with acyl halides and subsequent dehydrative ring closure. Both the triazoles and the thiadiazines are readily available from thiocarbohydrazide. The desulfurization of the triazolothiadiazines to pyrazolotriazoles is a two-step process. The first step involves a ring contraction reaction, and the second step involves hydrolysis and desulfurization.

4. The ring contraction reaction is usually clean and does not render any problems except for long reaction times. However, the subsequent reactions are not straightforward and generate unwanted impurities, including elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities. These impurities can interfere with subsequent reaction steps and are detrimental to the product. The use of hypophosphorous acid in the process of this invention reduces the amount of these impurities.

5. The use of hypophosphorous acid in the process of this invention has several advantages, including the reduction of unwanted impurities and the increase of product yield. The process is also straight-forward and economical to carry out. The use of hypophosphorous acid results in the formation of H2S by-product, which is readily removable from the reaction zone. This makes the process more efficient and easier to control.

1. The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for forming bias laid, non-woven fabrics, where the yarns in at least two of the layers of fabric are laid at an angle of from 30° to 150° to the long axis of the fabric. The yarns in the various layers are neither knitted, nor woven, but are held together by stitching through the layers, or by other external means, such as adhesive bonding. The invention provides for the formation of bias laid fabrics where all of the yarns in a given layer are parallel to each other. The parallelism in a given layer is achieved without complex machinery.

2. The apparatus for forming the bias laid, non-woven fabric includes a pair of parallel conveyors, each carrying a series of equidistantly spaced needles, and yarn carriers that move back and forth between the conveyors. The yarn carriers carry a plurality of individual, equally spaced yarns, and the number of yarns in a given linear dimension need not equal the number of needles in the same linear dimension. The rake systems, which are synchronized with the conveyors, yarn carrying means, and bonding mechanism, are associated with the needles formed on the conveyors to achieve greater assurance of parallelism of the yarns. The fabric formed in accordance with the present process is generally used in the formation of structural parts, such as airplanes, and is wrapped around a mold or laid into a particular position before being impregnated with a resin.

1. The present invention relates to weft insertion in a multiple-color air jet loom, and more particularly to a method of and an apparatus for inserting a selected weft thread with a weft carrying force appropriate for the selected weft thread. The invention aims to provide a method and an apparatus for inserting different weft threads in and through warp sheds in a multiple-color air jet loom. The apparatus includes a source of air under pressure, a regulator, and a subtank. The subtank is connected to dedicated subnozzles and common subnozzles.

2. The subnozzles are divided into groups along the warp shed and spaced at different intervals for the groups to produce combined air streams of varying pressures. The air pressure is controlled by a regulator and a subtank, which supplies air under different pressures to the subnozzles. The subnozzles are selectively operated dependent on the weft thread to be inserted for carrying the selected weft thread with a weft carrying force suitable for that weft thread. The different weft carrying forces may be produced by varying the interval of time in which air is ejected or by varying air ejecting forces.

3. The air ejecting forces are produced by a selective combination of different pitches of subnozzles, different effective cross-sectional areas of nozzle orifices of the subnozzles, different distances of the nozzles from the warp shed, different angles at which the subnozzles are directed to the warp shed, and different pressure under which air is supplied to the subnozzles. The on-off valves may be selectively actuated by a mechanical cam device operable in synchronism with the rotation of a main shaft of the loom. The mechanical cam device may comprise a control cam mounted on a valve control shaft. The control cam makes one third of a full rotation when the main shaft of the loom makes one complete revolution.

4. The weft insertion apparatus shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 has a source of pressurized air, a pair of regulators, and accumulator tanks. The regulators reduce the air pressure to a suitable degree, and the reduced air pressure is stored in the accumulator tanks. The pressure in the accumulator tank is selected to be low for the insertion of the thinner weft thread. The pressure in the accumulator tank is selected to be higher than that in the accumulator tank for the insertion of the thicker weft thread.

The rotary hook arrangement includes first and second cams arranged on respective sides of a projection of the bobbin housing of a rotatable hook for controlling the rotation of the bobbin housing.

2. The known rotary hooks have limitations, such as impediment of the thread movement during the guiding of the needle thread loop around the bobbin housing, which results in increased needle thread tension. The impediment occurs due to the holding means which prevent co-rotation and reverse rotation of the bobbin housing being arranged in the vicinity of the stitch hole.

3. The invention provides a rotary hook arrangement where the holding means are arranged so that they hinder the guiding of the needle thread loop and the pull-back occurring after its maximum expansion as little as possible. This is achieved by locating the holding means on the loop cast-off side of the bobbin housing.

4. The needle thread loop can be expanded totally unhindered until its maximum expansion is reached, and then it is pulled back by the thread take-up lever without touching the front cam. The slight impediment of the thread movement caused by the bending of the spring rod can be eliminated completely.

5. The capsule release device gives the bobbin housing a rotational impulse counter to the direction of hook rotation, creating a narrow gap between the rear side face of the shoulder and the spring rod. This allows the needle thread loop to slip through the thread passage gap entirely unhindered.

6. The rotary hook arrangement is simple in design, rugged in construction, and economical to manufacture, making it an improvement over conventional rotary hooks. The invention provides a lockstitch sewing machine with a rotary hook that has especially jerk-free and low friction motion of the needle thread loop.

1. The present invention relates to a sewing machine detector for detecting the position of a sewing needle and the speed of the sewing machine. The detector is integral with the drive and control elements of the sewing machine. The conventional sewing machine drive system includes a sewing machine, motor, belt, needle section, control circuit section, detector, and power indicating light. The detector is used to control the sewing machine.

2. The conventional detector includes a detecting section, an optical fiber cable, a photoelectric translation processing module section, and electrical connectors. The detecting section includes a sewing machine shaft, a shaft of the detecting section rotated in engagement with the sewing machine shaft, and needle UP and DOWN position detecting reflective discs. The optical fiber cable includes a detecting section, an optical fiber cable, a photoelectric translation processing module section, and electrical connectors. The photoelectric translation processing module section includes electronic parts such as light emitting and receiving devices and a signal processing circuit.

3. The conventional detector has several disadvantages, including the influence of static noise due to the friction of a fabric to be sewn, malfunction, and unstable sewing machine operations. The reflective discs must withstand constant vibration during the operation of the sewing machine. The bearings supporting the shaft of the detecting section may be worn, causing the shaft to vibrate and the optical axes to change. This results in an inability to receive predetermined signals.

4. The conventional detector also has the disadvantage of expensive optical fibers being necessary to prevent the above-described problems. The curvature radius of the optical fibers is large, resulting in a decrease in the light transmitting percentage and a deterioration in efficiency. The optical fibers are flexed, imposing significant stress on the fibers. This stress may cause the optical fiber supporter to fracture.

5. The conventional apparatus also includes a power indicating light having a light emitting diode and lead wires run through a cable. The power indicating light is supplied by the control circuit section through regular lead wires run through the cable. However, high frequency welders generate high frequency electromagnetic waves that can act as antennas and receive the electromagnetic waves, generating an electromotive force.

6. The present invention aims to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional apparatus by providing a low-price detector for a sewing machine that is durable despite the detrimental effects of vibration. The detector includes a thinner and more compact detecting section. The detector minimizes stress imposed on the optical fibers by minimizing the curvature of the optical fibers. The power indicating light does not electrically interfere with the operation of the detector and controller.

4. The water used for washing should have a pH between 4.0 and 5.5 and be free from cations in amounts higher than certain specified levels.
5. The process can be carried out with spinning speeds not lower than 90 m/min, and the washing and coagulation completion stages can be done within specific time frames.
6. The invention achieves a high degree of whiteness in the finished yarn, which is higher than that commonly accepted, through a simplified and economical process.

1. The invention is a continuation-in-part of a patent application Ser. No. 594,455 filed Mar. 29, 1984, now abandoned. The problem encountered when bleaching pulp with oxygen is attempting to wash the pulp after the oxygen stage. The oxygen entrained in the pulp mat reduces the vacuum on the vacuum washer and mixes with the wash water to form foam. This reduces the vacuum in the washer and prevents the chemicals and water from passing through the mat.

2. There have been a number of proposals for deaerating the pulp before the washer. One proposal is to use a 'Deculator' process which is described by Mac Gregor. The Deculator process involves the rapid acceleration and spraying of stock into a long 6-foot diameter stainless steel receiver. This system involves expensive equipment, including vacuum systems and vacuum vessels.

3. Another system is described in Sethy, U.S. Pat. No. 4,209,359 issued Jun. 24, 1980. In this system, the slurry is agitated by a radial flow impeller which imparts a substantially radial flow to the slurry. Several types of impeller are shown. This system is also large and expensive.

4. Other large degassing chambers are shown in Roymoulik, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,832,276 granted Aug. 27, 1974, and in Richter, U.S. Pat. No. 3,963,561 granted Jun. 15, 1976. These are large expensive systems utilizing large tanks which must be built to withstand pressure. The Richter patent describes a large pressure vessel. These systems are not suitable for small-scale deaeration.

5. The inventors decided that there was a need for a small deaeration tank which may be at either atmospheric pressure or under low pressure or vacuum. The tank should be the same diameter as an oxygen reactor so that it could be placed on top of the reactor and be supported by the reactor. It would have no moving parts, so there would be no need for motors to be mounted on or near the tank. A closed tank would allow steam or oxygen to be recovered.

6. The deaerator is a small tank having an inlet pipe, an outlet, and a tangential swirl inducing inlet pipe. The locations and sizes of these elements provide optimum deaeration. The swirl inducing fluid is the filtrate from the washer after the oxygen bleach",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 36}"

1. The invention relates to a load-limiting device for dissipating energy during a dynamic event, such as an earthquake. The device is designed to be placed in a braced frame structure and can undergo plastic deformation to limit the loads levied on the structure. The load-limiting device can be easily removed and replaced after plastic deformation with a new non-plastically deformed device. This allows for the structure to be preserved from extensive damage after a dynamic event.

2. The load-limiting device is designed to provide biaxial support for the braced frame structure and can dissipate energy in the structure. The device can be constructed of a plastic material or a metal-based elasto-plastic material. It can be attached to a connection means that couples the device to the brace in the braced frame structure. The device can have an opening for attachment of the connection means to the brace.

3. The load-limiting device can be used in various structural applications, including buildings, vehicles, aircraft, furniture, and roller-coasters. It can be used to dissipate energy during a dynamic event by further yielding of the material in the plastic hinges of the device. The device can be designed to have elasto-plastic stress-strain properties similar to low-carbon steels. It can be manufactured with a plurality of load capacities depending on the strength requirements of the device.

4. The load-limiting device can be checked after a dynamic event of moderate to severe intensity to determine if it has undergone plastic deformation. An indicator means can be used to indicate whether plastic deformation has begun on the device. The indicator means can be a brittle coat of material, a mechanical device, or an electronic sensor. The device can be removed from the structure if plastic deformation is detected and replaced with a new device to preserve the structure from further damage.

1. The present invention pertains to the stimulation of crude oil reservoirs to enhance production using a combination of pulsed power electrohydraulic and electromagnetic methods. The invention provides a method and apparatus for recovery of crude oil from oil-bearing soils and rock formations. The method involves using pulsed power to generate acoustic and coupled electromagnetic-acoustic vibrations that can cause oil flow to be enhanced and increase the estimated ultimate recovery from reservoirs.

2. The stimulation of crude oil reservoirs to enhance oil production from known fields is a major area of interest for the petroleum industry. One of the single most important research goals in fossil fuels is to recover more of the hydrocarbons already found. At present, approximately 66% of discovered oil is left in the ground due to the lack of effective extraction technology for secondary and tertiary Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).

3. Methods that are widely used for the purpose rely on the injection of fluid at one well, called the injection well, and use of the injected fluid to flush the in situ hydrocarbons out of the formation to a producing well. In one mode of secondary recovery, a gas such as CO2 that may be readily available and inexpensive, is used. In other modes, water or, in the case of heavy oil, steam may be used to increase the recovery of hydrocarbons.

4. The present invention differs from all of the prior art in several ways. It uses a coupled process of direct EH acoustic vibrations that propagate outward into the formation from one or more wells, and electromagnetically-induced high-frequency acoustic vibrations. This is significantly different from the prior art which relies on acoustic vibrations only, or a combination of acoustic vibrations and low-frequency AC or DC electrical stimulation.

5. The invention includes the use of EM pulse sources that do not generate a direct acoustic shock pulse like the plasma shock effect caused by the spark gap in the electrohydraulic device defined by Wesley. These pulse sources replace the conventional spark gap discharge device defined by Wesley with a single-turn magnetic coil that produces a magnetic pulse with no acoustic pulse effect.

6. The invention also includes the use of directional focusing and shaping devices that will cause the acoustic pulse to travel only in specific directions. This reflector cone allows the operator to aim the pulses from one or multiple wells so that they can effect the specific portion of the formation where stimulation is desired.

7. The invention includes the use of a multi-level discharge device that allows sequential firing of several sources in one well in a time sequence that is optimized to allow continuous",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27}"

1. The present application is a continuation-in-part of a co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/684,479, which was filed on Jan. 8, 2010. The contents of the co-pending application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The application relates to a wave anchor soil reinforcing connector and method. The connector is used to reinforce an earth mass in combination with a facing element.

2. Retaining wall structures that use horizontally positioned soil inclusions to reinforce an earth mass in combination with a facing element are referred to as Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) structures. MSE structures can be used for various applications including retaining walls, bridge abutments, dams, seawalls, and dikes. Basic MSE technology involves a repetitive process by which layers of backfill and several horizontally placed soil reinforcing elements are sequentially positioned one atop the other until a desired height of the earthen structure is achieved. The soil reinforcing elements are typically made of a welded wire grid.

3. The soil reinforcing element generally includes a welded wire grid having a pair of longitudinal wires that are disposed substantially parallel to each other. The longitudinal wires are joined to a plurality of transverse wires in a generally perpendicular fashion by welds or other attachment means at their intersections, thus forming the welded wire grid. In some applications, there may be more than two longitudinal wires. The longitudinal wires may have lead ends that generally converge toward one another and terminate at a wall end.

4. The wall end of each soil reinforcing element may include several different connective means adapted to connect the soil reinforcing element to a substantially vertical facing, such as a wire facing, or concrete or steel facings constructed a short distance from the standing earthen wall. Once appropriately secured to the vertical facing and compacted within the backfill, the soil reinforcing element provides tensile strength to the vertical facing that significantly reduces any outward movement and shifting thereof. The longitudinal wires of the soil reinforcing element may extend several feet into the backfill before terminating at corresponding reinforcing ends. Where added amounts of tensile resistance are required, longer soil reinforcing elements are required, thereby disposing the reinforcing ends even deeper into the backfill.

5. The splice for a soil reinforcing element may include a first wave plate defining one or more first transverse protrusions configured to receive and seat a corresponding number of transverse wires of the soil reinforcing element, and a second wave plate defining one or more second transverse protrusions configured to receive and seat a corresponding number",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The present invention relates to a novel design for a plow blade that provides a fluid passage and points of fluid ejection, which is produced with basic manufacturing processes allowing efficient production. This design includes a multiple component assembly that allows for rebuilding a blade by replacing a portion of the blade that may be worn. The fluid passage is defined by providing a small gap between the front surface of the blade and the rear surface of the leading edge section.

2. The fluid pressure at a certain point along the blade's length can be varied by extending the fluid tube to terminate at a position towards the bottom of the critical high friction area. The number of leading edge sections and the location of the stitch welds can also be adjusted to tailor a plow for a specific application. This allows for a nearly infinite variety of configurations in an economic manner.

1. The present invention relates to a jointing structure in vehicle traveling path joints and the like having an expansion function, which is adaptable for applications of various tire configurations different in tire diameter, ensures high slip resistance to tires, permits less occurrence of tire fall-in and/or stuck-in situations, and is easy to be given the maintenance. The jointing structure comprises more than one step provided face to face at the coaxially built traveling path ends with an expansion gap between, more than one elastic member respectively mounted inside the above more than one step, and a joint block mounted on the above more than one elastic member across the above expansion gap. The elastic members are desirably of a material that is hard to be deformed vertically and vice verse easy to be deformed horizontally in a soft manner. The present invention employs elastic members mainly consisting of laminated rubber.

2. The joint block is placed across the expansion gap, and thus, the adequate management of accuracy of each member if given may be adapted to prevent the differences in level from occurring in any joint portion between the joint block and the traveling path. The use of a joint block made of the same concrete as that of the traveling path may be adapted to provide more substantially increased slip resistance to the tires, as compared with the rubber or steel expansion joint. A high-strength fiber-reinforced concrete joint block is as highly durable as hardly worn away, and is thus considered to be suitably applicable to the joint block for use in the present invention. The joint block is firmly fixed in three positions to the upside of the backing plate by reason that the loose holes respectively take the shapes as described the above.

1. The present invention relates to track transport systems, specifically floor track systems used in sanitary fluid treatment chambers for transporting food stuffs on wheeled hand trucks. This invention aims to prevent the contamination of the treatment fluid by the wheels of the hand trucks.

2. In the conventional method of chilling cooked meat products, racks or hand trucks loaded with cooked meat are rolled into a cooling chamber and chilled air is circulated to cool the meat. However, this method has the major drawback of evaporating meat juices and causing excessive dehydration and shrinkage of the product.

3. More recent approaches to chilling cooked meat products employ fluid treatment chambers with a system for showering the meat products with a chilled brine solution to quickly transfer the heat from the meat to the solution. This method allows for the recovery and reuse of the brine solution.

4. The meat products processed in this manner are generally for human consumption and must be processed in a sanitary environment as required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The method of transporting cooked meat into and out of the fluid treatment chamber must maintain the sanitary condition of the chamber as well as the recovered brine solution.

5. One transport system used with a certain degree of success in cooling chambers is the overhead rail or trolley onto which product carriers, such as racks or trees, are suspended and automatically moved or manually pushed and pulled by a gaff or similar device. However, this system has the disadvantage of fixing the route of transfer.

6. Another transport system used is the wheeled dolly-like floor trucks, which can be pushed to any desired destination or stored at remote locations. However, the mobility advantage gained by these trucks is offset by the unsanitary nature of the wheels.

1. The present invention relates to oil well drilling tools and apparatuses, specifically an apparatus for retrieving the wear bushing from around the interior of the well head and casing. The apparatus includes a sub-unit for mounting onto the drill string. The sub-unit is designed to be removably securable on the exterior surface of a sub-unit, allowing it to be mounted on a string of drill pipe independently of threading on the pipe.

2. Wear sleeves or wear bushings are utilized during oil and gas well drilling to protect against excessive wear, particularly in seal areas of casing heads and other well head elements. The wear bushings prevent wear to the joint of the housing and the initial length of pipe or casing to which it is secured. However, often times it may be desirable to retrieve the wear sleeve or bushing without the use of the bit.

3. In the present state of the art, one method utilized for removing the wear sleeve or bushing is by using a retriever body having outwardly protruding dowels or the like for engaging a J-slot in the wear sleeve. The retriever is incorporated in the drill string with the usual pin and box threaded upper and lower ends. However, this method has a shortcoming in that the retriever body must be secured in rigid engagement with the exterior of the pipe.

4. The present invention provides a retriever apparatus for a wear bushing inside the casing head, allowing vertical movement of the retrieving unit while allowing rotational movement of the retriever unit during operation. The retriever unit is mounted onto a mandrel and connected onto drill pipe, allowing a vertical play or movement of the retriever unit.

1. The invention is related to downhole vibratory tools, specifically those that allow selective passage for other tools. These tools are used to dislodge stuck objects, known as fish, from downhole locations. They also have applications in transmitting pulling forces to fish stuck in deviated wellbores.

2. Vibratory tools in the art operate on a principle where an overpull is applied to the string supporting the tool, and pressure is applied within the string. A piston then travels against the bias of a spring, stretching the string while compressing the spring. At some point, the spring force becomes higher than the pressure applied, causing the valve member to move off its seat.

3. The prior art designs have limitations, including a dump valve that relieves pressure located in the center of the tool, preventing a clear run through the tool for wireline or other tools. This design also includes additional compromises, such as miniaturization of key components, which limits power delivery and increases fatigue on moving parts. The use of smaller components also increases the cost of the tool.

4. The invention addresses the issues with prior designs by reconfiguring the dump valve into an annular shape, keeping the middle of the tool free and clear. This allows a central passage to exist, permitting wireline operations through the tool when it's not in vibratory mode. The tool can be put in vibratory mode by dropping a removable plug onto a seat.

5. The tool has an outer body with a lower end attached to a stuck object or fish, and an upper end connected to a string. Within the outer body, a mandrel extends uphole from the upper end, connected to the surface through the string. The mandrel has a passage in fluid communication with the passage in the string.

6. The tool includes a modular piston stack that can be used to increase the available piston area in a confined downhole space, thus increasing the power of the pressure spike applied to the fish. The impacting of pistons on the housing is optional and depends on the applied overpull to the string. The cycling continues until applied pressure is turned off or the overpull force is removed.

7. The tool is activated by dropping a simple and cheap plug into the passage to seal its lower end. The design of the valve as an annular ring gets it out of the center of the tool, allowing wireline access feature through the passage before the plug is dropped. The ring seal simply slides between surfaces to close and open the valve.

The invention aims to overcome the limitations of conventional retaining wall designs, which often require extensive excavation and labor-intensive construction. By pre-manufacturing parts of the wall, the invention allows for taller walls and shorter bases, reducing installation and transportation costs.

2. The invention comprises a precast, substantially solid, rectangular or trapezoidal base set on grade at the job site, and a face panel with an integral counterfort set upright on the base. The face panel and counterfort are connected using a shear key or rebar, eliminating the need for temporary shoring. This connection allows the wall to withstand temporary wind loads immediately.

3. The retaining wall system is flexible, with the height or width of individual components varying over a wide range. All pieces of the assembly can be easily made to custom sizes, making it suitable for various applications, including retaining soil, sand, pebbles, or rocks. The system also allows for the use of different materials, such as precast concrete or cast-in-place concrete.

4. The invention includes various embodiments, such as using H-piles beneath the base for added stability, creating a pocket in the base to allow the pile to extend up into the base, or utilizing a cast-in-place pile cap. These alternatives provide additional support and stability to the retaining wall system. The use of H-piles or a cast-in-place pile cap can be particularly useful in poor soil conditions.

5. The retaining wall system can also include a vehicle impact barrier, which can be formed and cast-in-place on top of the wall or behind the wall. The impact barrier can be created using exposed rebar extending out of the face panel, or it can be pre-manufactured and pre-cast with the face panel at the factory. This feature provides additional protection and safety for the retaining wall system.

1. The invention relates to a mechanism for installing and removing objects in wells, including objects that might be stuck or lost within a well bore. The mechanism is designed to effectively connect to a down hole object or fish and disengage from it when desired. The invention aims to provide a simple and efficient way to accomplish fishing operations in well bores. It is particularly useful for wire line service operations.

2. The mechanism takes the form of an external pull tool or overshot that is adapted for use in well servicing operations. It can be provided on a wire line controlled pulling tool and run into the well casing or well bore for the purpose of establishing a mechanical connection with an object positioned in the well bore. The tool structure consists of an outer tubular body and an inner body structure disposed in movable relation therein. Telescoping movement of the inner and outer body structures causes the overshot or spear to selectively move into gripping relationship with the object.

3. The mechanism includes a controllable locking mechanism that allows for selective positioning of the guide pin relative to the latching or unlatching slots. The locking mechanism incorporates a plurality of spring elements that ensure alternate latching and unlatching of the pulling tool mechanism. The spring elements are designed to induce relative rotational control and guidance of the pins as they move relative to the inner body structure. This allows for efficient selective control of the pulling tool mechanism.

4. The mechanism can be used in various down hole service operations, including installation and removal of down hole tools and fishing operations for stuck or lost tools within the well bore. It can be latched and unlatched as many times as necessary to accomplish the service operation involved.

1. The present application claims the benefit of a PCT International Patent Application Ser. No. PCT/MX2011/000063 filed on May 25, 2011, which in turn claims priority to co-pending Mexico patent application Ser. Nos. MX/a/2011/005499 and MX/a/2010/005899. The entirety of the contents of each application is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The application relates to stave floors, particularly to modular composed stave floors. The example embodiment is directed to a method for the manufacture of composed stave floors.

2. The conventional composed stave floors or engineering floors have a base substrate and a sight substrate, with the sight substrate being selected from a group that consists of noble hard woods, exotic woods, and capricious woods. The sight substrate has a thickness from 2 to 3 mm, which is prone to deformation and detachment upon being sanded or rushed. The base substrate is composed of slung wood or is plated against, and both sheets are joined by means of glue. The conventional composed stave floors have a short life and no possibility of providing corrective maintenance.

3. The conventional composed stave floors have a thin thickness of the plate of the noble layer or sight substrate, which does not offer a solid base of attachment. The resistance of the glaze is poor, and it is susceptible to being easily scratched or suffering the effect of peeling. The materials are supplied pre-varnished from the supplier, but the thin thickness of the sheet does not provide a solid base of attachment. The conventional composed stave floors have a short life and no possibility of providing corrective maintenance.

4. The conventional composed stave floors have a problem of joining both sheets of plate, which is in preventing the displacement or change of dimensions. Different factors prevent the sheets from being fixed in a firm way, even though patent application number MX/a/2010/005899 tried to solve the problem. The conventional composed stave floors have a short life and no possibility of providing corrective maintenance. The conventional composed stave floors have a problem of joining both sheets of plate.

5. An example embodiment is directed to a method for the manufacture of composed stave floors, which includes providing a sight substrate having a thickness of at least 4 mm and providing a base substrate having a thickness of at least 12 mm.

1. The invention relates to ladders and ladder attachments that position the ladder away from the work surface, prevent defacement of the work surface, and prevent the ladder from slipping or sliding. A ladder is used to help people reach places they would not ordinarily be able to reach, and it is often used to climb onto roofs of buildings and for tasks such as washing windows or painting. The bottom portion of the ladder rests on the ground or other surface, and the top end of the ladder typically leans against the building or work surface. The ladder is oriented at an angle that makes it easy for a user to climb up and down the ladder.

2. One problem with ladders is that there is an amount of instability because the ladder rests on the side of the house with only a small portion of the siderails in contact with the house. When a person on the ladder reaches outside the rails, the center of gravity shifts, causing one or both rails to slide along the work surface, thereby damaging the work surface. This instability is a major concern, especially when painting or cleaning the exterior of a house. It is highly desirable to have a ladder that has lateral stability under normal working conditions and resists sliding.

3. Another problem with typical ladders is that the siderails of the ladder rest on the work surface with a very small contact area, which sometimes dents, scrapes, bruises, or otherwise defaces the work surface. It is desirable to have a ladder that contacts the work surface with a broad surface area that does not deface the work surface. This is particularly important when working on surfaces with corners, as the ladder must be positioned on one of the two surfaces forming the corner to stabilize the ladder. A typical ladder cannot straddle the corners because the rungs would rest against the corner with the siderails void of contact with the two surfaces, creating an unstable condition.

4. The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above, and it provides a non-slip gripping portion for a ladder that grips the work surface without damaging the work surface. The invention also provides a ladder that effectively increases the contact area of the ladder with the work surface, which improves the lateral stability of the ladder. Additionally, the invention provides an attachment for a ladder to improve the lateral stability of the ladder. The attachment is designed to prevent the ladder from slipping or sliding on the work surface.

5. The invention includes a brace assembly that is attached to the siderail of the ladder, and it includes",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The present invention pertains to a collated nail strip formed with a debris-free plastic material for use in a fastener driving tool. The plastic material is molded onto and adhered to the fasteners, defining a collar portion that captures or at least substantially encircles the fastener shank and a connecting portion extending between and connecting adjacent collar portions. The plastic material is formulated from an adhesive polymer such as a polyolefin, a polyolefin blend, an epoxy, or the like.

2. The collation system is formed from a plastic material that is molded onto and adhered to the fasteners, with the plastic material defining a collar portion that captures or at least substantially encircles the fastener shank and a connecting portion extending between and connecting adjacent collar portions. The connecting portion can be formed as a bridge and a rib in which the bridge and rib have a generally cruciform shape. The rib can be formed parallel to the collation or at an angle to the collation.

3. The plastic material can be a uniform material that is molded over the nail shanks and between the nails, or it can be a multi-part molding with discrete layers in the molding material provided on the nails. The adhesive can be applied or bonded to the nails onto which a layer of a material with desired characteristics is applied. A layered configuration can also be achieved using a coextrusion of two or more plastics.

4. The shape or configuration of the molding around and between the nails is another aspect of the present nail strip. The collars are formed as encircling elements that have a greater longitudinal or axial length at about a midpoint between the connecting elements and dip to a smaller axial length at about the connecting portions. The connecting portions include a bridge that extends from one collar to the adjacent collar and is about the height of the collar at the collar/connecting portion juncture.

5. The connecting portion provides the necessary rigidity to the strip that, in conjunction with the adhesive characteristics of the plastic, prevents corrugation of the strip. The connecting portion can be formed with a notch at the base or bottom along a desired line of separation, or at the juncture of the connecting portion and the next adjacent nail. The notch provides a location at which the nail, collar, and connecting portion, as a unit, separate from the strip.

1. The invention relates to a position sensor that can sense the position or movement of an object and provide a conditioned sensing signal to a remote monitor via two wires, making it suitable for multiplexing with other sensors. This allows for a reduction in the number of wires required for the system.

2. The position sensor includes a waveform generator that receives an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer and modifies it in response to an error correction signal to provide a conditioned sensing signal. The error correction signal is generated by an error correction generator that determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about the position of the object being sensed.

3. The error correction generator includes a comparator, a controller, and a signal processor that work together to provide the error correction signal. The comparator receives the conditioned sensing signal and determines its value, while the controller provides timing signals to the signal processor.

4. The signal processor generates the error correction signal in response to the timing signals and provides it to the waveform generator. The waveform generator then modifies the unconditioned sensing signal in response to the error correction signal to provide the conditioned sensing signal.

5. The position sensor also includes a window reference circuit that constantly compares a desired conditioned sensor signal output to an existing conditioned sensor signal output and adjusts the output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal. This ensures that the sensor output is accurate and reliable.

6. The sensor monitoring system provides power to the sensor and receives the conditioned sensing signal via two wires, making it suitable for multiplexing with other sensors. The sensor monitoring system can also be used to recalibrate the sensor at any time by simply removing and reapplying power.

1. The invention pertains to methods and apparatus for generating heat from particulate-laden gas or directly from waste fuels such as wood waste. It aims to provide a clean burning waste fuel burner that can deliver exhaust gases as clean as those produced by oil and gas burners.

2. The prior art wood waste fuel burners have been extremely inefficient in combustion, discharging undesirable amounts of gaseous and particulate pollution. They require frequent and expensive cleaning due to the dirty gases emitted to the boiler for heating.

3. The conventional practice is to build an extremely large furnace chamber for a boiler to allow the discharge gases from the burner to reach a very low velocity so that particulate matter in the exhaust can drop out of the gas stream. This results in gas velocities of 50 to 60 ft./sec. in hog or wastewood fuel boilers.

4. The invention aims to provide a waste fuel burner that emits discharges of very minimal quantities of particulate materials within the levels permitted by local environmental regulations. It also aims to provide a waste wood fuel burner that operates producing little slag or clinkers.

5. The invention provides a waste fuel burner that can effectively burn wet wood of 70% moisture content (wet basis). It also provides a waste fuel burner that is self-regulating, easy to control, and has fast response times to changes in the load comparable to conventional gas and oil burners.

6. The burner includes a primary combustion chamber with an internal side wall, a discharge opening, and a bottom. The chamber is lined with refractory material spaced from an outer metallic shell by an air cooling passage.

7. Fuel is fed from a hopper by a conveyor and pushed into the form of a conical pile. Preheated underfire combustion air is carried by a conduit and directed into two chambers to percolate or blow up through the pile.

8. High pressure swirl air is admitted through tuyeres, which are at an angle to the side wall to generate centrifugal forces that drive the heavier non-combusted materials to the outer wall. The tuyeres are individually adjustable to regulate the exact amount of air and the velocity of this air introduced into the primary combustion chamber.

2. Traditional engine compression release brake systems typically include an engine brake for each engine cylinder, but this can result in excess components and reduced overall robustness of the engine. Engineers have learned that a reduction in engine components can improve the overall robustness of an engine.

4. In one aspect of the present invention, an engine includes an engine housing defining a plurality of engine cylinders, and an engine compression release brake is provided for each of a portion of the engine cylinders. The portion of engine cylinders is less than all of the plurality of engine cylinders.

5. The engine compression release brake system includes a low pressure reservoir, a high pressure pump, a hydraulic system, and an electronic control module. The electronic control module controls multiple aspects of engine operation, such as fuel injection timing and engine compression release brake timing.

6. Each cylinder defined by the engine housing has a movable piston, and each piston is movable between a retracted, downward position and an advanced, upward position. The piston undergoes four stages of engine operation: intake, compression, power, and exhaust.

1. The present invention relates to support structures, specifically a mounting link between an engine structure and an attached structure such as an auxiliary gearbox. The mounting link is designed to withstand various loads, including routine vibrational loads and sudden or extreme shocks caused by hard landings.

2. Aircraft gas turbine auxiliary gearboxes are expected to withstand extreme loads, including those caused by ""blade-off"" events, where blades of the engine detach due to impacts or the like. These loads can be more than an order of magnitude stronger than any other sudden or extreme shock gas turbine engines are expected to experience.

3. Conventional gearboxes and gearbox connections are constructed to rigidly withstand all anticipated loads, often requiring additional material or being heavier to withstand such extreme loads. However, this can lead to increased weight and mass of material required to adequately reinforce associated systems.

4. A link assembly between an engine and a gearbox includes a male link coupled to the engine or the gearbox, a female link coupled to the engine or the gearbox, and a pin releasably coupled to the male link and the female link. The female link receives the male link to allow translation of the male link relative to the female link and to form a radial interface.

5. The radial interface dampens translation of the male link relative to the female link, allowing the mounting link to absorb extreme shocks without detaching the gearbox from the engine or transmitting potentially destructive loads. This design enables the mounting link to limit or prevent damage to the gearbox and its attached peripherals.

6. The mounting link includes a female link, a male link, and a pin that selectively prevents the relative translation of the female link and the male link. The pin passes through a through hole of the female link and a through hole of the male link to engage and retain the female link and the male link.

7. The pin can be designed to shear at a known load magnitude corresponding to the maximum structural capability of the gearbox assembly, the unfused mount components, and the engine mounting structure. This can be accomplished by selecting an appropriately durable diameter and material for the pin.

8. After an event that can cause the pin to shear, the female link and the male link are allowed to translate relative to each other, with the female link and the male link in contact at the radial interface between the link interface ends. The frictional radial interface provides coulomb damping to dissipate energy created by the translation.

1. The present invention relates to an air intake device of an internal combustion engine that utilizes the dynamic effects of the air flow to improve the volumetric efficiency of the engine. The device comprises a tank providing a volumetric area extending along an intake tube, a valve disposed in an interconnecting portion between the tank and the intake passage, and valve activating means to open or shut the valve in response to the engine load. The air inlet pipe placed upstream of an air cleaner should be as short as possible to obtain the most enhanced dynamic effect. However, cutting the inlet pipe too short results in an increase in the noise from the air intake.

2. The present invention aims to provide an air intake device that will improve the performance of the engine by the best utilization of the dynamic effect, to reduce noise from the air intake. According to the present invention, an intake device for an internal combustion engine comprises a tank defining a volume, a first pipe defining a first passage interconnecting the tank with the air intake passage, and a second pipe defining a second passage interconnecting the tank with the air intake passage. The first and second passages are open to the intake passage at different locations with respect to each other, and the cross-sectional area of the second passage is smaller than that of the first passage. The second passage preferably opens to the air intake passage at a location nearer the air cleaner than the location where the first passage opens to the air intake passage.

1. The present invention relates to a method of minimizing flow disturbance caused by the closing and reopening of turbine control valves during periodic operational testing. The method uses control valve positions as feedback to minimize such flow disturbance. The flow is determined as a function of control valve position, i.e., valve stem lift. The flow change due to closure of one of the several parallel flow paths during valve testing results in a change to the system that is controlling pressure from N valves to N- 1  valves.

2. The flow characteristic for each valve of the system with N valves, and for the system with N- 1  valves, is determined during the turbine design process. The flow characteristics are based on total flow and individual valve stem lift. For any given valve not under test, the difference in the flow-lift characteristic between the N and the N- 1  condition is known. This difference is applied to the total flow demand to each of the N- 1  valves on the basis of the total N valve demand derived from the position of the valve under test.

3. The present invention uses a test compensation circuit that uses control valve positions as feedback and compensates by adjusting the flow through parallel control valves to minimize flow disturbance caused by the closure and reopening of turbine control valve during testing. The test compensation circuit is shown in greater detail in FIG. 3. The circuit includes a test compensation array that provides, for the mass flow difference demanded by TCV Reference, for the three input control valves not being tested, where a fourth one of the control valves is being closed for testing. The output of the test compensation array is fed into a sample and hold circuit.

The valve has two inlets A and B, and one outlet, where the outlet mixture can range from 0% inlet A fluid, 100% inlet B fluid to 100% inlet A fluid, 0% inlet B fluid. The valve is intended to provide a constant pressure cleaning solution to each user, with the cleaning agent to water ratio being continuously adjustable. This allows multiple users to accomplish specific cleaning tasks without disrupting other members of the team.

2. The mixing valve is a key component of a stand-alone cleaning apparatus that would allow multiple users to accomplish specific cleaning tasks without disrupting other members of the team. Each user would have complete control over the strength of the particular cleaning solution being used. The system must be capable of providing a constant pressure cleaning solution to each user, with the cleaning agent to water ratio being continuously adjustable. This would be particularly useful in the commercial airline industry, where aircraft are typically cleaned extensively on a yearly basis by teams of airline employees.

3. The mixing valve has a valve body, a first inlet passage defined in the body for receiving a first fluid at a first predetermined pressure, a second inlet passage also defined in the body for receiving a second fluid at a second predetermined pressure, and an outlet passage defined in the body for providing a proportional mixture of the two fluids. The valve means is disposed within the body for directing the two fluids toward the outlet passage. The valve means is adjustable to permit the mixture to range, in an analog fashion, between a proportion of about 0% first fluid, 100% second fluid to about 100% second fluid, 0% first fluid. This allows for continuous control of the proportional quantities of the two fluids.

1. Electronic components produce heat when operating, and in some applications, free convection cooling is not sufficient to prevent overheating. In such cases, electric fans are often used to move ambient air across the components at a higher rate. This is a low-cost solution for keeping electronic components within acceptable temperature ranges.

2. Cooling fans are often integrated with an enclosure that houses electronic components, and they are typically mounted to the enclosure using fasteners like screws or rivets. However, this fastening technique increases the product cost due to labor and tooling requirements. It also involves handling costs associated with the fasteners.

3. The present invention discloses a system for eliminating fasteners traditionally used for securing cooling fans to an enclosure. This system can be utilized in various applications, including the automotive, computer, and electronic instrumentation industries. The invention aims to reduce product costs and improve installation efficiency.

4. The cooling fan assembly of the present invention includes a motor, a fan blade, and a motor carrier with mounting legs. The motor carrier is designed to be mounted to a panel or stationary member using a unique fastening mechanism. This mechanism eliminates the need for traditional fasteners.

5. The motor carrier includes a plurality of mounting legs with resilient leg portions that are separated by a compression gap. Each leg portion terminates into a turned-out portion that is inserted into a recess portion on the panel. The recess portion includes an opening with an enlarged opening region and a residual opening region.

6. To install the cooling fan assembly, a combined compressive and rotating force is imparted to the assembly or the panel. The compressive force compresses a spring member that urges the turned-out portions of the resilient legs against the panel. The rotating force repositions the resilient legs into an intermediate-sized opening of the recess portion.

7. As the cooling fan assembly is further rotated, the resilient leg portions enter into a residual opening region of the recess portion, where they spring outwardly and capture each leg portion pair within its associated residual opening. The spring member remains in a compressed state, urging the turned-out portions of the resilient legs against the panel. This prevents vibrational noise and ensures secure fastening of the motor carrier to the panel.

8. The present invention provides a secure and efficient fastening mechanism for cooling fans, eliminating the need for traditional fasteners and reducing product costs. The system can be used in various applications where forced air movement is relied upon for cooling. The invention aims to improve installation efficiency and reduce labor costs.

1. The invention aims to provide kinematic mounts with novel damping features to protect instruments from potentially damaging flight loads. These mounts are used extensively as base supports for precision optical instruments and other high-performance machinery. The first requirement for these mounts is to not adversely affect the stability of the instrument through attachment to a less precise spacecraft structure.

2. The kinematic mounts have been modified by inserting vibration damping materials into the mounts, which introduce a damping mechanism into the six mount suspension modes. This modification preserves the fundamental features of the mounts, such as strength, stiffness, and kinematic features. The damping mechanism is provided at machined hinge or flexure locations of the mounts.

3. Two embodiments of the damper design are depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B. The first embodiment uses a spherical damper placed around a flexure area, while the second embodiment uses a cylindrical slot damper with a series of o-rings. These designs induce shearing deformation and compression/tension in the viscoelastic material, respectively.

4. The proposed mounting concept offers several benefits and desirable features, including a simple design and the ability to uncouple the six suspension vibration modes of the instrument. This can be achieved by arranging the struts in a center-of-gravity mounting system. The mounting scheme provides a significant performance improvement over the design without the damping treatment, reducing the flight-induced random vibration response of the instrument by a factor of 0.32.

1. The invention described in the source document is related to the use of waveguide holograms for illuminating objects with specific requirements. This invention is a continuation-in-part of a parent application and has been made with government support. The government has certain rights in this invention. The invention provides improved, controlled illumination of objects, including holograms and spatial light modulators.

2. The invention uses thin substrate waveguides, which are characterized by the relationship between the width of an incident laser beam and the thickness of the waveguide. These waveguides are controlled by the wavelength of the incident lightwave and can provide uniform illumination. The inventors have discovered that these waveguides can be particularly used for situations requiring controlled illumination. The invention provides a method for selectively illuminating demanding objects, such as holograms and spatial light modulators.

3. The illumination system claimed in the invention comprises a light source optically coupled to a waveguide, on a surface of which is formed a hologram. The waveguide hologram (WGH) is normally flat and can be optically contacted to the objects it illuminates. The WGH illuminator occupies much less space compared to conventional lens illumination systems. The active volume for a WGH illuminator is no more than the thickness of the waveguide substrate.

4. The invention provides extremely high diffraction efficiencies, with the diffraction efficiency being the fraction of the light from the illuminating source which is diffracted into the required beam. For conventional display holograms, a diffraction efficiency of 0.6 is sometimes obtained, while for holograms made by two plane waves, a diffraction efficiency of 0.99 is attainable. The WGH illuminator can also achieve very high diffraction efficiency, approaching 0.99. However, high efficiencies over large area holograms require very careful design.

5. The invention also addresses several challenges associated with WGHs, including alignment sensitivity, illumination depletion, and two-sidedness. Alignment sensitivity can be combatted by attaching the source firmly to the edge of the waveguide or by using a spatially and spectrally broad source. Illumination depletion can be compensated for a priori or a posteriori, with a posteriori compensation being very light inefficient. Two-sidedness can be addressed by absorbing the light emerging from one side or by placing a mirror on one side to reflect all of the light into the same direction.

2. In a functional memory, updates are made by copying the path from the root of a tree-shaped structure to the point of updating and then making the update in the copied data.

The apparatus is designed to determine whether the driven disc assembly is within specified tolerances and generate external indications to the operator of the condition of the tested assembly.

2. The prior test fixture for measuring the warpage of a driven disc assembly included a splined hub, a stationary ring, and a movable ring, which were actuated by a pneumatic cylinder to move the movable ring toward the stationary ring. However, this fixture was slow and inefficient in the production environment and required several manual operations to be performed by an operator.

Face recognition is one of the most difficult and challenging tasks in computer vision, partly because of large variations in human faces. The difficulty and challenge are even higher for face age-estimation. Researchers have been developing technologies for face age-estimation due to the demands of many real-world operating scenarios that require accurate, efficient, uncooperative, and cost-effective solutions.

2. Accurate age-estimation may be of great benefit to businesses, such as convenience stores, restaurants, and others, who are required to forbid underage access to, for example, alcohol or tobacco. Age-estimation systems can also be applicable in homeland security technologies, criminal identification, management of e-documents and electronic customer relationships, all without requiring imposing password prompts, password change reminders, etc. In restaurants and other businesses, age-recognition systems may be used to help identify trends in business relative to the ages of customers. Additionally, these systems can help to prevent children from viewing or otherwise consuming unacceptable media or programming.

3. The aging of human faces is a complicated process influenced by many factors such as gender, ethnicity, heredity factors, and environmental factors, including cosmetic interventions, societal pressure, relative sun exposure, and drug or alcohol consumption. In this process, there are some controllable factors (i.e., gender, ethnicity, heredity, etc.) that can be exploited in order to recognize trends in the aging of human faces. However, other uncontrollable factors, such as environment, living styles, and sun exposure (photoaging), can prove quite challenging to deal with. Therefore, correctly estimating an age from a face is a huge challenge even for humans, let alone for computing devices.

4. The effects of age on the human face have been studied in numerous research fields, including orthodontics, anthropology, anatomy, forensic art, and cognitive psychology. However, compared to these aging-related fields, computer science approaches for aging problems are relatively new. From the viewpoint of computer science, face aging technologies generally address two areas: face age-estimation and face age-progression.

1. An imaging device, such as a xerographic machine, becomes inactive when not in use, and when it becomes inactive for a long period of time, the device is often put into a “sleep mode” to save energy. When the imaging device “wakes up” from the sleep mode, the device starts warming up and performs imaging operations with toner.

2. The toner used in such an imaging device is charged with a tribo-electro-static charge, and a toner concentration (TC) sensor measures the concentration of the toner in the developer by detecting the tribo charge of the toner. The TC sensor adjusts the supply of toner to increase the concentration of the toner when the concentration of toner is low.

3. If the imaging device is inactive for a long period of time, the tribo charge of the toner may decrease, which greatly affects the image quality in an imaging operation. Therefore, the image quality in an imaging operation after a delayed period may become inconsistent and darker than the image quality during normal or continual use.

The exemplary embodiments address these and other issues by determining one or more periods of inactivity of the imaging device and charging the toner to a predetermined level based on the determined period of inactivity.

This invention is particularly advantageous for the physically handicapped or for an outpatient during a period of convalescence to respond to an inquiry from trained hospital personnel. Hands-free conversation is also advantageous for persons whose activities make handling a telephone difficult or dangerous. Such individuals include those having wet or soiled hands, such as an employee of a laundry, cooks, hairdressers, automobile mechanics, or those people whose tasks require the use of both hands as a part of the work task.

2. The apparatus includes a source of power for the interfacing apparatus, such as by the use of a transformer connected to a wall outlet in a home. Selective switch means are provided for selectively connecting, when actuated, the interfacing apparatus with the telephone network to permit telephone operation in either a conventional manner or in an automatic answering mode. When in the automatic answering mode, a coupler is provided for automatically coupling the telephone network to the speaker device to receive incoming telephone calls on the speaker device when the selector switch is actuated. The apparatus also includes a timer for controlling the length of time of such interconnection and a bypass switch for bypassing the timer.

3. The invention includes two embodiments of the interfacer. The first embodiment includes an optically coupled circuit for coupling the telephone ringing circuit in a manner which discharges a charging capacitor to a predetermined signal level. Means are responsive to the discharge of the capacitor to a predetermined signal level to connect the speaker phone to the telephone lines automatically in a hands-free manner in response to the telephone ringing signal. A timer is connected in circuit with the output of the optocoupler for limiting the time duration during which the telephone network is coupled to the speaker phone. A reset switch is provided in cooperation with the timer for canceling the predetermined time cycle in the timer upon command.

4. The second embodiment of the interfacer includes a neon lamp optically coupled with a photocell having a resistance inversely proportional to the amount of light incident on the cell. As the light increases and the resistance of the photocell decreases, the current through a photocell relay increases to latch contacts to couple the speaker phone to the telephone line. A timing and extension feature as in the previous embodiment are also provided. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.

1. The present invention relates to the field of optical fiber communications, specifically to system network design and incorporation of branch powered amplification within such networks. The invention aims to reduce or eliminate undersea optical repeaters in a trunk and branch ring network. This is achieved by replacing repeaters with remotely pumped optical amplifiers and remotely supplying energy to those optical amplifiers over the same branch cables that also distribute communications signals.

2. The invention utilizes a trunk and branch structure with a ring geometry, which exhibits strong survivability features. An arbitrary single trunk cut leaves all nodes connected, and any number of simultaneous branch cuts simply isolate the corresponding branches. This allows all other communications to remain enabled within the trunk ring and further allows access to the trunk by the remaining unsevered branches.

3. The invention also utilizes a light emitting power source to supply energy to the optical amplifier. The light emitting power source is coupled onto the branch fiber optic cable or the optical fiber cable trunk, and the energy is transferred unidirectionally over the cable. The energy is then used to amplify attenuated optical fiber cable trunk communication signals.

4. The invention uses a multiple order cascaded Raman laser as the light emitting power source, producing an output light source with a wavelength in the range of 1450-1500 nm. The wavelength of the light source must be distinct from the band of signal wavelengths contemplated for transmission along the optical fiber cable trunk or the branch fiber optic cable. This ensures that the energy source does not interfere with the signal wavelengths.

5. The invention also uses an erbium doped fiber amplifier as the optical amplifier, which is capable of amplifying signals in the 1500-1600 nm range. The optical amplifier is spliced or coupled with the optical fiber cable trunk or the branch fiber optic cable, and its exact location is determined by the network designer. The maximum distance between the light emitting power source and the optical amplifier is currently limited to about one hundred kilometers.

6. The invention provides a number of advantages, including a single optical fiber cable trunk cut maintaining full connectivity along the trunk and to all cable stations. Branch fiber optic cable cuts simply isolate the associated cable station without compromising ring integrity. The invention also respects sovereignty concerns and allows for reconfigurable wavelength add/drop branching units.

7. The invention can be applied to other methods of signal multiplexing and may also be used as a terrestrial communications system instead of in an undersea application. The invention is particularly well suited as an undersea application of",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21}"

1. The invention was made with government support under Contract No. W-7405-ENG-36 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy, and the government has certain rights in the invention. The present invention relates generally to electron multipliers and, more particularly, to electron multipliers used in photomultipliers and particle detectors.

2. Two types of conventional electron multipliers are routinely used: discrete dynode multipliers and continuous electron multipliers. Discrete dynode multipliers consist of dynode stages that initiate and amplify a cascade of electrons.

3. Continuous electron multipliers, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates, employ one or more high resistivity glass channels or tubes that act as a series of continuous dynodes. These multipliers are used extensively in electron spectrometers, mass spectrometers, and photonic detectors.

4. The present invention includes a foil electron multiplier, which encompasses the next generation design of electron multipliers. The foil electron multiplier uses a sequential series of thin foils in an evacuated enclosure that act to multiply electrons in a series of transmission stages.

5. The foil electron multiplier comprises a series of thin foils held by foil holders in an evacuated enclosure that form discrete multiplication stages. The foils are arranged collinearly, although they can be arranged in an array along an arc.

6. The gain of a foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, transmission through the support grid, and secondary electron emission yield. The gain is represented by Equation 2, which takes into account the probability of incident particle transmission, transmission through the foil, and secondary electron emission yield.

7. The foil electron multiplier exhibits an intrinsic rejection of ion feedback at each stage, which is a limitation of continuous electron multipliers. Ions generated at one foil may be accelerated back to the previous foil, but cannot be re-transmitted back because the ion energy is too low.

8. The foil dimensions practiced for the present invention range from about 0.5 cm diameter to 2×4 cm 2, although this range may be expanded or reduced depending on the application sought. A preferred embodiment uses a round 1 cm diameter foil.

9. The foil areal thickness can range from about 0.2 μg/cm 2 to about 2 μg/cm 2, with a preferred embodiment using a range of 0.2 to 1 μg/cm 2. Carbon is the preferred foil material due to its thinness",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 20}"

The invention aims to provide a heat-dissipating fan and a housing thereof, wherein an sidewall of the housing extends outwards to enlarge the intake airflow area thereof.

2. A typical electrical product includes electrical elements positioned in a closed housing to prevent contamination, but the electrical element tends to be consumed and its lifetime shortened due to high-temperature conditions. A fan is typically disposed in the housing to dissipate heat to the outside and prevent the electrical element from failing.

2. A germanium layer is epitaxially grown on the semiconductor substrate, and the buffer layer is grown on the germanium layer. This provides a good buffer layer that is compatible with Si and many oxides. The epitaxial growth of Ge on top of the ferroelectric or high-dielectric constant oxide is also much easier than Si.

3. The Ge buffer layer can be used to prevent or minimize the formation of a low dielectric constant layer at the Si/oxide interface. This layer is generally amorphous and has a low dielectric constant, which degrades the usefulness of non-SiO2-based oxides with Si. The Ge buffer layer also enhances the epitaxy and reduces the reaction layer between the deposited oxide and the substrate.

4. The epitaxial growth of Ge on Si is compatible with current Si process technology, but the main difficulty is the 4% lattice mismatch, which results in misfit dislocations on Ge films thicker than 1 nm. A thin Ge layer is preferably used on the silicon to avoid misfit dislocations. Polycrystalline Ge may also be formed over polycrystalline Si.

5. The choice of materials may be very different depending on the application. For large density capacitors, (Ba1-x,Srx)TiO3 (BST) is the best linear dielectric. BaTiO3 (BT) or SrTiO3 (ST) are not thermodynamically stable next to Si, but they are stable next to Ge.

6. Not all oxides are stable next to Ge. For example, all ferroelectrics containing Pb, such as Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 (PZT), are much less stable next to Ge. A thin layer of SrTiO3 or other stable ferroelectric can be used as a buffer layer between the Pb-containing ferroelectric and the Ge-coated Si substrate.

7. The SrTiO3 buffer layer not only acts as a chemical barrier but also nucleates the desired perovskite structure. This is important because Pb is very reactive and can",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30}"

1. The invention relates to a recessed mask structure used in semiconductor devices to prevent localized high electrical fields at intersections, resulting in lower electrical breakdown. This structure is particularly useful in high-speed and high-density integrated circuit applications with fine metal features and low dielectric constant insulators.

2. As semiconductor devices are miniaturized, dimensional tolerances become very small, and abrupt physical discontinuities produce high electrical fields that lead to enhanced leakage and breakdown. The use of different materials with lower dielectric constants is becoming more attractive for reducing device parameters such as line-to-line capacitance and cross-talk noise.

3. The invention provides a metal plus low dielectric constant (low-k) interconnect structure with reduced lateral leakage current and a lower effective dielectric constant than conventional structures. This is achieved by positioning a differentiating or mask member below the surface to be planarized, where there will be a lower electric field.

4. The recessed mask structure is particularly useful in damascene type device structures, where adjacent conductors are lined with an electrically conductive and diffusion barrier film, and connections are made to levels above and below through metal-filled vias. The structure also includes a dielectric cap applied over the surfaces of the metal lines and the masking layer.

5. The invention involves removing a portion of the mask layer to create a recessed surface, which is then positioned so that the high field points are separated from the interface between the mask and the cap. This allows for a lower and predictable overall capacitance, which is valuable for faster signal propagation in interconnect wiring.

6. The structure of the invention can be made using a standard substrate with a bulk layer of intralevel dielectric material, and the etched openings are provided with conductive diffusion barrier liners. The surface is then chemically-mechanically polished until the copper conductors are nearly coplanar with the mask surface, and a different slurry is used to remove any remaining liner material.

1. The invention relates to the production of multilayered components, particularly multilayered electrical components, and provides a new process that simplifies the manufacture of such components. This process eliminates the need for cutting and metallizing steps, which are the most costly from a labor standpoint.

2. The process involves providing a first electrode and a first electrical component, locating the electrode in a recess formed by the component to produce a first laminate sub-assembly, and repeating this process to produce multiple sub-assemblies. These sub-assemblies are then brought into mutually stacked relation to form a resultant assembly.

3. The process also includes the provision of methods to interconnect electrodes in stacked sub-assemblies, locate sub-assemblies in precise registered relation, and build-up stacks with covering components at upper and lower ends of the stacks. This allows for the fabrication of assemblies of many different sizes at very low cost and at high production rates.

4. The invention provides apparatus or tooling to enable such fabrication, and the resultant sub-assemblies and assemblies themselves. The process also enables the inspection of both the electrode print and dielectric print for perfection and thickness before commitment to actual construction.

5.

This is achieved by providing a blocking film, or passivation film, to prevent the removal of oxygen from that surface.

2. The blocking film is uniformly coated over the spaces or micro-holes in the surface portion of the superconducting material using a photo CVD method, which is a method of exciting a reactive gas using ultraviolet light for coating a film onto a film forming surface. The film is formed at a thickness of 10 Å to 2μm.

3. The superconducting material used in the present invention can be in the form of tablets or thin films, and can be made of various materials such as (YBa2)Cu3O6-8. The material is placed in a vacuum, causing the oxygen in the area close to the surface to be removed, resulting in a deterioration of electrical characteristics.

4. To prevent the removal of oxygen, a film such as silicon nitride, silicon oxide, or aluminum is formed on the surface of the material using the CVD method. The film is formed at a depth of 5 Å to 50 Å, and is used to coat the inside of the spaces or micro-holes.

5. The film is then subjected to heat treatment in an atmosphere of oxygen at 300° C. to 900° C. to position the added oxygen in the appropriate atom location and to convert the film to a highly dense insulating material.

This is particularly important for ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) used in oil and natural gas exploration. The OBS is designed to operate remotely on the ocean floor, and its position and orientation can affect the quality of seismic data collected. The invention aims to provide a simple and inexpensive method for determining the angle of inclination.

2. The present invention also comprises a method and apparatus for automatically leveling seismic motion detectors employed in a seismometer. Seismic motion detectors, such as geophones, are commercially available and are used to sense the component of motion occurring along an axis parallel to their operating axis. To fully sense all components of seismic motion, three orthogonally positioned detectors are needed. The invention provides a means to align the vertically and horizontally operating detectors parallel and perpendicular to the vertical, respectively.

3. The invention uses a free-moving pendulum to automatically align the seismic motion detector with respect to the vertical. The pendulum consists of a geophone, a shaft, and a spherical ball, which are supported in an annular seat. The geophone is connected to the end of the shaft, and the shaft is protruding from the spherical ball. The spherical ball rests in the annular seat, allowing the geophone to swing freely.

The plunger is designed to be cocked for operation before deployment.

The line passing through the center of gravity of the geophone and the center of the spherical ball is immediately and automatically aligned with respect to the vertical. The geophone is then positioned for proper operation. After the seismometer has stabilized, an electric current is introduced to activate the solenoid, removing the pin and allowing the plunger to lock the pendulum in place.

The element is manufactured by a novel combination of familiar and non-exotic manufacturing methods. It is suitable for excitation by a ten Hertz sine wave alternating current electrical voltage impressed across its electrodes.

The humidity sensing element of the preferred embodiment consists of a tubular aluminum first electrode member whose bore has been anodized, the anodized layer impregnated in its porosity with nickel particles by vacuum deposition, the anodized layer sealed, and the sealed anodized layer overlaid with a porous vacuum deposition of nickel to form a second electrode. The sensing element is typically a small, hollow cylinder of commercially pure aluminum, with a bore of about 15 millimeter diameter, 32 millimeter length, and a wall thickness of about 15 millimeters. The anodized layer is formed by oxalic acid anodizing on a portion of the sensing element having an initial surface finish roughness of about 8 micro inches root means square. The second electrode is formed by vacuum deposition of nickel onto the sealed anodized coating.

3. The exact means by which the sensor of this invention functions to have an impedance which decreases generally linearly proportionally to the relative humidity of the atmosphere to which it is exposed must be a subject for theorizing. However, the invention of the present sensor was based on the theory that a suitable combination of capacitance and resistance in a humidity sensing element should result in a humidity element which responds essentially linearly proportionally to the relative humidity of the atmosphere to which it is exposed. The sensor's impedance varies inversely proportionally to the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and when connected in series with a resistance and excited by a suitable alternating current voltage, the voltage drop across the series resistor will vary directly as the relative humidity of the atmosphere. The sensor's impedance changes almost instantly in response to relative humidity changes due to the thin and molecularly porous dielectric and second electrode.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

1. Protective helmets with hard outer shells are well known in the art, and it is generally desirable to provide a resilient liner assembly between the outer shell and the wearer's head to help absorb shock. However, straps or similar elements used in the past for this purpose must be adjustable to accommodate various head sizes, resulting in some wobbling from front to back or from side to side. This issue has led to various proposals for custom-fitted liner assemblies.

2. One known method of making a custom-fitted helmet involves injecting foam into the region between the outer shell and an elastic layer closely overlying the wearer's head, but this method requires directly handling the foaming agent, limiting its utility in the field. Another method involves preforming a liner with a plurality of adjacent pairs of cells containing the first and second components of a foamable mixture, but this method is complex and expensive. Both of these methods are one-shot procedures that do not permit subsequent adjustment of the liner.

3. A third method disclosed in a commonly assigned application involves an individually fitted helmet liner with a plurality of layers, each consisting of a thermoplastic sheet formed with an array of pockets that receive hollow epoxy balloon spacer elements. However, this method requires arranging the adjacent layers with the spheres of one layer in register with the spaces between the spheres of an adjacent layer, which is a relatively expensive and time-consuming manufacturing step. Additionally, the relative incompressibility of the hollow epoxy spheres results in a tendency of the completed helmet to shift its position relative to the wearer's head.

4. The inventor's goal is to provide an individually fitted helmet liner that may be fitted to a wearer's head rapidly and in a simple manner, and that may be refitted to accommodate a changed head size. The liner should also have uniform and predictable structural characteristics, and should not require trimming after fitting. Furthermore, the liner should be relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture.

5. The invention contemplates a helmet liner with a plurality of layers, each consisting of an elastic thermoplastic sheet formed with an array of pockets that are open and unfilled. This design allows the liner to be fitted to an individual wearer's head by heating the sheets to a plastic state, placing the liner between an outer fixture and the wearer's head to deform the sheets to the proper extent, and removing the liner from the wearer's head when the liner has cooled to a rigid, nonplastic state.

1. The invention is a multiorifice wafer structure having a plurality of angularly disposed passages and a method for making the multiorifice structure. The structure is made by fusing concentric layers of solid rods interspaced with cylindrically shaped members. Each successive layer of rods is disposed at a progressively larger angle with respect to the axis of the fused assembly. The fused assembly of cylinders and rods is then cut into relatively thin wafers.

2. The multiorifice structure has a plurality of generally triangularly shaped passageways through the structure, which constitute the orifices through which the fluid to be dispersed or atomized flows. The thickness of the structure is a function of the effective aperture of the interstices and is selected such that the fluid passing therethrough will, upon exiting the structure, have a directional component parallel to the axis of the interstices. The triangular shaped orifices are more effective in the atomization of the exiting fluid than the circular orifices of the prior art. The exiting fluid stream will break up into smaller particles due to surface tension forces acting on the exiting fluid.

3. The multiorifice structure can be fabricated by fusing concentric layers of alternating cylindrical members and angularly disposed rods into an integral assembly, and slicing such integral assembly in a direction normal to the axis of the cylindrical members. The rods and cylindrical members may be coated with a thin layer of material having a lower melting temperature than the materials of the rods and cylindrical members. The composite structure is then fused or sintered to form an integral structure. The sliced surfaces of the multiorifice structures may subsequently be ground or polished to produce required surface finish or uniformity of thickness.

1. The invention pertains to the field of scraped surface heat exchangers, specifically the mounting of blades onto the central drive shaft. The blades are used to mix the material and scrape the inside surface of the outer tube to prevent material buildup. The blades are typically hingedly connected to the central drive shaft.

2. In a known method of mounting the blades, a pin is used to connect the blade to the drive shaft. The pin has a narrow protruding finger and an opposed wider finger. The blade is inserted at an installation angle and then pivoted to a more shallow angle.

3. The blades are generally installed on the drive shaft when the drive shaft is removed from the outer tube of the scraped surface heat exchanger. Installation occurs at initial setup and after each cleaning cycle. The blades need to be held at their relatively shallow angle during installation.

4. The current method of mounting the blades can be cumbersome, especially in horizontally and vertically arranged scraped surface heat exchangers. The blades may be tied with strings or held by hand to prevent them from swinging outwardly. This can be a problem, especially in vertically arranged heat exchangers.

5. The invention provides a method and apparatus to facilitate the mounting of a scraped surface heat exchanger blade onto a drive shaft. The apparatus includes a blade with locking tracks on both sides of the blade. The locking tracks interfere with the pin to prevent the blade from sliding off.

6. The blade includes a first side and a second side, with a scraper edge and a hinge edge. The blade has at least one mounting hole extending through the blade body, and a first L-shaped locking track protruding into the first side of the blade. The locking track includes an entry track and an intermediate track.

7. The pin includes an inner finger and an outer finger, with a base mounted to the drive shaft. The inner finger is aligned with the entry track of the locking track, and the outer finger is aligned with the entry track of the locking track. The blade is inserted between the fingers of the pin.

8. The blade is restrained from vertical travel by interference between the top of the inner finger and the top edge of the mounting hole, and by interference between the top edge of the outer finger and the top of the intermediate track. The blade can only be slid onto a pin with the inner side facing downward and the outer side facing upward. This ensures that the blade is installed with the correct side facing up.

1. The invention relates to a fixing mechanism for a tool used in various technologies, including machining, robot applications, and pneumatic tools. The fixing mechanism is particularly advantageous for use in cutting, punching, moulding, and forming work, especially in machining of metal sheets in sheet machining centers. The mechanism can be used for fixing both the actual machining tool and its counterpart, i.e. the cushion, to the tool holder in the frame of the machine tool.

2. The prior art uses a conic fit for fixing a tool, which has the disadvantage of easily becoming clamped too much against each other, particularly under the effect of axial forces. This leads to increased costs and complexity of the fixing mechanisms, making them subject to disturbances during the actual machining operation and particularly during the exchange of a tool. The invention aims to improve the prior art by providing a simple and secure fixing mechanism.

3. The tool-fixing mechanism according to the invention is characterized by at least one of the connecting surfaces in the tool frame and the tool holder being shaped as a curved surface. The first contact surface in connection with the tool frame and the second contact surface in the tool holder are adjusted to be placed against each other in the operational position of the fixing mechanism. This allows for a simple and secure fixing mechanism, where the tool and its frame can be placed in the tool holder by a simple movement defined by the curved surface.

4. The fixing mechanism can be arranged in various ways, including having a curvilinear surface on the outer surface of the tool frame, which is spherical substantially in the mounting direction. The connecting element in the tool holder can be a corresponding inlay, and both connecting surfaces can be at least partly curved. The mechanism can also be arranged with a ball mechanism or the like placed in the radial direction inside a series of openings in the clamp, allowing for a secure and simple fixing mechanism.

1. Vehicle battery rebalancing is performed to correct cell voltage imbalance conditions, where the voltage of each cell is measured and the cell with the minimum voltage is identified, and all other cells are bled down until their voltages are approximately equal. This process is repeated until all cell voltage readings are approximately equal, and then the battery is charged.

2. A method of determining the desired voltage for charging a battery pack includes calculating the required cell voltage using the minimum Amp-hr cell, summing the string energy, and comparing the calculated energy with the required trip energy. If the energy is too great, an incrementally smaller assumed voltage is used and the summation process is repeated until the desired energy level is reached.

3. The time required to charge a battery pack is dependent on the cell requiring the greatest ΔIhrs, the cell requiring the least ΔIhrs, the method of balancing the cells to the same voltage, and the portion of the charge cycle selected to balance the cells. The charge time can be determined using equations (14) and (15), and the resistive circuitry activation time can be determined using equation (15).

1. Prior to September 2001, significant vulnerabilities in aviation security were identified, including weaknesses in screening passengers and baggage, controlling access to secure areas at airports, and protecting air traffic control computer systems and facilities. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created to address these weaknesses, and it established security requirements for the new agency with mandated deadlines. The TSA deployed federal screeners at 429 commercial airports across the nation by November 2002 and implemented explosives detection technology to screen every piece of checked baggage for explosives by December 2002.

2. The TSA has taken major steps to increase aviation security, including implementing congressional mandates and exploring options for increasing the use of technology and information to control access to secure areas of airports and to improve passenger screening. The agency has also developed initiatives to use its passenger screening resources more efficiently, such as a registered traveler program that would prescreen low-risk travelers. However, the TSA faces several longer-term challenges in the areas of risk management, funding, coordination, strategic human capital management, and building a results-oriented organization.

3. The TSA has implemented various security measures, including the deployment of federal screeners, security managers, and law enforcement officers to screen passengers and property, and the screening of all checked baggage by explosives detection systems. The agency has also established a system for measuring staff performance and management accountability for meeting performance goals. However, the TSA faces challenges in ensuring continued investment in transportation research and development and in maintaining clear and transparent communication with the Congress and industry stakeholders about the use of its funds.

4. The TSA has proposed reprogramming $61.2 million of research and development funds to be used for other purposes, which could limit its ability to sustain and strengthen aviation security. The agency has also raised congressional concerns about accountability, and the Congress has asked GAO to investigate TSA's process for reprogramming funds for the air marshal program. The TSA's ability to form effective partnerships with federal, state, and local agencies and with the aviation community is also crucial for sustaining the aviation security advancements of the past 2 years.

LDA requires organizations to register and report lobbying activities to increase public disclosure of efforts to influence federal decisionmaking. In contrast, IRC sections 4911 and 162(e) were enacted to clarify the extent to which 501(c)(3) organizations can lobby without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status and to prevent businesses from deducting lobbying expenses from their federal income tax. The differences in definitions can significantly affect who registers and what they report under LDA.

2. The LDA lobbying definition covers only contacts with federal government officials and does not require lobbyists to report expenses for contacts with state and local government officials. In contrast, the IRC lobbying definitions cover contacts with federal, state, and local government officials, including grassroots lobbying efforts. The IRC definitions potentially cover more levels of executive branch officials than LDA covers when contacts are about legislation. However, when contacts are about nonlegislative subject matters, LDA covers contacts with a broader range of federal officials than the IRC definitions.

3. The differences in definitions can result in organizations not including expenses or other information on their lobbying reports, such as contacts with high-ranking officials or nonlegislative matters. The IRC section 162(e) definition has a narrow scope of covered executive branch officials, which can result in organizations not including expenses or other information on their lobbying reports.

1. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been assessing strategic sourcing and its potential value in federal acquisitions for over a decade, with a focus on developing knowledge of spending and taking an enterprise-wide approach to services acquisition. This approach has led to structural changes in services acquisition, including the establishment of commodity managers and better leveraging of buying power to achieve substantial savings.

2. Strategic sourcing encompasses a range of tactics for acquiring products and services more effectively and efficiently, including leveraged buying, managing demand, achieving efficiencies through standardization, evaluating total cost of ownership, and better managing supplier relationships. Comprehensive spend analysis is particularly emphasized as a foundation for employing a strategic approach to procurement.

3. Private sector companies are using spend analysis as a foundation for employing a strategic approach to procurement, and the GAO has reported that procurement at federal departments and agencies is generally decentralized, preventing the federal government from fully leveraging its aggregate buying power. This has led to the implementation of strategic sourcing practices through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI).

4. The FSSI mission is to encourage agencies to aggregate requirements, streamline processes, and coordinate purchases of like products and services to leverage spending to the maximum extent possible. However, the GAO found that most agencies leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing in fiscal year 2011.

5. The GAO found that the FSSI program had only managed a small amount of spending through its four government-wide strategic sourcing initiatives in fiscal year 2011, although it reported achieving significant savings on those efforts. The program also reported managing $339 million through several government-wide initiatives in fiscal year 2011 and achieving $60 million in savings.

6. The GAO identified several impediments to strategic sourcing in the federal setting, including the lack of reliable and detailed data on spending, securing expertise, leadership support, and developing metrics. Agencies faced challenges in obtaining and analyzing reliable and detailed data on spending, which is the biggest stumbling block for agencies.

7. The GAO found that agencies were challenged to produce utilization rates and other metrics, such as spending through strategic sourcing contracts and savings achieved, to monitor progress. Several agencies also mentioned a need for sustained leadership support and additional resources to more effectively monitor their ongoing initiatives.

The programs lack a well-defined vision of the national interest and federal role, and many funds are distributed through formulas that only indirectly relate to needs and may have no relationship to performance. The fiscal sustainability of the Highway Trust Fund is in doubt due to increased spending without commensurate increases in revenues. The federal government also lacks adequate data to assess outcomes or implement performance measures.

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engages in three primary activities: aviation safety oversight, air traffic control (ATC), and airport infrastructure development. The costs associated with each of these activities depend on the nature and usage of the specific service FAA provides.

2. The FAA's safety activities include licensing pilots and mechanics, as well as inspecting various aspects of the aviation system. The costs associated with these safety activities are primarily driven by the volume of each, such as the number of licenses and inspections.

3. The FAA's ATC activities include guiding and controlling the flow of aircraft through the National Airspace System (NAS). Commercial aircraft fly under instrument flight rules (IFR) that require ATC services throughout a flight.

4. The FAA funds airport infrastructure development through the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which is a multibillion-dollar grant program. AIP expenditures are not the direct result of costs imposed by users of the NAS.

5. The Trust Fund was established by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA's two capital accounts, AIP and the Facilities and Equipment account.

6. The Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through dedicated excise taxes, including a 7.5 percent ticket tax on domestic airline tickets. Trust Fund revenues totaled $10.7 billion in fiscal year 2005.

7. The current funding system for the FAA has raised concerns about revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency. The principle of revenue adequacy requires a funding system to produce revenues commensurate with workload changes over time.

8. Alternative funding options for the FAA include modifying the current excise tax structure, adopting more direct charges to users, and using a combination of workload-related taxes or charges to fund FAA. A combination of options, such as en-route charges to fund en-route costs and certification charges to fund safety costs, might best address concerns with the current system.

9. The use of debt financing for FAA capital projects has both advantages and disadvantages. Debt financing could provide a stable source of revenue to fund capital development, but it also encumbers future resources and raises issues associated with borrowing costs.

10. The federal government's long-term fiscal imbalance raises concerns about borrowing costs and the need for sound justification and careful consideration before adopting any program or policy change.

4. Incinerators used to clean Superfund sites are generally ""transportable,"" meaning they are transported to the site in pieces, assembled, and removed when the cleanup is complete, and are constructed and operated by contractors.
5. EPA relies on four principal methods to ensure the safe operation of incinerators used to clean up Superfund sites, including setting site-specific standards for emissions and operations, incorporating safety features into an incinerator's emergency systems, monitoring emissions, and providing 24-hour on-site oversight.
6. At the three Superfund sites visited, incinerators had built-in safety features unique to each model to prevent excessive emissions of contaminants in the event of an emergency shutdown, and EPA continuously monitors the air in the vicinity of an incinerator to ensure that emissions do not exceed maximum permitted levels.
7. EPA planned two additional methods to promote the safe operation of Superfund incinerators, including issuing a directive requiring inspectors to evaluate Superfund incinerators and systematically ensuring that lessons learned about an incinerator's operations are applied to subsequent projects.
8. However, EPA has not followed through on these plans, and inspections of Superfund incinerators have not taken place, in part due to the lack of a consolidated list of requirements and the higher priority given to other enforcement demands.

The SEC's internal control over financial reporting was found to be ineffective due to a material weakness in the period-end financial reporting process, disgorgements and penalties accounts receivable, accounting for transaction fee revenue, and preparing financial statement disclosures. The SEC's process for calculating its accounts receivable for disgorgements and penalties presents a high risk that significant errors could occur and not be detected. The SEC's information security program has not been fully implemented, resulting in significant deficiencies in internal control over information systems and data.

1. The U.S. Postal Service had about 765,000 career employees at the end of fiscal year 1997, with the largest group being craft employees. The Service structure includes headquarters, 11 areas, and 85 performance clusters, with cluster-level employees making up about 96 percent of the Service workforce. The EAS workforce consists primarily of employees in EAS 11 through 26 positions, with EAS management-level positions beginning at EAS 16. At the end of fiscal year 1997, EAS positions totaled 80,238, or about 10 percent of total Service career-level employees.

2. The Service created its Diversity Development Department in 1992 to foster an all-inclusive business environment and actively support the recruitment, retention, and upward mobility of women and minorities. The Department is responsible for promoting diversity and inclusion within the Service. The Service's 1999 Annual Performance Plan includes achieving a diverse workforce as one of its goals. The Postal Service Board of Governors commissioned Aguirre International to undertake a 6-month study of workforce diversity at the Postal Service.

3. The Aguirre report stated that the Service was a leader in meeting affirmative action goals and striving for parity between its workforce and the CLF. However, women and minorities appeared to be experiencing problems advancing to management jobs at EAS 17 and above positions. The Board of Governors directed the Service to develop an action plan for dealing with the diversity issues raised by Aguirre. The Service developed an action plan and briefed the Board on the plan in April 1998.

4. The Service's diversity initiatives include 23 initiatives aimed at improving its diversity program and addressing the concerns raised by Aguirre. The Service reported that it had completed implementation of nine of the initiatives and was on schedule for completing the remaining initiatives. The Service organized its 23 diversity initiatives into six functional groups, including articulating a clear diversity message and ensuring the representation of all employee groups in all levels of Postal Service employment. The Service is also in the process of establishing targets and measures to use in assessing its progress toward meeting its diversity goals and objectives.

5. The Service has not yet established and implemented targets and measures for tracking its progress in meeting its diversity goals and objectives. The Service has not fully captured or used EEO data on applicants as they progress, or do not progress, through the Service's promotion process. The Service has developed diversity goals and objectives, but it is not capturing reliable EEO data on promotion applicants' progress",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 20}"

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) defines a Military Working Dog (MWD) as any canine bred, procured, or acquired to meet DOD's requirements to support operations in the protection of installations, resources, and personnel. These requirements include explosive and illegal narcotic detection capabilities, patrol, tracking, and other requirements.

2. MWDs are removed from service when they can no longer perform their duties due to medical or behavior problems, when they are no longer needed by the military, or in other circumstances, such as when a handler dies in action. In 2000, a law commonly known as ""Robby's Law"" was enacted to promote the adoption of MWDs after their military service.

3. According to Robby's Law, the military shall make an MWD that is suitable for adoption available for adoption at the end of the dog's ""useful life"" or when the dog is no longer needed by the department. The law has been amended a number of times since first enacted, with the most recent amendment establishing priorities among the authorized recipients of MWDs that are removed from service.

4. The Army Veterinary Service has the lead responsibility for the medical care of all DOD-owned animals, including MWDs, and provides medical care for MWDs through its Public Health Command Regions and Activities and the DOD MWD Veterinary Service at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. The Army also maintains a veterinary care system that provides medical care to privately owned animals of individuals with access to medical services at a military installation.

5. The number of MWDs adopted, transferred, or euthanized has varied over the past 5 years, with the highest numbers in 2012 and 2013 due to a decreased need for MWDs during deployments. The prevalent medical conditions among adopted MWDs include skin, dental, and musculoskeletal issues, with the most common conditions being skin conditions or ear infections, dental disease or injury, arthritis or degenerative joint disease, and degenerative lumbo-sacral stenosis.

6. Adopted MWDs need preventative care regardless of their medical conditions, and the average age of most MWDs that had electronic medical records with master problem lists in ROVR and were adopted during 2014 and 2015 was about 9 years old. The chief of staff of a private network of veterinary hospitals in New Jersey provided estimated costs for preventative care procedures, which are specific to this private network of veterinary hospitals.

1. The Comanche program was established in 1983 to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet with a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing armed reconnaissance and attack missions.
2. The program experienced significant increases in program acquisition unit cost, with the estimated total program acquisition cost for the planned acquisition of 1,292 aircraft increasing from $61 billion in 1985 to over $44 billion in 1995.
3. The Army's restructuring of the Comanche program continues to pose risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will perform as required and higher program costs.
4. The Comanche will be the most computerized, software-intensive Army helicopter ever built, with an estimated 2.7 million lines of code required to perform and integrate mission-critical functions.
5. The program is experiencing technical problems, including software development issues, maintainability requirements not being met, and weight growth affecting vertical rate of climb performance.
6. The Army's maintenance concept for the Comanche program is predicated on two levels of maintenance—unit- and depot-level maintenance—to achieve operating and support savings predicted for the program.
7. The General Accounting Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Defense require the Army to complete operational testing to validate the Comanche's operational effectiveness and suitability before committing any funds to acquire long-lead production items or enter low-rate initial production.

1. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the principal federal agency responsible for programs in four areas: housing assistance, community development, housing finance, and regulatory issues. HUD provides housing assistance through public housing authorities and private-market housing assistance under section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The benefits of HUD's housing assistance programs are limited by budgetary constraints to only about one-fourth of those who are eligible.

2. HUD's fiscal year 2000 budget request includes 19 new initiatives and programs that were not funded during fiscal year 1999, with a total budget of about $28 billion in new discretionary budget authority. The request represents a 9-percent increase in budget authority over fiscal year 1999, and includes seven set-asides totaling $210 million. The set-asides will be funded within the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program and the HOME Program.

3. HUD's capacity to manage the increase in new programs and initiatives is a concern, as the Department is currently undergoing a significant organizational reform and has limited resources to plan, implement, and manage new programs. The reform aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HUD's operations, but may divert resources away from new initiatives. The Department's Inspector General has also cited weaknesses in HUD's contracting and procurement practices.

4. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has raised concerns about HUD's budget request, including the accuracy of the Section 8 housing assistance program's budget proposal and the use of unexpended balances to offset funding needs. The GAO also questioned the basis for the contract renewal costs for the Section 8 project-based program and the substantial increase in total Section 8 project-based and tenant-based outlays. The GAO recommended that HUD provide more information to support its assumptions and source data for the Section 8 program.

1. The Military Health System operated by DOD is large and complex, with a dual health care mission of readiness and benefits. The readiness mission provides medical services and support to the armed forces during contingency operations, while the benefits mission provides medical services and support to members of the armed forces and their families. DOD's health care mission is carried out directly through military medical centers, hospitals, and clinics throughout the United States and overseas.

2. The replacement medical center will serve as the only tertiary-level referral hospital for the EUCOM, Central Command, and Africa Command theaters of operation. Military treatment facilities are typically designed to offer sufficient health care for active duty beneficiaries and their dependents within a 40-mile radius of the military treatment facility. However, medical planners determined that the historical patterns of care indicated that the area for LRMC should be a 55-mile radius.

3. The four catchment areas, as defined by military medical planners, are based on populations of patients who are enrolled as beneficiaries or who are eligible to enroll for the following locations: the Kaiserslautern Military Community catchment area, the Germany-wide catchment area, the Europe Regional Medical Command catchment area, and the EUCOM catchment area. The Kaiserslautern Military Community catchment area includes all beneficiaries enrolled in LRMC, 86th MDG, and Kleber/Kaiserslautern military treatment facilities. This catchment area is approximately 55-miles in radius surrounding the proposed facility's site.

4. The replacement medical center is being sized for peacetime operations, not for contingency operations. However, these officials told us that the replacement medical center is being designed with the flexibility to expand capacity during surges to be able to handle casualties that result from contingency operations. DOD officials determined that the replacement medical center should be able to accommodate contingency operations' medical needs similar to those experienced in Fallujah, Iraq, during November 2004.

5. DOD officials used checklists and discussions with external health care providers to incorporate updated patient quality of care standards into the facility requirements for the replacement medical center. They also incorporated environmentally friendly design standards, such as optimizing the size and position of patient windows to provide exterior views for the patient from the bed. The replacement medical center's current design will likely qualify for a ""silver"" certification under the LEED system.

1. The Pew Research Center estimated the population of unauthorized aliens in the United States to be approximately 12 million as of March 2006. According to DHS, the population of aliens subject to removal from the United States has grown in recent years. DHS's Office of Immigration Statistics estimated that the population of aliens subject to removal has increased by half a million from January 2005 to January 2006. Additionally, DHS has estimated that the removable alien population grew by 24 percent from 8.5 million in January of 2000 to 10.5 million in January of 2005.

2. Aliens who are in violation of immigration laws are subject to removal from the United States. Over 100 violations of immigration law can serve as the basis for removal from the United States, including, among other things, criminal activity, health reasons, previous removal from the United States, and lack of proper documentation. ICE investigations resulted in 102,034 apprehensions, or about 8 percent of the approximately 1.3 million DHS apprehensions in 2005. Four main categories constituted the basis for aliens removed by DHS in 2005.

3. ICE officers exercise discretion throughout various phases of the alien apprehension and removal process, but the initial phases of the process involve the most discretion. Officers in OI and DRO field offices told us that they exercise discretion for aliens with humanitarian issues and aliens who are not investigation targets on a case-by-case basis with guidance and approval from supervisors. Officers told us they typically encounter aliens who are the target of an investigation and aliens who are not the target of an investigation but who are encountered through the course of an operation. While officers told us that discretion with regard to aliens who are fugitives, criminals, and other investigation targets is limited by clearly prescribed policies and procedures.

4. The alien apprehension and removal process encompasses six phases: initial encounter, apprehension, charging, detention, removal proceedings, and final removal. Our review of federal regulations, ICE policies, guidance, and interviews showed the parts of the removal process from the time officers encounter aliens as part of an operation to the time they determine whether to detain an alien involve the most discretion. During removal proceedings and final removal, ICE attorneys and DRO officers can exercise discretion only in clearly delineated situations prescribed by ICE policies and statutory and regulatory requirements. Officers told us that during the initial phases of the apprehension and removal process, they encounter situations that require them to pursue alternate ways to initiate removals.

1. Ground ambulance services are provided by a wide range of organizations with varying organizational structures, staffing types, transport types, and revenue sources. Medicare payments for ambulance services consist of two components: a service-level payment and a mileage payment. The service-level payment is based on the type of transport provided, while the mileage payment is determined by the number of miles traveled. The mileage payment is adjusted for rural and super-rural transports.

2. Providers may be affiliated with institutions or be independent and freestanding, and may be for-profit, nonprofit, or government-based. They may rely heavily on volunteers, use both volunteers and paid staff, or use only paid staff. Providers may specialize in nonemergency transports or offer both nonemergency and emergency transports. Some providers offer only basic life support (BLS) services, while others offer advanced life support (ALS) services.

3. ALS services require the skills of a medical technician who is more specialized and trained, such as a paramedic. Revenue sources for providers depend on community resources and choices about funding ambulance services. They may include community tax support, charitable donations, in-kind contributions, state and federal grants, subscription programs, and payments from Medicare or Medicaid. Private health insurance companies, including patient copayments or coinsurance, may also be a revenue source.

4. Medicare pays ambulance providers through a national fee schedule, with two components: a service-level payment and a mileage payment. The mileage payment is determined by the number of miles traveled with a patient during an ambulance transport and the mileage base rate. Since 2002, CMS has increased the rural mileage rate by 50 percent for miles 1 through 17. The mileage payment is adjusted for rural and super-rural transports.

5. Providers paid under a fee schedule generally have an incentive to keep their costs at or below the fee schedule rate. Some providers rely heavily on Medicare revenues, and adequate Medicare margins may help ensure access to ambulance services. Providers with lower transport volumes tend to have higher costs per transport due to high fixed costs for maintaining readiness. Other significant factors affecting cost per transport include volunteer staff hours, percentage of Medicare transports that are BLS, and percentage of Medicare transports that are super-rural.

6. Providers’ costs for providing ground ambulance transports were highly variable in 2010, ranging from $224 to $2,204 per transport. The median cost per transport was $429, with 5 percent of providers having costs less than $253 and 5 percent having costs more than $924.

418,"1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has a department-wide office responsible for leading the development of DOD supply chain policies, including the management of SRC I ammunition. The Army has a prominent role in managing SRC I ammunition, as it procures a majority of the department's ammunition and provides wholesale storage for other military services. Army depots ship SRC I ammunition owned by other military services to their respective locations at their request. The Army also conducts semiannual physical inventories of all SRC I ammunition as required of all installations storing SRC I ammunition.

2. SRC I ammunition may be located in small quantities at retail locations, such as military service installations, bases, and ammunition supply points. Each military service has entities responsible for the accountability, physical inventory, and transportation of SRC I ammunition. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force collectively had approximately 226,000 SRC I missiles and rockets in the continental United States as of April 30, 2015. The military services have automated information systems for managing accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition.

3. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command tracks the movement of SRC I ammunition and coordinates responses to transportation issues while in transit. DODM 5100.76 sets forth DOD policy on the physical security of sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives (AA&E). The policy requires continuous program and policy oversight to ensure protection of AA&E within DOD. DOD components are required to track and conduct physical inventories of SRC I ammunition by serial number.

4. The military services have policy and guidance on how to account for, safeguard, conduct physical inventories, adjust if necessary, track, and ship SRC I ammunition within and between services and to contractors for repair. The department is in the final stages of evaluating various automated information systems, including NLAC, to be designated as the DOD-wide authoritative source of data for conventional ammunition. The evaluation is in response to a congressional mandate to issue department-wide guidance by September 2015. The designated visibility system will serve as a repository of ammunition data collected through regular data feeds from the military services' automated information systems.

5. The military services have maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition at 11 sampled locations in the continental United States. However, we identified gaps in some service-level guidance and procedures for how SRC I ammunition is accounted for across locations.

To carry out its missions, SSA collects and maintains personal information such as name, date of birth, address, and Social Security Numbers (SSNs). SSA is responsible for issuing SSNs and is the repository of information on individuals' wages and earnings. This information is used in tax administration and is reported by individuals on their federal income tax returns.

2. SSA has a long history of protecting individuals' privacy, and its disclosure policy is designed to protect the privacy rights of individuals to the fullest extent possible while permitting the exchange of records required to fulfill its administrative and program responsibilities. SSA's policy is more restrictive than the Privacy Act and the disclosure policies of most federal agencies. The agency's policy requires SSA officials to consider several factors before releasing individuals' personal information to law enforcement agencies. These factors include the nature of the alleged criminal activity, what information has been requested, and which agency has made the request.

3. SSA's disclosure policy allows the disclosure of information to law enforcement under certain conditions, including when the criminal activity involves fraud or other criminal activity in Social Security programs. SSA will provide information necessary to investigate or prosecute fraud or other criminal activity in Social Security programs. The agency may also disclose information to investigate and prosecute fraud and other criminal activity in similar benefit programs. SSA's policy is designed to protect the privacy of individuals and uphold the pledge of confidentiality made to the public.

1. The Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) was established in 1997 to support Medicare program integrity activities, and it has undergone significant changes since its inception. The program was created to address the need for a dedicated and stable amount of funding for program integrity activities. Prior to 1997, program integrity activities were subsumed under Medicare's general administrative budget and performed by insurance companies under contract with CMS. This led to certain problems, including constrained funding and reduced ability to conduct audits and review medical claims.

2. The MIP has provided funds to support various program integrity activities, including audits, medical review, secondary payer, benefit integrity, and provider education. The program has allocated funds to contractors to perform these activities, with the goal of promoting the integrity of the Medicare program. The contractors involved in MIP activities include fiscal intermediaries, carriers, PSCs, and Medicare administrative contractors (MACs). These contractors have been tasked with conducting various program integrity activities, including medical review, secondary payer operations, and provider education.

3. The MIP has undergone significant changes since its inception, including increases in funding and changes in the types of activities supported. The program has also seen changes in the contractors involved, with the introduction of MACs and the transfer of claims administration work to these contractors. The MIP has also been affected by the addition of the new Part D prescription drug benefit and the reform of Medicare contracting. These changes have presented new challenges for the program and have required CMS to adapt its approach to allocating MIP funds.

4. The MIP has faced challenges in allocating funds effectively, including the need to consider quantitative data and qualitative information on the relative effectiveness of program integrity activities. CMS has developed two new measures to evaluate the relative effectiveness of provider education and the audit activity, but the agency has expressed concerns about relying solely on ROI as a measure of effectiveness. The MIP has also faced challenges in allocating funds to contractors based on workload and risk, but CMS has noted that contracting reform and the introduction of MACs will result in contractors' workloads being more evenly distributed. The agency has also expressed a commitment to identifying and investigating better approaches to allocate resources to support critical agency functions.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been working to enhance the training of screeners and supervisors to improve the effectiveness of passenger and checked baggage screening operations. TSA has implemented a basic screener training program and required remedial training, but has not fully developed or deployed a recurrent training program for screeners or supervisors. The agency has also collected limited data to measure screener performance.

2. TSA has taken steps to address the challenges in providing access to recurrent training, including factoring training requirements into workforce planning efforts and distributing training through written materials and CD-ROMs. However, the agency does not have a plan for prioritizing and scheduling the deployment of high-speed connectivity to all airport training facilities once funding is available. This lack of a plan limits TSA's ability to make prudent decisions about how to move forward with deploying connectivity.

3. TSA has improved its efforts to measure and enhance screener performance, but these efforts have primarily focused on passenger screening rather than checked baggage screening. The agency has established performance measures, indexes, and targets for the passenger and checked baggage screening systems, but has not established targets for the various components of the screening indexes. Without these targets, TSA will have difficulty performing meaningful analyses of the parts that add up to the index.

4. To address the challenges in providing ongoing training and ensuring that screeners receive required training, TSA should develop a plan that prioritizes and schedules the deployment of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity to all airport training facilities. The agency should also develop internal controls, such as specific directives, clearly defining responsibilities for monitoring and documenting the completion of required training. This will help provide TSA management with reasonable assurance that all screeners are receiving required passenger and checked baggage screener training.

Ginnie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that plays a crucial role in the secondary mortgage market, providing guarantees for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by government-insured or guaranteed loans. These guarantees help to make government-backed loans more accessible and affordable for low- to moderate-income borrowers. By providing a stable and liquid market for MBS, Ginnie Mae helps to promote the availability of credit for homeownership.

2. Despite its importance, Ginnie Mae's market share has declined significantly over the past 20 years, from 54% in 1985 to 10% in 2004. This decline is largely due to the rapid growth of the conventional MBS market, which has become more attractive to investors. As a result, Ginnie Mae's share of the overall MBS market has decreased, but it still remains a dominant player in the government-backed loan market.

3. Ginnie Mae faces several challenges in fulfilling its mission, including the need to respond to changes in the marketplace and meet the needs of its stakeholders. The agency has taken steps to address these challenges, such as expanding its product offerings and improving its data systems. However, Ginnie Mae still faces challenges in ensuring that its staff have the training, qualifications, and capabilities they need to oversee contractors and manage internal operations effectively.

1. The Internet has grown significantly in importance to American businesses and consumers, serving as the host for hundreds of billions of dollars of commerce each year. It is also a critical resource supporting vital services, such as power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense. The Internet relies on the domain name system to ensure the uniqueness of each e-mail and Web site address. The domain name system is governed by a set of rules that determine which top-level domains are recognized by most computers connected to the Internet.

2. The U.S. government supported the implementation of the domain name system for nearly a decade, largely through a Department of Defense contract. Following a 1997 presidential directive, the Department of Commerce began a process for transitioning the technical responsibility for the domain name system to the private sector. In June 1998, the Department issued a general statement of policy, known as the ""White Paper,"" which stated that the U.S. government was committed to a transition that would allow the private sector to take leadership for the management of the domain name system. The White Paper designated the stability and security of the Internet as the top priority of the transition.

3. ICANN has made significant progress in carrying out MOU tasks related to increasing competition, but progress has been slower on activities designed to address the other guiding principles. ICANN's president concluded that ICANN faced serious problems in accomplishing the transition and needed fundamental reform. ICANN's Board established an internal committee to recommend options for reform, and the committee recommended creating a new at-large supporting organization to select Board members through regional elections. The Department of Commerce has been involved in the transition process, but its public comments on the progress of the transition have been general in nature and infrequent.

1. The federal government has held funds in trust for Indian tribes since 1820, with the General Allotment Act of 1887 and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 playing significant roles in shaping the current trust management system.
2. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) was established to oversee the trust management reform, with a focus on improving the accuracy and completeness of trust data and implementing a comprehensive trust management system.
3. OST has made significant progress in implementing trust reforms, including the development of the Trust Funds Accounting System (TFAS), the Trust Beneficiary Call Center, and the Trust Portal, but still faces challenges in completing the remaining reforms.
4. The Special Trustee has not provided a timetable for completing the remaining trust reforms, as required by the 1994 Act, which has hindered congressional oversight and planning for trust fund operations.
5. OST has relied heavily on contractors to perform trust reform activities, with nearly 21 percent of its appropriated funds going to contracting in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, but has faced issues with preferential treatment of certain contractors.
6. The Special Trustee has received a retention allowance and several major awards, including a Presidential Rank Award, but the average performance award amounts for OST's SES managers were generally lower than those of other bureaus and offices within Interior and other federal agencies.
7. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Special Trustee to provide a timetable for completing the trust fund management reforms, develop a plan for future trust fund operations, and reexamine staffing levels and funding needs once reforms are completed.

1. In 1998, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) began a joint effort to develop a comprehensive, life-long medical record for each service member, which led to the creation of the Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR) project.
2. The GCPR project aimed to create an electronic interface that would allow physicians and other authorized users at VA and DOD health facilities to access data from each other's health information systems.
3. In 2001 and 2002, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) made recommendations to strengthen the management and oversight of the project, including designating a lead entity and creating comprehensive and coordinated plans.
4. The VA and DOD revised their strategy and renamed the project the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) program, which enabled the one-way transfer of data from DOD's health information system to a separate database that VA clinicians could access.
5. By 2004, the FHIE program was fully operational, and VA providers at all VA medical centers and clinics nationwide had access to data on separated service members, with a repository containing historical clinical health data on 2.3 million unique patients.
6. The VA and DOD are working on a longer-term goal to achieve a virtual medical record based on the two-way exchange of computable data between their health information systems, with the cornerstone being the planned electronic interface between the data repositories for the new systems, known as CHDR.
7. Despite progress made, the VA and DOD still face significant challenges in developing a project management plan that specifies the authority and responsibility of organizational units, work breakdown structure, and security policy, which could lead to further delays in their schedule and investment in a capability that could fall short of expectations.

1. There are two approaches for reorganizing or terminating a large financial company: judicial bankruptcy process and special legal and regulatory resolution regimes. The judicial bankruptcy process is a federal court procedure that helps individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts they cannot repay.

2. Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure that aims to help individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts they cannot repay and help creditors receive some payment in an equitable manner. The filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay, stopping most lawsuits, foreclosures, and other collection activities against the debtor.

3. The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities, including bankruptcy courts, the Judicial Conference of the United States, and the Department of Justice's U.S. Trustee Program. These entities work together to oversee bankruptcy cases and ensure the integrity and efficiency of the bankruptcy system.

4. Large, complex financial companies that are eligible to file for bankruptcy generally file under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This chapter allows debtors to continue some or all of their operations subject to court supervision as a way to satisfy creditor claims.

5. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy process involves several stages, including first-day motions, disclosure, and plan of reorganization. The plan of reorganization describes how the debtor intends to reorganize and treat its creditors, and the court may confirm the plan if it is fair to all impaired creditors.

6. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code does not restrict the federal government from providing debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to a firm in bankruptcy, and in certain cases, it has provided such funding. The authority to make new financial commitments under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) terminated on October 3, 2010.

7. The Federal Reserve may design emergency lending programs or facilities for the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system, but it may not establish an emergency lending program or facility for the purpose of assisting a single and specific company to avoid bankruptcy. The automatic stay generally preserves assets and prevents creditors from taking company assets in payment of debts before a case is resolved.

8. The safe-harbor provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allow most counterparties that entered into a qualifying transaction with the debtor to exercise certain contractual rights even if doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay. These provisions apply to derivative financial products, such as forward contracts and swap agreements.

1. The electricity industry is composed of four distinct functions: generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations. Once electricity is generated, it is sent through high-voltage transmission lines to local distributors, who transform it into a lower voltage and send it through distribution lines for consumption. The operation of an electric power system requires constant balancing of generation and consumption of power.

2. Utilities own and operate electricity assets, including generation plants, transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations, which contain technical equipment to ensure smooth and safe flow of current. System operators manage the electricity flows, using control systems to monitor and control sensitive processes and physical functions. These control systems are highly dependent on effective functioning for the electricity industry.

3. The electricity industry has matured, and technology has advanced, leading utilities to update the electricity grid by integrating new technologies and additional IT systems and networks. This vision, known as the smart grid, aims to increase the use of IT systems and networks and two-way communication to automate actions. The smart grid would facilitate alternative forms of generation, including renewable energy, and give consumers real-time information about fluctuating energy costs.

4. The use of smart grid systems may have several benefits, including improved reliability, downward pressure on electricity rates, and an improved ability to use alternative sources of energy. Utilities and manufacturers are working to implement smart grid technologies, but there are still challenges to overcome. The federal government and state governments have authority for overseeing the electricity industry.

5. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates for wholesale electricity sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, while state public utility commissions regulate local distribution and retail sales of electricity. State and federal authorities also play key roles in overseeing the reliability of the electric grid. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is the federally designated U.S. Electric Reliability Organization.

6. NERC has responsibility for conducting reliability assessments and developing and enforcing mandatory standards to ensure the reliability of the bulk power system. NERC develops reliability standards collaboratively through a deliberative process involving utilities and others in the industry. FERC reviews and approves these standards or directs NERC to modify them.

7. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established federal policy to support the modernization of the electricity grid and required actions by several federal agencies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and FERC. NIST was to coordinate development of a framework for smart grid interoperability, including protocols and model standards for information management.

1. The federal workforce faces significant mission-critical skills gaps, which pose a high risk to the nation and hinder the government's ability to cost-effectively serve the public and achieve results. These gaps can be attributed to various factors, including an insufficient number of people or a lack of appropriate skills or abilities to accomplish mission-critical work.

2. Current budget and long-term fiscal pressures, the changing nature of federal work, and a potential wave of employee retirements threaten to aggravate the problems created by existing skills gaps. According to OPM data, more than 34 percent of federal employees on-board by the end of fiscal year 2015 will be eligible to retire by 2020.

3. The federal government's pay system does not align well with modern compensation principles, where pay decisions are based on the skills, knowledge, and performance of employees as well as the local labor market. Congress has provided various agencies with exemptions from the current system to give them more flexibility in setting pay.

4. The GS classification system has not kept pace with the government's evolving requirements, and a modern, effective classification system should have eight key attributes, including a focus on a set of values and objectives to guide the pay system. These attributes provide a useful framework for considering refinements or reforms to the current system.

5. The federal hiring process needs to be applicant-friendly, flexible, and consistent with statutory requirements, such as hiring on the basis of merit. OPM and agencies should analyze the effectiveness of hiring authorities to identify opportunities to refine, eliminate, or expand authorities as needed.

6. Effective performance management is crucial for agencies to establish a clear ""line of sight"" between individual performance and organizational success. Supervisors play a key role in the success of any performance management system, and agencies should promote people into supervisory positions based on their supervisory skills.

7. The human resources specialist occupation is one of six government-wide, mission-critical skills gap areas identified by OPM. Capacity shortfalls in an agency's personnel office can adversely impact an organization's mission, as seen in the case of the Veterans Health Administration.

8. OPM has taken steps to improve the capacity of human resource specialists, including increasing registration in its Human Resources University and validating career path guides. However, more work is needed to strengthen the human capital infrastructure within agencies.

1. The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) costs are primarily funded through two accounts: military personnel and operation and maintenance. About 90 percent of the costs associated with GWOT fall into these two accounts.

2. Military personnel funds cover the pay and allowances of mobilized reservists, as well as special payments or allowances for all qualifying military personnel. Operation and maintenance funds are used for various purposes, including transportation, unit operating support costs, and intelligence, communications, and logistics support.

3. Estimating the cost of ongoing military operations is difficult due to operational requirements that can differ substantially from what was assumed in preparing budget estimates. This can result in operations costing more or less than originally estimated.

4. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses transfer authority to shift funds between appropriation accounts, and reprogramming authority to shift funds within an account. DOD can reprogram funds within an account as long as the funds are used for the same general purpose of the appropriation.

5. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received about $52.4 billion and $62.1 billion, respectively, in supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses. The Army, Air Force, and Navy also received funds for GWOT through their annual appropriations.

6. DOD and the military services have lost visibility over the funds provided through annual appropriations, including knowing how much was used to support GWOT in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The services have also lost visibility over the Program Budget Decision 736 funds after fiscal year 2003.

7. The military services have taken several actions to cover the gaps between reported obligations and supplemental appropriations, including transferring funds and reducing or deferring planned spending for peacetime operations. These actions have reduced DOD's flexibility to cover potential gaps in fiscal year 2005.

8. The Army, Air Force, and Navy received additional funds in their annual appropriations through Program Budget Decision 736, totaling about $7.9 billion in fiscal year 2004 and about $7.6 billion in fiscal year 2005. However, the services have lost visibility over these funds and do not know whether any of them were used in support of GWOT.

2. Government buyers usually pay a fee for using other agencies' GWACs, MACs, and schedule contracts, which are typically a percentage of the value of the procurement.
3. Large departments, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), are turning to enterprisewide contracts to acquire goods and services, leveraging their purchasing power.
4. Enterprisewide contracts are similar to interagency contracts but generally do not allow purchases from the contract outside of the original acquiring activity.
5. The federal government spent at least $60 billion through GWACs, MACs, the MAS program, and enterprisewide contracts in fiscal year 2008 to buy goods and services to support their operations.
6. The MAS program is still the primary governmentwide buying program aimed at helping the federal government leverage its significant buying power when buying commercial goods and services.
7. However, OMB and agencies lack reliable and comprehensive data to effectively leverage, manage, and oversee these contracts, which can lead to duplication of effort and increased costs.

1. The baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is maturing and will soon begin moving from traditional working ages to retirement ages, leading to significant changes in the labor force. The first wave of boomers will start turning 65 in 2011, and the last will be 65 in 2029. This will lead to a rise in the aged dependency ratio, which measures the number of workers available to support each retiree.

2. The aged dependency ratio was 21 percent in 2000, but it is expected to rise to 35 percent by 2030, meaning there will be fewer than three workers of traditional working age for every person 65 or older. This increase is not only due to the growing number of older persons but also the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers. The labor force under 55 grew at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent from 1950 to 1990, but this rate slowed to 1.0 percent from 1990 to 2000 and is expected to slow further.

3. Social Security retirement policy changes could strengthen incentives to work longer, such as eliminating the reduction of benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age. The delayed retirement credit for persons who first claim benefits after the normal retirement age is also being increased. Some members of Congress have proposed raising the normal retirement age for benefits beyond the current schedule of increases.

4. The number of older workers will grow substantially over the next two decades, and they will become an increasingly significant proportion of all workers. Older workers are employed in a diverse group of occupations, but are a growing proportion of the workers in white-collar occupations. According to projections, the number of older workers will grow rapidly over the next two decades, with 31.8 million older labor force participants expected in 2015.

5. Older workers will also become a larger percentage of all workers, with 20 percent of the total workforce expected to be over 55 by 2015. The composition of the older workforce will shift further from blue-collar to white-collar occupations in the near future. Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of workers age 55 to 74 in managerial/administrative and professional/technical occupations will increase by 2.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.

1. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was created by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and was permanently established in 2000. The program allows citizens of participating countries to travel to the United States without a visa for business or tourism purposes.

2. The VWP has expanded to 36 countries since its inception, with the most recent additions being countries that offer reciprocal visa-free travel privileges to U.S. citizens. To qualify for the VWP, a country must meet certain requirements, including having a low visa refusal rate and issuing machine-readable passports.

3. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibility for establishing visa policy, including VWP policy, from the Justice Department to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS created the Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit in 2004 to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating countries' adherence to program requirements.

4. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 increased the frequency of mandated assessments of the effect of each country's continued participation in the VWP on U.S. security, law enforcement, and immigration interests. The 9/11 Act also added security requirements for all VWP countries, including the requirement to share information on lost or stolen passports.

5. To travel under the VWP, nationals of participating countries must have received an authorization to travel through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and meet certain requirements, including having a valid passport and not overstaying their 90-day limit. Travelers who do not meet these requirements must obtain a visa from a U.S. embassy or consulate.

6. ESTA was implemented in 2008 to enhance program security and minimize the burden on travelers. The system electronically collects VWP applicants' biographical information and responses to eligibility questions, and DHS uses this information to determine eligibility for entry into the United States.

1. The state child welfare systems consist of a complicated network of policies and programs designed to protect children, but the systems' ability to keep pace with the needs of troubled children and their families has been greatly taxed due to growing caseloads over the past decade. From fiscal year 1984 through 1995, the foster care population grew from an estimated 276,000 children to 494,000.

2. The federal government plays an important role in financing foster care and establishes minimum procedural requirements for the placement process, with states required to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes. Once a child is removed from the home, the state must also provide services to the family and the child with the goal of reuniting them.

3. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires states to develop a case plan for each child, which must be reviewed at least every 6 months, and a permanency hearing must be held within 18 months to determine the future status of the child. If a final decision is not made at this hearing, federal law provides that additional hearings must be held at least every 12 months.

4. Some states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing, with 26 states requiring the hearing within 12 months or less, and 24 states and the District of Columbia having statutes consistent with the federal requirement of 18 months. Colorado requires that the permanency hearing be held within 6 months for children under age 6.

5. States have implemented various operational and procedural changes to expedite and improve the permanency process, including low-cost, creative methods for financing and providing services that address specific barriers to reuniting families. Arizona's Housing Assistance Program, for example, focused on families in which the major barrier to reunification was inadequate housing for the family.

6. Some states have placed special emphasis on expediting the process by which parental rights could be terminated, with Arizona's Severance Project and Kentucky's project to shorten the process for terminating parental rights being examples. These projects have resulted in significant reductions in the average length of stay between entering care and the filing of the termination petition.

7. States are experimenting with concurrent planning, which involves working toward reuniting a family while developing an alternate plan for permanently removing the child if reunification efforts fail. This approach has been shown to result in quicker permanent placements for children.

1. The DATA Act, signed into law on May 9, 2014, expanded on previous federal transparency legislation by requiring the disclosure of federal agency expenditures and linking agency spending information to federal program activities. The act requires government-wide reporting on a greater variety of federal funds, such as budget and financial information, as well as tracking of these funds at multiple points in the federal spending lifecycle.

2. The DATA Act requires that agency-reported award and financial information comply with new data standards established by OMB and Treasury, which specify the items to be reported under the act and define and describe what is to be included in each element. These standards aim to ensure that information will be consistent and comparable.

3. OMB has taken a number of steps to help agencies meet their reporting requirements, including establishing 57 standardized data element definitions for reporting federal spending information and issuing guidance to operationalize selected standards and clarify agency reporting requirements. OMB has also met with agencies to assess their readiness to meet the reporting requirements under the act.

4. The DATA Act requires agencies to submit three files sourced from their financial management systems to the DATA Act broker, which will extract award and sub-award information from existing award reporting systems. The broker will then provide data to Treasury to be displayed on USASpending.gov or a successor site.

5. The DATA Act also requires agencies' IGs and GAO to assess and report on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of spending data submitted by federal agencies. The first IG reports were due to Congress in November 2016, but agencies are not required to submit spending data in compliance with the act until May 2017.

6. The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) developed an approach to address the IG reporting date anomaly and maintain early IG engagement with the agencies. CIGIE encouraged but did not require the IGs to undertake assessments of their respective agencies' readiness to submit spending data in accordance with DATA Act requirements.

1. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has an agreement with the Administrative Resource Center (ARC) to provide contracting support for a fee, as OSC does not have in-house contracting staff. This agreement is a mechanism for interagency contracting, which involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order, and the contractors providing the goods and services. The OSC's primary mission is to protect federal employees from prohibited personnel practices.

2. The OSC's agreement with ARC is a fee-for-service procurement process, where the agency requiring a good or service determines the goods or services needed and prepares a statement of work, if applicable. The contracting officer at the ordering agency ensures that the contract or order is properly awarded or issued, including any required competition, and administered under applicable regulations and agency requirements. If contract performance will be ongoing, a contracting officer's representative is designated to monitor the contractor's performance.

3. The OSC contracted with MPRI for an organizational assessment, but several required steps were not taken, including competition among Schedule vendors and a convincing demonstration of why a sole-source order was necessary. The sole-source justification listed other factors, such as insufficient time and no contractor's current expertise to meet government requirements, but did not contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify a sole-source order. The justification also did not provide the minimum required information.

4. The OSC officials performed duties normally done by contracting officer's representatives without authorization or training and performed other duties that should have been reserved for the contracting officer. The contracting officer's responsibilities include ensuring that the government monitors the contractor's performance, and the contracting officer may designate a contracting officer's representative in the requiring agency to act as the contracting officer's technical expert and representative. The contracting officer's representative is responsible for monitoring the contractor's performance and serving as the liaison between the contracting officer and the contractor.

1. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a mission to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans by ensuring they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. The VA is the second-largest federal department, with a central office in Washington, D.C., and field offices throughout the United States, U.S. territories, and the Philippines. The department's three major components are the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA).

2. The VA relies on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits, working in various facilities, including 167 medical centers, 800 community-based outpatient clinics, and 131 national and 90 state or tribal cemeteries. The department operates and maintains an IT infrastructure to support its mission, providing data storage, transmission, and communications requirements. The infrastructure is critical to ensuring the delivery of reliable, available, and responsive support to all VA staff offices and administration customers, as well as veterans.

3. The VA operates approximately 240 information systems, manages 314,000 desktop computers and 30,000 laptops, and administers nearly 460,000 network user accounts for employees and contractors. These systems are used for various services, including the determination of benefits, benefits claims processing, patient admission to hospitals and clinics, and access to health records. The VA's IT systems are essential to supporting the department in delivering health care to veterans.

4. The VA has several old systems, including the Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system, which is 53 years old, and the Benefits Delivery Network (BDN) system, which is 51 years old. These systems are in need of modernization or replacement, and the VA plans to retire them in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The VA has a strategic plan to modernize its IT systems and improve access to benefits and services for veterans.

5. The VA's IT budget for fiscal year 2015 was approximately $3.9 billion, with $548 million spent on new systems development efforts, $2.3 billion on maintaining existing systems, and $1 billion on payroll and administration. For fiscal year 2016, the department received appropriations of about $4.1 billion for IT, and for fiscal year 2017, the department's budget request included nearly $4.3 billion for IT.

1. The Medicare program, managed by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), serves about 33 million beneficiaries and processes a high volume of claims, with an estimated 900 million in fiscal year 1997. HCFA is responsible for paying and monitoring more than 400 managed care health plans that serve over 5 million beneficiaries.

2. The Medicare statute divides benefits into two parts: hospital insurance (part A) and supplementary medical insurance (part B), with part A covering inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, and certain home health care services. Part B covers physician and outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, and ambulance and other medical services and supplies.

3. HCFA has slightly less than 4,000 full-time employees, with 65 percent working in the agency's headquarters offices and the rest in regional offices across the country. The agency oversees more than 60 claims processing contractors that employ an estimated 22,200 people.

4. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) grant HCFA substantial authority and responsibility to reform Medicare, addressing concerns about fraud and abuse. HIPAA enhances Medicare's anti-fraud-and-abuse activities, while BBA introduces new health plan options and major payment reforms.

5. HCFA is rethinking its strategy to develop, modernize, or improve its automated claims processing and information systems, preparing for the year 2000 and making necessary modifications to existing systems. The agency plans to make these changes as an interim measure until comprehensive reengineering can take place.

6. HCFA is facing transition problems resulting from the recent loss of large-volume claims processing contractors and the need for remaining contractors to absorb the workload. The agency has restructured its organizational units to better focus on its mission, but is experiencing disruptions common to organizational transitions.

7. Managers at HCFA expressed concerns about the distribution of agency resources, the need for specialized expertise, the loss of institutional experience, and reorganization issues. They noted that the quality of other work might be compromised due to the concentrated efforts to implement BBA and solve computer problems.

8. HCFA lacks a method for estimating the amount of improper Medicare payments, with the HHS Inspector General estimating that HCFA made about $23 billion in inappropriate payments in fiscal year 1996. Managers also expressed a common concern about the staff's mix and level of skills, citing the need for staff with specialized technical expertise to implement recent reforms exp",1,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is primarily supported by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from excise taxes paid by users of the National Airspace System (NAS), and General Fund revenues. In fiscal year 2006, $2.6 billion was appropriated from the General Fund for FAA's operations, representing about 18 percent of FAA's total appropriation.

2. The administration's reauthorization proposal aims to change FAA's financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges, with funding for the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) coming primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft. The proposal also creates an advisory board and gives FAA limited borrowing authority.

3. The proposed funding structure has raised concerns about the soundness of FAA's cost allocation system and its ability to link revenues and costs, with some critics arguing that the current system does not accurately reflect the costs imposed by different types of aircraft on the NAS. The proposal also raises questions about the influence that NAS users would have on fee setting and the impact that an advisory board would have on congressional oversight.

1. The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for ensuring federal agencies have access to telecommunications services and solutions needed to meet mission requirements. The GSA's Federal Technology Service, in conjunction with the Interagency Management Council (IMC), aims to provide the best service and price for the government while maximizing competition for services. The current program, FTS2001, has two goals: to ensure the best service and price for the government, and to maximize competition for services.

2. The GSA awarded two contracts for long-distance services to Sprint in December 1998 and MCI WorldCom in January 1999, with each firm guaranteed minimum revenues of $750 million over the life of the contracts. The contracts run for four base years and have four 1-year-extension options, with all contract options expected to expire in December 2006 and January 2007, respectively. Federal agencies spent approximately $614 million on FTS2001 services during fiscal year 2003 alone.

3. The GSA is planning its FTS Networx acquisition program, which includes the awarding of new governmentwide contracts for a broad range of long-distance and international voice and data communications services, wireless services, and satellite telecommunications services. The Networx acquisition program aims to replace the existing FTS2001, Federal Wireless Telecommunications Service, and FTS Satellite Service contracts. The program has five goals, including meeting agency needs, obtaining best value, encouraging competition, responding to the changing marketplace, and providing opportunities for small businesses.

4. The Networx program calls for two acquisitions: Networx Universal and Networx Select. Networx Universal seeks to ensure the continuity of services and prices found under expiring contracts that provide broad-ranging service with global geographic coverage. GSA expects all Networx Universal offerors to provide a full range of voice and data network services, managed networking services and solutions, and network access, wireless, and satellite communications services.

5. GSA plans to award multiple contracts for a more geographically limited set of services under Networx Select, which will provide agencies with leading-edge services and solutions with less extensive geographic and service coverage than that required by Networx Universal. The details of pricing structures and Select service delivery mechanisms will be provided in the Networx Select request for proposals, which GSA intends to release in the summer of 2005. GSA anticipates awarding both the Networx Universal and the Networx Select contracts well before the expiration",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21}"

1. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) program, established as a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) in 1998, manages and administers student financial assistance programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. FSA's performance plan discusses its three strategic goals: increasing customer and employee satisfaction, reducing unit costs, and integrating information systems. However, the plan could be more useful to congressional decision makers with respect to systems integration and program integrity.

2. FSA has made progress in improving customer and employee satisfaction, with scores on the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and Gallup Q12 increasing from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2001. However, FSA's unit cost measure has limitations, as it does not include all program obligations and has changed its method for calculating it, making it difficult to discern whether changes in the measure are indicative of changes in total program costs. FSA's current calculation of unit cost is also a change from the way it calculated it in the past.

3. FSA's performance plan has several limitations, including a lack of clear goals and strategies for systems integration and program integrity. FSA has devised an enterprise-wide systems architecture and initiated a new approach to provide users with a more complete and integrated view of information contained in multiple databases. However, FSA's implementation of the middleware technology remains in its early stages, and it needs to properly implement and manage its strategy.

4. FSA has taken steps to develop its human capital, including reorganizing its operations, hiring senior managers accountable for specific strategic goals, and encouraging accountability among all employees. However, gaps remain in FSA's overall human capital approach, including a lack of a formal plan to address pending retirements and a failure to implement a performance management system. FSA's relationship with its union has also made implementation of many of these initiatives difficult.

1. As of September 30, 2010, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) made over 21,500 grant awards using Recovery Act funds. These grants were made to three categories and varied in size, geographic distribution, duration, and research methods. The NIH used standard review processes and criteria to award the grants.

2. The Recovery Act required that the funds be obligated by NIH within a 2-year window, specifically in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. OMB guidance requires recipients of Recovery Act funding to report on the number of jobs supported by the Recovery Act on a quarterly basis. This reporting is done through a nationwide data collection system.

3. The NIH collects information about the FTEs supported by Recovery Act funding from the www.federalreporting.gov Web site and from annual progress reports submitted by grantees. Grantees also submit information about the jobs supported by Recovery Act funding through payroll records and effort reporting systems. The NIH uses this information to track the number of FTEs supported by Recovery Act funding.

4. According to NIH officials, Recovery Act funds could eventually support a total of approximately 54,000 FTEs. This estimate is based on the quarterly expenditure of funds reported by grantee institutions and the projected number of FTEs that NIH expects to support over the life of the Recovery Act. The NIH expects that the Star Metrics program will provide additional information about the number and types of jobs funded by the Recovery Act.

5. The NIH has processes in place for reporting the use of Recovery Act funds, and HHS assesses the quality of reports filed by NIH Recovery Act grantees. The NIH also participates in the development of a multiagency collaboration called Star Metrics to track the employment, scientific, and economic impacts of its funded research projects. The Star Metrics program is expected to release preliminary results regarding jobs in 2012.

6. The NIH gathers information from principal investigators working on priority research areas and prepares publicly available reports about the potential scientific impacts of NIH-funded research. The NIH Institutes and Centers select the topics featured in these reports based on the importance of the topic area, the level of funding provided, and the level of public interest. The reports are known as Investment Reports.

1. Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a compact, mixed-use, and walkable neighborhood located near transit, with a typical distance of up to a half-mile from a transit station. TOD can range in size and scope, from major urban centers to suburban neighborhoods. Transportation experts believe that TOD can increase access to employment, education, and other opportunities by promoting transportation options to households. This can lead to increased transit ridership and reduced road congestion.

2. The planning and implementation of TOD involve various stakeholders, including local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, local governments, regional councils, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts. These stakeholders play important roles in building, maintaining, and operating transit systems, developing transportation plans, and reviewing and granting entitlements for new development projects. Local governments and regional councils have control over land use planning, including zoning policies and growth management policies. Private developers decide on and create developments and build and manage housing units and commercial developments.

3. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD, but it does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, the agency has been expanding its role in TOD by funding research, coordinating with other federal agencies, and implementing a TOD planning pilot program. The FTA also evaluates proposed projects for potential New Starts funding, considering factors such as mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and economic development effects. The agency assesses the local government's financial commitment and the transit agency's ability to operate the project.

4. The success of TOD depends on various factors, including market demand for real estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, and efficient access to jobs and centers of activity. Market demand for real estate is driven by the strength of the local economy, and cities with strong local economies are more likely to support TOD. Large parcels of land available for development, such as surface parking lots or underutilized industrial land, can also support TOD. Resident support for transit and TOD is also crucial, with cities having a high concentration of people aged 18-34 years old tend to be more supportive of TOD.

5. Local governments can use various policies to encourage TOD, including zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. These policies can help improve developer certainty, facilitate more certainty for developers proposing projects near transit stations, and make projects more economically feasible. Responsiveness to local residents' preferences and market demand is also essential, with policies designed to encourage TOD being most successful when they align",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been sending the Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) to eligible workers since 1988, with the goal of providing accurate earnings records and benefit estimates.
2. The SSA plans to mail PEBES statements automatically to over 70 million workers by fiscal year 2000, with a projected cost of $80 million.
3. The PEBES benefit estimates are based on certain assumptions about an individual's future employment and earnings, but do not take into account special circumstances that could affect a worker's actual retirement benefit.
4. The SSA has conducted several surveys and focus groups to assess the public's reaction to receiving an unsolicited PEBES, with overall public reaction being consistently favorable.
5. However, the current PEBES statement still provides too much information, which may overwhelm the reader, and presents the information in a way that undermines its usefulness.
6. The SSA has not collected detailed information from its front-line workers on the public's response to the PEBES, and has missed key opportunities to improve the statement.
7. The SSA is considering a redesign of the PEBES for fiscal year 1999, but is focusing on reducing printing costs without considering all of the factors that would ensure the statement is cost-effective.

1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two programs that provide benefits for individuals with disabilities: Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs use the same definition of disability for initial entitlement, but differ in their requirements and work incentive provisions. DI was established in 1956 as an insurance program to replace earnings lost due to disability, while SSI was established in 1972 to provide a standard minimum level of income for individuals with disabilities.

2. Concurrent beneficiaries, who receive benefits from both DI and SSI, face challenges in understanding the complex interaction of the two programs and making informed decisions about work. SSA's current procedures and guidance do not adequately address the needs of concurrent beneficiaries, leading to potential overpayments and underpayments. To improve service to concurrent beneficiaries, SSA should develop procedures and integrated guidance to ensure information about work activity is collected and shared between the DI and SSI programs.

1. Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast region in 2005, causing human casualties and billions of dollars in damage, and the Stafford Act authorized the federal government to assist in saving lives and reducing human suffering. The federal government provided nearly $88 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for relief and recovery efforts related to the Gulf Coast hurricanes.

2. FEMA, the DHS component responsible for administering the Stafford Act, used appropriations made to the Disaster Relief Fund to assist relief and recovery efforts, with $60 billion allocated for the Disaster Relief Fund in September 2005. FEMA reported that it had obligated about $25 billion, or 42 percent, of the $60 billion it had received as of late December 2005.

3. FEMA has authority under the Stafford Act to issue mission assignments to other federal agencies, directing them to support overall federal operations pursuant to or in anticipation of a Stafford Act declaration. Mission assignments provide the recipient agency with reimbursable budgetary authority to perform the agreed-upon work.

4. FEMA's weekly reports to the Congress have limited usefulness from a governmentwide perspective due to a lack of mechanisms in place to collect and report on information from other agencies performing work on its behalf through mission assignments. FEMA's reports do not provide timely information on the use of hurricane relief and recovery funds from a governmentwide perspective.

5. FEMA's reported obligations and expenditures for mission assignments do not reflect the actual status from a governmentwide perspective due to timing differences and lack of documentation from performing agencies. FEMA's reported expenditures are less than actual expenditures made by performing agencies, resulting in understated governmentwide expenditures.

6. The federal government lacks a framework or mechanisms in place to collect and consolidate information from the 23 federal agencies that received funding for hurricane relief efforts and report on this information. Each agency is responsible for tracking its own funds, but no mechanisms are in place to consolidate this information.

7. To improve the information on the status of hurricane relief and recovery funds, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the Director of FEMA to take four actions, including explaining how FEMA's reported obligations and expenditures do not reflect the status from a governmentwide perspective and requesting actual obligation and expenditure data from agencies performing mission assignments. We also recommend that the Director, Office of Management and Budget, establish a framework for governmentwide reporting on the status of hurricane-related funding.

1. Program evaluations are systematic studies that use research methods to address specific questions about program performance, and they can provide a valuable supplement to ongoing performance reporting by measuring results that are too difficult or expensive to assess annually. Evaluations can be designed to better isolate the causal impact of programs from other external economic or environmental conditions in order to assess a program's effectiveness. In our 2013 survey of federal managers, we found that most federal managers reported lacking recent evaluations of their programs.

2. The key elements of national or organizational capacity to conduct and use evaluation in decision making include an enabling environment that has leadership support for using evidence in decision making, organizational resources to support the supply and use of credible evaluations, and the robust, transparent availability of evaluation results. Our 2014 survey of PIOs on the presence of these elements in their agencies found uneven levels of evaluation expertise, organizational support within and outside the organization, and use across the government. About half the 24 agencies reported committing resources to obtain credible evaluation by establishing a central office responsible for evaluation.

3. To help ensure that federal agencies obtain the evidence needed to address the most important questions to improve program implementation and performance, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget direct each of the 24 Chief Financial Officer Act agencies to prepare an annual agency-wide evaluation plan that describes the key questions for each significant evaluation study that the agency plans to begin in the next fiscal year. This plan should be shared with congressional committees, federal, state and local program partners, researchers, and other stakeholders. By doing so, agencies can target their scarce research and evaluation resources to their most important issues and shape budget and policy priorities and management practices.

Federal efforts aim to promote the employment of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce and help agencies carry out their responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act. Special hiring authorities, such as Schedule A excepted service hiring authority, are provided for people with disabilities.

2. Executive Order 13548 requires federal agencies to develop plans for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities and designate a senior-level official to be accountable for meeting the goals of the order. OPM and Labor have oversight responsibilities to ensure the successful implementation of the executive order. The executive order also requires OPM to develop mandatory training programs on the employment of people with disabilities for human resources personnel and hiring managers.

3. The federal government tracks the number of individuals with disabilities in the workforce through OPM's Standard Form 256, Self-Disclosure of Disability (SF-256). However, the accuracy of the SF-256 data is unknown, and agency officials and advocates for people with disabilities believe there is an undercount of employees with disabilities. The underreporting of disability status may be due to concerns about discrimination or lack of awareness about the importance of disclosure.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a mission to manage public lands and resources to best serve the needs of the American people, with 210 state, district, and resource area offices managing about 270 million acres of public lands. BLM's fiscal year 1995 appropriation totaled $1.24 billion.

2. BLM develops land-use plans to balance multiple uses and competing demands, including ecosystem management, timber harvesting, mining, oil and gas production, watershed management, wildlife management, and recreation. It also designates and maintains land of critical environmental concern.

3. BLM maintains over 1 billion documents, including land surveys and surveyor notes, tract books, land patents, mining claims, oil and gas leases, and land and mineral case files. Many of these paper documents are deteriorating, and some are illegible.

4. BLM recognized the need to automate its manual records and case processing activities due to a peak in the number of applications for oil and gas leases in the early 1980s. The Bureau began planning to acquire an automated land and mineral case processing system (ALMRS).

5. The ALMRS/Modernization project was initially estimated to cost $880 million, but was scaled down to $575 million due to high costs. The project was reduced to three major components: ALMRS Initial Operating Capability (ALMRS IOC), Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and modernization of BLM's computer and telecommunications infrastructure.

6. BLM has completed most of the initial installation of computer and telecommunications equipment and has met most of its ALMRS IOC, GCDB, and rehost milestones thus far. However, the project schedule could slip due to little time available to deal with unexpected problems.

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an independent organization affiliated with the United Nations, with governing bodies including the General Conference and the Board of Governors. The Board of Governors provides overall policy direction and oversight, with the United States being a permanent member. The IAEA derives its authority from its statute, the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and regional nonproliferation treaties. The agency's authority is also based on bilateral commitments between states and project agreements with states.

2. The IAEA has been subject to review by signatory states every 5 years since the NPT came into force in 1970. The 1995 NPT Review and Extension conference extended the life of the treaty indefinitely, and the latest review conference occurred in May 2005. Article III of the NPT binds non-nuclear weapon states to conclude an agreement with IAEA that applies safeguards to all source and special nuclear material. The five nuclear weapons states that are parties to the NPT are not obligated by the NPT to accept IAEA safeguards.

3. India, Israel, and Pakistan are not parties to the NPT or other regional nonproliferation treaties, and are known to have nuclear weapons programs. North Korea joined the NPT in 1985 and briefly accepted safeguards in 1992 and 1993, but expelled inspectors and threatened to withdraw from the NPT when IAEA inspections uncovered evidence of undeclared plutonium production. The IAEA's safeguards objectives are to account for the amount of a specific type of material necessary to produce a nuclear weapon. The agency attempts to meet these objectives by using a set of activities to verify that nuclear material subject to safeguards is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes.

4. The IAEA uses material-accounting measures to verify quantities of nuclear material declared to the agency and any changes in the quantities over time. Containment measures are used to control access to and the movement of nuclear material. The agency deploys surveillance devices, such as video cameras, to detect the movements of nuclear material and discourage tampering with IAEA's containment measures. The IAEA has taken steps to strengthen safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program.

5. The IAEA has begun to develop the capability to independently evaluate all aspects of a country's nuclear activities. The first strengthened safeguards steps increased the agency's ability to monitor declared and undeclared activities at nuclear facilities.

1. The public faces a high risk of critical services disruption due to the Year 2000 computing crisis, which could affect financial transactions, flights, power, and national defense. The crisis is caused by the inability of computer systems to handle the year 2000 date change, leading to potential failures in key economic sectors such as information and telecommunications, banking and finance, and health and emergency services. The federal government and private sector are working to address the issue, but progress has been slow, and many agencies are behind schedule. The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion was established to oversee the government's efforts.

2. The government's efforts to address the Year 2000 problem are hindered by a lack of clear priorities, inadequate contingency planning, and insufficient testing. Many agencies have not established priorities for fixing systems, and business continuity and contingency planning have been inadequate. The Office of Management and Budget's assessment of the current status of federal Year 2000 progress is based on agency reports that have not been consistently reviewed or verified. To address these issues, the General Accounting Office has made several recommendations to the Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, including establishing governmentwide priorities and ensuring that agencies develop contingency plans for all critical core business processes.

1. The Information Quality Act (IQA) was enacted in 2001 to ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated by federal agencies. The act requires agencies to develop guidelines for ensuring the quality of information and to establish administrative mechanisms for correcting information errors.

2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was responsible for developing governmentwide IQA guidelines and assisting agencies in meeting the act's requirements. OMB issued guidelines that explained what agencies were to do to ensure the development and public dissemination of quality information.

3. Agencies were required to post their IQA guidelines and related information on their Web sites, but many agencies failed to do so, and even when they did, the information was often difficult to access. OMB and OIRA subsequently issued additional directives to facilitate public access to government information and the process to request correction of erroneous public information.

4. The implementation of IQA has resulted in a significant decline in the number of IQA requests, from over 24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004, due in part to agencies excluding simple or administrative errors from IQA correction mechanisms. However, the remaining requests were often substantive and required considerable time and staff resources to address.

2. Banks generally use their deposits to make loans or invest in debt securities, while mutual funds invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks.
3. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with corporations increasingly tapping the securities markets for their financial needs.
4. Securitization, a process through which securities issuance supplants bank credit as a source of finance, has further diminished the importance of bank loans.
5. The growth of mutual funds has attracted sizable amounts of money that otherwise might have been placed in bank deposits, with the amount of money in mutual funds rising by almost $1.2 trillion since 1989.
6. Despite this, some observers dispute the magnitude of the impact of mutual funds on deposits, with one study claiming that mutual fund inflows do not depend on outflows from the banking system.
7. The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds has had little to no effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy.
8. Mutual funds have further advanced the securitization process, with their investments in securities becoming a greater source of new finance to the economy than bank lending.

The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 was passed by Congress on June 12, 2002, requiring specific activities related to bioterrorism preparedness and response. The Act aims to improve the nation's preparedness for bioterrorism and other public health emergencies by increasing coordination and planning. The Secretary of HHS is required to provide for the establishment of an integrated system or systems of public health alert communications and surveillance networks. This system is intended to allow for secure and timely sharing and discussion of essential information concerning bioterrorism and other public health emergencies.

PHIN aims to provide the nation with integrated public health information systems to counter national civilian public health threats. The PHIN architecture defines and documents the systems needed to support public health, identifies industry standards, and develops specifications necessary to make these standards work. PHIN has substantial size and scope, intended to serve as a comprehensive architecture, information exchange network, and set of services.

3. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has primary responsibility for conducting national disease surveillance and developing epidemiological and laboratory tools to enhance surveillance of disease. CDC provides an array of technical and financial support for state infectious disease surveillance and has implemented several major public health IT initiatives, including PHIN. The PHIN initiative includes applications at various stages of implementation, but it remains years away from fully achieving its planned improvement to the public health IT infrastructure.

For example, 81 percent of responding sponsors reported that they modified the formulas of one or more of their DB plans. The key reasons for these changes varied depending on whether the plans covered bargaining unit employees or nonbargaining employees.

2. The survey also found that employers are likely to make changes to their pension offerings in the future, with 50 percent of respondents indicating that adding or expanding automatic enrollment features to 401(k)-type DC plans was likely or very likely. Additionally, 45 percent of respondents indicated that changing the investment policy for at least one DB plan to increase the portion of the plan's portfolio invested in fixed income assets was likely or very likely. These changes may be influenced by changes in pension law and other factors.

3. The survey results suggest that the DB system is facing significant challenges, with many employers decreasing or eliminating the firm's share of health care costs for future retirees. The need to match or maintain parity with competitor's benefits package was a key reason cited for making these changes. The survey also found that only a few respondents reported that offering DB or DC plans was less important than offering a retiree health plan for purposes of firm recruitment and retention.

1. A refugee is defined as a person who is outside their country and unable or unwilling to return due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. The Refugee Act of 1980 provided a systematic and permanent procedure for admitting refugees to the United States. The Act maintains comprehensive and uniform provisions to resettle refugees as quickly as possible and to encourage them to become self-sufficient.

2. The federal government gives private, voluntary agencies responsibility to determine where refugees will live in the United States, with approval from the Department of State. Refugees are assigned first to a national voluntary agency and then the voluntary agency decides where the refugee will live. The nine national voluntary agencies meet weekly to allocate individual refugees based on an annual evaluation of the communities' capacity to serve refugees.

3. In the last 10 years, refugees have come to the United States from an increasing number of countries, and the issues associated with these diverse populations have become more complex. Many refugees today arrive after having lived in refugee camps for years, and may have little formal education or work experience, or untreated medical or mental health conditions. Receiving communities have needed to adjust their language capabilities and services in order to respond to the changing needs of these diverse refugee populations.

4. Three federal agencies are involved in the refugee resettlement process: the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). DHS approves refugees for admission to the United States, while PRM is responsible for processing refugees overseas and providing funding for services to meet their immediate needs. ORR provides temporary resettlement assistance to refugees and funds cash and medical assistance as well as social services to help refugees become economically self-sufficient.

5. The number of refugees resettled in the United States varies from year to year, sometimes due to security concerns. The federal government determines the maximum number of refugees the United States may admit for resettlement in a given year, but the actual number resettled is typically below this maximum. The federal government gives private, voluntary agencies responsibility to determine where refugees will live in the United States, with approval from the Department of State.

6. Voluntary agencies consider a variety of factors when they propose the number of refugees to be resettled in each community, including their own internal capacity and the capacity of the community.

1. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 established the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as an alternative to providing direct assistance after floods, with FEMA responsible for its oversight and management.
2. NFIP provides government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses, but currently does not charge all program participants rates that reflect the full risk of flooding to their properties.
3. To address this issue, increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss, including catastrophic losses, could result in premium rates that more fully reflected the actual risk of loss and decrease costs for taxpayers.
4. However, eliminating subsidized and grandfathered rates and increasing rates overall would increase costs to some homeowners, who might then cancel their flood policies or elect not to buy them at all.
5. Another way to limit costs to taxpayers is to decrease the risk of losses by undertaking mitigation efforts that could reduce the extent of damage from flooding, such as elevation, relocation, and demolition.
6. Expanding participation in NFIP would help ensure that losses from flood damage did not become the responsibility of the taxpayer, but would require careful implementation to avoid increasing the concentration of high-risk properties in the program.
7. To address the financial and operational issues of NFIP, Congress and FEMA need to take action to address fundamental operational and managerial issues, such as improving strategic planning, human capital planning, and information technology.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees mutual funds primarily through its Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), Division of Investment Management, and Division of Enforcement. These offices examine mutual funds to evaluate their compliance with federal securities laws and determine if they are operating in accordance with disclosures made to investors.

2. The SEC regulates mutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Investment Company Act was passed specifically to regulate mutual funds and other types of investment companies.

3. The SEC has made significant changes to its traditional examination approach, which generally focused on conducting routine examinations of all funds on an established schedule. The agency has reallocated or plans to reallocate its staff to conducting targeted examinations focusing on specific risks and monitoring larger funds on a continuous basis.

4. The SEC's revised examination approach offers the potential for the agency to more quickly identify emerging risks and better understand the operations of large and complex funds. However, due to the limited number of SEC's examination staff relative to the number of mutual funds and advisers for which the agency has oversight responsibility, the decision to focus examination resources on particular areas involves tradeoffs that raise regulatory challenges.

5. The SEC has integrated quality controls into its routine examinations but could benefit from additional controls to ensure that policies and procedures are being implemented effectively and consistently throughout SEC field offices. The agency could improve its quality control measures in three areas: supervisory review of risk scorecards, preparation of written examination plans, and review of completed examinations and work papers.

6. The SEC conducts examinations of broker-dealers shortly after they have been examined by self-regulatory organizations (SROs), but these examinations provide limited information on the adequacy of SRO oversight and impose duplicative regulatory costs on the securities industry. The agency has identified deficiencies in SRO examinations, including ones related to the SROs' examinations of mutual fund sales practices, and communicated those to the SRO to remedy the problem.

TVA is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

2. TVA's operations and planning involve forecasting demand for electricity, developing an integrated resource plan (IRP), and making resource planning decisions such as how much and what kind of capacity to build. TVA employs a set of models to forecast demand for electricity in its service area for the next 20 or more years.

3. TVA's debt ceiling has been increased four times from 1966 to 1979, from $750 million to $30 billion, but the debt ceiling has not been changed since 1979. TVA's business and operations have grown along with the power needs of the Tennessee Valley, and the agency has continued to add generating capacity to the system.

4. TVA aims to reduce its debt from about $26 billion in fiscal year 2016 to about $22 billion by fiscal year 2023, and plans to increase revenue through rate increases, limit the growth of operating expenses, and reduce capital expenditures. TVA's plans assume the completion of capital projects will occur on time and within budget.

5. TVA's unfunded pension liabilities have steadily increased over the past 10 years, and the agency aims to eliminate the $6 billion funding shortfall within 20 years. However, factors such as market conditions could affect TVA's progress, and no mechanism is in place to ensure the pension plan is fully funded.

The TVARS Rules do not adjust TVA's required contributions to ensure pension liabilities will be fully funded, and TVA plans to contribute no more than the rules require and to defer the remaining pension liability. We recommend that the Board of Directors ensure that TVA takes the following two actions: better document and communicate its goals to reduce its debt and unfunded pension liabilities in its performance plans and reports, and propose, and work with the TVARS board to adopt, funding rules designed to ensure the plan's full funding.

1. The First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc. was a major lender in the energy industry in the Southwest United States by the late 1970s, but it experienced financial difficulties in the early and mid-1980s due to the energy industry's financial struggles. By 1986, First City was reporting operating losses, and its regulators and the FDIC recognized that many of its subsidiary banks could not survive without major infusions of capital. The parties agreed that the capital needed for long-term viability could not come wholly from the private sector due to the financially strained condition of the Southwest's economy and banking industry.

2. In 1988, FDIC and First City entered into a recapitalization agreement, known as open bank assistance, which required First City to reduce its subsidiary banks from nearly 60 to about 20 and create a ""collecting bank"" to dispose of troubled assets. The agreement included a $970 million capital infusion from FDIC and $500 million of private capital raised by the new bank management to restore First City's financial health. FDIC received $970 million in preferred stock of the collecting bank and a guarantee for $100 million payable in 1998 toward the retirement of the collecting bank preferred stock.

3. The recapitalized First City banks embarked on an aggressive growth policy that resulted in assets increasing from about $10.9 billion to $13.9 billion, but problems with the quality of its loan portfolios caused operating losses and eroded First City's capital. A 1990 OCC examination report criticized the lending practices of First City's lead bank, and the bank made changes in senior executive management and entered into formal supervisory agreements with OCC. However, the bank's financial difficulties continued, and it incurred total losses of about $625 million between September 1990 and October 1992.

4. In 1991 and 1992, First City, OCC, and FDIC considered alternative resolution plans, including a Type A transaction where the banks would be acquired by a stronger institution, a Type B transaction where a major capital infusion would be provided by an outside investor, and a Type C transaction where First City would self-rescue through consolidation or sale of subsidiary banks. However, the Type A transaction was rejected by FDIC due to its estimated cost and the Type C transactions were deemed unviable.

The act required state and local governments that received at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance to have a single audit conducted for that year.

2. The Single Audit Act aimed to promote sound financial management, including effective internal control, and to reduce burdens on state and local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations. The act also required grantees to address material noncompliance and internal control weaknesses in a corrective action plan.

3. The quality of single audits conducted under the Single Audit Act has been a longstanding area of concern since the passage of the act in 1984. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the federal Inspectors General have found similar problems with single audit quality, including issues with insufficient evidence related to audit planning, internal control, and compliance testing.

The PCIE report recommended a three-pronged approach to reduce the types of deficiencies noted and improve the quality of single audits, including revising and improving single audit standards, criteria, and guidance. The report also recommended establishing minimum continuing professional education (CPE) as a prerequisite for auditors to be eligible to conduct and continue to perform single audits.

5. The GAO supports the recommendations made in the PCIE report and believes that actions must be taken to improve audit quality and the overall accountability provided through single audits for federal awards. The GAO also suggests considering size characteristics when implementing future actions to improve the effectiveness and quality of single audits as an accountability mechanism.

1. Medicare is a federal health insurance program designed to assist elderly and disabled beneficiaries, with hospital insurance (part A) covering inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and certain home health services. Supplemental medical insurance (part B) covers physician and outpatient hospital services, laboratory and other services. Claims are paid by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers.

2. The intermediaries and carriers are responsible for reviewing and paying claims, maintaining program safeguards to prevent inappropriate payment, and educating and responding to provider and beneficiary concerns. Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from that of most federal programs, as it does not require full and open competition for contracts. Instead, intermediaries are selected in a process called nomination by provider associations.

3. The nomination process was intended to encourage hospitals to participate by giving them some choice in their claims processor, but it has limited the pool of entities allowed to be contractors. Currently, there are three intermediary contracts, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which serves as the prime contractor for 26 local member plan subcontractors. When one of the local Blue plans declines to renew its subcontract, the Association nominates the replacement contractor.

4. Carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers, and the number of such companies seeking Medicare claims-processing work has been dwindling in recent years. The Social Security Act generally calls for the use of cost-based reimbursement contracts, which do not provide for profit. Medicare contractors cannot be terminated from the program unless they are first provided with an opportunity for a public hearing.

5. Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms, including freeing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities able to perform needed tasks. Allowing Medicare to have contractors specialize in specific functions rather than assume all claims-related activities could lead to greater efficiency and better performance. Authorizing Medicare to pay contractors based on how well they perform rather than simply reimbursing them for their costs could also result in better program management.

6. The program has used health insurers to process and pay claims since its inception in 1966, but the number of such companies willing to serve as Medicare contractors has declined, and the number of other entities capable of doing the work has increased. The need to broaden the pool of entities allowed to be contractors has increased in light of contractor attrition, which has left the program with fewer choices when one contractor withdraws or is terminated.

DOD recognizes that portions of its support structure are inefficient and continue to absorb a large share of the defense budget. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) requested that the Defense Science Board (DSB) identify DOD activities that the private sector could do more efficiently and determine the expected savings from outsourcing.

2. The DSB issued two reports in 1996 addressing outsourcing and other opportunities for reducing DOD support services. The first report focused solely on outsourcing and privatization issues, while the second report had a broader scope that included other methods for reducing infrastructure costs. The second report incorporated findings from the earlier report and provided a new vision for DOD's logistics support activities.

3. The DSB task force concluded that DOD could realize savings of 30 to 40 percent of logistics costs and achieve broad improvements in service delivery and responsiveness by outsourcing support services traditionally done by government personnel. The report cited evidence from the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) public-private competition studies of commercial and depot maintenance activities. The DSB task force stated that an aggressive DOD outsourcing initiative could generate savings ranging from $7 billion to $12 billion annually by fiscal year 2002.

4. Building on the earlier study, the DSB's second task force report provided a new vision wherein DOD would only provide warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy- and decision-making, and oversight activities. All other activities would be done by the private sector. The DSB said that DOD would need to make an investment of about $6 billion but would ultimately save about $30 billion annually by the year 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions.

5. The DSB estimates that the $6-billion savings represents an approximate 40-percent reduction in the $14 billion the Board estimated DOD spends annually for CONUS logistics activities. The data that is available indicates that DSB's estimate of $14 billion for CONUS logistics costs is conservative. For example, the Navy has reported that more than $8.5 billion of Navy resources was applied in fiscal year 1996 to maintenance programs in support of fleet ships and aircraft.

1. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) designed the National Research Program (NRP) to obtain new information about taxpayers' compliance with tax laws and to measure voluntary filing, reporting, and payment compliance.
2. The NRP sample consists of approximately 47,000 taxpayers with returns in the sample, and the majority of NRP efforts are devoted to obtaining accurate voluntary reporting compliance data.
3. The NRP reporting compliance study consists of three major processes: casebuilding, classification, and taxpayer audits, with the goal of minimizing the burden on taxpayers.
4. IRS plans to use NRP data to update return selection formulas, design prefiling programs, and focus its limited resources on the most significant areas of noncompliance.
5. The NRP classification process involves classifying returns into one of four categories: accepted as filed, accepted with adjustments, correspondence audit, and face-to-face audit.
6. IRS has implemented quality assurance measures to ensure the accuracy of NRP results, including regular reviews of classifiers' decisions and in-process and completed case reviews.
7. The NRP audit process includes quality assurance measures, such as data consistency checks, to verify that the information recorded by auditors agrees with the information from the tax returns.
8. IRS plans to survey taxpayers who receive NRP audits to assess their perceptions of the burden posed by those audits and to compare the results with those from enforcement audits.
9. The IRS is on track to meet its NRP goal of obtaining meaningful compliance data while minimizing the burden on taxpayers with returns in the NRP sample.

1. The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) has been planning the 2010 Census, which is a large and complex project with a scope, magnitude, and immutable deadlines. The Bureau's past experience has shown that thorough and comprehensive planning and preparation are crucial to the ultimate cost-effectiveness of any large, long-term project. The Bureau's current planning process has improved compared to its efforts for the 2000 Census, but certain information gaps remain. The Bureau's planning process still contains weak points that could undermine a cost-effective head count and make it more difficult to obtain the support of Congress and other stakeholders.

2. The Bureau's 2010 Census planning process lacks a substantial amount of supporting analysis, budgetary transparency, and other information, making it difficult for stakeholders to properly assess the feasibility of the Bureau's design and the extent to which it could lead to greater cost-effectiveness compared to alternative approaches. The Bureau's underlying budget assumptions are uncertain, and there are questions surrounding the Bureau's approach to the American Community Survey (ACS). The Bureau has not yet translated key goals into measurable, operational terms, which makes it difficult to evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative designs. The Bureau's lack of important performance data from the 2000 Census to inform 2010 decision making is also a concern.

3. The Bureau's three-legged stool strategy assumes that all three legs must work together to achieve its goals, but the failure of any one leg could compromise the other two, thereby requiring the Bureau to rely on the approach it used for the 2000 Census. The Bureau's risk assessment for the reengineering effort uses a consistent scoring system to assess the severity of the risks identified, but it does not provide extensive detail on the mitigation actions proposed. The Bureau's planning groups have incorporated a variety of lessons learned from the evaluations of the 2000 Census, but the Bureau still lacks data on the performance of key census activities. The Bureau's ability to build on the results of the 2000 Census could be hampered by the lack of data and information on the performance of key census activities.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has established a framework to ensure the privacy and security of Medicare beneficiaries' protected health information (PHI) when data on prescription drug use are used for purposes other than direct clinical care. This framework includes regulations, outreach, and enforcement activities to protect PHI.

2. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act provide the legal basis for HHS's framework, which includes the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. These rules establish standards for protecting PHI and require covered entities to implement safeguards to protect electronic PHI.

3. Electronic prescribing is one technology that can improve the quality of care and reduce healthcare costs, but it requires the transmission of PHI between healthcare providers and pharmacies. This transmission must be done in accordance with HIPAA regulations to protect PHI.

4. The HITECH Act requires HHS to educate the public about how PHI may be used and to provide guidance on implementing HIPAA requirements for de-identifying data. However, OCR has not issued required implementation guidance on de-identification methods.

5. OCR has established a process to enforce provisions of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules through investigations, but it has not fully established a capability to proactively monitor covered entities' compliance through periodic audits. This lack of a sustained audit capability limits OCR's assurance that covered entities are complying with HIPAA regulations.

6. The HITECH Act requires OCR to conduct periodic audits to ensure covered entities and business associates are complying with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and breach notification standards. However, OCR has not established plans for a sustained audit capability upon completion of its pilot program.

To improve HHS's guidance and oversight efforts, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of HHS direct the Director of the Office for Civil Rights to issue guidance on properly implementing the HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements for de-identification of protected health information and establish plans for conducting periodic audits to ensure compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. The GAO also recommends that OCR establish plans for conducting periodic audits to ensure compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and breach notification standards.

1. The Military Health Services System (MHSS) has a main mission of medical readiness, which requires providing medical support to active-duty military personnel and maintaining their health during peacetime. The MHSS has a budget of over $15 billion annually and employs uniformed health care providers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force to meet its medical readiness needs. The MHSS also supports the Department of Defense's (DOD) mission to care for non-active-duty beneficiaries, but purchases services from the civilian health care sector when resources are insufficient. The role of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in the MHSS is to provide mental health care to military personnel.

2. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists provide similar mental health services, including diagnosing and treating mental conditions with psychotherapy. However, psychiatrists require a medical degree and can prescribe medication, while clinical psychologists do not require medical training and cannot prescribe medication. The MHSS created the Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP) to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists and allow them to prescribe psychotropic medication. The PDP was established in response to a conference report in 1988 and was designed to train military psychologists to prescribe medication under certain circumstances.

3. The PDP was implemented in 1991 and consisted of a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship program, including 2 years of classroom training and 1 year of clinical experience. Participants received a certificate of ""Fellowship in Psychopharmacology for Psychologists"" and became known as ""prescribing psychologists."" The PDP was designed to provide clinical psychologists with the knowledge and skills necessary to safely and effectively prescribe psychotropic medication. However, the project faced several problems, including difficulty recruiting participants and delays in granting prescribing privileges.

4. The PDP was not clearly defined, and its goals and implementation were ambiguous. The project was structured and revised periodically without specifying the duties and responsibilities of prescribing psychologists, the types of clinical settings or facilities their skills would be best suited for, or the level of supervision they would require. The PDP Advisory Council recommended that prescribing psychologists should prescribe psychotropic medication only under the direct supervision of a physician. However, the MHSS has not decided who should supervise prescribing psychologists, and the project's implementation has been plagued by delays and disagreements.

1. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project is a complex and technologically advanced space telescope that is being developed by NASA to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope. The project is expected to launch in October 2018 and will be used to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the universe. JWST is being designed to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth and will have a 6.5-meter primary mirror.

2. The JWST project has experienced significant technical challenges and delays, including issues with the cryocooler, which is a critical component of the telescope that requires extremely cold temperatures to operate. The project has also faced challenges with the sunshield, which is a multi-layered tennis-court-sized structure that is designed to protect the telescope from the sun's heat. Despite these challenges, the project remains on schedule and is expected to meet its cost commitments.

3. The JWST project has a complex organizational structure, with multiple contractors and subcontractors working on different components of the telescope. The project is being managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, with Northrop Grumman serving as the prime contractor. The project has also received independent oversight from various groups, including the Standing Review Board and the Independent Verification and Validation facility.

4. The JWST project has made significant progress in recent years, with the completion of several major integration and test periods. However, the project still faces significant technical risks and challenges, including the need to resolve issues with the cryocooler and sunshield. The project has also faced challenges with workforce management, with Northrop Grumman's workforce exceeding projections in recent years.

5. The JWST project has implemented various measures to improve its cost and schedule management, including the use of earned value management (EVM) data and risk-adjusted analyses. However, the project still faces challenges with data reliability, with anomalies in contractor-delivered EVM data being identified in recent years. The project has also received recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to improve its cost and schedule management practices.

1. The U.S. chemical facilities pose a significant risk to human health and the environment due to the potential for massive damage from terrorist attacks. Despite this risk, no comprehensive assessment of security at these facilities has been conducted.

2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates about 15,000 facilities under the Clean Air Act, which requires them to prepare a risk management plan (RMP) to prevent and prepare for accidental releases. These facilities fall within various industries and produce, use, or store a variety of products.

3. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has developed a plan to protect the chemical sector, which will establish a framework for reducing the overall vulnerability of the sector. The plan will include background information on the sector, a process for developing an inventory of chemical sector assets, and efforts to identify and assess chemical facilities' vulnerabilities.

4. DHS has initiated actions to identify the chemical sector's critical assets, prioritize facilities, develop and implement protective programs, and coordinate efforts with EPA and other federal agencies. The agency has also developed a new risk assessment methodology, RAMCAP, to compare and prioritize critical infrastructure assets.

5. Industry associations, such as the American Chemistry Council (ACC), have been active in promoting security among member companies, requiring them to assess their facilities' vulnerabilities and make security enhancements. However, the extent of participation in these voluntary initiatives is unclear.

6. Chemical industry officials face challenges in preparing facilities against a terrorist attack, including the cost of security improvements and the need for guidance on what level of security is adequate. Industry stakeholders also cited the lack of threat information and difficulty in conducting employee background checks as challenges.

7. Existing laws give DHS limited authority to address chemical sector security, and the agency lacks specific authority to require all high-risk facilities to assess their vulnerabilities and take corrective actions. DHS has concluded that its existing authorities do not allow it to effectively regulate chemical sector security.

8. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to give the federal government greater authority over chemical facility security, including bills that would require high-priority facilities to submit vulnerability assessments and security plans to DHS. These bills would also provide for civil penalties and administrative penalties for failure to comply with security requirements.

9. Some bills, such as S. 2486, would impose a general duty on chemical facility owners and operators to identify hazards and ensure the design, operation, and maintenance of safe facilities. The bill would also direct DHS to work with EPA and state and local agencies to identify high-priority chemical facilities.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) faces challenges in ensuring that privacy concerns are addressed early, are reassessed when key programmatic changes are made, and are thoroughly reflected in guidance on emerging technologies and uses of personal data. This is evident in various DHS programs, including data mining, airline passenger prescreening, use of data from commercial sources, and development of an information sharing environment.

2. To address these challenges, DHS needs to conduct privacy impact assessments (PIAs) and implement specific policies and guidelines that reflect the Fair Information Practices, such as limiting the collection of personal information and ensuring accountability for its use.

1. The Social Security program in the United States provides about $546 billion in benefits to over 49 million beneficiaries, with the majority being paid to retirees. However, it also provides benefits to nearly 7 million workers with disabilities and over 11 million dependents.

2. Social Security benefits often represent a significant source of income for recipients, with an average monthly benefit of $1,051 for retired workers, $995 for widows and widowers, and $979 for disabled workers. Despite being lower, these benefits are crucial for disabled workers and dependents who may face considerable hardships.

3. The Social Security program balances the goals of income adequacy and individual equity, ensuring that lower-income beneficiaries receive higher benefits relative to wages. This balance is achieved through a common formula used to calculate benefits for different types of recipients.

4. The program has expanded over the years to include benefits for dependents and disabled workers, with the first new type of benefits going to dependents in 1939 and disability insurance being established in 1956. These expansions were made to provide additional protections for workers and their families.

5. The Social Security program is financed primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis, with payroll tax contributions used to pay for current benefits. However, due to demographic changes, the program is expected to face cash deficits starting in 2017.

6. To restore long-term solvency, proposals have been made to reduce benefits, increase revenues, or introduce structural changes such as individual accounts. These reforms could affect DI and dependents' benefits, which may be challenging for beneficiaries who rely heavily on Social Security income.

7. Six reform elements have been considered to improve trust fund solvency, including longevity indexing, price indexing, and progressive price indexing. These elements would reduce benefits from currently scheduled levels for the majority of disabled workers and dependents.

8. The reform elements would reduce median lifetime benefits for disabled workers and dependents, with price indexing having the largest impact, reducing median lifetime benefits by more than 25 percent. Progressive price indexing would create the smallest reduction, with median lifetime benefits falling by 7 percent for disabled workers and 8 percent for dependents.

9. Protection options have been explored to mitigate the effects of benefit reductions, including full and partial exemptions, a super COLA, and increasing the family maximum. These options could be targeted to specific dependents, such as children and widow(er)s, and could be designed to protect the benefits of vulnerable populations.

The program provided various forms of assistance to financial institutions, including capital investments, loan guarantees, and asset purchases.

2. The TARP programs, including the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI), and Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP), have made significant progress in winding down, with some programs recovering more than the original amounts invested. However, others, such as AIFP, have incurred a lifetime cost.

In the United States, coal-fueled electricity generating units provide a large share of the electricity produced, with 1,309 units in 2012, accounting for 29% of the total net summer generating capacity. Historically, coal-fueled generating units have provided about half of the electricity produced in the United States.

2. The abundance of coal and its historically low cost have contributed to the dominance of coal-fueled electricity generating units in the United States. However, concerns over air pollution, water resources, and solid waste have led to the enactment of several environmental laws.

3. The Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act are among the environmental laws enacted to address concerns over air pollution, water resources, and solid waste. These laws have led to the development of regulations that affect coal-fueled units.

4. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed or finalized four key regulations that will affect coal-fueled units, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). These regulations have potentially significant implications for public health and the environment.

5. The CSAPR aims to reduce SO emissions by over half in covered states, reducing asthma and related human health impacts. The MATS regulation aims to reduce mercury emissions by 75% from coal-fueled electricity generating units.

6. In addition to the four regulations, the EPA has proposed new regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating units. The proposed regulations include state-specific goals for carbon dioxide emissions and guidelines for states to follow.

7. The Department of Energy (DOE), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and EPA have taken initial steps to implement a formal, joint process to monitor industry progress in responding to EPA regulations. This process is necessary to monitor the complexity of implementation and extent of potential effects on price and reliability.

1. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) field offices do not systematically determine the eligibility of all estates kept open for more than 2 years, as regulations require. This lack of determination makes it difficult for FSA to identify estates being kept open primarily to receive payments and ensure that the payments are proper.

2. FSA regulations allow an estate to receive payments for the first 2 years after the death of the individual if the estate meets certain eligibility requirements for active engagement in farming. After 2 years, the estate can continue to receive program payments if it meets the active engagement in farming requirement and the local field office determines that the estate is not being kept open primarily to continue receiving program payments.

3. Our review of FSA case file documents found that FSA did not consistently make the required annual determinations. Only 39 of the 181 estates we reviewed received annual eligibility determinations for each year they were kept open beyond the initial 2 years.

4. FSA sometimes approved eligibility for payments when the estate had provided insufficient information, such as no information or vague information. In 20 of the 108 estates that received at least one eligibility determination, the minutes of FSA county committee meetings indicated approval of eligibility for payments to these estates, but the associated files did not contain any documents that explained why the estate remained active.

5. The extent to which FSA field offices make eligibility determinations varies from state to state, which suggests that FSA is not consistently implementing its eligibility rules. Overall, FSA field offices in 16 of the 26 states we reviewed made less than one-half of the required determinations of their estates from 1999 to 2005.

1. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized the Office of Management and Budget to designate six federal agencies to establish the franchise fund pilot program. The program aimed to provide common administrative services more efficiently than federal agencies' own personnel. Congress anticipated that the franchise funds would be able to provide services more efficiently, but this was not always the case. The original operating principles for franchise funds included offering services on a fully competitive basis and using a comprehensive set of performance measures to assess the quality of services.

2. The franchise funds, GovWorks and FedSource, are government-run, self-supporting businesslike enterprises managed by federal employees. They provide a variety of common administrative services, such as payroll processing, information technology support, and contracting services. The funds charge fees for services to cover their costs and are allowed to retain up to 4 percent of their total annual income. To recover their full costs, the franchise funds must provide services efficiently and effectively.

3. DOD primarily uses two franchise funds for contracting services, GovWorks and FedSource. GovWorks is operated by the Department of the Interior, and FedSource is operated by the Department of the Treasury. The funds provide contracting services to DOD customers, but they do not always follow sound contracting practices. The funds often rely on administrative personnel rather than contracting experts to review statements of work and choose appropriate contracting vehicles.

4. The franchise funds' business operating principles require that they maintain and evaluate cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors. However, they do not perform analyses that DOD could use to assess whether the franchise funds deliver good value. The funds focus on customer satisfaction and generating revenues rather than proper use of contracts and good value. This focus on customer satisfaction and generating revenues can lead to an inordinate focus on meeting customer demands at the expense of complying with contracting policy and required procedures.

1. Wildland fires play a crucial role in shaping the composition of forests and grasslands across the United States, but various land use and management practices have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many ecosystems, leading to abnormally dense vegetation that can fuel large or severe wildland fires. The changing climate conditions, including drier conditions in certain parts of the country, have increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons. For example, in the western United States, the average number of days in the fire season increased from approximately 200 in 1980 to approximately 300 in 2013. The U.S. Global Change Research Program's 2014 National Climate Assessment projected that western forests in the United States will be increasingly affected by large and intense fires that occur more frequently.

2. Federal agencies and nonfederal entities collaborate in various ways to reduce the risk of wildland fire before a potential wildland fire incident occurs, through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. Fuel reduction can occur through mechanical treatment or planned ignitions, which often replicate the positive effects of naturally occurring wildfire. Federal agencies have collaborated with nonfederal entities to prioritize, plan, and conduct fuel reduction activities, such as developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans. Federal agencies have also funded landscape-scale fuel reduction projects that span multiple jurisdictions and include multiple partners.

3. Improving implementation of the Cohesive Strategy, increasing collaborative planning, expanding education, and increasing prevention efforts are actions that federal officials and stakeholders said could help reduce wildland fire risk to communities. The Cohesive Strategy emphasizes the importance of coordination across entities and frames comprehensive national goals for mitigating the risk of wildland fire. However, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC) has not developed performance measures to assess the combined efforts of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. The Forest Service and Interior each have performance measures to monitor and assess their wildland fire management efforts, but those measures apply to the agencies individually and do not represent the set of national measures called for in the Cohesive Strategy.

4. Increasing state and local adoption of laws and ordinances that encourage fire-resistant building and the removal of potentially flammable vegetation around structures could help reduce wildland fire risk.

1. Pension plans invest in hedge funds and private equity to achieve returns superior to those attained in the stock market, but these investments pose several distinct challenges. Hedge funds offer investors relatively limited liquidity, and their investments can be difficult to value. Private equity funds require longer-term commitments of 10 years or more, and during that time, a plan may not be able to redeem its investments. Plans must provide committed capital when called upon by the fund manager, and may not redeem invested capital or typically see any return on the investment, for at least several years.

2. The federal government does not specifically limit or monitor private sector pension investments in hedge funds or private equity, and state approaches for public plans vary. ERISA requires that plan fiduciaries meet general standards of prudent investing but does not impose specific limits on investments in hedge funds or private equity. Labor annually collects information on private sector pension plan investments via the Form 5500, but the Form 5500 includes no category for hedge funds or private equity funds. States take a variety of approaches to overseeing and monitoring public pension plan investment, with some requiring plans to obtain approval before investing in hedge funds or private equity.

1. The U.S. territories of American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have some discretion in setting Medicaid and CHIP eligibility standards and provider payment rates, but their Medicaid and CHIP funding is subject to a statutory cap, unlike states. This cap limits the territories' ability to provide comprehensive Medicaid and CHIP coverage.

2. The territories face challenges in protecting their Medicaid and CHIP programs from fraud, waste, and abuse due to limited resources and a lack of program integrity efforts, and CMS has not required the territories to follow certain program requirements, such as complete service-level expenditure reporting and the establishment of a Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU). To address these issues, we recommend that CMS reexamine its program integrity strategy and develop a cost-effective approach to enhancing Medicaid program integrity in the territories.

1. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) established the Superfund program in 1980 to clean up highly contaminated hazardous waste sites, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administering the program.
2. As of November 1998, the Superfund program had investigated over 40,000 potential hazardous waste sites and made final decisions about whether to include almost 35,000 sites on the National Priorities List (NPL).
3. The EPA's CERCLIS database indicates that as of October 8, 1997, 3,036 sites were potentially eligible for the NPL on the basis of a combination of criteria, including a preliminary hazardous ranking system score of 28.5 or above.
4. Our surveys of officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states indicate that 1,789 of the 3,036 sites classified by EPA's database as awaiting a National Priorities List decision are potentially eligible for the list.
5. The 1,789 potentially eligible sites include 1,739 nonfederal sites and 50 federal facilities, with 686 sites having some cleanup activities conducted but the final cleanup remedy not yet under way.
6. Our surveys also indicate that some cleanup activities have occurred at 77 percent of the sites for which nearby residents are advised not to use wells and at 72 percent of the sites for which residents are advised to use bottled water.
7. State officials' assessments of their state's ability to fund cleanup activities at potentially eligible sites show that about a quarter of the responding states have an excellent or good financial capability, while more than half have a poor or very poor ability to fund cleanups.

1. Over the last two decades, the number of school-aged children with limited English proficiency in the United States has grown dramatically, increasing from less than 1 million in 1980 to more than 3.5 million in 1998. This growth has led to a significant increase in the enrollment of school-aged children with limited English proficiency across the country.

2. The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) was passed in 1968 to educate students with limited English proficiency, and its 1994 reauthorization created four bilingual education grant programs to distribute funds directly to school districts serving these students. These programs are the only federal programs that specifically target instructional services to children with limited English proficiency.

3. The four bilingual education grant programs are Program Development and Implementation Grants (PDI), Program Enhancement Projects (Enhancement), Comprehensive School Grants (Comprehensive), and Systemwide Improvement Grants (Systemwide). These programs share the same performance goals and measures, possess similar eligibility criteria, and allow similar uses of program funds.

4. The programs target students with limited English proficiency in kindergarten through 12th grade and aim to provide bilingual or special alternative education programs to help these students reach high academic standards. Student achievement is measured biannually to determine if they have demonstrated continuous progress in oral and written English, as well as in language arts, reading, and math.

5. The effectiveness of the four bilingual education programs on a national level is unknown due to the lack of comparable data, as locally collected data are not standardized. Grantees are required to submit evaluations every 2 years, but the evaluations are not comparable among grantees or nationally.

6. Consolidating the four bilingual education programs into one program may provide benefits other than cost savings to the Department of Education, such as reducing the administrative burden experienced by school districts applying for multiple program grants. This consolidation may also allow Education officials to reallocate some of their time to other important program-related activities.

7. The Department of Education officials believe that consolidating the four bilingual education programs has merit and has already taken steps to reduce overlap among the programs. They also support consolidating the four programs into one, which is consistent with the President's budget proposal.

8. The four bilingual education programs included in this review overlap in many significant ways, and our current and past work has shown that overlap can create an environment in which programs do not serve participants as efficiently as possible.

1. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a computerized criminal justice information system maintained by the FBI that serves as a repository of data on crimes and criminals of nationwide interest. It contains approximately 85,820 active records in its missing persons file as of January 1, 2011.

2. NCIC is managed cooperatively by the FBI's CJIS and state and local agencies that access the system, with an Advisory Process consisting of an Advisory Policy Board and working groups to establish policy and provide advice on CJIS Division programs. The Board creates ad hoc subcommittees as necessary to review policies and develop alternatives or recommendations.

3. Local level governance of NCIC use is performed by the CSA, a criminal justice agency responsible for the administration and usage of NCIC, including providing quality assurance and training and assuring LEA compliance with operating procedures. Most CSAs are state agencies that oversee NCIC use by all LEAs that enter data into NCIC in the state.

4. CJIS shares with the CSAs the responsibility for monitoring compliance with NCIC policy, including triennial audits of each CSA to assess compliance with NCIC policies, including the 2-hour entry requirement. CJIS's NCIC performance-based audit program tasks the CJIS Audit Unit with conducting a compliance audit of each CSA.

5. The purpose of the audit is to assess CSA compliance with NCIC system policy requirements, assess the quality, integrity, and security of the data maintained in and accessed from various criminal justice information systems and networks, and ensure timely and relevant criminal justice information is made available to authorized users. The audit consists of a pre-audit questionnaire, on-site visit, and follow-up report.

6. CJIS officials stated that if CJIS finds that 10 percent or more of missing children records reviewed are out of compliance, CJIS would make an audit recommendation requiring the CSA to take actions to address non-compliance. The officials also said that CJIS provides and discusses all findings from its LEA reviews with the cognizant LEAs.

7. The two predominant reasons given for the delay in NCIC entry were LEA personnel not knowing about the 2-hour entry requirement and responding officers not providing the information on the missing child in a timely manner. CJIS officials also said that in cases where CJIS auditors could not find documentation of the date and time that the minimum data required for NCIC entry were obtained, they deemed the entry to be untimely.

1. In the United States, automobiles are associated with nearly 29,000 traffic fatalities annually, including the deaths of both automobile occupants and others involved in collisions with automobiles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has the lead role in federal government efforts to reduce the number of traffic crashes and to minimize their consequences. Some types of automobiles have higher fatality rates than others, but it is difficult to conclude that some types of cars or drivers are more dangerous than others due to the relationship between driver and automobile characteristics.

2. The goal of this report is to isolate the independent effects of important crash-related factors on the likelihood of injury in a collision, focusing on the most important predictors of occupant injury in a collision: crash type and crash severity, automobile size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender. The report is concerned with both crashworthiness (protecting automobile occupants) and aggressivity (protecting other roadway users struck by automobiles). The report also considers prospects for improving the safety of automobile occupants.

3. The report found that crash severity is the most important predictor of driver hospitalization or death, followed by crash type, safety belt use, driver age and gender, and automobile weight. Crash severity refers to the speed of impact, while crash type refers to the number of vehicles in a crash, whether the car rolled over, and its points of impact. If information about only one of these several factors were available for predicting whether the driver would be seriously injured, having access to crash severity information would lead to the greatest number of accurate predictions.

4. The report also found that women drivers are more likely than men drivers to be hospitalized or killed in collisions with cars and light trucks, but not in one-car crashes. Women drivers may be protected less well by heavier cars and by safety belts than are men drivers. In contrast, drivers 65 and older have a greater risk of hospitalization or death than younger drivers in one-car as well as multivehicle crashes.

5. The report suggests that improving the crash protection offered by automobiles to women and older drivers so that it approaches the level enjoyed by men and younger drivers offers the greatest chance for reducing roadway injuries for them. In the absence of compelling evidence for the inherent physical frailty of women compared to men, the report is optimistic that crashworthiness for women can be substantially improved. However, the evidence indicates that older drivers are, in fact, more fragile than young drivers.

1. The Department of Defense's (DOD) personal property program is used by personal property shipping office staff to manage household goods moves for all military servicemembers and DOD civilians when they relocate. The program involves a complex process of qualifying carriers, soliciting rates, distributing moves, evaluating moving companies' performance, paying invoices, and settling claims.

2. DOD's personal property program has remained virtually unchanged for nearly 40 years, but the department has taken steps to improve the program, including the development of a new program called Families First. Families First is a U.S. Transportation Command program that aims to improve the quality of household goods moves for servicemembers, DOD civilian employees, and their families.

3. The Families First program has several goals, including improving the quality of service from moving companies, streamlining the claims process, and developing an integrated information management system called DPS. DPS is expected to provide full replacement value coverage, electronic billing and payment systems, and a customer satisfaction survey to help evaluate moving company performance.

4. DOD has faced delays and missed milestones in developing and implementing DPS, which has put achieving the program's goals and benefits at risk. The original estimated release date for DPS has been pushed back for more than 2 years, and the program is now expected to be fully operational in spring 2008.

5. DOD has developed a backup plan to provide servicemembers with full replacement value coverage by March 1, 2008, but its plan to implement the other goals and benefits of Families First still relies on DPS. The backup plan involves modifying contracts to include full replacement value coverage and using a legacy system to process claims.

6. The Families First program is expected to increase costs to DOD by about $1.4 billion over current program costs through fiscal year 2011. The program's costs are expected to increase due to the implementation of DPS, which is expected to cost about $180 million through fiscal year 2011.

7. DOD has not employed comprehensive planning that incorporates many sound management principles and practices, which has put the program's implementation at risk. The department has not developed a comprehensive plan to organize, staff, and fund Families First, and stakeholders have not agreed on some elements of the program.

1. The current fiscal environment requires agencies to separate wants from needs to ensure that programs and investments provide the best return within fiscal constraints. Agencies need to learn to differentiate their unlimited wants from their true needs to make strategic decisions.

2. Agency budgets may not be fully linked to strategic goals and may not adequately consider likely agencywide resource limitations. This can lead to poor acquisition outcomes and inefficient use of resources.

3. Agencies often pursue their individual needs rather than collective needs, which can result in duplication of efforts and wasted resources. This can be attributed to a lack of coordination and communication among agencies.

4. Individual program and funding decisions may undercut sound policies, leading to unnecessary duplication of effort and costs. This can occur when a disconnect exists between requirements and resources.

5. Congressional direction sometimes requires agencies to buy items and provide services that have not been planned for and may not be needed. This can lead to inefficient use of resources and poor acquisition outcomes.

6. Agencies sometimes budget and allocate resources incrementally, largely based on historical precedents, rather than conduct bottom-up reviews and allocate resources based on the broader goals and objectives of agency strategic plans. This can lead to inefficient use of resources and poor acquisition outcomes.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) establishes a standard price per barrel for fuel to be charged to its customers, which is set annually by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The standard price is based on three components: crude oil, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs. The crude oil component is forecasted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and is used as the baseline for setting the standard price.

2. The DOD uses the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price as its baseline, which is provided by OMB, and adds a refinement markup to account for the cost of refining the crude oil. The refinement markup is estimated based on the historical price relationship between WTI crude oil and refined product prices. The nonproduct costs include overhead, transportation, and storage costs.

3. The DOD's standard price has not accounted for changes in market conditions for crude oil, such as the decreasing relationship between crude oil and refined prices. The DOD's approach for establishing the standard price has resulted in estimated fuel costs that have been considerably lower than actual fuel costs. The actual prices have differed from DOD's estimates largely because changes in fuel market conditions have not been reflected in the standard price.

4. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, which is managed by the DLA, is intended to absorb the effects of price fluctuations, but it has been insufficient to absorb the significant net outlays for fuel. The fund has been used to transfer money into or out of the fund to mitigate the cash shortfall caused by an increase in fuel costs. The DOD has also adjusted the standard price to manage the cash balance in the fund.

5. The DOD has faced challenges in setting a standard price that closely approximates its actual fuel costs, and in recent years its estimated fuel prices have differed considerably from its actual costs. The actual prices have differed from DOD's estimates largely because changes in fuel market conditions have not been reflected in the standard price. The DOD has not documented its rationale for continuing to use the same assumptions.

1. The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted an assessment of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) performance during the 1994 filing season. The objective was to evaluate IRS' ability to process income tax returns and refunds accurately and efficiently, as well as provide taxpayers with access to forms, information, and electronic filing methods. The GAO validated the results of a service center's test of refund accuracy and timeliness by reviewing 853 randomly selected refunds. The GAO also analyzed filing season-related data from IRS' Management Information System for Top Level Executives and IRS data on processing errors.

2. The GAO found that IRS' computer systems generally performed well during the 1994 filing season, with some systems problems occurring that had operational impacts. The problems caused downtime for IRS employees and short delays in refunds for taxpayers. However, the limited downtime usually had a minimal impact on IRS' overall operations. The GAO also noted that IRS exceeded its accuracy and timeliness goals for processing refunds and its accuracy goal for processing returns.

3. The GAO identified several areas of concern, including the Earned Income Credit (EIC), which continued to be a leading source of errors by taxpayers and tax practitioners. The EIC also contributed to IRS' error resolution workload. Additionally, the number of fraudulent refund claims identified by IRS continued to grow at a troubling pace. The GAO noted that the EIC expansion under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 may make about 6 million more persons eligible for the credit and could encourage even more attempts to defraud the system.

4. The GAO found that taxpayers continued to experience considerable difficulty reaching IRS over the telephone, and those difficulties appeared to be widening. The accessibility of IRS' toll-free telephone assistance declined, and taxpayers calling IRS to order forms and taxpayers trying to use the TeleFile system also had problems getting through. The GAO measured accessibility using information on actual calls from IRS' Telephone Data Report. The accessibility rate for the 1994 filing season was 21 percent, indicating that about four out of five calls were not answered.

The federal government pays a portion of whatever qualifying expenditures a state Medicaid program incurs, and states decide whether to cover optional services and how much to reimburse providers for a particular service. States may obtain waivers of certain provisions from HCFA under the authority of section 1115 of the Social Security Act.

3. Section 1115 of the act offers HCFA the authority to waive a broad range of Medicaid requirements for state demonstration projects, and HCFA requires the applying state to demonstrate that its proposal is budget neutral. Until recently, budget neutrality was expected to be achieved in each year of the demonstration.

4. Tennessee became the first state to move its Medicaid program enrollees to a statewide demonstration project, known as TennCare, which was designed to use a capitated managed care system to expand coverage to the uninsured population and to control total program and state costs. TennCare's ceilings on total allowable federal funding are intended to be budget neutral.

5. The state-federal sharing arrangements of the financing plan tend to favor the state since several waiver provisions allow it to effectively reduce its share of total spending. The waiver includes provisions to monitor and ensure enrollee access to quality care.

6. TennCare was designed to expand health coverage by allowing non-Medicaid eligible persons to enroll and by extending the period of coverage for Medicaid-eligible persons. It also increased the scope of coverage by lifting restrictions on many services and by allowing additional types of services to all enrollees.

7. The state set capitation rates that are substantially below historical Medicaid costs, and it discontinued its DSH program and established a smaller Primary Care Provider Fund. The state's rationale for making these adjustments was that the costs of charity care that had been built into the rates paid historically to providers would be significantly reduced by expanded insurance coverage.

1. The rapid increase in crack cocaine use in the 1980s was referred to as a drug epidemic, and researchers and government agencies look for changing patterns in drug use to identify emerging problems. These patterns include the use of a new illicit drug, a change in how a drug is taken, a change in the level of use among populations that abuse drugs, and the use of a drug by a new population group or in a different geographic area. The federal government funds activities and programs to implement the nation's drug control strategy, with about 25 percent of federal drug control resources going to grants-in-aid or other forms of assistance to state and local governments and private entities.

2. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) sponsored several surveys and convened a work group of epidemiologists to help identify and monitor changes in drug use patterns, including the change in cocaine use from snorting to smoking, which was later associated with the emergence of the crack epidemic. NIDA's research activities related to prevention and treatment practices did not make clear distinctions between powdered cocaine and its crystallized form, crack. The agency did not initially target its education and outreach efforts to address the use of crack.

3. The federal public health response to crack in the 1980s primarily focused on cocaine in general instead of on crack specifically, and NIDA's research was aimed at developing ""best practice"" prevention and treatment approaches. The agency launched several education and outreach efforts specific to cocaine, including the Drug Abuse Prevention Media Campaign and the ""Cocaine: The Big Lie"" campaign.

The nation's drug detection system has been improved with changes to the NIDA-sponsored drug use detection mechanisms, including the expansion of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey to include 8th- and 10th-grade students and the annual conduct of the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA). However, concerns remain about the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the federal drug data collection system, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has begun implementing some of the principles in the Subcommittee's draft report. ONDCP is responsible for developing and coordinating a national drug control strategy, and it could take the lead in improving the nation's drug data collection system and coordinating the development of a strategy to address future emerging drug use problems.

513,"1. The worker-profiling initiative was introduced in the 1990s to identify unemployment claimants who are most likely to exhaust benefits and provide them with reemployment services. The initiative requires states to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for UI regular compensation. States use statistical models or characteristic screens to identify claimants who are likely to exhaust benefits, and the models can vary significantly from state to state. Labor encourages the use of statistical models over characteristic screens because they are more efficient and precise in identifying claimants likely to exhaust benefits.

2. Despite the initiative's goals, many states have not updated their profiling models in recent years, and the models may have lost predictive accuracy over time. Labor has not established requirements for updating models, and has not undertaken ongoing monitoring of state models. The reemployment services offered in the states we contacted generally did not conform to the robust service process originally outlined by Labor. States have been concerned with the availability of funding, and Labor officials said that the purpose of the worker-profiling initiative is to target the funding that does exist to those claimants who need it most.",1,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. The military health system has three missions: maintaining the health of active-duty service members, maintaining readiness, and providing care to dependents of active-duty personnel, retirees, and their families. In fiscal year 1999, DOD's annual appropriations included about $16 billion for health care, of which over $1 billion funded the care of seniors. The TRICARE framework was implemented in the mid-1990s to improve beneficiary access and quality while containing costs. TRICARE provides care through over 600 MTFs and a network of civilian providers managed by outside contractors.

2. TRICARE offers three options: TRICARE Prime, a managed care option; TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider option; and TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service option. TRICARE covers inpatient services, outpatient services, skilled nursing facility and other post-acute care, and prescription drugs. Medicare is a federally financed health insurance program that covers health care expenses of the elderly, some people with disabilities, and people with end-stage kidney disease. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees.

3. Medicare enrollees receive part A benefits and are eligible for optional part B benefits if they pay a monthly premium. Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries choose their own providers, and Medicare reimburses those providers on a fee-for-service basis. Beneficiaries who receive care through traditional Medicare are responsible for paying a share of the costs for services. Most beneficiaries have supplemental coverage that pays for many of the costs not covered by Medicare.

4. The Medicare+Choice option allows beneficiaries to enroll in private managed care plans and other types of health plans. Managed care plans provide all traditional Medicare benefits and typically offer additional benefits, such as prescription drug coverage. Plan members generally pay less out-of-pocket than under traditional Medicare. When choosing a plan, beneficiaries must weigh these benefits against other features of managed care.

5. The Senior Prime program is a DOD-run managed care organization that participates in the Medicare+Choice program and enrolls older retirees. To be eligible for Senior Prime, retirees must reside in one of the six geographic areas covered by the demonstration, be enrolled in both Medicare part A and part B, and be eligible for military health care benefits. Senior Prime is based on TRICARE Prime, DOD's managed care program for active-duty personnel, family members, and retirees under age 65. Services can be provided, at Senior Prime's option, at an MTF",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28}"

These areas include communication, strategic planning, IT, knowledge management, organizational structure, human capital management, training, and financial management. The GAO made 15 management recommendations in these areas, and NTSB has fully implemented three of them.

2. NTSB has fully implemented the GAO's recommendations on communication by reporting to Congress on the status of its recommendations and including the actions it has taken to address them in its Annual Report to Congress. The agency has also fully implemented the recommendation on strategic planning by linking all five mission areas in its goals and objectives and seeking external stakeholder comments. This has helped NTSB to better align its organizational structure with its strategic plan.

3. NTSB has taken steps to implement all three of the GAO's IT-related recommendations, including fully implementing an IT strategic plan that addresses the GAO's comments. The agency has also undergone annual independent audits, hiring outside contractors to perform security testing and evaluation of its computer systems. However, NTSB still needs to install encryption software on all of its laptop computers.

4. NTSB has made significant progress in limiting local administrator privileges while allowing employees to add software and print from offsite locations as necessary. The agency has also drafted a strategic training plan that, when finalized, would address GAO guidance on federal strategic training and development efforts. This plan would establish the core competencies needed for investigators and other staff.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on research laboratories, industry, and academia to develop new technologies, but historically, it has experienced problems in bringing technologies out of the lab environment and into real use. DOD has established various ""technology transition"" programs to address this issue, including the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program, and the Dual Use Science and Technology program. These programs aim to quickly move promising technologies from the laboratory and commercial environment into actual use.

2. The Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP), and the Quick Reaction Fund are three new transition programs established to address the problem of technology transition. The TTI focuses on speeding the transition of technologies developed by DOD's S&T programs into acquisition programs, while the DACP focuses on introducing innovative and cost-saving technologies developed inside and outside DOD. The Quick Reaction Fund is focused on field testing technology prototypes.

3. The three transition programs have reported benefits, including improvements to performance, affordability, manufacturability, and operational capability for the warfighter. However, it is too early to determine the impact of these programs on technology transition, and only a few projects have been completed. The programs have limited performance measures to gauge project success or track return on investment over time.

4. To optimize DOD's investment in the three transition programs, the Secretary of Defense is recommended to direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to develop data and measures to support assessments of the performance of the programs. The Secretary of Defense should also direct the Under Secretary of Defense to implement formal feedback mechanisms, including interim and after-action reporting, as well as project reviews if major deviations occur in a project. The Secretary of Defense should also assess how the Technology Transition Council can be better used to address broader technology transition problems.

1. The Clean Air Act, a comprehensive federal law, was passed in 1963 to regulate air pollution from stationary and mobile sources, and it was substantially overhauled in 1970 to establish national ambient air quality standards. The act was amended again in 1977 and 1990 to set new goals and dates for attaining the standards and to incorporate market-based approaches to reduce emissions.

2. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required EPA to take 452 actions related to Titles I, III, and IV, which included setting national ambient air quality standards, regulating hazardous air pollutants, and reducing acid rain. EPA completed most of these actions, but many were met late, and some remain unmet.

3. Title I of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to periodically review and revise national health- and welfare-based standards for air quality, and states are responsible for developing plans to achieve the revised standard. EPA must review and approve individual state plans, and the process can be complex and time-consuming.

4. Title III of the Clean Air Act established a new regulatory program to reduce the emissions of hazardous air pollutants, specifying 189 air toxics whose emissions would be controlled under its provisions. EPA must impose technology-based standards, or Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards, on industry to reduce emissions.

5. Title IV of the Clean Air Act established the acid deposition control program to reduce the adverse effects of acid rain by reducing the annual emissions of pollutants that contribute to it. The program uses a market-based trading program that allocates sulfur dioxide emission allowances to affected electric utilities.

6. EPA has completed most of the requirements related to Titles I, III, and IV, but many were met late, and some remain unmet. The agency missed deadlines for many requirements due to various factors, including the need to review a larger quantity of scientific information and competing demands on agency staff.

1. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) established the Girls Study Group (Study Group) in 2004 to develop research that communities need to make sound decisions about how best to prevent and reduce girls' delinquency. The Study Group was established under a $2.6 million multiyear cooperative agreement with a research institute. The objectives of the Study Group included identifying effective or promising programs, program elements, and implementation principles for preventing or reducing girls' delinquency. The Study Group also aimed to develop program models to help inform communities of what works in preventing or reducing girls' delinquency.

2. To meet OJJDP's objectives, the Study Group identified studies of delinquency programs that specifically targeted girls by reviewing over 1,000 documents in relevant research areas. These included criminological and feminist explanations for girls' delinquency, patterns of delinquency, and the justice system's response to girls' delinquency. The group identified 61 programs that specifically targeted preventing or responding to girls' delinquency. The Study Group then assessed the methodological quality of the studies of the programs that had been evaluated using a set of criteria developed by DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP).

3. The Study Group used OJP's What Works criteria to assess the studies, which ensured that the assessment of program effectiveness would be based on highly rigorous evaluation standards. However, 8 of the 18 experts interviewed said that the criteria created an unrealistically high standard, which caused the group to overlook potentially promising programs. OJJDP officials stated that despite such concerns, they approved the group's use of the criteria because of the methodological rigor of the framework. The Study Group's assessment of the programs was consistent with generally accepted social science research practices and standards.

4. The Study Group found that few girls' delinquency programs had been studied and that the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs. As a result, OJJDP plans to provide technical assistance to help programs be better prepared for evaluations of their effectiveness. The Study Group reported that among other things, there is a need for additional, methodologically rigorous evaluations of girls' delinquency programs. The group also found that the majority of the girls' delinquency programs it identified had not been studied by researchers.

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) was created to standardize DOD finance and accounting policies, procedures, and systems. DFAS was formed by consolidating the large finance and accounting centers that belonged to the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency. The Deputy Secretary of Defense directed DFAS to assume control of existing finance and accounting operations and personnel at the command and installation levels within the military services.

2. DFAS was established in January 1991, and by 1994, it had assumed responsibility for many of the finance and accounting activities at 332 offices. DFAS had announced plans to consolidate these activities at a limited number of DFAS locations. To focus DOD management's attention on managing the cost of finance and accounting activities, DFAS was designated a Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) business area in fiscal year 1992. The concept of DBOF is to promote total cost visibility by charging customers for the full cost of providing goods and services.

3. The 1997 Defense Authorization Act required DOD to conduct a comprehensive study of DBOF and present an improvement plan to the Congress for approval. Pending the results of this study, DOD's Comptroller dissolved DBOF and created four working capital funds. DFAS is part of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. The four working capital funds will continue to operate under the revolving fund concept and charge customers the full costs of providing goods and services to them.

4. DFAS and the military services are jointly responsible for carrying out DOD finance and accounting activities. DFAS negotiated a division of responsibility with each military service.

These entities facilitate the flow of and payment for drugs from manufacturers to consumers. The interactions among these entities are crucial for the smooth functioning of the pharmaceutical industry.

2. Drug wholesalers purchase bulk quantities of drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies, including independent pharmacies. Some wholesalers offer ancillary services to independent pharmacies, such as helping them manage their inventory. Three wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation, and Cardinal Health Inc., accounted for over 80 percent of all drug distribution revenue in the United States in 2011.

3. Independent pharmacies are a type of retail pharmacy with a store-based location that dispense medications to consumers, including both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Approximately 21,000 independent pharmacies constituted almost 34 percent of the retail pharmacies operating in the United States in 2010. These pharmacies provide patient-care services such as patient education to encourage patients' appropriate use of medications.

4. Independent pharmacies primarily purchase drugs from wholesalers and represented slightly over 15 percent of wholesalers' total sales to retail pharmacies in 2010. They may also purchase drugs directly from manufacturers. Independent pharmacies are an important part of a wholesaler's customer portfolio because they may also pay the wholesaler to provide logistical functions and ancillary services.

5. After receipt of drugs from a wholesaler or manufacturer, pharmacies fill and dispense prescriptions to consumers, such as health plan enrollees. These latter prescriptions are dispensed according to contractual terms agreed upon with each enrollee's health plan, that is, with each third-party payer or its PBM. Payments based on the contractual terms of third-party payers or their PBMs significantly affect the financial viability of independent pharmacies.

6. Third-party payers accounted for almost 80 percent of drug expenditures in 2010, which represents a significant shift from 30 years ago when payment from individual consumers accounted for the largest portion of expenditures. Third-party payers include private and public health plans such as those offered by large corporations and the federal government through Medicare and the FEHBP.

Hate crimes have become a prominent concern among policymakers, and Congress has enacted several laws to address this issue, including the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, and the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1994. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 expanded the scope of hate crime victims to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.

2. The commerce clause of the Constitution authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce, but the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Morrison narrowed the scope of this authority, making it difficult to use this clause to expand hate crime legislation. The Court held that Congress cannot regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on its aggregate effect on interstate commerce.

3. The Court's decision in Morrison suggests that hate crimes that involve interstate travel may still be within the commerce clause's reach, but attempts to broaden the scope of hate crime legislation tied to findings and the general nature and consequences of hate crimes are constitutionally suspect. This leaves other legislative powers, such as the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, as potential alternatives.

4. Section 5 of the 14th Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce the Amendment's provisions, but the Court has limited this authority to state action, not private action. This means that hate crimes committed by private individuals may not be within the scope of this amendment.

5. Section 2 of the 13th Amendment may be a more viable option for broadening hate crime legislation, as it proscribes slavery and involuntary servitude without reference to federal, state, or private action. However, it is unclear whether violence based on bigotry constitutes a ""badge and/or incident of slavery"" under this amendment.

6. The Court has observed that Congress has the power to determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery and to translate that determination into effective legislation, but it is unclear how broad this authority is. This leaves questions about whether hate crimes committed by private individuals can be addressed under this amendment.

7. The Court has considered constitutional challenges to state hate crime statutes under both the 1st and 6th Amendments, with the 1st Amendment declaring that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.

1. The exchange rate policies of East Asian nations, particularly China, Japan, and South Korea, have been a source of tension with the United States in the past and remain so in the present. Some analysts argue that these countries have intentionally kept their currencies undervalued to maintain price competitiveness in global markets. This is seen as a form of ""currency manipulation"" that violates Article IV, Section 1(iii) of the International Monetary Fund's Articles of Agreement. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the Department of the Treasury to analyze exchange rates and externally-oriented policies of major trading partners.

2. The Department of the Treasury's semiannual report to Congress in 2017 found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for currency manipulation. However, six major trading partners, including China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and Taiwan, were placed on a ""Monitoring List"" for close attention to their currency practices. Four of the six major trading partners are in East Asia. The report noted that China has a long track record of engaging in persistent, large-scale, one-way foreign exchange intervention to resist renminbi appreciation.

3. Japan has a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, but has not intervened in the foreign exchange market in five years. South Korea has a track record of asymmetric foreign exchange interventions, and the IMF maintains its assessment that the won is undervalued. Taiwan has a track record of asymmetric foreign exchange interventions, and the Treasury urges Taiwan's authorities to demonstrate a durable shift to a policy of limiting foreign exchange interventions. The report also noted that Japan has a significant goods surplus with the United States.

4. East Asian governments may be resistant to adopting ""free float"" exchange rate policies due to the commonly held view that economies with more liberal exchange rate policies suffered more during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. The adoption of ""free float"" exchange rate policies by more monetary authorities in East Asia may not significantly reduce the U.S. trade deficits with countries in the region. The United States generally runs trade deficits with East Asia, and there is no consensus among economists that the resulting appreciation of East Asian currencies against the U.S. dollar would increase overall U.S. exports or reduce U.S. imports. However, for some price-sensitive industries, the appreciation of a competing nation's currency may stimulate U.S. export growth and/or a decline in U.S. imports.

The State Department and USAID 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) emphasized the need to equip ambassadors to better perform that role.

2. A COM is the title conferred on the principal officer in charge of each U.S. diplomatic mission to a foreign country, foreign territory, or international organization, usually referring to the U.S. ambassadors who lead U.S. embassies abroad. The U.S. Constitution authorizes the President to appoint ambassadors with the advice and consent of the Senate, subject to Senate confirmation. In circumstances where no presidentially appointed ambassador is currently serving at a U.S. mission abroad, legislation further authorizes the President to appoint a career U.S. foreign service officer as a chargé d'affaires.

3. The role of the COM has expanded considerably since World War II, with COMs assigned to head U.S. embassies or other country-based diplomatic missions abroad charged with responsibility for overseeing nearly all U.S. government activities in their country of assignment. The State Department/USAID 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) casts ambassadors as chief executive officers or ""CEOs"" of multi-agency missions, not only conducting traditional diplomacy, but also leading and overseeing civilians from multiple federal agencies in other work. The QDDR highlights the key role of country teams and ambassadors in the conduct of foreign policy and assistance.

4. The authorities and responsibilities of COMs are explained primarily in the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (FSA 1980), which serves as a codification in legislation of many of the provisions in previous executive orders setting out and developing COM authority. COM authority is also shaped by executive branch directives, which include executive orders and other presidential directives and State Department regulations. According to State Department regulations, COM authority derives originally from the President's general constitutional powers in foreign affairs.

5. Section 207 of FSA 1980 sets out the three main components of COM authority: (1) the COM's responsibilities, (2) the COM's authority over the personnel stationed at the embassy",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27}"

1. China's economy is heavily dependent on global trade and investment flows, with its net exports contributing to one-third of its GDP growth in 2007. The country's exports of goods and services as a share of GDP rose from 9.1% in 1985 to 37.8% in 2008. China's foreign trade sector employs more than 80 million people, with 28 million working in foreign-invested enterprises.

2. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to China have been a major factor behind its productivity gains and rapid economic growth, with FDI flows totaling $75 billion in 2007 and $92 billion in 2008. China was the largest FDI recipient among developing countries and the third largest overall in 2007. The current global economic slowdown is having a significant negative impact on China's export sector and industries that depend on FDI flows.

3. China's economy slowed sharply in 2008 and early 2009, with its fourth-quarter 2008 real GDP growth at 6.8% and its 1st quarter 2009 growth at 6.1%. Some analysts contend that annual economic growth of less than 8% could lead to social unrest in China. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that China was the single most important contributor to world economic growth in 2007.

4. China's exposure to the global financial crisis is unclear, but the country places numerous restrictions on capital flows to maintain its managed float currency policy. Chinese government entities, such as the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, may have been more exposed to troubled U.S. mortgage securities. China's foreign exchange reserves rose from $403 billion in 2003 to $2.1 trillion as of June 2009.

5. China's holdings of U.S. securities totaled $1,205 billion as of June 2008, making it the second-largest foreign holder of such securities. The Treasury Department estimates that $527 billion of China's U.S. securities holdings were in long-term U.S. agency securities. China's holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities were likely substantial but less risky.

6. China's stimulus package, announced in November 2008, is a two-year, 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) program to finance infrastructure projects, affordable housing, and rural infrastructure.

1. The national mining and minerals policy fosters private enterprise in the development of economically sound and stable domestic mining, minerals, metal, and mineral reclamation industries. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages most federal mineral development and is largely responsible for implementing this policy.

2. The BLM manages a large amount of federal lands, and federal land in the National Forest System (NFS) is under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Forest Service plays a role in authorizing mineral development on NFS lands.

3. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (MLLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for exploration and to lease lands containing oil and gas and other defense-related minerals. The MLLA also authorizes the Secretary to lease oil and gas deposits and onshore public domain lands containing oil and gas deposits.

4. The Secretary of the Interior must develop and revise ""land use plans"" for the public lands, officially known as Resource Management Plans (RMPs), that consider the present and potential future uses for public lands managed by BLM. These RMPs serve as the initial determinant of which lands may be subject to leasing.

5. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to withdraw public lands managed by BLM so that some or all potential land uses are proscribed on those lands. However, limitations on the Secretary's withdrawal authority exist, including congressional withdrawals.

6. The Secretary of the Interior must apply ""multiple use"" and ""sustained yield"" principles when developing RMPs, which involve judiciously managing lands in a manner that takes into account the environmental, historical, and natural resource values of the lands. The Secretary is also required to provide opportunities for the public and various levels of government to participate in the development of RMPs.

7. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (2005 EPACT) requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding issues such as the establishment of procedures to ensure timely processing of oil and gas lease applications. The 2005 EPACT also requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an internal review of Federal onshore oil and gas leasing and permitting practices.

The 2005 EPACT establishes that certain actions taken by either the Secretary of the Interior or by the Secretary of Agriculture (when NFS lands are involved) ""shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that the use of a",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 14}"

1. Policymakers are considering reforming or limiting itemized tax deductions for individuals to increase federal tax revenue, simplify the tax code, and reduce incentives for inefficient economic behavior. However, some argue that limits on deductions could have adverse economic effects or change the distributional burden of the federal income tax code. Analysis of tax filer data is informing discussions about itemized tax deduction reform.

2. The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Statistics of Income (SOI) data show that in 2014, 30% of all tax filers chose to itemize their deductions, with higher-income individuals more likely to itemize. The share of tax filers who chose to itemize in income ranges above $200,000 remained virtually the same (over 90%), although the average sum of itemized deductions claimed increases substantially as income rises. Tax filers with an AGI greater than $200,000 had an average sum of itemized deductions claimed ranging from $43,131 to $424,864.

3. Itemized deductions are often grouped together in broader discussions of tax policy, but they exist for various reasons and target different types of tax filers. The data analysis in this report aims to identify who claims itemized deductions, for how much, and for which provisions. The mortgage interest deduction was the largest single deduction, by amount, claimed by tax filers with an AGI less than $500,000, while the deduction for state and local income taxes was the largest average deduction amount claimed for any deduction by tax filers with an AGI greater than $500,000.

4. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the top four itemized deductions will contribute 17.8% of the approximately $1.36 trillion in net individual tax expenditures in FY2018. The deduction for state and local income or sales taxes is estimated to be the itemized deduction with the largest tax expenditure estimate in FY2018, accounting for 5.5% of all individual tax expenditures. Some proposals to reform or limit itemized deductions include a flat, dollar-value cap or percentage-of-income cap on total deductions, and converting deductions into credits.

1. The Pacific Islands region is strategically important, encompassing U.S. Pacific territories and presenting Congress with diverse policy issues. U.S. relations with Australia and New Zealand include pursuing common interests in the Southwest Pacific, which has attracted Chinese diplomatic attention and economic engagement. The region includes 14 sovereign states with approximately 9 million people, including three countries in ""free association"" with the United States. The region's gross domestic product (GDP) totals around $32 billion.

2. The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) seeks to foster cooperation between member states, addressing key issues such as climate change, regional security, and fisheries. The PIF's 16 states include Australia, Cook Islands, and New Zealand, while its two territories are French Polynesia and New Caledonia. The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) includes Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu, seeking common positions and solidarity on regional issues. The MSG has granted observer status to the United Liberation Movement for West Papua.

3. The United States enjoys friendly relations with Pacific Island countries, with the Freely Associated States, particularly Palau, voting with the United States 90% of the time. The U.S. has worked with Australia to advance shared strategic interests, maintain regional stability, and promote economic development. China has become a diplomatic force, major source of foreign aid, and leading trade partner in the Southwest Pacific. China's foreign assistance has resulted in 218 projects, including infrastructure projects and investments in natural resources.

4. Climate change and sea level rise pose significant environmental challenges to the Pacific Islands, with some areas potentially becoming uninhabitable by 2050. The Paris Agreement includes outcomes sought by Pacific Island countries, such as limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Pacific Islands Forum has focused on climate change, with leaders welcoming the Paris Agreement and encouraging key stakeholders to prioritize its implementation. The region also faces issues such as ocean acidification, coral reef bleaching, and overfishing, which can have severe impacts on fisheries and tourism.

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of species that are endangered or threatened with extinction, and listing a species results in limitations on activities that could affect that species. Federal agencies are required to use their existing authorities to further the purposes of the act, and under certain circumstances, federal agency actions may be exempted from the act. The exemption process and its history are the subject of this report.

2. The consultation process between federal agencies and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) determines whether an agency project might jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify a species' critical habitat. This process concludes with the appropriate Service issuing a biological opinion (BiOp) as to the harm the project poses. If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is released along with any reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to the agency action that would avoid jeopardy.

3. The exemption process is available for federal projects, licenses, or actions that cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species, and it offers the opportunity to consider extraordinary economic circumstances in the list of factors used in evaluating federal actions. However, an exemption is for a federal project, license, or action, rather than for a species—a key distinction. In more than four decades since the ESA was enacted, there have been only six instances in which an exemption was sought, and only two in which it was granted.

4. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) reviews applications for exemptions, and is responsible for the ultimate decision, which requires five affirmative votes (out of seven) on the committee. The ESC must determine whether to grant an exemption within 30 days of receiving the Secretary's report, and it has subpoena powers for obtaining information it deems necessary to reach its decision. The ESC shall grant an exemption if, based on the evidence, it determines that there are no reasonable and prudent alternatives to the agency action.

5. The exemption process is a complex affair, and even without extensions, could take 280 days, and it requires the applicant to fund any required mitigation measures, which lasts for the life of the action—potentially forever, depending on the nature of the action. The exemption applies to the specific federal agency action in the exemption application, not to the species, and FWS or NMFS must continue to attempt to recover the species. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall more heavily elsewhere, and other laws may still be in play",1,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 15}"

1. The tax treatment of capital losses has been a topic of debate in Congress since the enactment of the individual income tax in 1913, with numerous bills introduced to change the way capital gains income is taxed. The current tax system allows for the deduction of capital losses against ordinary income, but with a $3,000 annual limit. This limit was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from selectively realizing losses and minimizing their capital income tax liabilities. The limit has been adjusted over the years, with the most recent change being the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.

2. Increasing the net capital loss limit against ordinary income may not be an effective device to stimulate aggregate demand, as it could produce an incentive to sell stock, which could depress stock prices and erode confidence. The empirical evidence suggests that the tax benefits of an increase in the net capital loss limitation would be received by a relatively small number of higher income individuals. Restoring the value of the loss limitation to its 1978 level is complicated, as there is no way to determine that a particular time period had achieved the optimal net capital loss limitation. Achieving full symmetry in the system requires accounting for the tax rate differential between short and long-term gains and losses during the netting process.",1,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) recognizes the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing. This right is intended to mitigate and eliminate labor-related obstructions to the free flow of commerce. Although union membership has declined since the 1950s, congressional interest in the NLRA remains significant.

2. The NLRA does not apply to all individuals employed by an employer, but only to ""employees"" who are defined as individuals who do not include supervisors. The term ""supervisor"" is defined by the Act to include any individual with the authority to perform certain functions, such as hiring or firing employees. The exercise of such authority requires the use of independent judgment and is not merely routine or clerical.

3. In NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., the Court considered whether certain nurses should be classified as supervisors for purposes of the NLRA. The Court ultimately affirmed the Sixth Circuit's decision, which held that employees will be considered supervisors if they hold the authority to engage in certain functions and their exercise of authority requires the use of independent judgment. The Court also noted that the NLRB's discretion to clarify the meaning of the term ""independent judgment"" is limited.

4. In Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., the NLRB revisited the issue of supervisory status and defined the terms ""assign,"" ""responsibly to direct,"" and ""independent judgment"" as they are used in section 2(11) of the NLRA. The NLRB concluded that the term ""assign"" refers to the act of designating an employee to a place or giving significant overall duties or tasks to an employee. The NLRB also noted that the term ""responsibly to direct"" applies to individuals who are held accountable for the performance of tasks by other employees.

5. The NLRA prohibits certain misconduct by both employers and unions that interferes with the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining. Section 8(a)(1) of the Act prohibits employers from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights. Similarly, section 8(b)(1)(A) of the NLRA prohibits unions from restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights.

1. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a 10-member grouping of nations with a combined population of 580 million and an annual gross domestic product (GDP) of around $1.5 trillion. Established in 1967, ASEAN has grown into one of the world's largest regional fora, representing a strategically and economically important region. The organization's primary goal is to foster regional dialogue and cooperation among its member states.

2. The United States has deep-seated interests in Southeast Asia, including maritime security, the promotion of democracy and human rights, and the encouragement of liberal trade and investment regimes. However, the Obama Administration's policy of expanding and upgrading U.S. relations with Southeast Asia has been perceived as a shift from the Bush Administration's narrowly focused approach on terrorism. The U.S. has been steadily expanding and deepening its relations with ASEAN since the middle of the decade.

3. ASEAN has traditionally operated on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members, which has led to considerable difficulty in the group operating in formal concert. The organization's expansion to include underdeveloped nations has created a wide range of interests within the group, making formal security and economic moves difficult to agree upon. ASEAN's reluctance to become involved in the internal affairs of its members has largely kept issues from becoming the business of the group as a whole.

4. The ASEAN economies have become a major regional hub for globalized manufacturing, with ASEAN's total merchandise trade exceeding $1.7 trillion in 2008. The organization has been actively promoting the creation of a larger, Asia-based free trade area, including the East Asian Community (EAC). ASEAN has also been negotiating trade agreements with key Asian nations, including China, India, Japan, and South Korea.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) provides an alternative tax calculation on a broader tax base than the regular tax, but its exemptions are not indexed to inflation, leading to an increase in the number of taxpayers covered by the AMT. This has resulted in a significant growth in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT, from 140,000 in 1987 to 9 million in 2009.

2. The AMT has a complex interaction with tax credits, and the elimination of the credit limit provision would cost the U.S. Treasury $1 billion currently, but would cost many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009. Indexing AMT exemptions would cost $13.9 billion by 2008.

3. Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities without altering the AMT would increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and the number affected by the credit limit, and would cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families. The marriage penalty legislation would have increased the number of taxpayers on the AMT or constrained by it via credits by 49% by 2010.

4. The AMT has a significant impact on tax proposals, and proposals that lower tax rates or narrow brackets across the board would also be expected to have significant interactions with the AMT. Taxpayers already on the AMT would get no tax cut, and some taxpayers would be shifted to the AMT.

5. There are various approaches to dealing with the AMT, including indexing exemptions, eliminating the credit limit provision, and adjusting the AMT in tandem with regular tax changes. Some individuals see the AMT as a desirable alternative tax, while others see it as an unnecessary and complicating feature of the current tax system.

However, India's relations with Iran have been a point of concern for the U.S. due to Iran's nuclear program and its potential to undermine the U.S.-India partnership. India has traditionally maintained positive ties with Iran, citing ""civilizational ties"" between the two countries.

2. The U.S. has expressed opposition to India's plans to seek energy resources from Iran, which could benefit a country the U.S. seeks to isolate. Indian firms have taken long-term contracts for the purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and India supports the proposed construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan. The Bush Administration has expressed strong opposition to any pipeline projects involving Iran.

1. The Supreme Court decided four search and seizure cases during its October 2012 term, including Florida v. Jardines, which involved a trained narcotics-detection dog's sniff at the front door of a suspected marijuana grow house.
2. The Court held that the dog's sniff was a Fourth Amendment search, affirming the Florida Supreme Court's decision that the search required probable cause.
3. In Florida v. Harris, the Court unanimously reversed the Florida Supreme Court's decision, holding that a trained drug-detection dog's positive reaction is sufficient to establish probable cause for a search.
4. The Court also decided Missouri v. McNeely, which involved a warrantless blood test ordered for a drunk driving suspect, and held that the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant.
5. In Bailey v. United States, the Court held that the occupants of a premises must be detained in the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched, rather than being detained off-site, in order to be considered a valid exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.

1. The federal government first supported a program for energy storage and electric power system technology during the 1970s, before the establishment of the Department of Energy (DOE). The program was focused mainly on energy storage to even out the variable power production from rapidly growing use of wind and solar technologies. The advancement of computer capacity, miniaturization, and industrial controls has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows. The subsequent increase in networking of computerized devices for grid data collection and control advanced the ability of operators to anticipate, avoid, and otherwise mitigate potential power crises.

2. The nation's energy infrastructure is diverse, including a variety of transmission and distribution system network structures, operating models, and hardware and software. The energy sector consists of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically. Interdependency within the sector and across the nation's critical energy infrastructure sectors is significant. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the virtually borderless nature of energy use and the reliance on predominantly privately-owned infrastructure.

3. Key challenges and opportunities facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure, modernizing and securing communication networks, accommodating new end-use technologies, and planning for increased interdependencies of natural gas, water, and electricity systems. These activities are constrained by the need for cost control, physical security, cybersecurity, improved system resiliency, and the flexibility to adapt to weather and market uncertainties. Further opportunities arise from growing use of shale gas production and decreasing costs for information technologies. The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is charged with a mission to support more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure.

4. The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through research and development (R&D), demonstration projects, partnerships, facilitation, modeling and analytics, and emergency preparedness and response. OE is the federal government's lead entity for energy sector-specific responses to national energy security emergencies. The office works with a variety of stakeholders, including private industry and federal, state, local, and tribal governments on a variety of initiatives to modernize the electric grid. Grid modernization is needed to address aging infrastructure, achieve public policy objectives, sustain economic growth, support environmental stewardship, and mitigate risks.

1. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was enacted in 1986 to guide the creation of memorials in the District of Columbia, with the goal of preserving the integrity of the comprehensive design of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans for the Nation's Capital. The CWA ensures the continued public use and enjoyment of open space in the District of Columbia and its environs, and encourages the location of commemorative works within the urban fabric of the District of Columbia. The CWA defines a commemorative work as ""any statue, monument, sculpture, memorial, plaque, inscription, or other structure of landscape feature.""

2. Prior to the enactment of the CWA, Congress had authorized over 100 memorials in the District of Columbia, but there was no statutory criteria for authorizing commemorative works. The CWA established a 24-step process for creating a memorial in the District of Columbia, which includes initiation, legislation, site election and approval, design approval, fundraising, construction, and dedication. The process is guided by the National Park Service (NPS) and involves various entities, including the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission (NCMAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.

3. The CWA divides the District of Columbia and its environs into three sections for the placement of memorials: the Reserve, Area I, and Area II. The Reserve is a no-build zone on the National Mall, and new commemorative works are prohibited within its boundaries. Area I is reserved for commemorative works of ""preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States.""

4. Area II is reserved for ""subjects of lasting historical significance to the American people,"" and it encompasses all sections of the District of Columbia and its environs not part of the Reserve or Area I. The Secretary or the Administrator of General Services, after seeking the advice of NCMAC, can recommend the location of a commemorative work in either Area I or Area II. If the Secretary or Administrator recommends placement in Area I, he or she must notify Congress of his or her determination.

5. The CWA requires that the sponsor of a commemorative work must donate an amount equal to 10% of the estimated cost of construction to offset the costs of perpetual maintenance and preservation. The sponsor must also submit a construction permit application to the Secretary or Administrator, which includes a site and design plan, a construction schedule, and a budget. The Secretary or Administrator must approve the permit application before construction",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27}"

1. The Senate Finance Committee approved the America's Healthy Future Act of 2009 on October 13, 2009, which aimed to reform the private health insurance market and provide health insurance coverage to more Americans.
2. The bill required individuals to maintain health insurance and certain employers with more than 50 employees to either provide insurance or pay a tax, with some exceptions.
3. The bill introduced market reforms, such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and insurance renewal, and required insurers to not exclude potential enrollees or charge them premiums based on pre-existing health conditions.
4. The bill established a mandate for most individuals age 18 and over to have health insurance beginning July 1, 2013, or to pay a penalty for noncompliance.
5. The bill provided subsidies to help pay for premiums and cost-sharing for individuals who enrolled in a silver plan through an exchange, with the amount of subsidies based on income.
6. The bill established a program to provide affordable health care coverage through private health care systems under contract, with funding based on the Secretary's estimates of 85% of the value of individual tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies.
7. The bill created a temporary reinsurance program to assist participating employment-based plans with the cost of providing health benefits to eligible retirees who are 55 and older and their dependents.
8. The bill imposed excise taxes and limitations on employer deductions that would impact health insurers, health plan sponsors, and administrators, with the goal of raising $304 billion in revenues over a 10-year period.

1. High risk health insurance pools have been established in 35 states to provide coverage to individuals who cannot obtain or afford health insurance in the private market, primarily due to preexisting health conditions. These programs target individuals who have been denied coverage, received quotes with higher premiums, or received offers with permanent exclusion of preexisting health conditions. High risk pools generally cover people who have sought health coverage in the individual market but have been unable to obtain it. Many states use their high risk pools to comply with the portability and guaranteed availability provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

2. State high risk pools tend to enroll a small percentage of the uninsured, with approximately 200,000 individuals enrolled in the 34 high risk pools in operation in 2008. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that nearly 4 million additional persons were potentially eligible for enrollment. The limited enrollment reflects the narrow focus of these pools, which target individuals with preexisting health conditions who do not have access to public or group health insurance. High risk pools fill a niche in the health insurance system, providing coverage to individuals who are excluded from the private market.

3. High risk pools were designed to assist individuals with costly medical conditions who have very few options for private health coverage. Supporters of HRPs contend that states can use their existing regulatory infrastructure and knowledge of health care markets to efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals. They also argue that removing high-risk persons from the individual market and placing them in publicly subsidized insurance pools will make coverage more affordable and stabilize the market. However, others contend that high risk pools are generally too small and underfunded to meet the needs of the majority of persons who cannot access health insurance in the private market.

4. State high risk pools usually operate through state-established nonprofit organizations, with private insurance companies responsible for daily administrative duties. Boards oversee the governance of HRPs and typically consist of representatives from insurance companies, consumer groups, health care providers, and state agencies. States have a great deal of discretion regarding the establishment and operation of these pools, including covered benefits, eligibility requirements, and funding sources. High risk pools generally operate at a loss, and many states tap other sources of funding to cover their operating expenses.

5. The federal government has provided financial assistance to states through a grant program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The program provides seed grants to states that want to establish high risk pools and operational and bonus grants to existing state pools.",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 20}"

1. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program was created by President Truman in 1951 to provide airlift support to the Department of Defense (DOD) in times of crisis. The program allows DOD to tap into the commercial airline industry's capacity to transport passengers and cargo, providing a cost-effective solution for airlift needs. CRAF has been activated twice, during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and has proven to be a valuable asset for DOD.

2. The CRAF program has undergone changes and updates over the years, with recent legislation aiming to improve its viability and effectiveness. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act required a comprehensive assessment of CRAF's viability, including an examination of its operational planning system, reward system, and long-term affordability. The assessment also looked at potential barriers to CRAF's viability, such as increased foreign ownership of US air carriers and limitations imposed by the Secretary of Defense.

3. The study on the size and mix of the airlift force, as required by Section 1046 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, aimed to analyze the full-spectrum lifecycle costs of various airlift capabilities and assess the viability and capability of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet during activation stages. The study also evaluated the state of the current airlift fleet of the Air Force, including assessments of the programmed service life of aircraft and the optimal mix of C-5 and C-17 aircraft. The study's findings and recommendations are expected to inform force structure decisions regarding the optimal mix of DOD's organic air mobility fleets and the CRAF.

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce that serves as the executive branch's principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology policies. It represents the executive branch in both domestic and international telecommunications and information policy activities. The NTIA frequently works with other executive branch agencies to develop and present the Administration's position on key policy matters.

2. The NTIA administers some grants programs, including the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and the Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) grant program. It also oversees the transfer of some radio frequencies from the federal domain to the commercial domain. Many of these frequencies have subsequently been auctioned to the commercial sector and the proceeds paid into the U.S. Treasury.

3. The NTIA supports the Administration's policy goal of increasing spectrum capacity for mobile broadband by 500 MHz. To this purpose, the NTIA has produced a 10-year plan and timetable that identifies bands of spectrum that might be available for commercial wireless broadband service. The plan includes recommendations for making available 15 MHz of spectrum from frequencies between 1695 MHz and 1710 MHz, and 100 MHz of spectrum within bands from 3550 MHz to 3650 MHz.

4. The NTIA is required to work with the FCC to identify specific bands for auction under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The NTIA will also be responsible for collecting auction proceeds and making distributions from a Public Safety Trust Fund that remains in effect through FY2022. The act has also given the NTIA responsibilities to create and support FirstNet in planning, building, and managing a new, nationwide, broadband network for public safety communications.

1. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed by President Bush on August 8, 2005, and it was the first omnibus energy legislation enacted in more than a decade. The major provisions of the act include tax incentives for domestic energy production and energy efficiency, a mandate to double the nation's use of biofuels, and authorization of numerous federal energy research and development programs. The report describes the electricity provisions of the act, which include the Electric Reliability Act of 2005. This act provides federal jurisdiction over activities that are required to support the reliability of the U.S. bulk power system.

2. The Electric Reliability Act of 2005 requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to promulgate rules to create a FERC-certified electric reliability organization (ERO). The ERO will develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system, including cybersecurity protection. The ERO can impose penalties on users, owners, or operators of a bulk power system that violate any FERC-approved reliability standard. FERC can also order compliance with a reliability standard and impose a penalty if it finds that a user, owner, or operator of a bulk power system has engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of a reliability standard.

3. The act also includes provisions for siting of interstate electric transmission facilities, which require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a study of electric transmission congestion every three years. Based on the findings, the Secretary of Energy may designate a geographic area as being congested. FERC is authorized to issue construction permits under certain conditions, and affected states, federal agencies, Indian tribes, property owners, and other interested parties will have an opportunity to present their views and recommendations. The act also allows permit holders to petition in U.S. District Court to acquire rights-of-way through the exercise of the right of eminent domain.

4. The act includes provisions for third-party finance, which allow the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) to participate with other entities for the design, development, construction, operation, maintenance, or ownership of transmission facilities. The project is required to be consistent with the needs identified by the appropriate Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. The Secretary of Energy may also design, develop, construct, operate, maintain, or own an electric power transmission facility in the WAPA and SWPA region.

1. The Robinson-Patman Act (R-P) was enacted in 1936 to create a market atmosphere where small businesses could compete effectively with larger rivals. The act prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality."" It applies only to the sale of goods and not services, and only where each sale is of goods purchased for resale within the United States. The act aims to prevent price discrimination that may substantially lessen competition or create a monopoly.

2. The immediate impetus for the R-P legislation was concern for smaller grocery store operators who complained about the activities of chain grocery stores, particularly the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P). The statute states that it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality. The effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. The act also prohibits price discrimination that may injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination.

3. The Department of Justice has been less than enthusiastic about the R-P act, believing it is not beneficial to consumers. The act has been criticized for having many adverse effects on the economy, including limiting the extent of discounting and causing consumers to pay higher prices. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been entrusted with the enforcement of the act, but has acted inconsistently over the years. The bulk of R-P cases have generally been brought by disfavored buyers.

4. A seller may successfully defend against an allegation of unlawful price differentials under the R-P act if they can show that their price differentials were ""cost justified"" or ""meeting competition."" The ""meeting competition"" defense has two levels: primary line competition and secondary line competition. A seller may not knowingly ""beat"" the prices of a competitor. The 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act created a broad exemption from the general price-discrimination prohibition for certain institutions.

5. The Nonprofit Institutions Act permits price breaks on purchases of supplies for the own use of schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions not operated for profit. The Supreme Court has interpreted the ""for their own use"" phrase in the Nonprofit Institutions Act strictly, holding that not all purchases made by a nonprofit hospital are necessarily exempt from price discrimination prohibitions. The exemption is applicable only to those purchases made in order to enable the hospital",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The Obama Administration has faced significant scrutiny for its nonenforcement, under enforcement, or delayed enforcement decisions, which have generally been implemented through stated agency policies directing officials not to take action to ensure compliance with statutory requirements. These policies have been grounded in practical or policy considerations, and have not been based on any argument that the statutory provisions themselves are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

2. The Administration has largely justified its inaction as consistent with a proper exercise of enforcement discretion, a legal doctrine that generally shields executive branch enforcement decisions from judicial review. This report focuses on two distinct forms of enforcement discretion: prosecutorial discretion, exercised in the criminal context; and administrative enforcement discretion, exercised in the administrative context.

3. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has cited prosecutorial discretion as the basis for its efforts to curtail the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in states that have adopted both medical and recreational marijuana legalization initiatives. The DOJ has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize investigative and prosecutorial resources on persons whose actions relate to identified federal priorities.

4. The Secretary of Homeland Security relied on the doctrine of administrative enforcement discretion in a memorandum setting forth guidelines on how to enforce the Nation's immigration laws against certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home. The directive provided that immigration officers should exercise their discretion to forego enforcement actions against a specific class of individuals.

5. The Administration utilized enforcement discretion to justify delays in the enforcement of a number of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the law's employer mandate and minimum coverage requirements. The Treasury Department announced that enforcement of the ACA's new excise tax on employers with 50 or more employees that fail to provide affordable health coverage would be delayed for one year.

6. Some Members of Congress have asserted that these unilateral Presidential nonenforcement determinations upset the separation of powers, harm Congress as an institution and a coordinate branch of government, and are in direct violation of the President's constitutional obligation to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."" The House has held hearings addressing the issue and has approved legislation that would require the Administration to provide Congress with a report describing the legal grounds for any nonenforcement decisions.

7. The President's general obligation to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed"" is a constitutional duty that has been interpreted as placing an obligation on both the President and those under his supervision to comply with and execute clear statutory directives as enacted by Congress. The Take Care Clause has been invoked",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18}"

The poverty rate increased each year from 2001 through 2004 due to economic recession. The poverty rate remained well above pre-recession levels even as the economy recovered. The unemployment rate has generally been falling since late 2009, but poverty has remained high.

2. The poverty rate among non-aged adults (persons age 18 to 64) reached 13.8% in 2010, the highest since the early 1960s. In 2013, the non-aged poverty rate remained statistically unchanged from the prior three years. The poverty rate for non-aged adults will need to fall to 10.8% to reach its 2006 pre-recession level. The 2013 poverty data provide an encouraging sign with respect to children, with both the estimated number of poor children and their poverty rate falling from 2012 to 2013.

3. The poverty rate among children fell from 21.3% in 2012 to 19.5% in 2013, with an estimated 1.3 million fewer children poor in 2013. The 2013 child poverty rate is still well above its pre-recession low of 16.9% (2006). Child poverty appears to be especially sensitive to economic cycles, with a loss of work by one parent putting the family at risk of falling into poverty. Roughly one-third of all children in the country live with only one parent, making them more prone to poverty.

4. The poverty rate among the aged (persons age 65 and over) was 9.5% in 2013, statistically unchanged from 2012. The number of aged poor grew by 305,000 from 2012 to 2013. Among persons age 75 and over, 11.2% were poor in 2013. Measured by a slightly raised poverty standard (125% of the poverty threshold), 15.1% of the aged could be considered poor or ""near poor"" in 2013.

1. The U.S. agricultural sector plays a critical role in international trade, with exports accounting for about 20% of total U.S. agricultural production. The United States is subject to intense scrutiny for compliance with current WTO rules and its potential to diminish the success of future multilateral negotiations. The farm bill, which is renewed every five or six years, locks in U.S. policy behavior for an extended period.

2. The current omnibus farm bill, the Agricultural Act of 2014, made several substantial changes to the previous farm safety net of the 2008 farm bill, with most of its agricultural provisions set to expire on September 30, 2018. The farm bill will either be replaced with new legislation, temporarily extended, or allowed to lapse and be replaced with ""permanent law."" The most recent U.S. notification to the WTO of domestic support outlays was made on December 8, 2014, for the 2012 crop year.

3. The World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements governing agriculture and trade, including the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), are paramount in disciplining domestic agricultural support. The AoA sets country-specific aggregate spending limits on the most market-distorting policies and defines general rules covering trade among member countries. Domestic policies or programs found to be in violation of WTO rules may be subject to challenge by another WTO member under the WTO dispute settlement process.

4. The AoA categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs according to their potential to distort commercial markets, with amber box subsidies subject to spending limits. Green box programs are minimally or non-trade distorting and not subject to any spending limits, while blue box programs are production-limiting and also not subject to any payment limits. The United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays.

5. The SCM details rules for determining when a subsidy is ""prohibited"" or ""actionable,"" with the key aspect being the degree to which a domestic support program engenders market distortion. The SCM evaluates the ""market distortion"" of a program or policy in terms of its measurable market effects on the international trade and/or market price for the affected commodity. Challenged subsidies that are found to be prohibited or actionable must be stopped or withdrawn ""without delay"" in accordance with a timetable laid out by a WTO panel.

1. The campus-based programs, which include the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program, the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program, are collectively referred to as the ""campus-based"" programs. These programs are considered campus-based because federal funds are awarded directly to institutions of higher education (IHEs) that administer the programs and provide institutional funds to match the federal funds they receive for them.

2. The campus-based programs are unique in that the mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined according to institution-specific award criteria, rather than according to non-discretionary award criteria such as those applicable to Pell Grants and Direct Loans. This approach allows institutions to have more flexibility in awarding aid to students.

3. The authorizations of appropriations for the campus-based programs expired at the end of FY2015, but the programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills. The FSEOG and FWS programs have been funded through the Continuing Appropriations Act 2018, while the Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015.

4. The campus-based programs are among the oldest of the federal financial aid programs, and they have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort. In FY2016, 76% of federal aid was made available through the Direct Loan program, 21% through the Pell Grant program, and 2% through the campus-based aid programs.

5. The campus-based programs were designed to provide students who demonstrated financial need with aid to help meet the costs of postsecondary education. However, the programs now operate amidst a host of other financial aid programs and tax benefits that are available for postsecondary students.

6. Some have proposed eliminating one or more of the campus-based programs that could be considered to be duplicative of or overlapping with other aid programs. These proposals sometimes identify the FSEOG program and the Perkins Loan program as candidates for elimination.

7. The campus-based programs are unique in that institutions participating in the programs are required to provide a partial match of the federal funds received. This institutional match means that more aid is made available to students for each federal dollar provided.

8. The formula for allocating funds to institutions that participate in the campus-based programs is a two-stage process, with a base guarantee and a fair share allocation.

1. The September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon drew attention to the security of many institutions, facilities, and systems in the United States, including the nation's water supply and water quality infrastructure. These systems have long been recognized as being potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks of various types. Damage or destruction by terrorist attack could disrupt the delivery of vital human services in this country, threatening public health and the environment, or possibly causing loss of life. The potential for terrorism is not new, as Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote in 1941 that water supply facilities offer a particularly vulnerable point of attack to the foreign agent.

2. Water infrastructure systems are highly linked with other infrastructure systems, especially electric power and transportation, as well as the chemical industry which supplies treatment chemicals, making security of all of them an issue of concern. These types of vulnerable interconnections were evident during the August 2003 electricity blackout in the Northeast United States and the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Broadly speaking, water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources of untreated water for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and household needs. Across the country, these systems comprise approximately 77,000 dams and reservoirs, thousands of miles of pipes, aqueducts, water distribution, and sewer lines.

3. The federal government has ownership responsibility for hundreds of dams and diversion structures, but the vast majority of the nation's water infrastructure is either privately owned or owned by non-federal units of government. The federal government has built hundreds of water projects, primarily dams and reservoirs for irrigation development and flood control, with municipal and industrial water use as an incidental, self-financed, project purpose. Many of these facilities are critically entwined with the nation's overall water supply, transportation, and electricity infrastructure. The largest federal facilities were built and are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Attacks resulting in physical destruction to any of these systems could include disruption of operating or distribution system components, power or telecommunications systems, electronic control systems, and actual damage to reservoirs and pumping stations.

1. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV) was signed into law on August 12, 2006, and it reauthorizes and amends the Perkins Act. The act provides funding for career and technical education (CTE) programs and activities. Perkins IV retains the overall purpose of the act, making only technical changes. The act authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for FY2007-FY2012 for Perkins Act programs and activities.

2. Perkins IV modifies the state allotment formula when there are ""additional funds"" above the amount allotted to states for FY2006. The formula changes are triggered by funds in excess of the FY2006 base amount, which is calculated by subtracting set-asides from the total appropriation. Up to one-third of the ""additional funds"" would be allotted to states with FY2006 grants that are less than the minimum grant amount of ½% of the current-year funds allotted to states. The remaining funds would be allotted to the other states based on the underlying formula.

3. Perkins IV requires states to distribute at least 85% of state grant funds to the local level, and states may reserve up to 10% of the funds distributed to the local level for eligible recipients in rural areas and in areas with high percentages or high numbers of CTE students. States have complete discretion in how much of local funding is distributed for CTE at the secondary level versus postsecondary CTE. States may reserve up to 5% of their grants for ""administration of the State plan."" Perkins IV continues to require states to match administrative funds ""on a dollar-for-dollar basis.""

4. Perkins IV establishes six explicit core indicators of performance at the secondary level, including student attainment of challenging academic content standards and student academic achievement standards. The second core indicator of performance must measure student attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies. The third core indicator of performance requires eligible agencies to measure student rates of attainment of a secondary school diploma. The fourth core indicator of performance requires eligible agencies to measure student graduation rates as required under Title I-A of the ESEA.

5. Perkins IV requires eligible agencies and eligible recipients to submit annual reports detailing their progress in meeting their adjusted levels of performance on the core indicators of performance. The reports must be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, migrant status, English proficiency, and status as economically disadvantaged.

Cabo Verde is a small island nation in West Africa with historical ties to the United States, and its relations with the US are based on its status as a model of democratic governance and a key partner in the region. The country has a high per capita income, a high literacy rate, and positive social indicators, making it an important partner for the US. Cabo Verde's strategic location has made it a transshipment point for Latin American cocaine bound for Europe.

2. The US-Cabo Verdean cooperation focuses on counternarcotics efforts, military professionalization, and development projects, with the country being eligible for tariff preferences under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The Open Skies commercial aviation and flight safety and security agreement between the two countries has also been established. Cabo Verde has a small national military of about 1,000 personnel, including a small coast guard.

3. The country's political system takes into account its large expatriate population, whose remittances are a key source of private investment and hard currency. Expatriates may vote in national elections, and foreign nationals resident in Cabo Verde are eligible to vote in local elections. Cabo Verde became a democracy in 1991, following increasing demands for a multi-party political system.

4. The Movement for Democracy (MPD) won a large parliamentary majority, the presidency, and multiple municipal elections in 1991, and has continued to dominate politics since then. The MPD has pursued an economic reform-focused agenda, seeking to privatize state-owned firms, reform public spending, and alleviate poverty. The party has also sought to promote political pluralism and increase and diversify Cabo Verde's trade and development relations with other countries.

5. In the most recent parliamentary elections, the MPD won 40 seats, the PAICV 29, and the small Independent and Democratic Cabo Verdean Union three. The MPD victory ended 15 consecutive years of PAICV parliamentary majorities.

1. The U.S. Constitution establishes two methods by which Presidents may appoint officers of the United States: with the advice and consent of the Senate, or unilaterally ""during the Recess of the Senate."" These two constitutional provisions have long served as sources of political tension between Presidents and Congresses.

2. President Obama's difficulty in obtaining Senate confirmation of nominations for the Directorship of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) and Members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is a prime example of this tension. The President formally nominated Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the CFPB on July 18, 2011.

3. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs approved Cordray's nomination for a full vote of the Senate, but the Senate fell seven votes shy of the 60-vote threshold necessary to reach cloture and move to a vote on the nomination. The NLRB, an agency with certain powers to investigate and adjudicate unfair labor practices, consists of up to five officials who are to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

4. President Obama nominated Terrence F. Flynn, Sharon Block, and Richard F. Griffin Jr. to be Board members, but the Senate did not confirm any of the nominees before the third member's term expired. Following Senate inaction, the President reportedly considered making recess appointments should the Senate go into recess.

5. The Senate held ""pro forma"" sessions, which are intended to prevent the existence of a Senate recess sufficient to permit the President to exercise his constitutional authority to unilaterally appoint officers. These pro forma sessions typically are governed by unanimous consent agreements of the Senate that prohibit the chamber from conducting any formal business.

6. The President, asserting his authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, announced his intent to appoint Cordray to serve as the first CFPB Director and Block, Griffin Jr., and Flynn, to be members of the NLRB. The appointments occurred in the time between pro forma sessions on January 3 and January 6, 2012.

7. A reviewing court would first consider a number of preliminary questions of justiciability, including whether the plaintiffs who have brought the claim have standing and whether the asserted claims present matters appropriately resolved by a court.

1. The principle of a republic is that the people should choose whom they please to govern them, which is embodied in congressional redistricting, the drawing of district boundaries from which the people choose their representatives to the U.S. House of Representatives.
2. Prior to the 1960s, court challenges to redistricting plans were considered non-justiciable political questions, but in 1962, the Supreme Court held that a constitutional challenge to a redistricting plan was not a political question and was justiciable.
3. The Supreme Court has since issued a series of rulings balancing the competing commands of the Constitution, federal law, and state processes, significantly shaping how congressional districts are drawn.
4. The Court has clarified that the ""one person, one vote"" standard requires congressional districts to be drawn with approximately the same population, and that states must justify population deviation among districts with ""legitimate state objectives.""
5. The Court has also held that the ""as nearly as practicable"" standard does not require congressional districts to be drawn with precise mathematical equality, but instead requires states to demonstrate that population differences were needed to achieve a legitimate state objective.
6. In the case of Evenwel v. Abbott, the Supreme Court upheld a state's decision to draw its legislative districts based on total population, but declined to rule on the constitutionality of drawing district lines based on eligible or registered voters.
7. The creation of one or more ""majority-minority"" districts may be required in a congressional redistricting plan to avoid racial vote dilution and the denial of minority voters' equal opportunity to elect candidates of choice.
8. Congressional redistricting plans must also conform with standards of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and if race is the predominant factor in the drawing of district lines, a ""strict scrutiny"" standard of review is applied.

1. The severe fire seasons in the past decade have led to substantial debate and proposals related to fire protection programs and funding. President Clinton proposed a new National Fire Plan in 2000 to increase funding to protect federal, state, and private lands. Congress largely enacted this request, and the severe 2002 fire season led President Bush to propose a Healthy Forests Initiative to expedite fuel reduction on federal lands.

2. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act was enacted in 2003 to expedite fuel reduction on federal lands and to authorize other forest protection programs. In 2009, Congress enacted the Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement (FLAME) Act to insulate other agency programs from high wildfire suppression costs. Wildfire funding has continued at relatively high levels since 2000.

3. The total wildfire funding for FY2008 was a record high of $4.46 billion, and the high costs of firefighting continue to attract attention. The report briefly describes the three categories of federal programs for wildfire protection, including protection of federal lands, non-federal lands, and fire research, fire facilities, and improvements in forest health. The last section of the report discusses issues associated with the high wildfire costs, including pending legislation.

4. The Forest Service (FS) was created in 1905 with the merger of the USDA Bureau of Forestry and the Forestry Division of the General Land Office. The agency developed its 10-acre policy in 1926, aiming to keep wildfires small, and the 10:00 a.m. policy in 1935, focusing on control before the next burning period began. The aggressive FS fire control policies began to be questioned in the 1970s.

5. Research had documented that, in some situations, wildfires brought ecological benefits to the burned areas, aiding regeneration of native flora, improving the habitat of native fauna, and reducing infestations of pests and of exotic and invasive species. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) challenged proposed budget increases based on FS policies, and a subsequent study suggested that the fire control policies would increase expenditures beyond efficient levels. The Clinton Administration directed a review of federal fire policy in 1995.

6. The report recommended altering federal fire policy from priority for private property to equal priority for private property and federal resources, based on values at risk. Concerns about wildfire threats persist, and the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued two reports in 1999 recommending a cohesive wildfire protection strategy for the FS and a combined strategy",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21}"

3. Mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local government employees is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds, closing 8-9% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall.
4. The Bipartisan Policy Center and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform have recommended mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees to increase the universality of the program.
5. Mandatory Social Security coverage could simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who divide their careers between state and local government positions and other positions.
6. Opponents argue that mandatory Social Security coverage would not necessarily result in better benefit protections for workers, as state and local governments could reduce some pension benefits currently available under non-covered pension plans.
7. Mandating Social Security coverage for all public employees would impose significant administrative burdens on state and local governments, including communicating with employees and actuarial reviews.

OPM established the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) with coverage first available on December 31, 2006.

2. Eligible individuals for FEDVIP include federal employees, Members of Congress, annuitants, survivor annuitants, compensationers, and their eligible family members, such as spouses and unmarried dependent children under age 22.

1. A sitting Member of the United States Senate is not directly affected by a federal statute, constitutional provision, or Rule of the Senate upon being indicted for a felony. The Senate's internal party rules may be relevant, and the Senate Republican Conference Rules require an indicted chairman or ranking Member to temporarily step aside from their leadership or chairmanship position. However, the Member's service in Congress would otherwise continue.

2. Members of Congress do not automatically forfeit their offices even upon conviction of a crime that constitutes a felony. There is no express constitutional disability or ""disqualification"" from Congress for the conviction of a crime, other than under the Fourteenth Amendment for certain treasonous conduct after having taken an oath of office. Under party rules, Members may lose their chairmanships of committees or ranking Member status upon conviction of a felony.

3. Conviction of certain crimes may subject Senators to internal legislative disciplinary proceedings, including resolutions of censure, as well as expulsion from the Senate upon approval of two-thirds of the Members. Expulsion of a Member from Congress does not result in the forfeiture or loss of one's federal pension, but the Member's conviction of certain crimes may lead to such forfeiture of retirement annuities. The Member's conviction may also lead to the loss of all ""creditable service"" as a Member that one would have earned towards a federal pension.

4. Indictment and/or conviction of a crime that is a felony does not constitutionally disqualify one from being a Member of Congress, unless a Member's conviction is for certain treasonous conduct committed after taking an oath of office to support the Constitution. The constitutional qualifications for congressional office are age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state when elected. These qualifications are the exclusive qualifications for being a Member of Congress.

5. The Senate has demonstrated that in cases of conviction of a Member of crimes that relate to official misconduct, the institution need not wait until all the Senator's appeals are exhausted, but that the Senate may independently investigate and adjudicate the underlying factual circumstances involved in the judicial proceedings. The Senate has significant discretion to discipline misconduct that the membership finds to be worthy of censure, reprimand, or expulsion from Congress. The authority to expel would thus be used cautiously when the institution of Congress might be seen as usurping or supplanting its own institutional judgment for the judgment of the electorate as to the character or fitness for office of an individual whom the people have chosen to represent them in Congress.

1. The United States has approximately 766 million acres of forestlands, with 58% (445 million acres) being privately owned by individuals, families, Native American tribes, corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other groups. The federal government has numerous programs to support forest management on private and public forests. These programs are primarily administered by the Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), often with the assistance of state partner agencies. The FS has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance.

2. The Forest Service Assistance Programs have been a component of USDA's programs for over a century, with initial forestry assistance efforts beginning in 1881. The programs have grown and evolved over time, with the creation of the USDA Forest Service (FS) in 1905. The FS has jurisdiction over forestry in general, forestry assistance, and forestry research programs, with the Senate and House Agriculture Committees having oversight. The 2008 farm bill established national funding priorities and a standardized process for states to assess forest resource conditions and strategize about funding needs.

3. To be eligible to receive funds for most of the programs, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, consisting of a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term statewide forest resource strategy. The State Forest Action Plans are reviewed every 5 years and revised every 10 years. The forestry programs may provide technical assistance, financial assistance, or both, with technical assistance including guidance documents, skills training, data, or sharing information, expertise, and advice. Financial assistance is typically delivered through formula or competitive grants or cost-sharing.

4. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, with the average annual appropriation from FY2004 through FY2018 being $362.7 million. The Administration requested $197.4 million in FY2019 and proposed to eliminate funding for seven of the programs and decreased funding for the others. Some FS programs have been repealed by previous farm bills, or have gone unfunded by Congress for several years. Other agencies, inside and outside of USDA, also administer programs that may have forest conservation or protection benefits, such as the USDA Farm Services Agency and the Department of the Interior.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. Transnational organized crime groups in Burma engage in various illicit activities, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, gun smuggling, wildlife trafficking, gem and timber smuggling, and money laundering. These groups operate with relative impunity due to corruption among officials in the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). The country's extra-legal economy is reportedly so large that an accurate assessment of its size and structure is unavailable.

2. The SPDC's corruption and lack of effective law enforcement create a low-risk environment for contraband trafficking, with smugglers using the same routes for multiple forms of trafficking. Synergistic links connect various forms of contraband trafficking, with smugglers following paths of least resistance where corruption and lax law enforcement prevail. This has led to the development of ""ungoverned spaces"" along Burma's borders, where governments have difficulty establishing control or are complicit in the corruption of the rule of law.

3. The State Department lists Burma as a major drug-producing state, and the country is barred access to U.S. foreign assistance under several legislative provisions. Congress has also authorized sanctions against countries that do not comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons, which includes Burma. The 110th Congress passed the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, imposing further sanctions on SPDC officials and prohibiting the indirect import of Burmese gems.

4. The U.S. State Department and other observers indicate that corruption is common among the bureaucracy and military in Burma, with officials involved in smuggling, money laundering, and corruption. Burma has no laws on record specifically related to corruption and has signed but not ratified the U.N. Convention against Corruption. The country is reported to be the third-most corrupt country in the world, according to Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index.

5. The State Department states that Burma's weak implementation of anti-money laundering controls remains at the root of the continued use by narcotics traffickers and other criminal elements of Burmese financial institutions. Some reports indicate that Burmese military officials have benefitted financially from the earnings of transnational crime organizations, with some even directly involved in opium poppy cultivation. The SPDC reportedly allows and encourages traffickers to invest in domestic businesses, receiving start-up fees and taxes from these enterprises.

1. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has had a significant impact on federal mandatory spending, with most of the projected spending going towards expanding health insurance coverage.
2. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reported that spending on premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions totaled $79.2 billion for the first three fiscal years (FY2014-FY2016) in which the ACA exchanges were operational.
3. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that gross spending on insurance coverage expansion under the ACA will total $1.938 trillion over the 10-year period FY2017 through FY2026.
4. The ACA also included numerous appropriations that provided billions of dollars in mandatory funds to support new and existing grant programs and other activities.
5. The law established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) within CMS and appropriated $10 billion for the FY2011-FY2019 period—and $10 billion for each subsequent 10-year period—for CMMI to test and implement innovative payment and service delivery models.
6. The ACA created four special funds and appropriated substantial amounts to each one, including the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF), and the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF).
7. The ACA provided more than $100 billion in mandatory appropriations and Medicare fund transfers over the 10-year period FY2010-FY2019.
8. Congress extended funding for several programs funded by the ACA, including health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and CHIP, and partially reduced or rescinded ACA funding for IPAB, PPHF, and the CO-OP program.
9. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) established two budget enforcement mechanisms to reduce federal spending by at least $2.1 trillion over the 10-year period FY2012 through FY2021.

1. The increased presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs has been a concern for some in the scientific community, as enrollment of U.S. citizens in these programs has not kept pace. This has led to debates about the impact of foreign students on the U.S. workforce and the need for stricter immigration limits.

2. Approximately 56% of foreign doctorate degree earners on temporary visas remain in the United States, with many eventually becoming citizens. Data on adjustments from temporary visas to permanent status reveal that approximately 6 in 10 new permanent residents occurred in both 2007 and 2008 from adjustments of status admissions.

3. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that between the years 2006 and 2016, employment in science and engineering fields will increase at a faster rate than other professional groups. The growth rate will result, primarily, from growth in mathematics and computer-related occupations.

4. The 1990 Immigration Act more than doubled employment-based immigration, including scientists and engineers entering under the H-1B visa category. The act raised the numerical limits or ceilings on permanent, employment-based admissions, from 54,000 to 140,000 annually.

5. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 significantly changed the H-1B program and the employment-based immigration program. The legislation raised the annual number of H-1B visas to 195,000 for FY2001, FY2002, and FY2003, and returned to 65,000 in FY2004.

6. The scientific community has been divided over proposals to impose stricter immigration limits on people with scientific and technical skills. Attempts to settle upon the balance between the needs for a highly skilled scientific and technical workforce, and the need to protect and ensure job opportunities, salaries, and working conditions of U.S. scientific personnel, will continue to be debated.

1. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2008 by an unknown programmer or group of programmers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and it has since become a widely recognized and rapidly proliferating financial instrument. Cryptocurrencies are digital money in an electronic payment system that is validated by a decentralized network of system users and cryptographic protocols instead of by a centralized intermediary.

2. The primary function of money is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services, and it serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. To function as a medium of exchange, the thing must be tradable and agreed to have value, and to function as a unit of account, the thing must act as a good measurement system.

3. Traditional monetary systems have evolved over time, with early forms of money being things that had intrinsic value, such as precious metals. Fiat money, on the other hand, has no intrinsic value but derives its value by government decree.

4. Cryptocurrencies provide an alternative to traditional electronic payment systems, using a decentralized network of computers to validate transactions and a public ledger to record transactions. This system is designed to be more secure and transparent than traditional payment systems.

5. The use of cryptocurrencies as money is still limited compared to traditional systems, with a relatively small number of businesses or individuals using or accepting cryptocurrency for payment. The recent high volatility in the price of many cryptocurrencies undermines their ability to serve as a unit of account and a store of value.

6. Policymakers are concerned about the potential risks posed by cryptocurrencies, including the potential for them to be used to facilitate criminal activity and the lack of consumer protections applicable to parties buying or using cryptocurrency. Existing laws and regulations may not be adequate to address these risks, and new policies may be needed to regulate the industry.

7. The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could affect the ability of central banks to implement and transmit monetary policy, and some have suggested that central banks could issue their own digital, fiat currencies, known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs could provide certain benefits, such as increased efficiency and stability, but also raise concerns about their potential impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy.

8. The future role and value of cryptocurrencies remain highly uncertain, due mainly to unanswered questions about their ability to effectively and efficiently serve the functions of money and displace existing money and payment systems. Proponents of the technology assert that cryptocurrencies will become a widely used payment method and provide increased economic efficiency, privacy, and",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

1. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is used by financially troubled business debtors to reorganize their financial affairs and remain in business. In a chapter 11 reorganization, the debtor generally remains in possession and no trustee is appointed, allowing those familiar with the business to continue managing it. The Bankruptcy Code provides debtors the opportunity to assume or reject executory contracts, including collective bargaining agreements (CBAs).

2. Collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) are treated somewhat differently than other executory contracts, and rejection of a CBA must meet a higher standard. Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code provides the procedures for rejecting a CBA, and recently introduced legislation, H.R. 3652, would modify several sections of the Bankruptcy Code, including § 1113. The proposed changes aim to address the inequities in the bankruptcy process and recognize the unique firm-specific investment by employees and retirees in their employers' business.

3. H.R. 3652 proposes a number of changes to existing subsections of 11 U.S.C. § 1113, including adding six new subsections, and would entirely replace the text of the first three subsections. The bill's language may be clarifying the Code rather than substantively changing it, or it may be intended to legislate resolution of some point of law that has been disputed in the courts. The proposed changes will be discussed in order, subsection by subsection, with accompanying discussion about the current state of the law.

4. The bill would limit the modifications to the existing CBA that can be proposed by the debtor, requiring that proposals be limited to those that would (1) limit the effect of the labor group's financial concessions to no more than two years after the effective date of the plan, (2) be the minimum savings the debtor needs to successfully reorganize, and (3) not put too great a burden on the labor group. Current law puts no time limit on the duration of the effects a debtor's proposed modifications to a CBA may have on the relevant affected labor group. The bill would prohibit court approval of rejection unless the debtor's proposals for modification were in compliance with the proposed limitations.

5. The bill's second requirement for debtors' proposals is that they must ""be no more than the minimal savings necessary to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy such that confirmation of such plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation of the debtor.""

1. The distinction between net job loss and gross job loss is crucial in understanding the labor market dynamics, with net job loss being the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains in a given period, and gross job loss being the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting firms in a given period.

2. The U.S. labor market is characterized by net job creation amidst gross job loss in expansions, and it is only during recessions that the overall labor market experiences persistent net job loss, which is viewed as a detrimental phenomenon by economists.

3. The quarterly data series from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides data that help to put the distinction between gross and net job loss into perspective, showing that gross job loss and gains are each, on average, around 20 times higher than net job loss in any given quarter.

4. The rate of job gains increased steadily from the beginning of the series in 1992 until the end of 1999, while job losses increased steadily from 1992 to 2001, indicating that the U.S. labor force is becoming more mobile over time.

5. Trade liberalization has no effect on net employment, as seen in Figure 3, which shows that employment has steadily increased during the post-war period, and the unemployment rate has mirrored the business cycle, not trade patterns.

6. The trade deficit causes gross job gains in the sectors that produce plant, equipment, housing, and interest-sensitive goods, all else equal, which offsets the gross job loss caused by higher imports, resulting in no net job loss.

7. Policymakers can use expansionary monetary policy or expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate aggregate spending and offset net job loss, but direct job creation programs have a similar effect to any expansionary fiscal policy and are prone to implementation lags.

8. The government's role in insuring workers against the risks associated with gross job loss can be viewed through a broader prism than the unemployment insurance program, including disability insurance, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and income redistribution.

9. Public policies to protect workers against the risks posed by gross job loss can be justified on both social and economic grounds, as they have been shown not to reduce gross job gains and can arguably raise efficiency by addressing market failures.

Shinzo Abe has been Japan's prime minister since December 2012, and in 2017, he succeeded in extending the LDP's term-limit rules for party president from two consecutive three-year terms to three consecutive terms. Abe's victory in the LDP leadership contest means that he will continue serving as premier.

2. Abe's new Cabinet includes one woman, down from two, despite Abe's campaign to increase women's representation in government and participation in the workforce. Abe's next electoral test will come in July 2019, when half the seats of Japan's Upper House of the bicameral legislature will be chosen.

3. The U.S.-Japan relationship has been strengthened by a shared approach to confronting the North Korean threat, with Abe and Trump presenting a united front on dealing with Pyongyang's nuclear weapon test and multiple missile launches. However, Trump's shift on North Korea has increased questions among Japanese policymakers about the depth and durability of the U.S. commitment to Japan's security.

4. U.S. trade policy under the Trump Administration has strained U.S. trade relations with Japan, which accounted for $70 billion or 9% of the total U.S. goods trade deficit in 2017. The Administration has proclaimed increased tariffs and other import restrictions under rarely used U.S. trade laws.

The Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for providing medical care to noncitizens in its custody, but there have been concerns about the quality of care and access to medical services. The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS) is ultimately responsible for the provision of health care to noncitizens detained by ICE, but its policies and procedures have been criticized for being inadequate. The DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package (CSP) primarily provides health care services for emergencies only.

2. The ICE Detention Standards, which are published in the Detention Operations Manual, outline the minimum requirements for medical care, but they do not have the force of law, and detainees do not have legal recourse for violations of the standards. The standards require that detainees receive an initial health screening immediately upon arrival at the detention facility, as well as a health appraisal and physical examination within 14 days of arrival. However, there have been reports of problems with detainees being transferred without their medical records.

3. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) have conducted audits of detention facilities and found instances of non-compliance with the medical care standards, including failure to provide timely initial medical care and failure to administer medical screening immediately after admission. The OIG recommended that ICE develop specific criteria to define a reasonable time for medical treatment, but ICE has not implemented this recommendation. The quality of oversight when a death occurs in detention is also a concern, and there are doubts about the propriety of using deaths in detention as a reliable measure of standard of care.

1. Congress has used commemoratives to express public gratitude for distinguished contributions, dramatize the virtues of individuals, groups, and causes, and perpetuate the remembrance of significant events since its inception. The first commemoratives were primarily in the form of individually struck medals. During the 19th century, Congress gradually broadened the scope of commemoratives by recommending special days for national observance, funding monuments and memorials, creating federal holidays, and authorizing the minting of commemorative coins. In the 20th century, it became increasingly commonplace for Congress to use commemorative legislation to name buildings and other public works, scholarships, endowments, fellowships, and historic sites.

2. Commemorative options available to Congress are divided into those that require legislation and those that do not. Types of commemoratives requiring legislative action include naming federal buildings, creating postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding Congressional Gold Medals, authorizing monuments and memorials, establishing commemorative commissions, and requesting presidential proclamations. Nonlegislative options include sending certificates of recognition, making floor speeches, and sending flags flown over the Capitol Building to constituents. These options can be used to honor individuals, groups, and events without the need for legislative approval.

3. Efforts to curb commemoratives can be divided into two categories: creating an advisory commission to recommend appropriate commemorations and amending congressional rules on the introduction and consideration of commemorative legislation. Between the 89th Congress and the 104th Congress, several proposals were introduced to shift the responsibility of recommending commemorative celebrations to a presidential commission. The House Rules Committee adopted a new rule to reduce the number of commemorative bills and resolutions introduced and considered by the chamber. House Rule XII, clause 5, prohibits the introduction and consideration of date-specific commemorative legislation.

4. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has a rule against considering legislation that proposes the issuance of commemorative stamps. Committee Rule 13 states that the determination of the subject matter of commemorative stamps and new semi-postal issues is properly for consideration by the Postmaster General. The Postmaster General has used his discretionary authority to create a semipostal stamp to help raise funds to fight Alzheimer's disease. The House Committee on Financial Services has adopted a committee rule to prohibit the scheduling of a subcommittee hearing on commemorative coin legislation unless it was cosponsored by at least two-thirds of the Members of the House.

6. The U.S.-Vietnam nuclear cooperation agreement has been the end-goal of engagement in the nuclear field since the 2010 Memorandum of Understanding, and it is seen as expanding another bridge in the growing network of links between the two countries. The agreement reflects the strength and breadth of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership.

7. The Obama Administration has expressed concerns about human rights in Vietnam, and the two countries have often disagreed in the formal human rights dialogue. However, bilateral differences over human rights have not prevented the United States and Vietnam from improving the overall relationship.

8. The U.S.-Vietnam nuclear cooperation agreement complies with all the terms of the Atomic Energy Act as amended and is a ""non-exempt"" agreement. This means that it may enter into force after the 90th day of continuous session following its submittal to Congress unless a joint resolution disapproving the agreement is enacted",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 14}"

1. In 2005, North Korea escalated the security situation on the Korean peninsula through words and actions, including announcing that it had nuclear weapons and suspending participation in the Six-Party Talks, a multilateral negotiation forum dedicated to the peaceful denuclearization of North Korea.
2. Despite a joint statement of principles agreed to in September by all parties, which committed North Korea to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, the talks stalled again, and hostile rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang intensified, with the U.S. labeling North Korea a ""criminal regime"" and likening it to Nazi Germany.
3. Meanwhile, North Korea continued to allow periodic visits by non-Administration officials and specialists, and Pyongyang-Seoul relations advanced toward stronger cooperation, with major progress achieved in developing the Kaesong Industrial Zone and inter-Korean trade topping $1 billion in 2005.

1. The study compared two methods for increasing proteome coverage: repetitive LC-MS/MS runs and an additional protein level separation step using microsol ief. The results showed that the 3-d method, which included microsol ief, provided superior protein and peptide coverage compared to the 2-d method with repetitive runs. This method identified 3486 proteins with two or more peptides, which is 22% more than the 2-d method.

2. The study also evaluated the reproducibility of protein lists between the two methods and found that the apparent differences in protein identifications were due to limitations of current sequence databases and protein naming conventions, as well as software limitations for filtering database search results and building consensus protein lists. The 3-d method had a higher reproducibility of protein lists compared to the 2-d method. The study suggests that additional prefractionation with microsol ief is a more efficient use of mass spectrometer instrument time for increasing proteome coverage.

1. The study aimed to compare the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (SMUPPP) procedures. The study reviewed the medical records of 404 patients who underwent either tonsillectomy or SMUPPP at their institution between 2001 and 2010. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of 198 patients who underwent tonsillectomy, and Group 2 consisted of 206 patients who underwent SMUPPP. The study found that the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was 5.05% in Group 1 and 1.45% in Group 2.

2. The study also found that the incidence of delayed hemorrhage requiring surgical treatment was 4.54% in Group 1 and 0.97% in Group 2. The study suggested that the SMUPPP technique may have a lower incidence of postoperative delayed hemorrhage compared to tonsillectomy using unipolar cautery. The study also found that suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP seemed to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding. The study recommended the routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.",1,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. The morbidity of breast cancer is increasing, and a growing number of young people are at risk for this disease, making early detection and accurate analysis of molecular biology characteristics crucial. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in the invasion and development of breast cancer, and their expression levels can be used as markers for early diagnosis.

2. The study investigated the function of miRNAs in breast cancer, focusing on the expression levels of miR-125a, miR-206, miR-145, miR-21, and miR-10b in breast cancer tissues and para-carcinoma tissues. The results showed that the expression levels of miR-125a, miR-206, and miR-145 were lower in breast cancer tissues than in para-carcinoma tissues.

3. The study found that miR-145 was negatively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis, while miR-21 was positively related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and positive HER-2 expression. The results also showed that miR-21 was an independent prognostic factor of breast cancer.

4. The study suggested that miR-145 and miR-206 may be involved in the suppression of breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and may be used as new target spots in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. The results also showed that miR-145 and miR-206 were related to negative ER and negative HER-2.

5. The study concluded that miR-125a, miR-206, miR-145, miR-21, and miR-10b are highly expected to be novel tumor markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer, and may contribute to the development of treatment methods for TNBC and HER-2-positive breast cancer cells. Further investigations are needed to verify the detailed mechanism and clinical applications of these miRNAs.

1. The study aimed to investigate the role of tissue transglutaminase 2 (tgm2) in the pathogenesis of chronic allograft injury (cai) in a rat model of renal transplantation. The researchers used a well-established experimental model of human cai, where Fischer-344 (F344) rats were transplanted into Lewis rat strain recipients. The study focused on the expression of tgm2 by mononuclear leukocytes, which accumulate in the vascular bed of rat renal allografts during acute rejection. The researchers used real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting to analyze tgm2 mRNA and protein expression.

2. The study found that tgm2 mRNA and protein were overexpressed by mononuclear leukocytes, predominantly by activated monocytes, which accumulate in the vascular bed of rat renal allografts on day 9 after transplantation. The researchers also detected tgm2 immunoreactivity in the vascular endothelium of some arteries, veins, and capillaries in the graft tissue. The staining was more intense in allografts compared to isografts. The study suggested that tgm2 expression by monocytes might be linked to apoptosis.

3. The researchers investigated the functional relevance of tgm2 expression by m2 macrophages and found that tgm2 can be expressed by activated monocytes, but it is unclear if tgm2 expression is confined to m2-like monocytes. The study also found that tgm2 expression by blood mononuclear cells might be linked to apoptosis, as activated caspase-3 was more visible in veins compared to arteries. The researchers suggested that tgm2 might play a dual role in apoptosis, inducing apoptosis but also stabilizing the cytoskeleton of dying cells. The study proposed that tgm2 expression by monocytes might be a tremendous anti-inflammatory stimulus capable of reverting rejection.

4. The researchers performed animal experiments to investigate the hypothesis that tgm2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling in allografts. They chronically applied biologically meaningful concentrations of cystamine, an inhibitor of transglutaminase activity, for 4 weeks after transplantation. However, the study found that allografts developed first hallmarks of cai, such as interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, cav, and renal dysfunction, irrespective of cystamine treatment.

1. Endothelial cells (HUVEC passage 46) were grown to confluence and stimulated with plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to produce endothelial microparticles (EMPs).
2. The supernatant was collected, centrifuged, and ultracentrifuged to isolate EMPs, which were then re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at -80°C.
3. Flow cytometric analysis was used to characterize and quantify EMPs based on CD31- and annexin V-positivity occurring in a size gate less than 1 μm.
4. EMP levels were measured in a model patient's circulation using a CVVH filter and counter-current dialysis, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes.
5. The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis, suggesting that EMP sequestration occurs within the CVVH filter or tubing.
6. The authors propose that frequent changing of the CVVH filter and using a selective filter with convection and pressure gradients could overcome the limitation of EMP clearance.
7. Clinical data support the protective role of CVVH in acute lung injury (ALI) management, and the authors plan to assay patients pre- and post-dialysis to observe EMP concentration effects.
8. The application of dialysis to rodent models of EMP-induced ALI would examine efficacy in ongoing diseases and EMP thresholds associated with worse injuries.
9. The authors conclude that standard dialysis alone was effective in removing EMPs due to their small size, and that ultrafiltration may not be necessary for EMP clearance.

1. The residual and resistant microorganisms, including fungi, are recognized as the primary cause of failures in root canal treatments. Fungi, specifically Candida albicans, may play a key role in periradicular diseases, and their presence can lead to endodontic treatment failures. In fact, Candida albicans has been found in 20% of endodontic treatment failures.

2. Candida species, including Candida albicans, are considered dentinophilic microorganisms due to their ability to invade dentin. The presence of Candida albicans in endodontic treatment failures may be attributed to coronal leakage after or contamination during the treatment. Several factors, such as the ability to survive without nutrients or resistance to intracanalicular treatment materials, contribute to Candida albicans remaining in the root canal system.

3. If repeated treatment has failed or is unfeasible, the only alternative is a root-end resection. Apical sealing, avoiding contamination, and reducing the number of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, influence the success rate of such treatment. Therefore, the antibacterial and antifungal properties of root-end filling materials are crucial to the outcome of these procedures.

4. Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is a widely used endodontic biomaterial, introduced in 1993 and approved by the US FDA in 1998. MTA has several advantages, including excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, antimicrobial effects, and resistance to fluid and blood contamination. However, it also has some disadvantages, such as delayed setting time, poor handling properties, and high price.

1. After a stroke, patients often experience deficits in motor and sensory functions on the side of the brain opposite to the damaged hemisphere, but recent studies suggest that the unaffected side may also be affected. Ipsilateral motor deficits have been observed in various studies, and they emerge during the acute phase and persist chronically. These deficits are not well understood and may be due to various factors, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere.

2. Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to differentiate ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination functions on the unaffected side. Kinematic deficits in the upper limb have been found in recent studies, particularly in tasks requiring dexterity and coordination. These deficits suggest that the unaffected side may be more vulnerable than previously thought.

3. Several possible mechanisms have been suggested to explain ipsilateral motor deficits, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, and different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of ipsilateral motor deficits. The presence of ipsilateral motor deficits highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of brain function and recovery after stroke.

4. The current study aimed to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the unaffected upper limb of patients with stroke using a tracking and reposition sense test. Fifty hemiparetic stroke patients were recruited, along with 40 sex- and age-matched normal control subjects. The inclusion criteria were strict, with patients required to have a first-ever stroke confirmed by medical history and brain MRI.

5. The tracking and joint position sense tests were conducted on the hand ipsilateral to the damaged hemisphere of the patients, and with the corresponding hand of the control subjects. The tests were performed using a plastic frame with an embedded potentiometer to measure the accuracy of movement and proprioceptive sense in the metacarpophalangeal joints. The results were analyzed using an accuracy index and reposition error score.

6. The study found that the stroke group showed a lower accuracy index in the tracking task and a higher score of reposition errors in the joint reposition test compared to the control group. These results indicate that patients with stroke have difficulty performing motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions. The findings suggest that ipsilateral sensory deficits may be connected with bilateral hemisphere activation during performance of motor tasks.

The Millennium Cohort study is a large prospective study conducted by the Department of Defense (DoD) to collect and evaluate data on health, behavioral risk factors, and occupational characteristics related to military service. The study began in 2001 and included 77,047 participants from the first enrollment cycle that spanned 2001-2003. Approximately 71% of those participants enrolled at baseline responded to follow-up surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007.

2. The surveys were administered via paper and the internet and included questions on self-reported provider-diagnosed medical conditions, mental health symptoms, physical and functional status, alcohol and tobacco use, occupational status, military exposures, sleep patterns, and demographic information. The study was approved by the Naval Health Research Center Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The research was conducted in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects in research.

3. The outcome of interest was incident diagnosed diabetes self-reported on a follow-up survey among people without diabetes at the baseline assessment. Eligible participants included those who were followed until either the outcome was reported to have occurred at year 3 or 6, or until their last completed follow-up if the outcome was not reported. Exclusions included participants reporting provider-diagnosed diabetes at baseline, missing outcome or exposure data, or if DoD outpatient or inpatient medical encounter data contained codes for type 1 diabetes.

4. The primary data sources were the self-administered Millennium Cohort surveys and DoD electronic personnel files, managed by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). For these analyses, electronic records from DMDC provided information on age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, pay grade, service branch, service component, military occupation, dates of separation, and deployment dates. DMDC information was supplemented with self-reported data to reduce missing values when necessary.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects people of all ages, with a higher prevalence in women than in men, and its prevalence increases with age. The disease imposes a significant economic burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems, and its costs are expected to increase due to the aging population. In Italy, the prevalence of RA is estimated to be around 0.5%, with a higher prevalence in women than in men.

2. The costs associated with RA in Italy are substantial, with a mean annual cost per patient estimated to be around €11,546 in 2008. The costs are divided into direct costs, such as hospitalizations and treatments, and indirect costs, such as productivity loss and informal care. The indirect costs are estimated to be twice as high as the direct costs when the disease progresses.

3. The introduction of biological agents for the treatment of RA has increased the direct costs of the disease, but has also improved disease activity, joint damage, and loss of productivity. The use of biologics in the early stage of RA may reduce other healthcare costs by slowing the evolution of the disease. However, the high direct costs incurred from early use of biologics may be balanced by other healthcare cost offsets due to the reduction in the need for surgery or other interventions.

4. The economic burden of RA in Italy is expected to increase in the coming years due to the aging population and the progression of the disease. The disease is associated with a high prevalence of comorbidities, such as depression, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, which can increase the economic burden of the disease.

1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third most common cause of global cancer-related mortality. It disproportionately impacts developing countries and males, with 85% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia as of 2008. The risk factors for HCC development include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The median overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced disease is estimated at 58 months.

2. HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy, likely due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products such as heat shock 70 and P-glycoprotein, and P53 mutations. The systemic therapeutic options in the locally advanced or metastatic setting are limited to sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting RAF kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. The transition from normal hepatocyte to HCC is not fully understood, but hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex multistep process driven by the accumulation of heterogeneous molecular alterations. Molecular alterations implicated in HCC development include mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic alterations, chromosomal changes, and aberrant activation of signaling cascades.

3. The molecular pathogenesis of HCC is multifactorial and is reliant upon dysregulation of multiple pathways, including WNT/β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), VEGF, PDGF, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), TGF-β, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The HGF-CMET pathway serves as a hub for multiple heterogeneous signaling networks and is also modulated by the activation of other receptor tyrosine kinase families. HGF-CMET signaling is critical for normal processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, and postnatal tissue repair after acute injury. HGF-CMET axis dysregulation occurs in a variety of solid tumors and hematopoietic-derived malignancies and plays a key role in malignant transformation.

The tumor has been associated with osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia, and its origins have been a subject of controversy. The most common site of metastasis is to the lungs, with metastases to regional lymph nodes being rare.

2. Two cases of tibial adamantinoma were reported, which were problematic from a diagnostic point of view. One case presented with groin metastases, initially diagnosed as a cutaneous adnexal carcinoma, but later reinterpreted as metastatic adamantinoma. The patient had a confirmed past clinical history of surgical excision of a left tibial adamantinoma three years previously.

3. The histopathological examination of the inguinal lymph node metastasis showed similar findings, confirming the presence of metastatic adamantinoma. The neoplastic cells were composed of predominantly basaloid and tubular nests of malignant cells with some peripheral palisading. The histomorphological appearance of these cells was identical to the previous histology in this case.

4. A literature search was conducted to review cases of inguinal lymph node metastases from adamantinoma of the tibia. Ten cases were identified, with details of reference number, year reported, author, sex, age at diagnosis, bone involved, location in bone, character and duration of symptoms, latent period, treatment, and outcome. The cases were reviewed to understand the clinical presentation and management of this rare condition.

5. Adamantinoma of the tibia can be divided into two main groups based on their histology and biological behavior: classical adamantinoma and differentiated adamantinoma. Classical adamantinoma refers to the prototype cases with a predominance of epithelial tumor cells and are associated with a destructive growth pattern on radiology. Patients with classical adamantinoma are usually of an older age group with a reported range of 15-65 years.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndrome, characterized by the degeneration of both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons with neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. The clinical diagnosis of PD is often straightforward, but can be challenging in cases with mild or uncertain symptoms. Accurate and early diagnosis is crucial for correct management and prognostication.

2. Molecular imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), have improved the diagnostic accuracy of PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and sympathetic innervation of the heart have become popular tools in clinical practice. These imaging techniques can help visualize presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration and exclude patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, or vascular parkinsonism.

3. DAT imaging as a standalone tool cannot differentiate between various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy. However, it can support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with normal nigrostriatal function. Several studies have shown the utility of meta-[i]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy in assessing sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals in PD patients.

4. The study compared the results of SPECT studies of striatal DAT receptors and myocardial MIBG scintigraphy with clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes. The patients underwent both MIBG scintigraphy and DAT SPECT within a 4-month period for differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and usefulness of combined SPECT imaging in the same patient population.

5. The study found that the mean H/M ratio of the MIBG uptake in the delayed phase was significantly lower in PD patients than in non-PD patients, but the mean SBR did not differ to a statistically significant extent. The sensitivity and specificity of SBR were 86.7% and 52.6%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of the delayed H/M ratio on MIBG scintigraphy were 93% and 47%, respectively. The accuracy of these analyses in differentiating between PD and non-PD was the same using each of the molecular methods.

1. The Amblyomma testudinarium tick is a large, ornate, and longirostrate blood-feeding ectoparasite that infests a wide variety of vertebrates, including humans. It is commonly found in Asian countries, particularly in Malaysia and Korea. In Korea, human infestation of A. testudinarium is rare, with only two previously reported cases in elderly individuals. The tick is known to be distributed in Korea, particularly in the southern coastal area and Jeju Island.

2. A 73-year-old Korean man presented to a clinic with a round nodule in the left perianal area, which had been found two weeks prior to admission. The patient recalled a trip to a water reservoir in Yeonggwang-gun, a rural county in Jeollanam-do province, South Korea, where he had defecated in the sitting posture on the grass near the water reservoir. The gross appearance of the tick bite site was characterized by a mild swelling and erythema. The patient agreed to surgical treatment of the skin lesion to remove the perianal tick.

3. The removed tick was 25 mm in length and 18 mm in width, engorged with a blood meal, and identified as a female adult of A. testudinarium based on morphological characteristics. The tick's pedipalps were slender and longer than the basis capituli, and its second segment was not salient laterally. The eyes and festoons were present, and the small scutum was ornate. The spiracular plate was comma-shaped, and the denticles of the inner file were much smaller than those of the other files.

4. The histopathology of the skin response to the tick bite showed an intense skin reaction at the site of attachment, with a characteristic feeding lesion formed immediately beneath the attachment site. The lesion was composed of two different portions: a superficial perirostral portion and a deep cavitary portion. The cement was found slightly at the dermal entrance of the tick mouthparts but not on the surface of the epidermis. The inflammatory cells were mainly neutrophils, and a dense and mixed cellular infiltrate was noted around the feeding lesion and extended into neighboring dermis and subcutaneous tissues.</summary>",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, with predominant involvement of the interventricular septum, and is often caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins. Familial HCM is an autosomal dominant disorder, and at least 15 genes are implicated in 55.7% of HCM cases.

2. The TNNT2 gene, which encodes cardiac troponin T, is one of the major genes causing HCM, and mutations in this gene have been associated with a particularly severe form of the disease characterized by a poor overall prognosis and high incidence of sudden death. Previous reports have suggested that there is a more consistent relationship between certain genetic mutations and clinical outcome, allowing for the classification of benign and malignant mutations.

3. In a study of 173 unrelated Japanese patients with familial HCM, three reported mutations and a new mutation of TNNT2 were identified in 11 individuals from four families, and the clinical features of these patients were diverse, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to those with sudden cardiac death or the need for an early heart transplant. The proband and her elder brother in family A had the double reported mutations, arg130cys and phe110ile, of TNNT2.

4. The study found that the type of genetic mutation of TNNT2 did not seem useful in distinguishing the prognosis of HCM, and that only the presence of mutations was associated with a risk of sudden death in youth. Therefore, regardless of the type of genetic mutation, it would be more important to observe the patient in detail from birth in each lineage, and to search for modifier and environmental factors including diet, lifestyle, exercise, and the modification gene and polymorphism.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. The Schistosomatidae family includes several digenetic endoparasites with complex life cycles, whose developmental stages alternate between intermediate and definitive hosts. The Schistosoma genus is the best-studied genus of Schistosomatidae, with six species infecting humans causing schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating disease considered one of the most serious public health issues and the second most prevalent tropical disease worldwide. It is estimated that 237 million people require treatment worldwide, and 600 to 779 million people live in endemic areas under infection risk.

2. The development of powerful and scalable methods to analyze nucleic acids and proteins has changed the way biological data is surveyed, allowing a better understanding of processes such as host-parasite interaction. The application of such technologies has expanded our perspective of schistosome biology, and the scientific community has joined efforts to assess the schistosoma genomic information. The Schistosoma genome sequence data has been used to identify genetic loci that determine important traits such as host specificity, virulence, and drug resistance. Comparative genomics of three Schistosoma species revealed several conserved features, including the overall GC content, sequence identity, presence of repetitive elements, and synteny.

3. Transcriptomic analyses have been valuable in studying differential regulation in gene expression, identifying splicing variants, and elucidating the dynamics of parasite transcriptomes. The increasing number of transcriptome projects has accelerated studies in this area, providing means to use complementary approaches, especially microarray analysis. The availability of sequencing data from mitochondrial genomes has provided a basis for studies ranging from phylogenetic systematics to molecular ecology. The use of RNA interference (RNAi) techniques has been a promising tool for studying gene function in Schistosoma, and new tools for the introduction and expression of homologous or heterologous gene constructs are being developed.

1. For patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sclm), simultaneous resection of the primary colorectal and liver tumors is considered a favorable strategy, but it may involve excessive surgical stress and a higher morbidity rate. The study found that the morbidity rate after simultaneous resection for sclm was 64%, with anastomotic leakage occurring in 21% of patients. The overall survival rate after simultaneous resection for sclm was 61% at 3 years and 45% at 5 years.

2. The study identified intraoperative blood loss and operation time greater than 8 hours as predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage, respectively. The presence of a diverting stoma was not a predictive factor for absence of postoperative anastomotic leakage, and the site of primary tumor was not a predictive factor for anastomotic leakage in this series. Based on the results, the authors recommend selecting staged resections when operation time is expected to be greater than 8 hours to prevent anastomotic leakage or serious complications.

1. The study aimed to validate two scores for assessing the ability of patients to use metered dose inhalers (MDIs) or dry powder inhalers (DPIs), identify common errors, and determine the need for educational programs. The study was conducted in three phases: validation of the reliability of the inhaler technique scores, assessment of the content validity, and assessment of the criterion validity and discriminant validity. The study included 72 patients who were diagnosed with asthma and were in outpatient treatment for at least two years. The patients were randomly selected and evaluated by two pharmacists who were blinded to the study methodology.

2. The study used the inhaler technique scores developed by Santos et al. to assess the errors made during MDI and DPI use. The scores provided step-by-step descriptions of the correct technique and awarded points for each correct step. The pharmacists were trained in the correct use of the scoring systems and evaluated the patients' technique using the provided medications. The study found that the most common errors made by patients were related to the maintenance of total lung capacity (TLC) after a deep inhalation.

3. The study identified the most common difficulties encountered by patients using MDIs and DPIs, including the maintenance of TLC after a deep inhalation, incorrect speed of inhalation, and not exhaling prior to inhalation. The study found that the proportion of MDI technique errors was higher than that of DPI technique errors, which may be related to the fact that the correct DPI technique is more easily understandable to patients. The study also found that incorrect inhaler use affects drug efficacy and that assessment of inhaler technique is still considered irrelevant by many health professionals. The study's results suggest that the use of validated scores can improve inhaler use and patient outcomes.

4. The study used a convenience sample for phases 1 and 2 and a random sample for phase 3. The sample size for phase 3 was calculated based on the hypothesis of an association of at least 60% between the scores given by the pharmacists. The study used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18 to analyze the data and the Sigmastat software version 3 to determine the interobserver agreement.

1. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria, which have potential use as natural and nontoxic food preservatives and in human and veterinary applications. The classification of gram-positive bacteriocins is difficult due to their heterogeneity, and various classification schemes have been proposed. Klaenhammer suggested four classes of bacteriocins, including class I (lantibiotics), class II, class III, and class IV.

2. Enterococcal strains from various ecosystems have been characterized as antagonists of broad-range foodborne pathogens, and the bacteriocins produced by these strains displayed heterogeneous structures and differences in their mode of action. The ability to produce bacteriocins may provide an ecological advantage to non-bacteriocin producer strains. Enterocin S37, a bacteriocin produced by E. faecalis S37, was isolated from chicken feces and exhibited activity against L. monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni.

3. The purification and characterization of enterocin S37 revealed that it has a molecular weight of 4-6 kDa and is sensitive to proteases, but stable at different pH and high temperatures. The activity of enterocin S37 increased several folds during purification, and its spectrum of activity was similar to that observed with the crude supernatant. The combination of enterocin S37 with K channel modulators, such as pinacidil and cromakalim, enhanced its inhibitory activity on sensitive strains of L. monocytogenes, but had a weaker effect on resistant strains.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 9}"

1. The phase 1 study was a first-in-human, open-label, escalating-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single intrathecal dose of nusinersen in children with spinal muscular atrophy.
2. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the European Union Clinical Trials Directive, and local regulatory requirements.
3. A total of 28 children were enrolled and received dosing in the phase 1 study, with 15 children having spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 13 having spinal muscular atrophy type 3.
4. The majority of lumbar punctures were carried out using either a 22- or 25-gauge needle inserted in the L3-L4 or L4-L5 space, with nearly half of the procedures guided using fluoroscopy.
5. The most common adverse events were headache, back pain, and post-lumbar puncture syndrome, with the majority occurring within 72 hours after the procedure.
6. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest incidence of adverse events was reported in older children, children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3, and when a larger 21- or 22-gauge needle was used.
7. Using a 24-gauge needle or smaller atraumatic needle inserted with the bevel parallel to the dura fibers had been suggested to considerably reduce damage to the dura and consequently decrease the risk for cerebrospinal fluid leak after lumbar puncture.
8. The use of spinal ultrasound may facilitate the lumbar puncture procedure, and is favored over fluoroscopy in children, particularly if repeated procedures are planned, to minimize radiation exposure and cost.
9. The study concluded that intrathecal delivery of medication is feasible, safe, and well-tolerated, and that using a 24-gauge or smaller needle would likely reduce the chance of adverse events.

1. The main concern is to ensure the highest possible standard for services provided and meet the needs of individual service users and communities. In 1997, the UK Department of Health introduced Clinical Governance (CG) as a strategy for improving quality of healthcare services. The classic definition of CG is a system through which health organizations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services.

2. The Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) has applied CG as a framework for improving quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009. MOHME used the definition cited above as a guide to implement the policy. The CG model developed in Iran consists of seven interlocking components, including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information.

3. A number of studies have assessed the implementation of CG in different health systems and healthcare settings. Insufficient knowledge and attitude toward CG, lack of resources, inadequate information technology systems, resistance to change, necessity of cultural change, and professional boundaries were the main factors explored by Lathman et al. Another study using qualitative research identified some barriers such as speed of CG implementation, workload, and earmarked funding in CG implementation.

4. The scarcity of resources was one of the most important barriers in the implementation of CG noted by Walsh et al. Raising awareness of CG among managers, supportive culture, and sufficient resources were declared as state-level accountability in clinical governance implementation. Previous literatures mainly provide inadequate understanding about senior managers' viewpoint toward facilitators and barriers in the implementation of CG.

5. A qualitative research was employed to obtain a comprehensive understanding about senior managers' viewpoint toward CG barriers and facilitators. Deputies for curative affairs of all types of Iranian medical universities were purposefully selected to maximize the sample diversity and provide a comprehensive view toward CG implementation. The sampling continued until reaching data saturation, and 43 deputies were interviewed.

6. The findings demonstrated the willingness to support and positive attitude towards clinical governance. Senior managers also declared that having adequate knowledge about clinical governance and a positive attitude toward the necessity of the program are the main factors affecting clinical governance implementation. The level of enthusiasm expressed by senior managers seemed to be related in particular to their knowledge and attitude about CG concept and components.

1. Hydatid cyst disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus parasite, which affects humans and animals. The disease is common in most parts of the world, especially in countries where animal husbandry is practiced. In Iran, the disease is considered a hyper-endemic area due to the close relationship between humans and animals. The prevalence rate of human hydatid cyst in Iran has been reported to be between 1.1% and 13.7%.

2. The study aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical status of human hydatidosis in Khorasan Razavi province, Iran, during 2011-2014. The study population consisted of all cases with hydatid cyst diagnosed in governmental and private laboratories, hospitals, and health centers in the province. The data collection was performed using a checklist, and descriptive and analytical statistics were used for data analysis. The study found that the most percentage of cases was related to the cities of Mashhad, Ghoochan, Neishabour, and Fariman.

3. The study found that the majority of patients (70.5%) were infected with a single cyst, and 24.5% of them had multiple cysts. The most common clinical symptom in the hydatidosis patients was abdominal pain (42.3%), followed by hepatomegaly (27.4%), chest pain (21.6%), and cough (8.7%). Liver involvement was reported in 59.4% of patients, and 8.4% had multiple organ involvement. The study also found that the highest proportion of hydatidosis was in the age group of 21-40 years old.

4. The study found that the most percentage of infection was in women (54.9%) compared to men (45.1%), which may be due to more contribution of women to agricultural and animal husbandry in the region. The study also found that housewives had the highest proportion of infection, which may be due to their more likely contact with the source of contamination.

1. The first case of a ciliated hepatic foregut cyst (CHFC) was described by Friederich in 1857, and he posited its congenital origin. The term CHFC was coined by Wheeler and Edmonson, who identified specific characteristics that differentiate it from other hepatic cysts. These characteristics include the presence of four typical layers: a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer with interspersed mucus cells, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule.

2. CHFCs are rare, with only 103 cases reported since their first description in 1857, and the majority of these cases have been reported in the last 25 years due to improved imaging techniques. The cysts are thought to be the result of evagination of the foregut during embryogenesis, and they are most commonly found in segment IV of the left lobe just beneath the hepatic capsule. The cyst size ranges from <1 cm to 24 cm in greatest diameter, with a mean greatest dimension of 4 cm and a median of 3 cm.

3. The average age of presentation is 52 years, ranging from 3 months to 82 years, with a slight female predominance. Nearly 40% of reported cases have been found incidentally on imaging studies, 26% incidentally at autopsy, 6% incidentally at surgery, and 22% presented with abdominal symptoms. CHFCs are most frequently located superficially in the median segments of the liver (segments IV, V, VIII).

4. The imaging appearances of CHFCs are variable and appear as anechoic or hypoechoic cysts with spotty hyperechoic areas on ultrasound. CT findings are of a non-enhancing, rounded lesion of varying density depending on the contents of the cyst, which can include calcium crystals and cholesterol. Typical magnetic resonance imaging features are a hyperintense cyst on T2-weighted images and a variable appearance on T1-weighted images.

5. Pathologically, the cysts are typically solitary and unilocular, and have four layers: an outer fibrous rim, a layer of smooth muscle (often incomplete), sub-epithelial connective tissue, and a lining of ciliated, pseudo-stratified, mucin-secreting columnar epithelium. The presence of unique histological features indicates CHFC with a reasonable degree of confidence. A",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The oral route is one of the most preferred routes of drug administration due to its safety, ease of administration, and acceptability by patients. About 60% of conventional dosage forms are available as oral solid dosage forms.

2. However, the low bioavailability, longer onset of action, and difficulty in swallowing for dysphasia patients have turned the manufacturer towards parenterals and liquid dosage forms. But these forms have their own set of problems, such as accurate dosing and painful drug delivery systems.

3. The most popular oral dosage forms are tablets and capsules, but they have a major drawback of difficulty in swallowing, especially when water is not available. This is particularly inconvenient in cases of traveling, motion sickness, and sudden episodes of coughing.

4. To overcome this issue, fast-dissolving tablets have been developed, which can rapidly dissolve or disintegrate in the oral cavity within 60 seconds without drinking water or chewing. These tablets are also known as mouth-dissolving tablets, orodispersible tablets, rapidmelts, and porous tablets.

5. However, fast-dissolving tablets have certain disadvantages, such as their physical solid form, psychological fear of swallowing, chewing, or choking, friability of wafer-like porous and low-pressure molded tablets, and expensive packaging costs. To overcome these issues, a new technology was developed as orally dissolving strips.

6. Orally dissolving strips are the most advanced form of oral solid dosage forms due to their more flexibility and comfort. They improve the efficacy of APIs by dissolving within a minute in the oral cavity after contact with saliva without chewing and the need for water for administration.

7. Orally dissolving strips are useful in patients such as pediatrics, geriatrics, bedridden, and emetic patients and conditions such as sudden episodes of allergic attacks or coughing. They give quick absorption and instant bioavailability of drugs due to high blood flow and permeability of oral mucosa.

8. The backbone of an orally dissolving strip is generally formed of a plasticizer and film-forming polymer or a mixture of polymers that provide the necessary elasticity and shape to the film. Examples of polymers that have been used in the formulation of orally dissolving strips include hydrocolloids or povidone K-90, maltodextrin (MDX), hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose (HPMC-E15, 5), pectin, sodium alginate, or blends of polymers.

1. Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, and it represents an often devastating disruption to life, with the majority of survivors experiencing some degree of impairment requiring additional care or support 1 year post-stroke. The recovery following stroke is complex and multidimensional, encompassing bio-medical, psychological, and sociological elements. Effective self-management is key to promoting recovery and is cited as a means of empowerment and facilitator of improved health outcomes.

2. Self-management is a prominent issue in UK health policy and has been identified as a key priority for health by organisations independent of the UK government. It can be defined as the active management by individuals of their treatment, symptoms, lifestyle, physical, and psychological consequences inherent with living with a chronic condition. Self-management interventions (SMIs) are designed to enable people to manage their health more effectively.

3. Evaluation of SMIs must consider two key areas: firstly, whether people develop the skills to manage their own health, and secondly, if this consequently results in better health. The UK Medical Research Council advocates establishing the theoretical basis of an intervention as a first step in estimating its possible outcomes. Currently, evidence suggests that the mediators of change and theoretical premises in SMIs are unclear.

4. The COSMIN checklist is a tool used to assess the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties, and it has been used in other systematic reviews examining the measurement properties of outcome measures in a range of health conditions. The COSMIN checklist consists of nine items: internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, content validity, structural validity, hypothesis testing, cross-cultural validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness. The COSMIN checklist does not advocate summarising the quality criteria into one overall quality score.

5. The review examined the methodological quality of studies determining the psychometric properties of outcome measures used in stroke SMIs according to criteria outlined by the COSMIN checklist. Consistent with measurement theory, the review explored the validity and reliability of these measures for use in people with stroke, not their general use in broader populations. To our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically appraise and summarize the evidence on the quality of outcome measures used in stroke SMIs.

The review identified 43 different outcome measures adopted by studies in this review of measures used in stroke SMIs, with 21 measures (49%) demonstrating some properties in stroke populations according to the COSMIN checklist.

1. Osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee joint is a common reason for functional disability in older people in India, leading to a lowered quality of life. The disease severity is influenced by objective factors such as age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Physiotherapy practice aims to lower pain, other symptoms, improve activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL) in OA knee rehabilitation.

2. To achieve rehabilitative goals, physiotherapists use both self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to monitor prognosis in pain, symptoms, ADL, and QOL. Self-reported questionnaires provide subjective information without examiner bias, while performance-based tests objectively measure patient ability to perform ADL activities. Examples of self-reported questionnaires include WOMAC, SF-36, and KOOS, while performance-based tests include timed up and go test (TUG), six-minute walk test (6-MWT), and stair climbing test.

3. The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between KOOS subscales and objective measures such as 6-MWT, age, height, weight, and BMI in primary OA knee patients. The study used a cross-sectional survey design and included 251 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The KOOS questionnaire consisted of 42 questions addressing five patient-related domains, including pain, other disease-specific symptoms, ADL, sport and recreation function, and knee-related QOL.

4. The results showed a weak correlation between KOOS subscales and height, but a progressively increasing correlation with weight and BMI. The mean score of KOOS all subscales was less than the present study results, but the trend was similar between the two studies. The present study results were in agreement with Sabirli et al., who reported strong correlation between TUG and all subscales of KOOS.

BMI had a strong correlation with KOOS pain, symptom, ADL, and sports subscales, and a very strong correlation with KOOS QOL. Weight had a weak correlation with KOOS symptom, ADL, and sports subscales, and a strong correlation with KOOS pain and QOL.

1. Hemoptysis is a common symptom in patients with respiratory diseases, and when massive, it has a mortality rate of over 50%. Therefore, significant or life-threatening hemoptysis requires quick treatment to stop bleeding.

2. In the past, control of hemoptysis was obtained using surgical methods if conservative management failed to be effective, but patients with massive hemoptysis may be associated with high morbidity and mortality using conservative or surgical management.

3. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is a safe and effective treatment not only for massive hemoptysis but also for chronic or recurrent hemoptysis that impairs the patient's quality of life.

4. A retrospective study of 344 patients who underwent BAE found that 186 were men and 158 were women, with a mean age of 57 years old, and 234 patients had acute and massive hemoptysis.

5. The study analyzed the demographic characteristics, clinical features, results of imaging techniques, complications related to BAE, and follow-up of the patients, and found that 317 patients (92.2%) were suggestive of causes of hemoptysis.

6. The findings of angiography suggested that few direct signs were found during arteriography, and most of the indirect appearances that support a site of bleeding include tortuosity, hypertrophy, hypervascularity, aneurysms, extravasation, and bronchial artery to pulmonary artery or vein shunting.

7. BAE was performed in 336 of 344 patients (97.7%), and artery spasm and closure occurred in six patients, arterial subintimal dissection occurred in one patient, and the responsible vessel could not be super-selective in one patient.

1. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, celiac disease (CD), and lymphocytic gastritis (LG) in pediatric patients. The researchers found that LG was more common in CD patients without HP infection, followed by patients with CD infected by HP, HP-positive patients without CD, and none in the control group. The highest proportion of LG was found in CD patients without HP infection, at 50%. The study also found that patients infected with HP had the highest number of lymphoid aggregates, irrespective of CD status.

2. The researchers used immunohistochemistry to investigate the differential contribution of HP infection to LG in an inflammatory condition like CD. They found that CD patients with associated HP infection showed a lower rate of LG, which might be explained by the limited role of bacterial infection in cytotoxicity. HP converges the immune response towards a Th2 response and suppresses the Th1 immune response. The study also found that CD8+ lymphocytes were significantly increased in CD patients with or without HP infection compared to controls.

3. The researchers characterized the T-cell subsets immunophenotype (CD4+, CD8+, CD57) in the gastric mucosa of CD and HP-infected patients. They found that CD8+ iels were significantly higher in CD patients compared to controls or HP-infected patients without CD. The study also found that NK cells may play a negligible role in these two pathologies, as indicated by the low expression of CD57 in lymphoid cells. The proliferation marker, Ki67, was not increased in both conditions, suggesting that the process of antigen presentation occurred in the lymph nodes.

4. The study suggested that the number of CD8+ iels in the antrum might hint towards the diagnosis of CD rather than HP infection, and the number of lymphoid follicles directs towards the diagnosis of HP infection. The researchers also found that the inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria and in the mucosal glands does not contribute to the differentiation between these diseases. The study aimed to explore the contribution of CD and HP infection to LG and to characterize the different immunoprofiles of the gastric inflammatory cells involved in these diseases. The researchers suggest that immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 lymphocytes in the antrum should be included in undefined cases of CD.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. Angiogenesis, the process by which the existing vascular network expands to form new blood vessels, is required for the growth of solid tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a primary stimulant of angiogenesis and binds to VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2.

2. The inhibition of angiogenesis with the use of several drugs could represent an important tool in cancer treatment, as it has low toxicity and does not harm most normal dividing cells. The targets of these treatments are normal processes controlled by normal cells and not by the tumor cells themselves.

3. VEGF is a critical target for cancer therapy, as it is a primary stimulant for tumor angiogenesis. In breast cancer, elevated levels of VEGF have been associated with tumor growth and metastasis.

4. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human VEGF, is approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2/neu-negative breast cancer. Anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab has been shown to inhibit the growth of established orthotopic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in SCID mice.

5. Selective inhibition of VEGFR2 with an anti-VEGF antibody is sufficient for effective blockade of the protumorigenic activity of VEGF in breast cancer xenografts. Inhibition of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 by 2C3 has been shown to reduce tumor size in both pancreatic and breast tumors.

6. The effect of anti-VEGF therapy on tumor growth was evaluated in an orthotopic human breast cancer xenograft model, where chronic treatment with R84, 2C3, or bevacizumab significantly reduced tumor volume compared to control-treated animals. The reduction in tumor volume was associated with a decrease in macrophage infiltration and microvessel density.

7. The reduction of macrophage infiltration in the phase of treatment with 2C3 and R84 is presumably due to expression of VEGFR2 on tumor-associated macrophages. The major findings of this study were that 2C3, R84, and bevacizumab effectively decrease tumor size, microvessel density, and macrophage infiltration in an orthotopic model of breast cancer.

8. In addition to reducing macrophage infiltration, anti-VEGF therapy also modulated other immune cell infiltrates, including myel",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18}"

1. Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common medical condition in postmenopausal women, resulting from the loss of estrogen stimulation on vaginal and vulvar tissue. It affects most postmenopausal women at some point in their lives, with an estimated 64 million postmenopausal women in the US and up to 32 million women suffering from VVA symptoms.

2. VVA symptoms include dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation, which can negatively impact women's quality of life, including sexual relationships and emotional well-being. If left untreated, VVA symptoms can cause discomfort and affect other aspects of life, such as clothing choices, exercise options, and general pelvic floor comfort.

3. A recent survey, the Revive survey, found that many postmenopausal women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its associated symptoms. The survey demonstrated that many women were unaware that their vaginal symptoms could be caused by menopause or hormonal changes.

4. The Revive survey also found that almost half of the study population had never discussed their VVA symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP), and 40% of women with VVA symptoms expected HCPs to initiate the conversation. However, among those who had discussed VVA symptoms, the HCP was the initiator only 13% of the time.

5. The most common reasons for not mentioning symptoms to HCPs were the assumption that symptoms were a natural part of aging or were not bothersome enough at that time. Women who initiated discussions about VVA waited until a scheduled physical examination and often waited greater than 7 months to do so.

6. The Revive survey demonstrated the considerable impact of VVA on women's lives, with the most commonly reported VVA symptoms being vaginal dryness (55%), dyspareunia (44%), and local irritation (37%). More than half of participants reported that VVA had the greatest impact on enjoyment of sex.

7. The survey found that use of VVA-specific treatments, such as vaginal OTC products or prescription therapies, was reported by 40% of participants. However, even among women who had discussed symptoms with an HCP, the use of OTC products as monotherapy was common.

8. The most common limitations of participants' current OTC or prescription treatments included inadequate symptom relief, inconvenience, and dislike of the accommodations needed for vaginal administration.

1. In Denmark, women planning to conceive are advised to take a daily supplement of 400 mcg of folic acid (FA) until the 12th week of gestation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Despite campaigns promoting the FA recommendation, women in the preconceptional period appear to have inadequate dietary intake of folate and supplementation from FA tablets or multivitamin (MV) supplements. A national survey from 2003 to 2008 found that only 51% of Danish women of fertile age have a sufficient intake of dietary folate. The most recent data on periconceptional use of FA supplements in Denmark are from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC).

2. A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an internet-based prospective cohort study of Danish pregnancy planners found that 62% of the 5383 participants adhered to the Danish FA recommendation. The study used multivariate binomial regression to estimate the prevalence proportion differences (PPDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each predictor level in relation to the reference group. The study found that higher age was associated with increased prevalence of FA or MV use, and women who finished high school were more likely to use FA or MVs compared with women with less schooling. Women who had pap smears once or more during the last 3 years were more likely to use FA or MV supplements compared with women who did not have pap smears.

3. The study found that women who had a previous spontaneous abortion were more likely to use FA or MVs, and women who engaged in physical activity were more likely to use FA or MVs than sedentary women. Women who had a higher BMI were less likely to use FA or MVs, and women who smoked or had a higher alcohol intake were also less likely to use FA or MVs. The study found that women with a chronic illness might be more prone to use FA or MVs due to increased health awareness, but there was little association between a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, or infections with chlamydia and preconceptional use of FA or MVs. The study's findings indicate that more than one-third of the pregnancy planners in this study do not follow the preconceptional FA recommendation.

1. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition that results from the progressive narrowing of arteries in the lower extremities due to atherosclerosis, and it is an important predictor of coronary and cerebral vascular risk. The most common symptomatic manifestation of mild to moderate atherosclerotic PAD is intermittent claudication, observed in approximately 5% of individuals older than 60 years.

2. Several studies have revealed that the presence of PAD, even when asymptomatic and in patients with no history of other cardiovascular diseases, is a marker of greatly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Oxidative stress, through the extra generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is also involved in the development and progression of PAD.

3. Risk factors associated with PAD, similar to those for coronary heart disease, include high blood concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, called statins, are well-known lipid-lowering drugs that also have important pleiotropic effects.

4. The aim of the present study was to evaluate lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of patients with PAD before surgery as well as 35 days and 710 days after surgery. The study group consisted of PAD patients, treated either surgically or pharmacologically, and the patients treated surgically had shown critical ischemia.

5. The results of the study showed that the concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly higher in the surgically treated patients before surgery than those in the patients on simvastatin therapy. The surgically treated patients also had enhanced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of MDA.

6. The study found that statin therapy relieved symptoms and improved function in patients with lower extremity PAD, and the results provide strong support for the efficacy of statin therapy in PAD. The findings of the study are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that lipid peroxidation may be one mechanism through which several risk factors may promote PAD.

7. The study also showed that the reduction in FRAP level observed in the surgically treated patients 35 and 710 days after surgery can be partly explained by a decrease in their serum antioxidant status and an increase in serum oxidant levels following surgery. The results of the study suggest that simvastatin therapy may have a dose-dependent effect on plasma antioxidant status.

1. The demand for herbal remedies in Nigeria has been increasing, but there is a lack of scientific data to support their medicinal claims, which poses a risk to public health. This study aimed to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to Fijk herbal mixture on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology.

2. The Fijk herbal mixture is prepared from a mixture of 13 medicinal plants, including cassia alata, citrus medica var acida, and aloe vera, and is indicated for the treatment of several ailments, including obesity, diabetes, and malaria. However, there are no empirical data to support claims of medicinal benefits or otherwise of Fijk.

3. The study found that oral administration of Fijk herbal mixture at double and triple doses caused significant reduction in rat plasma protein level compared to the control group. The determination of lipid profile showed that the oral exposure of rats to Fijk at the various doses did not produce significant change in the plasma level of total cholesterol.

4. However, the exposure to Fijk at the highest dosage caused significant elevation in rat plasma level of triglyceride, and the levels of plasma HDL-C were significantly lowered by repeated administration of Fijk mixture. The lipid profile indices are useful in monitoring health status of the cardiovascular system.

5. The study revealed that the rat plasma levels of ALT and AST were elevated by exposure to repeated administration of Fijk mixture relative to control, which may indicate tissue toxicity. The histopathological findings support the biochemical alterations caused by oral and repeated exposure to Fijk herbal mixture and are reminiscent of rat hepatic injury.

6. The study found that oral and repeated exposure to Fijk herbal mixture in rats caused lipid peroxidation and potentiated hepatic lesion, which may be due to the generation of free radical species potentiated by exposure to Fijk mixture. The low level of GSH may be attributed to increased usage in order to scavenge free radical species or consumption as substrate by antioxidant enzymes.

7. The study revealed that the atherogenic index was elevated significantly in the groups exposed to Fijk mixture, which may implicate increased tendency for the development of atherosclerosis. The study also found that the oral administration of Fijk to rats did not produce significant change to average body weights of animals.

1. Preconceptional carrier screening has the potential to benefit prospective parents by identifying carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders before pregnancy. This allows couples to become aware of possible genetic risks to future offspring and reproductive options available. Carrier screening and carrier testing are two approaches to identifying carriers, with carrier screening being offered to individuals without an increased risk of having a child with a certain disease. Carrier testing, on the other hand, is offered to individuals with a higher a priori risk based on their or their partner's personal or family history.

2. Carrier screening can be offered on an individual basis or as an organized screening program, either during or before pregnancy. The goal of preconceptional carrier screening is to strengthen reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making. This can mean less time constraints, less pressure, and less emotional stress than when a test is performed during pregnancy. Internationally, the potential of preconceptional carrier screening has been studied extensively for cystic fibrosis (CF).

3. Preconceptional carrier screening for CF has been recommended by various medical associations, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Despite this, screening is not currently offered in most countries. Carrier testing for disorders such as CF is still usually restricted to families and partners of CF patients and carriers. Traditional healthcare systems have hesitated to implement carrier screening programs for the entire population of couples planning a pregnancy.

4. Various concerns underlie this stance, including the psychological impact and risk of stigmatization/discrimination of being a carrier, impairment of the freedom of choice, medicalization, and provider-related barriers. Commercial companies have been offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers, providing information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing is often defined as the offer and/or marketing of genetic tests directly to the public without the intermediary of a health care professional. The availability of DTC genetic testing services has created a huge debate about the desirability of these activities.

5. The DTC offer of preconceptional carrier tests for autosomal recessive disorders raises various ethical issues, including the informed consent procedure, the provision of information, and the need for medical supervision and follow-up. The details of the offer from each company vary greatly, with some companies including a wide range of disorders in their test panels.

1. The study aimed to investigate the commonest indications of implant removal and to detect which implants were most likely to require removal. The study included 83 patients who underwent implant removal surgery, with 71 being males and 12 females. The mean age of the patients was 38 years, ranging from 20 to 78 years.

2. The most common indications for implant removal were pain or discomfort (39.75%), followed by implant infection (28.91%), and implant failure (9.52%). The implants most commonly removed included distal tibial/ankle plates, femoral IM nails, olecranon wires and plates, and tibial IM nails and patellar TBWs. The mean duration of hospital stay for patients with pain or discomfort was 5 days.

3. The study found that the majority of patients requiring implant removal were men (85.5%), and the mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher (49.33 years) than those with pain (31.6 years) or implant failure (35 years). The study also highlighted the importance of carefully considering the risks and benefits of implant removal surgery, as it can be a safe procedure but may also have complications. The study's findings suggest that more studies are needed to produce concrete literature on the patterns of removal surgeries in symptomatic implants.

1. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve atrophy, with multiple factors contributing to its development, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
2. Müller cells, a type of glial cell in the retina, play a crucial role in supporting and nourishing retinal neurons, maintaining extracellular ion homeostasis, and recycling glutamate, and are involved in multiple pathological retinal diseases, including glaucoma.
3. Reactive Müller cells can release cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which can aggravate retinal damage and contribute to neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
4. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of 2-aminoadipic acid (AAA) on Müller cell gliosis and retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
5. The study found that AAA treatment significantly attenuated Müller cell gliosis and reduced retinal TNF-α levels in the rat model of AOH, suggesting that AAA may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
6. The study also found that AAA treatment rescued retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from apoptosis and reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the rat model of AOH.
7. The results suggested that AAA promoted survival of RGCs in the rat model of AOH through the inhibition of AOH-induced Müller cell gliosis and downregulation of TNF-α protein production.

1. The authors developed a new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFTR-L) for the treatment of nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms (SDNs).
2. The LAEFTR-L procedure involves the use of a ligation device to ligate the tumor, followed by temporary suturing of the seromuscular layer and resection of the targeted lesion using a snare technique.
3. The procedure was performed in 5 consecutive patients with nonampullary SDNs, and complete resection was achieved in all cases with histologically confirmed full-thickness resection.
4. The mean operative time was 173 minutes, and the mean diameter of the resected specimen was 24 mm, with a mean tumor size of 9 mm.
5. The LAEFTR-L procedure has two advantages over conventional full-thickness resection (FTR) procedures: it allows for intraluminal collection of the resected specimen, avoiding contact with the peritoneum, and does not require proficient experience in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
6. The procedure also has the advantage of not requiring proficient experience in ESD, and the total operative time was not different from previous reports on conventional FTR for SDNs.
7. However, tumor size and location are important factors to consider when deciding on the indication for LAEFTR-L, with lesions smaller than 15 mm in diameter and located away from the ampulla of Vater being suitable candidates.
8. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAEFTR-L procedures for the treatment of nonampullary SDNs.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by defects in enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 21-hydroxylase deficiency being the most common cause, accounting for 90-95% of cases. This deficiency leads to a shunting of precursors into the androgen synthetic pathway, resulting in signs and symptoms of androgen excess. CAH is typically managed with oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. The clinical course of the disease has improved significantly since the discovery of cortisone in the 1950s.

2. The pathophysiology of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency involves a defect in cortisol biosynthesis, leading to a compensatory increase in hypothalamic and pituitary secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This results in hyperplastic adrenal glands and a state of hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism. CAH is classified as classic or non-classic, with classic CAH being further subdivided into salt-losing and non-salt-losing forms. Non-classic CAH is characterized by signs of androgen excess developing during childhood or at puberty.

3. The diagnosis of CAH is typically made through newborn screening programs by screening for 17-hydroxyprogesterone in dried blood spots, with a high concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone being diagnostic of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The gold standard for diagnosis is a corticotropin stimulation test, with measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone at 60 minutes. Treatment aims to suppress adrenal androgens sufficiently without impairing growth, while allowing for normal pubertal development and fertility. Glucocorticoids are given in doses sufficient to suppress excessive secretion of CRH and ACTH without total suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

4. The management of CAH involves close interaction between pediatric, reproductive, adult endocrinologists, and clinical psychologists experienced in psychosexual counseling. Treatment is indicated only for those with symptoms and aims to reduce hyperandrogenism. Patients with CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumor, improve symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorders, particularly hyponatremia.

The study examined the relationship between self-rated health (SRH) and lifestyle behaviors, including dietary and physical activity, in a population largely comprised of Hispanics with a considerable proportion of blacks. The study found that modifiable lifestyle behaviors known to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, such as low fruits and vegetables intake and high fat intake, were associated with poor/fair SRH in males and females. Poorer SRH was significantly associated with low physical activity in females only, and low physical activity was also more common in women than men in this study sample. The study's findings suggest that gender differences may have implications in designing and monitoring lifestyle interventions to prevent cardiovascular diseases.

2. The study used a secondary data analysis of the Living for Health Program, which collected information on health behaviors from adults aged 18 and older in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The study sample consisted of 1,701 participants who responded to all the questions included in the analysis. The study found that females were more likely to report poor/fair SRH, be obese, and be less physically active compared to males. The study also found that age, ethnicity, health insurance, and comorbidities were associated with SRH.

3. The study examined the relationship between SRH and lifestyle behaviors, including dietary and physical activity, in males and females. The study found that males who consumed mostly high-fat foods were 3.2 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH compared to those who consumed primarily low-fat foods. Females who consumed mostly high-fat foods were 1.5 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH compared to those who consumed primarily low-fat foods. The study also found that physical activity was associated with SRH in females, but not in males.

4. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that have found an association between lifestyle behaviors and SRH. The study's results suggest that promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as increasing fruits and vegetables intake and physical activity, may be an effective way to improve SRH.

1. The endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (DX/HA) has become a popular treatment option for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) due to its minimally invasive nature, low complication rate, and fast recovery time. However, the success rate of this procedure is lower compared to open surgery, ranging from 75-80%.

2. The use of positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography has been explored as a method to detect occult VUR and predict the success of DX/HA injection. Studies have shown that PIC cystography can detect VUR with high sensitivity, but its ability to predict the success of DX/HA injection is limited, with a correlation of only 80% between negative intraoperative cystograms and postoperative cystograms.

Further research is needed to improve the success rate of DX/HA injections and to develop more effective methods for predicting the success of this procedure.

1. Lung cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed and the most common cause of cancer-related death among both men and women in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2012, 226,160 patients will be diagnosed with lung cancer and 160,340 will die from the disease. Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease, as early-stage disease is often asymptomatic. The stage distribution of lung cancer cases diagnosed in 1999-2006 included distant metastasis at diagnosis (56%), regional metastasis (22%), localized (15%), and unstaged (8%).

2. The stage of disease was a strong risk factor for survival, with advanced disease having much lower five-year survival compared to early disease. From 1999-2006, the SEER program reported that the five-year relative survival was 3.5% for distant stage at diagnosis, 24% for regional stage, and 52.9% for localized stage. Bone is one of the most frequent sites of metastasis in patients with lung cancer. These osteolytic lesions undermine the structural integrity of bone, placing lung cancer patients at an increased risk for skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain.

3. A study was undertaken to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and SREs on mortality among older lung cancer patients by analyzing a combined population-based cancer registry and the Medicare claims database. The SEER program collects cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries from selected geographic areas. The Medicare program covers 97% of the US population ages 65 years and older. Medicare data included demographic information on beneficiaries and claims data from hospitals and other institutional and non-institutional providers.

4. The study identified a cohort of patients aged 65 years or older and having a SEER record of a new diagnosis of lung cancer between July 1, 1999, and December 31, 2005. The claims data from this baseline period provided information on the presence of comorbidities and on the presence of possible bone metastasis and SREs at diagnosis. Bone metastasis, with or without evidence of SREs, was the time-dependent exposure variable of main interest in the analyses. The study used Cox regression to estimate mortality hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) among patients with bone metastasis with or without SREs, compared to patients without bone metastasis.

The methods included 0.9% physiological saline, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, 17% EDTA, 37% orthophosphoric acid, and a photodynamic diode laser. The results showed that the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups had the highest bond strength values.

The photodynamic diode laser group showed post-cement failure, while the other groups showed mixed failures between resin and dentin. The results suggest that the photodynamic diode laser is a more effective method for removing the smear layer and improving the bond strength of self-adhesive cement.

The results showed that the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid were more effective at the cement-dentin interface than EDTA. The study suggests that modifying the smear layer may be more effective when using a self-adhesive system.

1. Recent years have seen concerted efforts to identify, describe, and quantify the bacterial communities of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, with many international consortia and collaborations established to answer the question of who is there and what are they doing there. The human microbiome project in the USA and the metagenomics of the human intestinal tract (Metahit) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives aimed at characterizing the microbial communities that inhabit multiple sites in the human body. These studies have led to the discovery of fascinating glimpses of what lies ahead in understanding the human microbiome.

2. The human gut flora has been found to belong mainly to two phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The discovery of archaea, mostly represented by the methanogenic Methanobrevibacter smithii, has also been made. The diversity of archaea is a fraction of the expansiveness of the bacterial species colonizing the gut.

3. The composition of the bacterial flora seems to strongly depend on the environment and the maternal input during delivery and upon breastfeeding. Members of the same family have been shown to have bacterial communities that are more similar to each other than to unrelated individuals. This suggests that the environment and maternal flora, rather than genetic factors alone, have a greater impact on establishing bacterial communities in a new individual.

4. Recent second-generation, high-throughput studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities. One major study aimed at assessing whether a common bacterial core shared by all or at least a majority of humans could be determined found that only 18 species were present in all individuals examined. The study also found that around 50% of individuals shared 75 species.

5. The human gut microbiome has been classified into three different clusters termed enterotypes. Each enterotype has unique properties, such as the prevalence of bacteria, methods of harvesting energy, and overrepresentation of certain enzymatic pathways. The three enterotypes can be identified and viewed on various levels, including prevalence of bacteria and methods of harvesting energy.

6. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the regulation of host energy balance and metabolism. Germ-free mice have been shown to be protected from diet-induced obesity, but this protective effect was later found to be strongly dependent on the sugar composition of the diet.

1. Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nail characterized by nail discoloration, thickening, and defect, with dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes being the most common agents.
2. The treatment of onychomycosis is often difficult due to slow nail growth, physical presence of the nail plate, and difficulty in finding compounds with adequate pharmacologic profile for nail penetration.
3. A study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of tazarotene 0.1% gel for the topical treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis, showing complete healing in all patients after 12 weeks.
4. Tazarotene has proven effective in reducing hyperkeratinization in fungus-infected nails and has a direct fungistatic activity against various fungal species, including Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida albicans.
5. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of tazarotene in terms of relapse and reinfection, but the results suggest that it could be a useful alternative treatment for onychomycosis, particularly in treatment-resistant cases.

1. Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) has become an important treatment for patients with heart failure and left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony, but clinical non-response to CRT is reported in 25-35% of patients. The causes of suboptimal response to CRT have been cited, but most attention has been focused on the selection of patients eligible for CRT, and less on inadequate delivery of CRT therapy.

2. The study aimed to investigate the acute haemodynamic response (AHR) of the implanted system and alternative left ventricular endocardial pacing sites in patients clinically not responding to CRT. Twenty-four non-consecutive patients, 23 males, age 72.8 ± 9.1 years, mean ejection fraction 22.5 ± 7.1%, agreed to undergo this test.

3. The results showed that in 5 patients, LVDP/DTmax with the implanted coronary sinus system increased by ≥15% after optimisation, and in 3 out of these 5 patients with the coronary sinus lead in a posterolateral position, endocardial pacing did not increase the LVDP/DTmax substantially. In one of the two remaining patients with an apical position of the coronary sinus lead, the AHR could be increased during LV endocardial pacing.

4. The study found that basal or mid-posterolateral segments had the highest AHR of the tested endocardial sites in all 14 patients who showed an AHR ≥15% rise in LVDP/DTmax compared with baseline. The average qrs width was 133 ± 22 ms, and the average q-lv interval was 155 ± 26 ms.

5. Ten patients were considered possible candidates for LV endocardial pacing, and 5 of them finally agreed to LV endocardial implant at the optimal LV site as indicated from the acute study. All five patients improved clinically with a reduction of at least 1 class in the NYHA score after 6 months of follow-up.

6. The study also showed that endocardial pacing opposite the epicardial coronary sinus pacing site did not improve the AHR in our study, which is in contrast with animal experiments that show significantly better haemodynamic results with endocardial vs. epicardial pacing at the same location. The longest q-lv interval is a reliable indicator for the optimal electrode position in the individual patient.

1. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects between 1 in every 500 and 1 in every 1000 individuals and is found in all racial and ethnic groups. The disease may not be clinically apparent until the third or fourth decade of life.

2. Only about half of the patients with ADPKD will progress to renal failure, and several risk factors such as hypertension, renal hemorrhage, and male gender have been associated with a more rapid course. Young patients with ADPKD have no way to predict whether or when renal failure will develop.

3. Pregnant subjects with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis are at risk for complications such as maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, and infected renal and hepatic cysts. However, with careful and effective perioperative monitoring, spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

1. The study aimed to determine the pattern of milk yield in normal and mastitis crossbred cows using the gamma type function. The data collected from 733 Karan Fries cows over 12 years showed that the lactation curve was composed of 21 fortnightly test-day milk yield records. The study found that the peak milk yield was attained in the 3rd and 4th fortnights in both normal and mastitis cows. The peak yield duration was not affected by the incidence of mastitis.

2. The study observed that the initial milk yield (a) was higher in normal cows compared to mastitis cows in different parities. The peak milk yield was observed in the 4th parity (16.45 kg and 14.42 kg) while the minimum yield was observed in the 1st parity in both normal and mastitis cows. The lactation curve parameter of ascending slope parameter up to peak yield (b) was similar in both groups in the 1st parity, declined in the 2nd parity, and increased in the subsequent parities. The descending slope parameter (c) was lower in the 1st parity and higher in the 4th parity in normal cows.

3. The study found that the persistency of lactation was higher in the 1st parity and declined till the 5th and above parity in all cows. The fortnights of peak milk yield ranged from 4.53 to 6.15 fortnights in normal cows and from 4.49 to 5.88 fortnights in mastitis cows. The peak yield was minimum in the 1st parity (13.89 kg/d and 12.58 kg/d) and maximum in the 4th parity (19.67 kg/d and 16.61 kg/d). The coefficient of determination of variation (r) ranged from 84.88% to 98.18% in normal cows and from 83.93% to 97.68% in mastitis cows.

4. The study observed that the value of ascending slope parameter up to peak yield (b) was lower than reported earlier in different parity of Friesian and Ayrshire crossbred cows due to differences in milk yield, management practices, and breed.

1. The study investigated the effects of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on the lifespan of mice and Drosophila. Mice were fed NDGA at different doses, and their lifespan, weight, and food consumption were monitored. The results showed that NDGA extended the median lifespan of mice by 12% at a dose of 373mg/kg body weight per day. However, higher and lower doses of NDGA were ineffective in extending lifespan.

2. The study also found that NDGA increased the incidence of liver, lung, and thymus tumors, and hemorrhagic diathesis in mice. Despite this, NDGA decreased the mass of liver tumors by 24% relative to those found in control mice. The results suggest that NDGA may decrease the rate of liver tumor growth, but increase tumor formation. The study also found that NDGA increased the prevalence of lung and thymus tumors.

3. In contrast to the effects seen in mice, NDGA did not appear to affect energy uptake or utilization in Drosophila. The study found that NDGA increased the median lifespan of Drosophila by approximately 23% at a dose of 3.0mg/ml medium. However, NDGA did not alter food consumption, body weight, or locomotor activity in Drosophila. The results suggest that the effects of NDGA on Drosophila lifespan may be due to mechanisms that are conserved between mice and flies.

4. The study also investigated the possible mechanisms by which NDGA extends lifespan. The results suggest that NDGA may inhibit the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is a well-established mechanism for extending mouse and Drosophila lifespan. However, the study found that NDGA increased tumor formation, which is the opposite of what would be expected if mTORC1 inhibition was the major mechanism by which NDGA extends lifespan. The results suggest that NDGA may have multiple mechanisms of action, and that further study is needed to fully understand its effects on lifespan and health.",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. Genetic variation contributes to both disease susceptibility and treatment response, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled rapid discovery of genetic variants contributing to the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases. GWAS have also detected many pharmacogenetic markers, which can be used to predict treatment response. The driving hope of these advances in genetic epidemiology is that promotion of personalized medicine will improve medical decision-making. Personalized medicine applications are far more broad than just identifying the optimal drug and dosage for a subgroup of patients.

2. Current personalized medicine applications include situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients. For example, in prostate cancer, DNA biomarker tests may be used to determine whether treatment may be safely delayed for a period of watchful waiting. If the tumor is demonstrated to lack genes causing an aggressive form of the cancer, it may remain stable for decades, and the need for radical surgical resection with subsequent radio- or chemotherapy may be obviated. This approach is already used for some forms of hereditary cancer, in which individual genetic testing is the basis for deciding upon specific, sometimes very radical interventions.

3. Beyond treatment schemes that are applied identically across large subgroups of patients, other personalized medicine applications offer targeted treatment options for individual patients. Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as anti-TNF, anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-1, are thought to be effective in inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease. To choose one or a combination of different anti-inflammatory therapies, the physician might first obtain the genetic profile of a patient by sequencing. Depending on the individual DNA profile, the physician might select the anti-inflammatory combination therapy, of which there are many.

4. Biological markers, or biomarkers, are foundational to personalized medicine, but are diversely defined in the literature. The most commonly adopted definition states that a biomarker is any substance or biological structure that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain, or predict the incidence or outcome of disease. However, it is a matter of debate whether the qualification that biomarkers must be measured in the human body is a reasonable limitation. From our perspective, the definition developed by the Biomarkers Definitions Working Group is preferred: a biomarker is a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.

1. Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
2. Each dimerized MyoVa molecule consists of a pair of N-terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, and ending in a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain.
3. The directed movement of MyoVa is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms.
4. The lever arms consist of six tandem-helix motifs, stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains, and are required for the motor's processivity.
5. The flexural stiffness of MyoVa and its subdomains was measured using tethered particle microscopy (TPM), which involves anchoring a MyoVa-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle to a desired location along the motor.
6. The TPM method was used to estimate the flexural stiffness of various MyoVa constructs, including full-length MyoVa, double-headed short constructs, and single-headed MyoVa.
7. The results showed that the lever arm flexural stiffness was significantly reduced in the presence of calcium, which is consistent with the observed decrease in processivity of MyoVa in high calcium conditions.
8. The distal rod domain of MyoVa was found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm, which is lower than the lever arm stiffness but higher than the combined stiffness of the two lever arms in the two-headed bound state.
9. The estimates of flexural stiffness for various MyoVa constructs and subdomains by TPM offer direct insight into the structural components of the MyoVa motor that are critical to its functional capacities.

The aim of this study was to determine whether clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in different proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aurka, erbb2, mdm2, cdh1, cdkn2a, and tp73 genes were genotyped in a consecutive cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients. The study found that the mdm2 and cdh1 SNPs were significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with EAC.

2. The study included 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent, and the patients were followed for a median of 14 months for DFS. The study found that the DFS of EAC patients was 14 months, and for ESCC patients, it was 16 months. The study also found that 37% of EAC patients and 28% of ESCC patients were alive at the time of analysis.

3. The study found that the pattern of disease recurrence was similar in both EAC and ESCC patients, with loco-regional recurrences being the most common type of recurrence. The study also found that distant metastases were found in liver, lung, brain, bone, adrenal gland, pleura, peritoneum, and skin. The study found that 78% of EAC patients and 72% of ESCC patients had recurrent disease after surgery.

4. The study found that the variant genotypes of SNPs located in the promoter region of the mdm2 and cdh1 genes were significantly associated with DFS in patients with EAC. The study found that patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous mdm2 t/g genotype had a significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type t/t genotype. The study also found that patients with EAC harboring the homozygous cdh1 ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival compared with patients carrying the wild-type g/g genotype.

1. The oral cavity is colonized by Candida albicans or other Candida species in 40-60% of healthy persons, and in immune-compromised patients, Candida species can trigger a variety of disease manifestations. In HIV-positive patients, Candida species can cause oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), which is the most frequent opportunistic fungal infection. OPC can appear as erythematous patches or white, scrapable lesions and is often one of the first clinical signs of HIV infection. It is observed with a higher prevalence in patients with CD4+ counts below 200/mm or a high viral load.

2. The present study aimed to evaluate the forms of OPC and their correlation with CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients. A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was carried out for a 2-year period, in which quantitative data collection methods were used. Patient records were studied, and patients were asked to visit the clinic for further evaluation. A complete medical history was taken, and a physical examination of the oral cavity, head, and neck area was performed on each patient.

3. The variables studied included medical history, physical examination, socio-demographic characteristics, socio-behavioral factors, experience with oral lesions, and laboratory tests. Patients were prescribed essential medication and repeated examination, and follow-up visits were considered. A single oral swab was collected from each study participant, and Candida was identified by conventional tests and species identification was performed using the germ tube test. The distribution of oral lesions based on the CD4+ count of HIV-infected patients showed that 62% of the oral lesions occurred at CD4+ count < 200 cells/mm.

4. The majority of patients with OPC had cell counts < 200 cells/mm, followed by 201-499 cells/mm, and > 500 cells/mm. The mean CD4+ count was 167.12, and the median duration of ART was 2 years. Candida species were isolated from the oral cavity in 38/50 (76%) of the patients. The most common clinical presentation of OPC was pseudomembranous candidiasis, followed by erythematous, angular cheilitis, and a combination of these.

The study used data from two multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trials to test surrogate variables for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers and explore the correlation between granulation tissue development and complete healing. The trials involved patients with Wagner grade 3 or 4 ulcers, who received intralesional injections of rhEGF at 75 or 25 g, three times per week. The total number of ulcers included in the analyses was 190. The results of an active postmarketing surveillance of rhEGF treatment in 1,440 DFUs were also taken into account.

2. The patients included in the trials were diabetic patients (type 1 or 2), both sexes, > 18 years of age, with Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs > 1 cm. Intralesional rhEGF was administered adjuvant to standard care, which included thorough debridement, moist dressing, pressure offloading, and antibiotics, if necessary. Patients with chronic, uncontrolled illness, psychiatric or neurologic diseases that could impair proper reasoning for consent, or presence or suspicion of neoplasia or who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded. The median treatment duration was 5 weeks.

3. The surrogate markers of complete healing generated were percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT). The variable of granulation tissue covering the wound area was also taken into account. The EOT data were used as the comparison points with the 4-week area change proposed by other authors. Ulcer areas and percent granulation were measured by planimetry from manual tracing on a transparent grid sheet.

1. The breathing process is essential for human survival, and it begins at the upper airway, culminating in gas exchange inside the alveoli. When breathing begins through the nose, the air is prepared to reach the lungs with ideal conditions, including warming, moistening, and filtering. This process activates immunological processes that protect the lower airway.

2. When breathing begins through the mouth, despite air warming and moistening, no filtering or immunological activity occurs. Mouth breathing in childhood promotes pathological adaptation of the stomatognathic system, to the detriment of harmonious morphological and functional growth. This can lead to various consequences, including dental occlusion alterations and facial growth pattern alterations.

3. The main causes of mouth breathing in childhood are hypertrophy of the pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsil, nasal mucosa and turbinate edema, nasal septal deviation, and extended suction habits. Morphological adaptations in mouth-breathing children occur with the aim of facilitating air arrival to the alveoli. These adaptations can lead to maxillary hypoplasia and posterior mandibular demotion/rotation.

4. The complexity of mouth breathing consequences justifies the participation of several professionals, including otorhinolaryngologists, odontologists, phonoaudiologists, physiotherapists, and pediatricians. Multidisciplinary staff integration is essential for a uniform categorization of mouth breathers. Accurate diagnosis of the cause of mouth breathing is essential for effective treatment.

However, distinguishing between a true local recurrence (TR) and a new primary tumor (NPT) is crucial due to their different clinical relevance, prognosis, and therapeutic management.

2. To differentiate between TR and NPT, the location of the new tumor, staging, and histological subtype are studied through various methods, including imaging, biopsy, and immunohistochemical studies. These studies help determine the expression of HER-2 and hormone receptors.

4. Four years after surgery, the patient noticed periareolar thickening in the right breast with redness and heat, which was confirmed as inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) through biopsy. The IBC was consistent with the diagnosis of IDC.

5. The patient received treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab, which resulted in a progressive decrease of inflammatory signs. She underwent breast reconstruction surgery and remained in complete clinical remission after 4 years and 8 months of follow-up.

6. Breast cancer is a major public health problem worldwide, and IDC is the most frequent form of invasive breast cancer, accounting for 70-80% of all cases. Its treatment is based on a multidisciplinary approach, including primary tumor surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.

1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in developed countries, with the neovascular form accounting for the majority of cases of AMD-related severe central vision loss. Upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in the development and progression of AMD. The management of neovascular AMD has been transformed with the development and advent of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment.

2. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, such as ranibizumab and aflibercept, are health Canada-approved options for the treatment of neovascular AMD, and large multicenter clinical trials have demonstrated that monthly ranibizumab prevents vision loss in most patients with neovascular AMD. The phase 3 randomized VIEW clinical studies demonstrated that intravitreal aflibercept injection every 8 weeks was noninferior to monthly ranibizumab. Aflibercept binds to both VEGF-A and proangiogenic placental growth factor.

3. The binding affinity of aflibercept to VEGF is substantially higher than that of ranibizumab, with a greater potency in vitro and a longer duration of action allowing potentially for less frequent dosing. Research findings in eyes with neovascular AMD demonstrate a mean duration of complete VEGF suppression of 36.4 days for ranibizumab compared with ~70 days for aflibercept injection. Switching treatment-resistant neovascular AMD patients to aflibercept is an option that may improve visual and anatomic outcomes.

4. The study evaluated the efficacy of switching to aflibercept from ranibizumab in treatment-resistant neovascular AMD patients with persistent fluid, despite previous near-monthly ranibizumab treatment. The study population received close to the planned 4-weekly aflibercept dosing after switch initiation, and adherence to strict inclusion criteria ensured that the study population included only suboptimal responders with persistent fluid.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, causing severe cognitive and physical impairments, and is most commonly diagnosed in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40. The exact reason for this disease is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors, such as viruses, are believed to be involved in its pathogenesis.

2. Researchers have investigated interleukin-25 (IL-25), a cytokine that plays a key role in stimulating and developing T helper 2 (Th2) responses, and its potential association with MS. The IL-25 gene has a known polymorphism, c424c/a, which may be associated with immune system-related diseases.

3. A study was conducted to evaluate the association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in an Iranian population. The study used a case-control design, recruiting 74 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 75 healthy controls.

4. The results of the study found that neither the aa, ac, and cc genotypes nor the a and c alleles were associated with MS in the Iranian population. The frequencies of the genotypes and alleles were not statistically different between patients with MS and the controls.

5. The study's findings suggest that the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene is not associated with MS and cannot be considered a risk factor for MS development. This is consistent with a previous study that found no association between this polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), another inflammatory disease.

The study found that TAA was more prevalent than AAA, with a prevalence of 36.5% and 6.0%, respectively. The study also found that TAA was associated with various clinical factors, including older age, larger body surface area, and higher diastolic blood pressure.

2. The study identified several risk factors associated with TAA and AAA, including age, absence of dyslipidemia, body surface area, diastolic blood pressure, and presence of AAA. In contrast, AAA was independently associated with presence of dyslipidemia, current/past smoking, and presence of TAA. The study also found that smoking history was a significant risk factor for AAA.

3. The study had several limitations, including the inability to properly evaluate the very proximal portion of the ascending aorta using non-contrast CT scans. The study was also limited to a population of elderly Asian males with hypertension, and the results may not be generalizable to other populations. Future research should establish distinct screening strategies for TAA and AAA according to risk factors and ethnicity, and should also explore the relationship between TAA, AAA, dyslipidemia, serum cholesterol, and statin therapy.

1. Endometrial cancer has become the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries, surpassing cervical cancer in morbidity. The increasing incidence of endometrial cancer is attributed to lifestyle changes, including a lack of exercise and high fat intake, leading to obesity and high BMI. Obesity triggers several pathways, including hormonal imbalance and hyperactive proliferative pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer.

2. The effective procedure for reducing morbidity and mortality in endometrial cancer is to screen certain groups with risk factors and design a reliable tool suitable for a mass screening program. Dilation and curettage (D&C) has been used clinically for many years but has unsatisfactory specimen adequacy and diagnosis accuracy. Researchers have reported that the accuracy of D&C is 40.5%, sensitivity 40.5%, specificity 72.3%, PPV 77.1%, and NPV 25.1%.

3. The sap-1 sampler device is designed to meet the requirements for endometrial samplers, including avoiding contamination from the endocervix and vagina, procuring an adequate representative sample of the entire endometrium, and being safe, easy to use, and well-tolerated by patients. The device has a soft loop that can be flexible within the endometrial cavity, and the spindles can easily obtain adequate endometrial cells with minimal chance of injuring myometrium and bleeding. The sap-1 sampler has been shown to provide more sufficient materials for cytology than D&C or hysteroscopic biopsy.

4. The sap-1 sampler combined with the liquid-based SurePath preparation method is a reliable diagnostic method for detecting endometrial cancer, complex hyperplasia with atypia, and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN). The overall accuracy for detecting endometrial cancer, complex hyperplasia with atypia, and EIN was 92.4%, with a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 95.8%, PPV of 75%, and NPV of 95.3%. The sap-1 sampler provides more adequate specimens than D&C or hysteroscopic biopsy, especially in postmenopausal women.

1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with nearly 1.7 million new cases in 2012, and the highest incidence rates are found in Europe and North America. The countries with the highest incidence rates are Belgium, Denmark, and France.

2. Breast cancer mortality has decreased in some parts of the world, with screening mammography associated with a reduction in mortality rate of up to 50%. Although there has been controversy about mammogram screening, it remains the most commonly performed procedure for breast cancer detection.

3. Digital mammography (DM) has been shown to be as efficacious as screen-film mammography (SFM) in detecting breast cancer, and most mammography units in the US are now digital. DM is less likely to be lost or damaged and has slightly higher sensitivity than SFM.

4. However, conventional mammography has limitations, including the problem of overlapping tissue, which can obscure tumors and make them difficult to detect. This is particularly challenging in women with dense breast tissue, who are at higher risk of breast cancer.

5. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a 3D imaging technique that can help solve the problem of overlapping tissue by creating image slices of a tissue volume. DBT uses x-rays to obtain multiple low-dose images of the breast, which are then reconstructed into thin tissue slices.

6. Studies have shown that adding DBT to standard mammography (DM) can improve the accuracy of interpretation of mammograms, reduce recall rates, and increase cancer detection. DBT can also more clearly depict benign findings, such as cysts and fibroadenomas, which can reduce the need for recall for additional imaging.

7. The radiation dose for DBT is slightly more than twice the dose of mammography alone, but this can be reduced by using synthesized images made from DBT data. The use of DBT has also been shown to reduce the need for additional mammogram views and biopsies, which can lead to cost savings and improved patient outcomes.

8. DBT is a relatively low-cost innovation compared to breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and its use has been shown to reduce recall rates and improve cancer detection. However, the cost of a DBT system is substantially greater than that of a DM system, and it also requires digital storage for the large file sizes of DBT.

1. Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications have been criticized for lacking evidence supporting their efficacy, with many studies showing that they do not effectively treat coughs. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of diphenhydramine, a commonly used antihistamine, as an antitussive.

2. The study used capsaicin cough challenge testing to measure cough reflex sensitivity in healthy subjects with acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). This method has been shown to be a reliable and reproducible way to assess cough sensitivity.

3. The study found that diphenhydramine significantly inhibited cough reflex sensitivity, with a significant increase in the concentration of capsaicin required to induce 5 or more coughs (C5) compared to placebo. This suggests that diphenhydramine may be an effective antitussive.

4. In contrast, dextromethorphan, another commonly used OTC antitussive, did not show a significant effect on cough reflex sensitivity in this study. This is despite dextromethorphan being widely used and recommended as an antitussive.

5. The study also found that the diphenhydramine-containing syrup was more effective than dextromethorphan in suppressing cough reflex sensitivity. This suggests that diphenhydramine may be a more effective antitussive than dextromethorphan.

6. The study's findings have important implications for the treatment of coughs, particularly in cases of acute URI. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate the effectiveness of other OTC cough and cold products.

7. The study's use of capsaicin cough challenge testing as a measure of cough reflex sensitivity is a significant advancement in the field of cough research. This method allows for a more objective and reliable assessment of cough sensitivity.

8. The study's findings suggest that diphenhydramine may be a useful treatment option for coughs, particularly in cases of acute URI. However, further research is needed to confirm these results and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of diphenhydramine as an antitussive.

1. The axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, and prognosis worsens with increasing number of metastatic lymph nodes. According to the AJCC/UICC tumor classification, nodal disease is classified into three groups based on the number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes.

2. The number of metastatic lymph nodes depends on the number of removed lymph nodes that are dissected by the surgeon and examined by the pathologist. Various studies have shown that the number of metastatic lymph nodes is greater with increasing number of removed lymph nodes.

3. The lymph node ratio (LNR), which is the ratio of the number of metastatic lymph nodes to the number of removed lymph nodes, provides a more useful prognostic information compared to nodal disease classification. Studies have shown that the LNR threshold value varies in different studies and emphasizes the importance of considering the sampling size and tumor stage.

4. In a study of 924 patients with breast carcinoma having 1-3 axillary metastatic lymph nodes, the LNR threshold value of 0.20 was identified as the most significant value separating patients in low- and high-risk groups with significant survival difference. The LNR had independent prognostic significance for disease-free survival (DFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).

5. The study results confirm that a sufficient axillary dissection is necessary for surgical control of the disease in the axilla and for correct evaluation of the axillary status in node-positive patients. The high rate of axillary recurrence in patients with few lymph nodes removed indicates that there may be more than three metastatic lymph nodes in the axilla.

6. The LNR is a more powerful prognostic factor than the number of metastatic lymph nodes, and it can be used to separate n1 disease patients having at least 10 lymph nodes removed into low- and high-risk prognostic groups for distant metastasis development. The LNR can provide more detailed and useful prognostic information than TNM nodal disease classification.

7. The study suggests that LNR may be useful to standardize adjuvant therapy for patients operated in hospitals that use different axillary dissection width and have different median number of removed lymph nodes. LNR can also be used to draw reliably comparisons between treatment results coming from such different hospitals.

1. The phenomenon of non-native biological invasions has been observed for centuries, with notable examples including the phylloxera that devastated the wine industry in Europe in the 1860s and the chestnut blight that eliminated a dominant tree species in North America. These invasions have significant ecological and economic impacts, and their study has become a major area of research.

2. Charles Elton's book on the subject in 1958 did not inspire a broad research thrust or public response, but an international project by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) in the 1980s triggered an explosion of research on invasions. This research has led to a greater understanding of the impacts of non-native species on ecosystems.

3. Studies have shown that non-native species can have a range of impacts, including eating native species, competing with them, infecting them, and sometimes competing with them while vectoring diseases to them. These impacts can be subtle and take a long time to be manifested.

4. Research has also revealed that non-native species can have ecosystem-level impacts, affecting nutrient cycles and other ecosystem processes and features. This can lead to changes in the physical structure of an ecosystem and affect a large fraction of the resident species.

5. Molecular genetic research has shown that non-native species can hybridize with native species, leading to introgression and the evolution of new species. This can also lead to the creation of new, more invasive species.

6. The phenomenon of invasional meltdown, where two or more introduced species facilitate one another's establishment or enhance one another's impact on native species, has been detected in many cases. This can lead to a rapid and significant impact on native ecosystems.

7. The lag effect, where the full impact of an introduced species is not seen until years after its initial arrival, has been observed in many cases. This makes it difficult to predict the impact of an introduced species and highlights the need for early detection and rapid response.

8. Critics of invasion biology argue that the problems caused by non-native species are overblown and that similar impacts arise from native species. They also argue that introduced species can increase native biodiversity and that the methods used to combat invasive species are inhumane.

1. Schwannomas are rare tumors of the nerve sheath that arise from the primary glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, although benign and slow-growing, they can cause significant morbidity due to direct involvement of nerves or by local mass effect.
2. Approximately 25 to 45% of all schwannomas are found in the head and neck, where they can originate from virtually any cranial nerve, with the most common being the vestibular schwannoma.
3. The vestibular schwannoma accounts for 51% of all nerve sheath tumors found anywhere in the body and arises from the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve.
4. Vidian canal schwannomas are extremely rare, with only four documented cases of biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannomas appearing in the literature.
5. Symptoms of vidian schwannomas can result from compression of surrounding structures or extension into surrounding areas, causing headaches, facial pain and paresthesias, and facial muscle paralysis.
6. Radiation therapy, including single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and conventional fractionated radiotherapy, is a common alternative to surgical resection of intracranial schwannomas.

1. The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for obtaining photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering that is typically needed for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, which prevents the use of conductive plastic substrates. The ESA method has been previously demonstrated with ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes.

2. The addition of minor amounts of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to ZnO surfaces brought about a significant impact on the crystal growth for evolution of various nanostructures and alteration of the crystallographic orientation of the film. The coprecipitation of dye molecules does not necessarily deteriorate the crystallinity of ZnO. In the case of ZnO/Eosin Y (EY) hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed.

3. The space between the ZnO nanowire is filled with aggregates of EY, and the solid EY can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline such as dilute KOH aq. The prepared ZnO thin films, consisting of large single-crystalline grains with internal porous structure, have large surface area for adsorption of photosensitizer dye in a large amount and high crystallinity for efficient transport of electrons. This results in a high incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of around 90%.

4. The researchers have been seeking to perform cathodic electrodeposition of CuSCN, a p-type, wide-bandgap semiconductor, into highly crystallized thin films at low temperature. CuSCN has been frequently used as a hole conductor in nanostructured solar cells and also as a sensitized photocathode in combination with hole-injecting dyes. The ESA of CuSCN-based hybrid thin films could serve nicely as a counterpart to the well-established ZnO-based hybrid systems.

5. The researchers have attempted to employ dye molecules having soft Lewis basic NCS groups for the ESA of CuSCN hybrid systems.

1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, specifically the pharyngeal endoderm, and is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx. This remnant normally disappears during the second month of intrauterine fetal development. However, if it becomes obstructed, a Tornwaldt's cyst develops.

2. A Tornwaldt's cyst is a type of nasopharyngeal bursitis that can be either cystic or crusty, with the cystic type being more common and often presenting with symptoms such as nasal obstruction and secretory otitis media. The crusty type, on the other hand, presents with crust expectoration and retching, with or without fetid postnasal discharge. This type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is often asymptomatic.

3. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, but it can appear at any age, with a peak incidence between 15 and 30 years. The disease is more common in Caucasians and has no gender predilection. Most published literature comprises selected case reports and describes the cystic type.

4. A clinicoanatomical audit was conducted to identify the incidence of nasopharyngeal bursa disease, its different types, and its clinical presentation over two years in a single rhinology practice. The audit showed an equal incidence of the cystic and crusty types of the disease. Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx after proper nasal decongestion will clearly show either a cyst or ulcer-like lesion covered with crusts.

5. The crusty type of nasopharyngeal bursitis presents with retching, expectoration of crusts, and/or fetid postnasal discharge, and occasional occipital pain, with symptom-free intervals of a few days. The crust reforms quickly, only to shed again every few days. This type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is often asymptomatic and can develop at any time without recognized predisposing factors.

Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with over 1,890 new cases diagnosed annually.

2. Early diagnosis of melanoma is crucial for prognosis, and dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that enables the visualization of morphological features not discernible by the naked eye. Dermoscopy has been shown to improve diagnostic sensitivity by 10-30%.

3. However, dermoscopy requires great experience to differentiate skin lesions, and inexperienced dermatologists may experience a decrease in diagnostic accuracy. Experts have achieved 90% sensitivity and 59% specificity in skin lesion diagnosis, while less trained doctors have shown significant drops in accuracy.

4. The diagnosis of melanoma is highly dependent on subjective judgment and is scarcely reproducible, making it challenging to develop reliable diagnostic systems. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve diagnostic performance, but they have shown problems with within- and between-observer concordance.

5. A growing interest has developed in the automated analysis of digitized images obtained by dermoscopy techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions. Computational intelligence methods have been applied to help physicians and dermatologists in faster data processing and more reliable diagnoses.

6. The application of machine vision and computerized analysis has become increasingly important in melanoma diagnosis, with numerous computerized diagnostic systems reported in the literature. Researchers have reviewed and critically examined image analysis techniques for skin cancer diagnosis and compared diagnostic accuracy with experts and artificial intelligence.

A standard automatic decision support system based on semantic analysis of melanoma images and further classification of characteristic objects has been proposed.

The main processing step towards a complete analysis of pigmented skin lesions is to differentiate the lesion from the healthy skin, which is a challenging task due to the presence of artifacts such as uneven illumination, hair, and skin lines and texture. Preprocessing steps such as image resizing, masking, cropping, and color space transformation are necessary to facilitate the segmentation process.

The study population consisted of 151 patients with established coronary disease on dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin.

2. The study found that carriers of cyp2c19 * 2 alleles had higher platelet aggregation and higher VN-P2Y12 reactivity with significantly lower VN platelet inhibition than noncarriers. This association was observed in both the maintenance clopidogrel therapy group and the group that received a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose.

3. In contrast, pon1 (q192r) polymorphism was not associated with increased platelet aggregation or VN-P2Y12 reactivity. In fact, there was a trend towards lower platelet reactivity in pon1 (q192r) individuals.

This was observed in both the maintenance clopidogrel therapy group and the group that received a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose.

5. The results of the current study are consistent with findings of Shuldiner et al, who did not demonstrate an association of SNPs in or near the pon1 gene with clopidogrel nonresponse during clopidogrel maintenance dosing. The study confirms the association of cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphism with reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.

1. Approximately 20 million people in the United States have gallstones, and 1 million new patients are diagnosed with cholelithiasis every year, making it the most costly digestive disease, with an estimated annual cost of over $5 billion. The National Institute of Health convened a consensus development conference in 1992 to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The conference concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no apparent increase in morbidity or mortality. This led to a reduction in the disability and loss of income following the surgery.

2. However, the charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often surpass those of open cholecystectomy, which is surprising given the reduced length of stay and hospital support required for laparoscopic procedures. Surgeons at Maricopa Medical Center identified excessive charges by comparing the cholecystectomy DRG with 16 other hospitals in the region. The remainder of the patients were either old with complications or young with advanced disease and complicated courses. Little could be done to reduce charges except to lessen the conversion rates or costs for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

3. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients was conducted from a four-year data base of 633 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy. Thirty-five patients with converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies and thirty-five patients with open cholecystectomies were selected from the data by matching for age, sex, and similar diagnosis. A paired sample t-test was used for statistical analysis with significance at the p=0.05 level. The average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922, and that of open cholecystectomies was $13,042.

However, if charges could be reduced to certain levels, depending on the conversion rate, laparoscopic cholecystectomy would become cost-effective. Steiner reviewed surgical rates and operative mortality for open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Maryland and found the overall mortality rate had been reduced by 33%.

Lower baseline A1C levels at diagnosis were associated with higher chances of PR, and this effect was evidenced in girls entering PR. However, boys had similar A1C levels whether they entered PR or not.

3. The study also found that higher baseline C-peptide concentrations were observed in girls and boys entering PR compared to patients without PR, and this effect was more pronounced in boys. C-peptide levels at diagnosis positively correlated with PR duration in the age subgroup 0-4 years. However, initial C-peptide levels were not significantly associated with higher chances of PR. The study did not find any long-term effects of PR on diabetes complications or incidence of severe hypoglycemia, partly due to low numbers of events.

1. Oral health is crucial for the quality of life of individuals across all age groups, and oral lesions can lead to discomfort, pain, and interference with daily activities such as mastication, swallowing, and speech. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a population over 60 years old as elderly. In India, 8.6% of the population is 60 years or more, highlighting the need for geriatric healthcare.

2. Research on gerodontology is limited, and there is a lack of studies on the prevalence of oral lesions in the elderly population. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in 5,100 geriatric patients in India. The study was conducted from September 2008 to October 2012 at the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Jodhpur Dental College General Hospital.

3. The study consisted of 5,100 patients, with 3,100 (60.8%) men and 2,000 (39.2%) women, aged between 60 and 98 years. A written informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to the inclusion in the study. All examinations were carried out by one researcher, and a calibration exercise was conducted before recording the clinical parameters.

4. The study found that 3,264 patients (64%) presented with various oral lesions, with males being more affected (66%) than females (34%). The majority of the cases had only one lesion (42%), while some patients exhibited more than one oral lesion simultaneously. The most common sites for oral lesions were the hard palate (23.1%), tongue (16.4%), and gingiva (14.7%).

5. The lesions identified during the study were classified according to clinical, histopathological, and microbiological diagnosis and were distributed in 27 different clinical entities. Nicotinic stomatitis (43%) due to tobacco use and denture stomatitis (34%) due to long use of prostheses were the most commonly diagnosed lesions. OSMF (30%) was also a commonly seen premalignant lesion due to high percentage of people with the habit of betel nut chewing.

6. The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions has been found to be higher in older patients than in the younger population.

1. Chondroblastoma is a rare osseous tumor that affects the epiphyseal regions of the tubular bones, especially the ends of the tibia, femur, and humerus. It can also occur in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint (TMJ), resulting in various symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, and hearing impairments. In the case of chondroblastoma in the temporal bone, accurate diagnosis is crucial due to its potential for malignant transformation.

2. A patient with a misdiagnosed chondroblastoma in the temporal bone underwent a modified surgical procedure, which included subtotal resection of the temporal bone and skull base dissection. The patient's postoperative recovery was successful, with no residual tumor or clinical evidence of recurrence after four and a half years. This case highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and early-stage treatment for chondroblastoma, as well as the value of modified surgical procedures for later-stage cases.

1. The benefits of regular structured exercise are well-documented, including improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic function, which reduce the risk of chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also demonstrates that exercise alone reduces visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL). However, it is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits. Understanding these associations has implications for policy, particularly in public health messages.

2. Cross-sectional analyses indicate an inverse relationship between central adiposity and self-reported physical activity levels, as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Prospective studies have further supported this association, with physically inactive individuals having higher liver fat scores. However, self-reported behavior is subject to reporter bias and tends to overestimate activity levels. Emerging evidence using objectively measured physical activity via accelerometry supports these observations.

3. The study aimed to evaluate whether levels of accurately quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of VAT and IHL in adults with overweight/obesity. Based on current guidelines for the management of obesity, the researchers hypothesized that there would be a negative relationship between time spent in moderate intensity physical activity and levels of VAT and IHL. The study included 82 volunteers who provided informed consent and underwent baseline assessments, including measures of anthropometry, a fasting blood test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and spectroscopy (H-MRS). The results showed that traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were associated with VAT and IHL.

4. The study found that there was no relationship between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat. However, a weak positive association was observed between VAT volume and time spent in moderate activity. The inclusion of objectively measured levels of moderate activity and sedentary behavior did not improve the potency of traditional risk factors for predicting the liver fat concentration or level of visceral adiposity. The study suggests that a direct link between unstructured, objectively measured levels of physical activity and sedentariness and levels of metabolically risky fat depots is insignificant.

5. The findings of this study are consistent with previous research that has suggested that prolonged sitting is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and type 2 diabetes. However, the association between sedentary behavior and markers of cardiometabolic risk disappears when adjusted for total physical activity levels. The study suggests that only individuals with low activity and high levels of sedentary behavior, such as sitting, may",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

2. The results showed that the right eye was affected in 30 eyes, while the left eye was affected in 23, and the severity of ocular damage was more among patients who ignited the fireworks themselves than bystanders. The most common types of firecracker causing injury were bombs, as reported by other Indian studies.

3. The study found that 18 eyes underwent surgical management, including corneal tear repair, scleral tear repair, and pars plana vitrectomy, while 34 eyes were managed conservatively. The visual outcome was poor, with 7 eyes having vision worse than 3/60 and 5 eyes developing phthisis bulbi.

4. The study highlights the need for immediate measures to reduce ocular morbidity and noise pollution, such as prohibiting the manufacture and sale of dangerous fireworks. Public awareness about the possible dangers and expert primary ophthalmic care of the injured are also essential to prevent preventable blindness.

1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (sch), characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, is a relatively common disorder that represents early, mild thyroid failure. The prevalence of sch varies according to population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement. It is essential to standardize the normal reference range for TSH levels and establish quality control procedures to accurately diagnose sch.

2. The relationship between elevated TSH levels and adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes is unclear, and the optimal TSH cutoff values and clinical significance of subclinical abnormalities are controversial. The treatment of sch is typically considered only for patients who are pregnant, infertile, exhibit associated symptoms, or have a high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, the evidence supporting screening for this disorder and the benefits and risks of its treatment remains controversial.

3. The most common cause of sch is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis associated with the presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, which is a marker of chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is more common in girls and women, but the overall incidence increases with age in both sexes. Patients who have been treated for overt thyroid failure often exhibit sch due to inadequate thyroid hormone supplementation, poor adherence to the treatment regimen, drug interactions, or inadequate monitoring of treatment.

4. The prevalence of sch is relatively high and ranges from 4% to 20% in the adult population, with women, elderly people, and iodine-sufficient populations being affected more often. Studies have demonstrated that variations in thyroid function within the population reference range have a substantial impact on weight and body mass index (BMI). Higher levels of TSH are associated with an increased BMI and rising TSH levels, which are associated with enhanced weight gain.

5. Subclinical hypothyroidism can lead to impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function, and symptomatic sch patients often complain of reduced exercise tolerance during effort. The negative effects of sch on CV function might be improved or reversed by replacement doses of T4. Studies have shown that T4 replacement therapy improves systolic and diastolic heart function, endothelial function, and carotid intima-media thickness.

1. The anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and antimicrobial drugs disrupt the normal intestinal flora, allowing C. difficile to flourish and release toxins that induce C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Although CDAD is the common healthcare-associated infectious disease, treatment or infection countermeasures are not applied to patients who do not present with diarrhea, including asymptomatic adults who carry C. difficile in their intestines. CDAD diagnosis widely uses an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B (CD toxins) released by the C. difficile cells.

2. However, the low detection sensitivity of EIA for the CD toxins has been reported, with a detection sensitivity of around 70% compared to the 90% detection sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytotoxigenic culture. CDAD diagnosis is based on EIA results in Japan, because PCR has not been clinically available. If EIA testing is performed on C. difficile isolates cultured from the same specimen, an EIA GDH-positive and toxin-negative stool specimen may give a toxin-positive result.

3. Bacterial content is higher in specimens containing colonies in solution compared to stool, and toxin concentration may also be markedly higher. If a specimen is GDH-positive, follow-up testing with a nucleic acid amplification test, such as PCR, is recommended to compensate for the low sensitivity of EIA. PCR detection of TCDA or TCDB genes is the evidence for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile.

4. The present study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA and compared the clinical history and need for treatment among patients with toxin-positive stool, toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates, and toxin-negative stool and isolates. Patients were divided into three groups based on the EIA CD toxin results in stool specimens and isolates obtained from bacterial culture. The aim of the study was to investigate clinical history and need for the treatment of patients with GDH-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens.

2. The trial included 5,269 participants who were randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two-by-two factorial design and followed for a median of 3 years after randomization.
3. The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow-up, which was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
4. Rosiglitazone, but not ramipril, resulted in significant improvements in measures of -cell function over time, including a significant increase in IGI/IR and a significant decrease in PI/C.
5. The findings suggest that the diabetes preventive effect of rosiglitazone may in part be a consequence of improved -cell function, and that rosiglitazone may improve -cell function indirectly by ameliorating pathogenic processes such as lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity, and inflammation.

1. Microbial communities differ from monocultures in terms of the toxins they degrade, the natural products they produce, and their capacity to grow in certain environments. A complete understanding of microbial metabolism must extend from the properties of individual strains in pure culture to the combinatorial interactions supported by complex communities. Such strains may exhibit naturally complementary metabolism or be genetically engineered to interact. Interacting partners share metabolites, such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose.

2. A general model of metabolic interaction would account for the variety of metabolites that can be exchanged and the genotypic diversity of the strains that exchange them. Ideally, such a model would not require detailed biochemical characterization of each individual participant to be predictive. Optimization-based techniques of flux balance analysis have been successful in describing metabolic systems. These approaches draw on the well-characterized biochemical reaction network of organisms such as Escherichia coli.

3. We extended these approaches to the higher-order system of two strains in concourse and found that certain pairs of auxotrophs will complement one another's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites. This relationship is referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (SMT). The SMT interactions constitute a class of synthetic genetic interactions because they reflect and elucidate the genetic and metabolic network from which they derive. We developed a quantitative and predictive theoretical model that reveals the extent to which complex metabolic interactions emerge from the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network.

4. We selected 46 conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli from the Keio collection and each deletion strain exhibits robust growth in rich (LB) medium but no measurable growth in minimal (M9) medium. Strains were labeled individually with plasmids expressing either Venus or mCherry fluorescent proteins and co-cultured in minimal media in all pairwise combinations. Theoretical and empirical precedents have established that metabolic cooperation is enhanced at intermediate cell densities. Strains were therefore each inoculated at 10 cells per ml, roughly 1/200th saturation density.

5. A subset of mixed pairs showed improved growth relative to either corresponding monoculture, and 17% of dissimilar pairings showed greater than 50-fold growth, indicating metabolic synergy. Growth phenotypes were variable, with alternately one strain, both, or neither benefiting from the interaction. For each strain, we were able to identify at least one partner with which synergistic growth was evident. Conversely, no strain exhibited a universally cooperative phenotype.

1. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) is a rare genodermatosis characterized by the progressive formation of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, mainly trichoepiteliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas. This condition is due to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene cyld (cylindromatosis gene) on chromosome 16q12q13.

2. A 71-year-old woman was evaluated due to the progressive development of asymptomatic lesions in her head, and multiple rounded skin-colored or erythematous papules were found in her scalp and forehead. The histopathological diagnosis was spiradenoma in all of the lesions, except for one cylindroma.

3. The family pedigree suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the disease, and the exon 8 sequencing of the cyld gene revealed the heterozygous mutation c.1628_1629delct in the patient and her two affected daughters. This mutation consists of a two-base-pair deletion that originates a new frameshift.

4. The genetic study in this case confirmed the association of the heterozygous cyld gene mutation c.1628_1629delct with BSS, and the authors suggest that the particularities of the clinical manifestations may support the hypothesis about the relationship between the germline mutation, variable presence of somatic mutation, and the final phenotype. The genetic study should be considered individually with the possibility of genetic counseling to the family members.

1. Biological scaffold materials derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa have been utilized for soft tissue repair applications, including hernia repair, breast reconstruction, and orthopedic applications. These materials are particularly useful in clean-contaminated or contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria. However, they are also extremely expensive and exhibit substantial scaffold variability.

2. Early designs of absorbable polymer scaffolds, such as Dexon and Vicryl, have been developed, but they have shown limitations in terms of mechanical strength and resorption profile. Dexon is comprised of polyglycolic acid and degrades in vivo via hydrolysis, while Vicryl is a copolymer of glycolide and lactide that also degrades in vivo through hydrolysis. However, both materials have been associated with hernia formation and other complications.

3. More recent absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, have been developed, which utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly. Phasix Mesh, in particular, has been evaluated in a porcine model for hernia repair applications and has shown promising results in terms of mechanical strength, resorption profile, and histological characteristics. The material has been found to be durable and capable of maintaining support at the repair site over a 52-week period.

1. Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci was first detected over 25 years ago, and since then, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become significant nosocomial pathogens associated with high mortality and costs. VRE infections are often linked to outbreaks in healthcare settings.

2. The resistance in enterococci is primarily mediated by van genes, with Vana and VanB being the most prevalent. Several European countries have reported a rising incidence of VRE in recent years.

3. In Denmark, a significant increase in VRE cases since 2012 has been attributed to multiclonal outbreaks of Vana-positive Enterococcus faecium. The country's healthcare system has implemented measures to control the spread of VRE.

4. Current guidelines recommend screening patients at risk and implementing isolation precautions for VRE carriers. Screening relies on selective culturing and/or detection of the resistance genes Vana or VanB by PCR.

5. A study in France highlighted the benefits of rapid VRE detection, which can lead to substantial indirect savings. The study compared the management of two simultaneous VRE outbreaks on two different wards.

6. Several studies have examined the diagnostic accuracy of various assays to detect Vana and VanB with or without a previous enrichment step. However, the results have been inconsistent, with sensitivities ranging from 43.5% to 100% and specificities from 79.2% to 99.6%.

7. The Xpert Vana/VanB assay is a fully automated system that integrates DNA extraction and real-time PCR, providing results within an hour. The assay has been used to screen for VRE in rectal swabs.

8. The study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert Vana/VanB assay and its impact on infection control decision-making. The assay was used to screen 1110 VRE samples from 804 patients.

Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) were proved in several observational and experimental studies.

2. The lipid-lowering action of n-3 PUFAs was detected at the beginning, so these nutrients were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders. Their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects were observed later. Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

3. Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease featured by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through the disease progression. In physiological conditions, endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins. However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts, leading towards an increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

4. The human body can produce almost all fatty acids, except linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which are named essential fatty acids because the body cannot synthesize them. Endogenous conversion of the initial C18 PUFA precursors results in the synthesis of longer-chain counterparts such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish is the major food source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, including EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA).

1. The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is built on the work of pioneering pathologists, including Rudolf Virchow, Pelayo Correa, and Robin Warren. Virchow's idea that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation laid the foundation for further research. Correa's model for gastric cancer development, published in 1975, proposed a stepwise process from chronic atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and cancer.

2. Correa initially thought that environmental factors, such as diet, were responsible for promoting the progression from gastritis to cancer. However, his subsequent work focused on the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer, and his model has stood the test of time. The discovery of H. pylori by Warren and Marshall in the 1980s provided crucial evidence for the bacterium's role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.

3. Initial investigations into the association between H. pylori and gastric cancer provided weak evidence, but subsequent cohort studies showed a significant correlation between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. The World Health Organization declared H. pylori a definite carcinogen in 1994, based on the compelling results of these studies. H. pylori eradication has been shown to reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer by approximately 40% in primary prevention studies.

4. The eradication of H. pylori from a community has been shown to prevent gastric cancer and diminish the morbidity of peptic ulcers. A pilot study in Taiwan showed a 25% decrease in gastric cancer incidence and a 77% decrease in gastric atrophy after mass population screening and eradication. Recent meta-analyses have confirmed the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication in preventing gastric cancer.

The inverse relationship between H. pylori and esophageal adenocarcinoma has raised concerns about the potential benefits of H. pylori eradication in the developed world.

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NAMD) is a leading cause of visual loss among the elderly population, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents have significantly improved treatment outcomes. Before the introduction of anti-VEGF agents, only a limited number of patients achieved prevention of visual acuity loss with different treatment options. Intravitreal treatments with bevacizumab and ranibizumab have led to significant improvements in visual acuity and prevention of visual loss in most patients. The multicenter studies with ranibizumab, such as MARINA, ANCHOR, PRONTO, and EXCITE, showed that ranibizumab and bevacizumab were effective in preventing visual acuity loss in up to 95% of patients.

2. The CATT trial compared the efficacy of bevacizumab and ranibizumab and showed that both drugs had similar effects in the treatment of NAMD. However, the safety of the drugs remains unclear, and there is an ongoing debate about this issue. This study aimed to compare the functional and anatomical outcomes of bevacizumab therapy to ranibizumab therapy on an as-needed treatment regimen for NAMD in Turkish patients. The clinical data of patients who were treated with either bevacizumab or ranibizumab between 2009 and 2011 were retrospectively evaluated for this study.

3. Further studies are required to understand the complex network of signaling cascades that drive angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs, and to identify specific cancer indications for novel therapeutic agents targeting VEGF family members and their receptors.

1. Over the last two decades, many new immunotherapy approaches to cancer treatment have entered clinical development due to increased understanding of immune mechanisms.
2. These approaches have led to the approval of several agents, including infusional cytokine therapies and active cellular therapies targeting specific antigens.
3. However, evaluating these agents using traditional clinical development paradigms has presented challenges, particularly when used in combination with other therapies.
4. To address this, researchers have sought to identify markers of biological response associated with clinical outcome, but this has been more elusive for broadly active immune modulating agents.
5. Studies have used machine-learning algorithms to identify potentially promising biomarkers and potential biomarker networks in complex data sets.
6. Researchers have used serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) to identify immunologically recognized proteins expressed by normal and malignant prostate tissue.
7. The study found that IgG immune responses could be detected to individual antigens and were associated with individual treatments, suggesting that these responses might be useful as biomarkers of immunological efficacy.
8. The researchers used a machine-learning approach to identify a subset of biomarkers associated with clinical response, including IgG responses to chromosome 1 gene contig 1 and bac RP11-321G3.
9. The study demonstrated that immune-active therapies, including androgen deprivation, elicit IgG responses to individual prostate-associated antigens, which were more obvious many months after treatment.
10. The findings suggest that IgG responses to specific antigens might be developed as a diagnostic tool to evaluate immune responses elicited following immune-active therapies and as a biomarker of clinical response.

2. The researchers used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films as a substrate for MC3T3 cells to investigate the concept of using piezoelectric materials for osteoblast mechanical stimulation.
3. The PVDF films were coated with acrylic and bone-like particles to improve cell adhesion and electrical insulation, and were then subjected to dynamic conditions to stimulate the cells.
4. The study found that the actuated devices had a significantly higher total bone area, immature bone area, and mature bone area compared to static controls.
5. The mineral apposition rate was also significantly higher around actuated devices, indicating increased bone formation.
6. Immunohistochemistry revealed a marked elevation in osteopontin (OPN) detection around actuators, particularly in areas with higher displacement values.
7. The study suggests that the increased OPN expression is associated with mechanical stress, and may play a role in bone formation and mineralization.
8. The researchers noted that the electric insulation of the PVDF films remained satisfactory, but further studies are needed to confirm this.

1. The study investigated the role of LCN2 in lipid metabolism, adaptive thermoregulation, and diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice. LCN2-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells from mouse strain 129.

2. The mice were backcrossed onto the B6 background for 10 generations before being used for experiments. Heterozygous mating was used to generate wild-type and LCN2 mice for the experiments.

3. The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at the University of Minnesota, and animal handling followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Experimental procedures were approved by the University of Minnesota Animal Care and Use Committee.

4. Age-matched male wild-type and LCN2 mice were allocated into groups and fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a regular chow diet (RCD) with free access to water. Body weight was significantly different between wild-type and LCN2 mice fed an HFD.

5. LCN2 mice were significantly heavier than wild-type mice on either an HFD or RCD. The weight of white and brown fat pads was significantly higher in HFD-fed mice than that in wild-type mice.

6. LCN2 mice showed a significantly higher weight of liver, heart, kidney, and spleen compared to wild-type mice. Similar metabolic phenotypes were also observed in female LCN2 mice.

7. The study found that LCN2 mice were cold intolerant and failed to maintain body temperature when acutely exposed to cold temperature. Cold exposure could still significantly stimulate gene expression of UCP-1 and PGC-1 in BAT in LCN2 mice.

8. The expression levels of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function were significantly reduced in BAT of LCN2 mice fed an HFD. This suggests that mitochondrial metabolism is dysfunctional in BAT of LCN2 mice.

9. The study demonstrated that LCN2 mice display impaired adaptive thermogenesis and deteriorated diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity in BAT and skeletal muscle may be the primary mechanisms for the development of diet-induced insulin resistance and cold sensitivity in LCN2 mice.

1. The study used 10-week-old male Wistar rats obtained from Sankyo Labo Service, Co. Ltd. in Japan. Each animal was housed in an individual cage with unlimited food and water and a 12-h light/dark cycle. The rats were given 0.3-mg/kg LPS intravenously on days 1 and 2.

2. On days 3, 4, and 5, the animals were given 20-mg/kg methylprednisolone intramuscularly to promote the development of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). The injections were administered at 7:00 p.m. Hindlimb unloading was accomplished as described by Wronski and Morey-Holton with some modifications.

3. The tail was varnished with instant adhesive, and a strip of traction tape was attached to the tail beginning at the base of the tail above the hairline. The cast was attached to a swivel anchored to the cage that allowed a 360-degree range of movement. The animals were then suspended in a head-down tilted position.

4. In non-weight-bearing (NWB) rats, the tail was suspended from day 1 to sacrifice. The femur and humerus were harvested from each rat and fixed with 10% formalin-0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The tissues were processed for routine haematoxylin and eosin staining.

5. Histopathological osteonecrosis was defined as the diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis. The study used a chi-square test to compare the data between weight-bearing (WB) and NWB groups. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

1. Nurses in Kenya have been found to be inadequately involved in national policy development processes, with many feeling excluded from policy decisions and lacking opportunities to contribute to policy formulation. This lack of involvement has been attributed to various factors, including the top-down approach to policy-making, inadequate knowledge and skills among nurses, and the hierarchical structure of the health care system. The findings of this study highlight the need for nurses to be more actively engaged in policy-making processes.

2. The study found that nurses in Kenya lack the necessary knowledge and skills to contribute to policy processes, with many nurses not understanding the broader issues outside of nursing that are necessary to influence policies. This deficiency in nurses' knowledge is attributed to the failure of the nursing profession to incorporate policy issues and policy processes into nurses' training curricula. As a result, nurses are not equipped to participate in policy-making processes at the national level.

3. The study also identified the need for nurses to develop leadership and advocacy skills to enhance their ability to carry out policy advocacy at all levels. This can be achieved through programs such as the Leadership in Negotiation Program, the Global Nursing Leadership Institute, and the Leadership for Change Program, which aim to build the capacity for leadership in nursing. By developing these skills, nurses can influence decisions to strengthen the health care system, resource allocation, and primary health care.

4. To enhance nurses' role in advocacy, nurses should unite to build a strong voice to advocate for improvements in national policies that affect their work and quality of care. Working in collaboration with other health professionals, nurses can influence decisions to strengthen the health care system, resource allocation, and primary health care. Additionally, nursing regulators and educators should be clear that policy involvement is part of nurses' scope of practice, and nurses should be given orientation on existing national policies in the sector and how these policies are affecting their work environment and patient outcomes.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited disorders caused by a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, resulting in altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent variant, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, accounts for 95% of affected patients and is caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).

2. The deficiency of 21-hydroxylase leads to a decrease in negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, causing hyperplasia of the adrenal gland and increased virilization. Treatment of CAH consists of replacement of glucocorticoids and, when necessary, mineralocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and suppress abnormal androgen secretion.

3. The study investigated the frequency of white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in 26 patients with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The results showed that 11 patients (42.3%) had MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities and temporal lobe atrophy.

4. The mechanisms leading to brain atrophy in CAH patients are not fully understood, but may be related to hormonal imbalance, exogenous glucocorticoids, and chronic hyperandrogenism. Further studies are required to define the relationships between brain involvement and different CAH phenotypes and treatment regimens.

1. The delivery of the human genome draft sequence by publicly funded and corporate projects promises to precipitate significant biomedical advances this century. To rise to this challenge, biologists must become adept at navigating the vast expanses of genomic DNA data that may seem, at first glance, to be devoid of features.

2. Surveying and signposting this apparently bland genomic landscape should guide investigators towards experiments that address specific hypotheses about gene function. Different communities of biologists speak in dialects that are not always mutually comprehensible, particularly with respect to the umbrella term 'function'.

3. If the genome is to offer up its secrets to all scientific communities, its surveyors need to adopt universal vocabularies. Broadly speaking, there are two common ways of annotating (assigning names and functions to) genes.

4. Websites such as LocusLink, GeneCards, EuGenes, and Ensembl integrate information from diverse sources relevant to individual human genes. Such annotation is essential, yet it is currently restricted to the minority of human genes - those that have been characterized experimentally.

5. A key to the databases mentioned in this article is the second type of annotation, which relies not on empirical observations but rather on predicted evolutionary relationships. All genes that are thought to have arisen from a common ancestor are defined as homologs.

6. The importance of annotating the genomic landscape on the basis of homology is that protein homologs invariably have similar tertiary structures and frequently also have similar functions. The surveying and way-marking of each new gene needn't always be an arduous process of discovering structure and function from scratch.

7. The predicted domains in a protein can suggest its function, localization, and potential interactions with other proteins. However, prediction of a protein's domain architecture does not allow prediction of its cellular function or the phenotypic effect of its deficiency.

8. The number of representatives of a domain family in a proteome is not directly related to that family's contribution to cellular and organismal function. Future proteome comparisons will progress beyond the simple enumeration of homologous genes and domains towards an understanding of the biology that underlies the variability of domain family sizes.

9. The Gene Ontology Project (GO) has created an initial hierarchy of defined terms that encompasses many of the flavors of 'function' commonly described in biology. GO has begun to permeate throughout genomics and will do so more rapidly as its scope and attention to detail improve.

The prototype was designed to overcome the limitations of universal testing machines, which are expensive, large, and complex to handle. The prototype was developed to measure the accuracy and precision of the bracket debonding force in vivo.

2. The prototype consisted of three basic parts: a modified plier, a measurement and control circuit, and a PC with specific software to record the values of the bracket debonding force. The software was programmed in C and designed to enable appropriate use in a research environment. The software has a calibration system and calibration was performed with weights ranging from 0.5 kg to 6 kg.

3. The prototype was tested with weights ranging from 1 kg to 6 kg, and the measurements were undertaken by two examiners who did not standardize the position of the hand on the pliers. Twenty repetitions were performed for each weight, and the numerical value recorded by the software installed on the computer was noted. The arithmetic mean was calculated for each weight.

4. The mean temperature in the laboratory during the experiments was 23 ± 2°C, and the humidity was 70%. The exposed enamel surface was lightly abraded with #600 grain silicon carbide abrasive paper in a polisher to obtain a flat enamel surface. The maxillary central incisor brackets were bonded to the enamel using a specific procedure.

5. The specimens were divided into two equal groups: group 1, where the bracket debonding was performed with the prototype, and group 2, where the bracket debonding was performed by tensile testing in a universal testing machine. The bond strength obtained in group 1 (2.96 MPa) and in group 2 (3.08 MPa) were statistically similar. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) score 3 was predominant in both groups.

1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, classified as a symptomatic generalized epilepsy syndrome by the International League Against Epilepsy. It is characterized by tonic seizures, atonic seizures, and atypical absence seizures, with some patients also developing myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, or partial seizures. The syndrome is often associated with cognitive impairment and behavioral disorders.

2. The diagnosis of LGS requires the presence of three key features: interictal awake electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns consisting of slow spike-wave discharges, paroxysms of low-voltage fast activity during sleep, and cognitive impairment involving moderate to severe mental retardation and behavioral disorders. Over 75% of children with LGS have a history of congenital or acquired etiologies, such as cortical maldevelopment, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, CNS infection, or neurometabolic disorders. The typical age of onset of LGS is between 2 and 5 years, with boys being affected about 5 times more often than girls.

3. The prognosis of LGS is poor, with regard to both seizures and cognitive outcome. Risk factors for a poor cognitive prognosis include symptomatic etiology, history of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, prior infantile spasms, and early age of seizure onset. Due to the encephalopathic nature and multiple seizure types, LGS is notoriously difficult to treat.

4. Treatment of LGS often involves the use of multiple anticonvulsants, which can lead to cumulative side effects and drug interactions. Valproic acid is considered the most useful initial medication for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS. However, caution must be exercised in using valproic acid in children under the age of 2 years, especially if they are receiving several other anticonvulsants.

1. The study investigated the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica) in central Spain. The researchers hypothesized that interpopulational variations in chemical signals could lead to premating boundaries and reproductive isolation. They aimed to explore the possibility that P. hispanica lizards use chemical sexual signals to discriminate between populations.

2. The study involved capturing male and female lizards from five localities within the Madrid region and making morphological measurements of each individual lizard. The researchers selected these populations because lizards clearly differ in morphology and coloration. They also made morphological measurements of the head and counted the number of femoral pores on the right and left hindlimbs of lizards.

3. The researchers used one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to test for differences in morphological variables between populations. They found significant differences between populations in all morphological measurements, with lizards from Fuenfra and Golondrina populations being significantly heavier and longer than lizards from Aranjuez and Belmonte populations. Lizards from Pedrezuela were intermediate in size between the other populations.

4. The study also analyzed the composition and proportion of chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions of males using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). They found 53 lipophilic compounds in femoral gland secretions of male P. hispanica, with steroids and carboxylic acids being the predominant components. The researchers found differences between populations in the presence/absence of 19 compounds in femoral secretions.

5. The discriminant analysis showed that the eight principal components (PCs) scores describing proportions of compounds in femoral secretions could be used to predict the population of origin of a male lizard. The researchers found significant differences between populations in the number of tongue-flicks (TFs) directed at the swab in response to scents of males and females from different populations. Males from Aranjuez and Belmonte directed a significantly higher number of TFs to scent of males of their own population than to males from the three northern populations.

The study found that females also discriminated between scents of males from different populations, with females from northern populations making more TFs in response to scent of northern males than to southern males. However, there were no differences between populations within each area.

1. The advent of cell type-specific molecular markers has enabled the description and analysis of developmental morphogenesis in various biological systems. Gene-specific RNA probes are now extensively used to visualize gene expression patterns and provide valuable information regarding the role of specific genes during development. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a widely used technique that involves the use of RNA probes to detect specific gene expression patterns in embryos. This technique has been used in several biological systems, including Drosophila, Xenopus, Quail, Dictyostelium, and Zebrafish.

2. In situ hybridization (ISH) is a common technique among developmental research labs, and its uses are diverse, including medical and prenatal diagnostics. The technique involves the use of RNA probes to detect specific gene expression patterns in embryos. However, the use of chromogenic multilabeling techniques has limitations, including the difficulty in discerning overlapping regions of expression. The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts may overcome this limitation.

3. Fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts have several advantages, including higher quality three-dimensional imaging and multiplexing different RNA species. However, the major limitations preventing the widespread use of fluorescence detection for WISH are the high endogenous background fluorescence of many embryos and the limited brightness and photostability of organic fluorophores. Quantum dots (QDs) have been used recently in several systems in vitro for detection of proteins and in vivo for protein labeling and lineage tracing. QDs have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission and longer excited state lifetime.

4. The use of QDs offers several advantages over organic fluorophores, including wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, and resistance to photobleaching. QDs have been used for in situ hybridization in clinical biopsies for the detection of multiple mRNAs with successful conjugation to oligonucleotide probes. However, previous efforts to use QDs for RNA detection in whole embryos met with aggregation issues and were time-consuming. The use of hydrophilic QDs and hydrophilic QD conjugates has become commercially available, making it possible to use QDs for RNA detection in whole embryos.

1. Pancreatic cancer is a devastatingly lethal disease with the highest mortality and lowest one, three, and five-year relative survival rates of all cancers in the United States. It accounts for approximately 44,000 new diagnoses and over 37,000 deaths per year. Pancreatic cancer ranks only behind breast, colon, and lung cancer in total US cancer mortality. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential.

2. The median survival time after PDAC diagnosis is about four months, with only about 19% of patients surviving past one year and only about 2% surviving past five years. However, the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC may vary significantly depending on many factors, including demographic characteristics and the pathologic nature of the tumor, as well as the type of treatment performed. Cox proportional regression models have been used to estimate the relative impact of distinct risk factors on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC. These models have shown that demographic factors such as gender, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, and time period of diagnosis have a significant impact on survival.

3. Clinical factors such as tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases also have a significant influence on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC. The most dramatic influence on survival is a surgical resection of the tumor, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Unfortunately, less than 20% of patients diagnosed with PDAC are suitable for surgical resection. For the remaining patients, the extent of disease precludes the use of surgical procedures.

4. The combination of surgery with radiation and chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival compared to surgery alone. Cox proportional hazards regression models have been used to develop two nomograms for estimating survival for patients diagnosed with PDAC. One nomogram estimates survival for patients who have undergone pancreatectomy of the malignancy, while the other nomogram predicts the risk of perioperative mortality in PDAC patients scheduled to undergo pancreatectomy. These nomograms have been shown to have good discrimination and calibration abilities.

5. Recently, two new Cox regression models were developed to estimate the survival for patients with resectable and unresectable PDAC. These models use variables such as age, gender, race, tumor stage, tumor site, tumor grade, and radiotherapy. An interactive, online clinical calculator was developed to estimate survival probability for patients diagnosed with PDAC based",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28}"

1. The study recruited 278 Japanese patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for chronic limb ischemia (CLI) between 2003 and 2009. The patients were evaluated for limb ischemia by angiography, and the diagnosis and management of CLI were compliant with the Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) or its revised consensus, TASC II.

2. The indication of PTA was judged by consensus among vascular specialists, including vascular surgeons, and was not considered feasible when lesions were heavily calcified and/or with diffuse occlusions. Poor-risk patients, having relative contraindications for bypass surgery, were not necessarily contraindications for PTA.

3. Major amputation, namely, above-the-ankle amputation, was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control their foot lesions. The indication for amputation was judged by consensus among plastic surgeons as well as vascular specialists.

4. The study analyzed all of the recruited patients as well as those with diabetes, and the preoperative variables considered in the analyses were sex, age, activities of daily living (ADLs), Fontaine stage, the presence of infection, diabetic condition, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, receiving regular hemodialysis, and serum albumin level as a nutritional marker.

5. Diabetic condition was determined as the presence of diabetes in the whole population and as glycemic control in the diabetic population, and the diagnosis of diabetes was based on World Health Organization criteria. Glycemic control of diabetic patients was evaluated by A1C.

6. The study found that diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared with nondiabetic patients, whereas they had a similar life prognosis. The leading cause of death was cardiac and vascular disease, followed by infection.

7. The presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation, and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 3.101 (95% CI 1.262-7.621) (p = 0.014). Mortality was associated with age, impaired ADLs, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.

1. Human cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is a widespread parasitic zoonosis that affects humans through accidental ingestion of infected dog feces. The disease is common in areas with close contact between intermediate and definitive hosts, usually sheep and dogs. CE presents with symptoms associated with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other viscera, and diagnosis is established by radiology and serology. The disease is a significant public health concern, particularly in regions with poor sanitation and hygiene.

2. One of the challenges in treating CE is the risk of postsurgical relapses or treatment failure due to nonradical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material. Relapses in the form of newly developing cysts have been reported, affecting between 2 and 25% of cases after therapy. Therefore, postsurgical follow-up of CE patients for years is necessary to detect newly growing cysts as soon as possible. A posttreatment follow-up method should include markers that allow the detection of newly growing or relapsing cysts and tracking of previously undetected but still viable cysts.

3. Serology has been one of the methods selected for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies after recovery makes it difficult to diagnose relapse by serology. Many serologic techniques have been evaluated, including latex agglutination, passive hemagglutination, immunoelectrophoresis, and specific IgE, IgM, and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, there is still a need to develop or improve immunodiagnostic tools to meet the requirements expressed by clinicians. One approach consists of searching for and identifying new antigens that specifically allow the classification of patients into cured and non-cured categories.

4. This study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of CE, revealed by immunoblotting analysis. The study also reported on the post-operative evolution of patients treated for this disease and determined the diagnostic performance of Western blot. Blood samples were obtained from 50 patients with clinically/radiologically diagnosed CE, 40 non-CE patients with different parasitic infections and malignancy, and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The sera were divided into three tubes for each subject and stored immediately at -70°C until analysis.

3. Recent studies have drawn attention to new obesity indices, including waist-to-height ratio (WHTR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and body adiposity index (BAI), which also take into account adipose tissue distribution.
4. A study was conducted to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
5. The study included 66 consecutively enrolled obese non-diabetic patients with a mean age of 55.8 years, including 40 women and 26 men.
6. The study found that patients with class III obesity had lower mean serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to patients from the other two groups.
7. Negative significant correlations were found between BMI and TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C, as well as between WC, WHR, and VAI and HDL-C.
8. Positive significant correlations were found between WC, WHR, and triglycerides (TG)/HDL-C, as well as between VAI and TC, TG, TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C.
9. The study suggests that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C.

3. The study used the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the Duke Health Profile to assess internet addiction and health status, respectively.
4. The results showed that 74.5% of the students were moderate users, 24.8% were possible addicts, and 0.7% were addicts, with males being more likely to be addicted.
5. Addicts were found to have poor mental, physical, and mental health scores, as well as high anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression scores.
6. The study also found that addicts were more likely to use the internet in the evening and nights, and that about half of the adolescents with addiction were also working part-time.
7. The findings of the study corroborate with previous studies stating that internet addiction is more common in males than in females and that it is associated with poor mental health.

1. The frequency response of the resonators was measured using a downmixing method, described in detail in the source document. This method involved electrostatically actuating the device and applying a driving voltage to a side-gate parallel to the resonator.

2. To reduce parasitic signals, the drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency, making the amplitude of motion of the resonator proportional to the square of the actuation voltage. A bias voltage was used to down-mix the resistance change occurring at the actuation frequency.

3. The measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same setup, with the drive electrode disconnected.

4. The Allan deviation was measured in an open-loop configuration, and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency. The phase of the measured signal was monitored for a certain amount of time and then transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.

5. Close to the resonance frequency, the phase response was linear, f2qf0. Using the complete phase response of the resonator instead of this linearization did not significantly alter the Allan deviation.

6. Harmonics appearing at the frequency of the electricity supply (multiples of 50 Hz) were filtered out of data during post-processing. Using this method, n samples of the resonance frequency of the resonator were obtained, each averaged over an integration time, 0.

7. The Allan deviation for this integration time was defined as (2)a(0)=12(n1)1n1(fi+1fif0)2. To obtain the frequency stability for higher integration times from the same set of frequency samples, the standard method was followed.

8. Initial samples were averaged in groups of n samples, and the Allan deviation for the new array was calculated using equation (2) to determine a(n0). This process was repeated multiple times until the number of samples was too low to provide a statistically significant result.

1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 29.4% of total deaths in 2010, and costing over $312.6 billion in healthcare spending and lost productivity. Aspirin therapy is a prevention measure that can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.

2. The American Heart Association recommends the use of low-dose aspirin daily for people at high risk of a heart attack and regular use of low-dose aspirin for heart attack survivors. However, many studies have failed to ascertain whether a person was recommended to take aspirin by their physician or whether they were taking it on their own initiative.

3. The current study aimed to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention in a nationally representative sample. The study analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012.

4. The study found that among the total sample eligible for aspirin as primary prevention, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin. Over three-fourths of primary-prevention patients were classified as low risk, and less than half of the primary-prevention patients who had a high CVD risk level received a recommendation to take aspirin.

5. The study also found that the vast majority of patients who were told to take aspirin by their physicians complied with the recommendation, with 77.4% of the total sample, 79.0% of high-risk patients, and 76.5% of low-risk patients reporting taking aspirin. However, the results indicate that recommendations for aspirin for CVD prevention do not match up to the objectively computed future risk.

6. The study suggests that decisions for treatment recommendations seem to be being made on criteria other than objectively calculated future CVD risk, and that access to care and receipt of recommendations for aspirin use may be influenced by factors such as insurance status and education level. The study highlights the need for improved clinical decision support and better understanding of physician prescribing practices and patient usage of aspirin.

7. The study found that lack of health insurance can be a significant barrier to accessing health care, especially for preventive services, and that access to care may play a role in recommendations for the advice of aspirin for CVD prevention.

1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which is essential for cellular signaling and differentiation. The resulting superoxide anion is converted to hydrogen peroxide by cellular superoxide dismutases, leading to the formation of sulphenic acid and disulfide bonds in proteins.

2. Oxidation of protein cysteine residues represents a form of reversible, posttranslational protein modification that can regulate signaling, similar to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation. The cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms.

3. Mitochondrial ROS generation is required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs.

4. Cellular mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity are increased when stem cells are induced to differentiate, and increased ROS levels and oxidation products correlate with the differentiation of various stem cell populations. Hematopoietic stem cells contain significantly lower levels of ROS than more-differentiated common myeloid progenitor cells.

5. The epidermis is a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium regulated by stem cell populations, and its homeostasis is maintained by the differentiation of cells in the proliferative basal layer. The epidermis also elaborates appendages such as hair follicles, which are regulated by stem cell populations.

6. Conditional deletion of TFAM in basal, undifferentiated epidermal keratinocytes resulted in impaired differentiation and an epidermal barrier defect, leading to perinatal mortality in mice. Treatment with exogenously applied H2O2 partly restored differentiation marker expression in TFAM-deficient cells.

7. Mitochondrial ROS generation is required for the activation of the Notch and -catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth, respectively. Nucleoredoxin (NXN) is a putative target of ROS-mediated Wnt-/-catenin signaling and becomes oxidized when wild-type keratinocytes are treated with the -catenin activator Wnt-3a.

1. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, and its study has progressed mainly in the field of functional analysis and therapeutic implications. Due to low viral levels in the serum, diagnosis of HCV infection has been made using branched chain DNA signal amplification assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, simple and reliable histochemical techniques are needed for detecting viral pathogens within routinely prepared biopsy tissue samples.

2. Reports have described the detection of HCV in human liver tissue using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH), as well as by in situ RT-PCR. However, HCV detection with immunohistochemistry and ISH is not yet reproducible enough, and reliable histochemical techniques for detecting HCV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues are needed. In the present study, an ISH technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAI) was established for detecting HCV-RNA in FFPE tissue sections of the liver.

3. The study used humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice and FFPE tissue sections of chronic hepatitis C patients to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the ISH technique. The results showed that the LNA-based ISH detected signals in 9 (82%) of 11 chronic hepatitis C lesions, including three showing diffuse cytoplasmic positivity, and six showing focal or partial positivity. No HCV-RNA was detected in HBV-related lesions, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, and in HCC lesions.

The positive signals remained after DNase treatment but were completely abolished after RNase treatment.

1. The effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on wild animals and humans have raised concerns, with many chemicals shown to alter the thyroid system in vertebrates. The disruption of the thyroid axis is an important consideration for the regulation of chemicals. The OECD and EPA have established guidelines for investigating thyroid toxicity.

2. Amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to contaminants in wastewater due to their thin, permeable skin and aquatic environment. They are exposed to toxicants through both dermal and dietary routes, making them a good model for studying thyroid disruption. The dramatic structural and functional changes during metamorphosis can be readily applied as parameters reflecting endocrine disruption.

3. The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted to a more biologically active form, 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3), mainly in the peripheral target tissues. Transport of thyroid hormones in the blood is accomplished through binding to transport proteins, predominantly transthyretin (TTR). Conjugation and degradation processes occur in the liver and subsequent secretion in bile.

4. Several processes influence the thyroid hormone balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation. Inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake and suppression of thyroidal peroxidase activity can disrupt T4 synthesis and secretion. Inhibition of 5-deiodinase in the peripheral tissue reduces the conversion from T4 to T3.

5. Chemical compounds can interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism by inhibiting sulfation, glucuronidation, or deiodination. Competitive binding to thyroid transport proteins reduces the levels of total and free thyroid hormones in serum. The T3:T4 sulfating activity ratio varies during developmental stages in frog tadpoles.

6. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as halogenated phenol and phenolic compounds, can inhibit sulfation and disrupt thyroid hormone metabolism. Glucuronidation has been poorly studied in amphibians, but a subset of responsible enzymes, glucuronidases (UGTs), can reduce circulating levels of thyroid hormones. Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 2B1 is induced by pentobarbital in adults of the semiaquatic frog, Rana pipiens.

1. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 10-15% rate of cesarean section (CS) to minimize maternal and neonatal mortality rates, but many countries have higher rates of CS. The rate of CS in Iran has increased six-fold over the past three decades.

2. The debate on the best practices for minimizing postnatal morbidity between vaginal delivery (VD) and CS is ongoing, with some studies showing that VD leads to better health outcomes. However, other studies have found conflicting results, with some showing no significant differences between the two modes of delivery.

3. A prospective study was conducted in Iran to explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health-related quality of life (QOL). The study included 342 women who underwent VD or CS, with 150 women in each group completing QOL questionnaires at 2 and 4 months after delivery.

4. The study used the Iranian version of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) to measure QOL, which consists of 36 items organized into eight scales. The scores on each subscale range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health.

6. Women who underwent VD also had higher total mental health scores at 4 months after delivery compared to those who underwent CS, with significant differences found for the social functioning and emotional well-being subscales. However, the differences were not significant at 2 months after delivery.

The most prominent regioisomer, 14,15-EET, arises via metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450. However, its therapeutic utility is complicated by factors such as aerial oxidation and enzymatic processes.

Researchers have developed EET surrogates with improved stability, which were evaluated for their ability to relax precontracted bovine coronary artery rings and inhibit soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH). The surrogates modified the free carboxylic acid of the previous generation of 14,15-EET mimics while retaining key structural features. The results showed that conjugating the carboxylate with a short poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) unit improved vasorelaxation and EC50 values.

1. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, and the American Osteopathic Association developed the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) to improve healthcare in the United States. The PCMH model aims to provide quality, coordinated, and cost-effective care to patients and increase access to services. It also aims to increase practice efficiency and provider and patient satisfaction.

2. The transition to a PCMH requires significant changes in office culture, including promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records (EMRs). Many physicians resist the change due to a lack of PCMH training, misaligned financial incentives, underreimbursement, and time-consuming procedures. The PCMH model recommends that practice staff and providers take time to analyze patients' needs as a whole.

3. Team-based care is a key component of the PCMH model, which requires staff to address patient treatment decisions collectively. This includes previsit meetings to allocate resources, ensure adequate health maintenance, and address chronic care management. The use of previsit huddles has resulted in improved decision-making and care for patients, as well as increased patient satisfaction.

4. The PCMH model also requires practices to improve care coordination and document patient engagement in self-management. This has prompted many PCMHs to create a care manager or care coordinator position to perform tasks such as patient follow-ups and patient education. The care coordinator position has been successful in improving patient outcomes and increasing patient satisfaction.

5. The size of the primary care practice can be an obstacle in implementing the PCMH model, particularly for smaller practices with limited resources. These practices may have difficulty making the changes necessary to become a PCMH and may need to find ways around their limited resources. The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) can help improve patient care and reduce costs, but implementing an EMR can be challenging, especially for smaller practices.

The studies compared the therapeutic effect of hypothermia versus normothermia in patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated.

2. The pooled results showed that mild hypothermia did not improve survival rate and neurological function at hospital discharge, but it did improve the prognosis of patients after 6 months. The possible reasons for this discrepancy include the potential side effects of whole-body hypothermia and the influence of combination therapy with other drugs.

3. The meta-analysis also found that mild hypothermia did not influence the incidence of adverse events, such as re-arrest, renal failure, and pulmonary edema, compared to the control group. However, the study suffered from several limitations, including inadequate trial numbers and study sizes, which may have led to inaccurate results.

1. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with localized prostate cancer, offering excellent tumor control, good functional results, and low morbidity. However, the major long-term morbidity from this procedure is erectile dysfunction, despite advances in surgical techniques. Prior to studies done by Walsh and Donker, the cause of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy was not well understood.

2. Walsh and Donker proposed and demonstrated that erectile dysfunction occurred secondary to the injury of cavernosal nerves, which are mainly concentrated laterally to the prostate and referred to as neurovascular bundles. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, with studies reporting a 16 to 76% recovery of erectile function in men whose bilateral neurovascular bundles were preserved. The variability in potency rates can be attributed to the fact that there was no definite and exact anatomy of periprostatic nerve fibers.

3. A recent study aimed to describe periprostatic nerve distribution and construct a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution using adult male human cadavers. The study involved removing the prostate, seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum en bloc and slicing the specimens into 5mm step sections. Immunostaining with anti-S-100 antibody neural stain was performed to delineate the precise location of neural tissue.

4. The study found that the number of nerve fibers in the ventral part of the prostate was significantly lower compared to the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts. The average number of nerve fibers in the ventral part was 3.75±1.38, while the average number in the dorsal part was 28.50±2.17. The number of nerve fibers in the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts showed no significant difference.

The study also found that the average distance from the prostatic capsule to nerve fibers was almost the same in all four parts, with no significant difference among the base, mid-part, and apex levels. The average thickness of nerve fibers in the ventral part was significantly decreased compared to the other parts. The three-dimensional model of periprostatic nerve fibers revealed an almost even distribution and nearly similar thickness of periprostatic nerve fibers on dorsal and both lateral parts.

1. The study aimed to assess the concentration of serum amyloid A (SAA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with different disease activity and its association with clinical and laboratory variables. The study found that SAA levels were significantly higher in patients with high disease activity and those currently treated with glucocorticoids. SAA levels were also inversely associated with the corrected QT (QTc) duration.

2. The study demonstrated a strong correlation between SAA levels and RA activity, as well as its association with cardiovascular (CV) and renal involvement in RA patients. SAA levels were significantly higher in patients with atherosclerotic plaques and increased cystatin C (cys-c) serum concentration, indicating a risk of CV and renal complications. The study also found that SAA levels were inversely correlated with QTc duration.

3. The study's findings suggest that SAA could be considered a biomarker associated with both the current inflammatory disease activity and chronic complications in RA patients. High SAA levels were observed in patients with normal or low disease activity, indicating sustained inflammation despite clinical improvement. The study's results highlight the importance of prospectively assessing SAA levels to identify RA patients with persistent inflammation and increased risk of extra-articular complications and amyloidosis development.

1. Glucocorticoids have been extensively characterized as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents in therapeutic settings, but they also play coadjuvant roles in promoting inflammation and may promote Th2-type immunity through differential effects on Th1 and Th2 cytokine production. In a physiological context, glucocorticoids are involved in the development of inflammation and the limitation of production or maturation of some effector immune cell types. There is a well-established association between stress and allergic diseases, including asthma.

2. Glucocorticoids, which are an essential part of systemic stress responses, play a role in promoting inflammation and may promote Th2-type immunity through differential effects on Th1 and Th2 cytokine production. Chronically stimulated eosinophil production (eosinopoiesis) is an important feature of human asthma and of murine allergic asthma models. In both cases, allergen challenge of sensitized subjects increases eosinopoiesis in the bone marrow.

3. The effects of oral tolerization in bone marrow neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes can be duplicated by transfer of splenic T lymphocyte subpopulations from tolerized/sensitized/challenged donors to histocompatible naive recipients. These observations highlight the importance of acquired cellular immunity in regulating the hematological response to allergen sensitization and challenge. They further suggest the possibility that granulopoiesis, encompassing both eosinophil and neutrophil production, might be regulated by lymphocyte populations in nonsensitized subjects as well.

4. In an allergic asthma model, we demonstrated a critical role for endogenous glucocorticoids in the hematological response to allergen challenge: challenge induces a corticosterone surge that is paralleled by increased eosinophilia of bone marrow in vivo and by increased responsiveness to IL-5, the major eosinopoietic cytokine, ex vivo. The bone marrow response to challenge is abolished by blockade of glucocorticoid signaling or glucocorticoid production. On the other hand, in the absence of allergen sensitization and challenge, we have also obtained evidence of a link between the corticosterone surge induced by mild surgical trauma and short-term bone marrow eosinophilia.

1. Over the past decade, various cell types have been evaluated for cardiac regeneration, including embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, skeletal myoblasts, and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells and resident cardiac stem cells have also been considered as potential sources for cardiac regeneration. These cell types have shown promise in preclinical studies, but their clinical application is still in its infancy.

2. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been extensively studied for their potential in cardiac regeneration. They can be obtained from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation blastocyst and expanded in vitro almost indefinitely without loss of pluripotency. When allowed to differentiate as embryoid bodies, ESCs give rise to most somatic lineages, including cardiovascular lineages.

3. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from adult somatic cells by overexpression of transcription factors critical for maintenance of ESC pluripotency. iPSCs have shown promise in differentiating into functional cardiovascular lineages and contributing to normal cardiovascular development. They may provide an unlimited supply of autologous donor cells for cardiac regeneration.

4. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be separated from bone marrow and adipose tissues based on their adherence to a culture dish. They can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, but can also be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes under special conditions. MSCs may be less immunogenic than other cell populations, allowing for allogenic transplantation.

5. Skeletal myoblasts, also known as satellite cells, can be harvested from muscle biopsies and expanded in culture. They are less prone to teratoma formation and more resistant to ongoing ischemia, but true cardiomyocyte differentiation has not been observed in vivo. Despite this, skeletal myoblasts may be incorporated into an infarct site and contribute to cardiac function.

6. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, including hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, can be mobilized with cytokine therapy or harvested by standard collection techniques. They can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, and supply a broad range of paracrine factors with proangiogenic, positive remodeling, and antiapoptotic properties. Intracoronary infusion of these cells has shown improved ventricular function in clinical trials.

1. Polyhalite is a mineral with the chemical formula K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4·2H2O, commonly found in sedimentary evaporite successions and rare volcanic successions. It was first described in 1818 by German chemist Friedrich Stromeyer from the Salt Mine Bad Ischl-Perneck in Austria. Polyhalite is associated with other minerals such as halite, anhydrite, glauberite, and carnallite.

2. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria in 1970 and later confirmed in 2005. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C and reaches a maximum of 343°C.

3. The substitution of divalent cations with other elements such as Zn, Cu, Ni significantly changes the dehydration reactions of polyhalite to higher or lower temperatures. Further chemical data on the conditions of formation and stability of polyhalite were presented by various authors, including Krupp in 2005 and Wollmann et al. in 2008. Polyhalite commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite.

4. The formation of polyhalite in marginal marine shallow water sedimentary environments is only suspected, and all Alpine polyhalites are of secondary origin. Polyhalite is stable between room temperature and 255-343°C, and within nearly the whole temperature range, the Haselgebirge sulphates have experienced temperatures between 200-300°C. Polyhalite contains potassium in stoichiometric amounts, making it interesting for absolute age dating.

The mine is around 600 meters wide and has a maximum height of 1350 meters above sea level.

2. Propofol, a widely used anesthetic, has been shown to have antioxidant effects in vitro and in vivo, and it is chemically similar to the endogenous antioxidant vitamin E.
3. The study aimed to investigate the effects of propofol on lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant indices in rodents.
4. The results showed that administration of propofol did not significantly affect the levels of serum and renal and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating that propofol may not be linked to the generation of free radicals.
5. However, propofol significantly increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol, and decreased the levels of serum HDL-cholesterol in the rats.
6. The increased cholesterol level during propofol administration may be linked to an increase in alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coa reductase activity, which is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
7. Propofol also increased the levels of hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, indicating an enhancement of the detoxifying potential of the liver.

1. The dynamic folding of the genome into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs) is fundamental in regulating gene expression and DNA replication. This hierarchical structure is essential for proper genome organization and is associated with multiple diseases and cancer.

2. TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions, and are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions. The replication timing, histone modifications, and gene expression inside a TAD are highly correlated.

3. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, contributes to TAD boundary strength and regulates nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions. BRG1 knockdown results in reduced nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions and a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions.

4. The orderly positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes at TAD boundaries may be achieved by enriched CTCF binding, which positions 20 nucleosomes around its binding sites. BRG1 loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and preclude the binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries, leading to reduced boundary strength.

5. The interplay between BRG1, CTCF, and topoisomerases in the organization of TADs is essential for proper genome organization. Topoisomerases, such as topoisomerase II beta, facilitate supercoiling at CTCF sites in a transcription-dependent manner.

6. The association between BRG1 knockdown and reduction in TAD boundary strength may be due to perturbations in the recruitment of CTCF and topoisomerases, affecting the integrity of the chromatin structure and its stiffness at TAD boundaries. Other chromatin remodeling complexes may play similar roles in regulating TAD formation and function.

7. The biophysical properties of TADs and their boundaries, as well as chromatin folding and overall genome organization, are essential for biological control. Continued examination of the factors found at TAD boundaries will yield important insights into these processes.

8. The study of TADs and their boundaries has implications for understanding the mechanisms of genome organization and its dysregulation in diseases, including cancer. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex structure that regulates TAD formation and function.

1. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO). The imaging relies on three characteristics of SPIO: their superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated. MPI can visualize and quantify the spatial distribution of SPIO, providing high temporal and spatial resolution combined with high signal-to-noise ratios. This method has potential applications in cardiovascular imaging and guidance of cardiovascular interventions.

2. The study aimed to evaluate the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and compare it with the blood half-life in MRI. The researchers used two different versions of Resovist, a commercial SPIO agent, sourced from Bayer Pharma AG and Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. The results showed that the MPI signal declined rapidly, with the average signal strength decreasing to 30% of the baseline signal 5 minutes after injection. The signal decay was significantly different between the two types of Resovist, with Resovist from Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd showing a faster decline.

The researchers found that the blood half-life of the MPI tracer cannot be equalized to the blood half-life of the MRI signal. The difference in blood half-life between Resovist sourced from Bayer Pharma AG and Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd was significant, but not as high as to indicate a change of application. The study suggests that the mechanism of clustering of Resovist particles may be responsible for the difference in blood half-life, and that Resovist may be suitable only as a bolus tracer for vascular applications.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

The researchers used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate the transcriptional response of infected and uninfected cells. They isolated liver macrophages from infected mice and analyzed their gene expression profiles using microarray analysis.

2. The study revealed significant quantitative and qualitative differences in transcriptomic responses compared to previous in vitro gene expression studies. The researchers found that uninfected liver macrophages also underwent significant biological and gene transcriptional changes associated with the inoculation of live Leishmania amastigotes. This activation showed both qualitative and quantitative differences between infected and inflamed liver macrophages.

3. The researchers identified and validated the importance of a gene network centered around retinoid X receptor (RXRA) that is associated with the survival of amastigotes within the liver of Leishmania-infected mice. They found that this network regulates lipid metabolism and is essential for parasite survival. The researchers also showed that perturbation of RXRA in either direction via activation or suppression had similar effects on the growth of Leishmania in vivo.

4. The study demonstrated that manipulation of the RXRA pathway in vivo can impact parasite survival, reducing parasite load at early stages after liver infection. The researchers used pharmacological intervention to target the RXRA pathway and showed that this approach can be used to discover important host response pathways that would be invisible in studies of the interaction between macrophages and pathogens in vitro. This approach has the potential to be used for the development of new therapeutic strategies for Leishmaniasis.

1. The control of appetite is a complex process involving the coordination of inputs from physiological and environmental sources, and early theoretical approaches were based on the idea that the control mechanism was dedicated exclusively to signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue.

2. More recent central nervous system models have emphasized inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, along with input from sensory features of food, and the major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin and insulin from specialized cells in the GI tract.

3. The major task facing any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat, together with the intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signalling and tonic inhibition, and a new formulation has been proposed to explain how aspects of body composition and energy expenditure regulate hunger and appetite.

4. The formulation is based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects and suggests that the physiological drive for food arises from the energy used to maintain physiological and metabolic functioning of the body, mainly from fat-free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic rate (RMR).

5. The drive to eat is under tonic inhibition from leptin, whose action reflects the amount of stored energy reserves in the body, and episodic signals in the form of peptides released from the GI tract in response to food consumption periodically interrupt and suppress the drive to eat.

6. Prolonged exercise displays a dual-process action by stimulating hunger and increasing post-prandial satiety signalling through an effect on GI peptides, and RMR is also strongly correlated with objectively measured self-determined energy intake.

7. The proposal that FFM and RMR contribute to a physiological demand for energy that influences appetite is plausible and has implications for the research and management of obesity, as it suggests that individuals with a high FFM should have a stronger tendency to consume larger meals.

8. The formulation can help to promote research to clarify the relative strength of biological and environmental variables that contribute to energy intake and changes in body weight, and it can also influence energy balance by adapting to progressive changes that occur in body composition over time.

1. The study aimed to determine whether bacteria inhabiting freshwater reservoirs in glacier forefield areas have the potential to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). The researchers collected samples from five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream near the Polish Antarctic Station Arctowski. The samples were analyzed for the presence of PHA synthase genes, which are responsible for PHA production. The study found that many microorganisms in the samples possessed genes responsible for PHA synthesis.

2. The researchers used PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to amplify the 16S rRNA gene and PHA synthase genes from the DNA of the isolated bacteria. They then sequenced the amplified genes to determine their genetic identity. The results showed that the isolated bacteria belonged to various genera, including Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, and Burkholderia. The study also found that some bacteria had genes responsible for both short-chain-length (SCL) and medium-chain-length (MCL) PHA synthesis.

3. The researchers conducted a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to examine the relationship between the presence of bacteria possessing specific PHA synthase genes and environmental conditions. The results showed that bacteria having genetic potential to synthesize SCL-PHAs inhabited reservoirs with rather low trophy, characterized by low levels of total phosphorus and high amounts of pheophytin. The study also found that bacteria having genes responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis were isolated from both mats and water. The results suggest that PHA accumulation could increase the survival capabilities of microorganisms in extreme environments.

4. The study found that some bacteria had obtained PHA synthesis genes through horizontal gene transfer, rather than gradual evolution. The researchers observed that the genes responsible for SCL-PHA synthesis differed significantly from those responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis. The study also found that some bacteria had obtained PHA synthesis genes from other bacteria, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens. The results suggest that horizontal gene transfer plays a significant role in the evolution of PHA synthesis genes in bacteria.

Establishing vegetation is the most uncertain category among these operations. Vegetation establishment is crucial for reducing erosion, improving public perception, and allowing for productive reuse of the land. It also reintegrates disturbed lands into the existing landscape.

2. Vegetation establishment is important for reducing erosion from both wind and water, improving public perception, and allowing for productive reuse of the land. It also reintegrates disturbed lands into the existing landscape. The uncertainty in vegetation establishment comes primarily from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment. Irrigation is expensive and generally not more successful than natural rainfall.

Non-natives were previously preferred for their ability to establish in years with limited rainfall, but natives are now more recommended due to their known long-term stability and resource value for wildlife. Natives are also more acceptable due to better public acceptance. A mixed plant community is needed to maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation.

4. A mixed plant community should contain the same ratio of functional groups as a natural community in the same area. This increases the resiliency of the plant community to disturbance. Perennial grasses are often the primary contributors to surface stability and erosion prevention. They have an extensive, low-to-the-ground life form with spreading, fibrous roots near the soil surface.

5. The establishment success of native perennial warm-season grasses depends on the seminal root staying ahead of the soil drying front. The seminal root supports the seedling until the adventitious roots begin to grow. The adventitious roots can be suppressed by dry conditions, making soil moisture the primary controlling factor for seedling mortality. The drying front is defined as the wilting point for a loamy sand.

6. The rate of root elongation is crucial for seedling survival, and the elongation rate of the seminal root and adventitious root initiation are important factors for survival. The variability of root elongation rates and the lack of studies on the non-genetic causes of rate differences make it difficult to know how they would change the outcome of the analysis. Soil moisture is the primary driver of seedling survivorship in a climate change scenario. Warming and CO2 increases only affect survivorship indirectly through changing soil moisture.

1. Major depression (MD) is the main cause of disability and the fourth-leading contributor to the global burden of disease, projected to reach second place in the ranking of disability-adjusted life years by 2020. Trials of available antidepressant medications alone or combined with psychotherapies are effective for 60-80% of those affected with MD. Conversely, up to 40% of patients with MD do not show satisfactory improvement due to multiple biopsychosocial factors. At its worst, MD can lead to suicide, and as a consequence, about 850,000 lives are lost every year.

2. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) evades universal definition, but a poor response to two adequate trials of two different classes of antidepressants has been proposed as its operational characterization. Researchers have categorized TRD into stages based on antidepressant trials, including stage 0, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, stage 4, and stage 5. These staging methods help researchers and clinicians understand TRD patients and plan interventions for enhancing the response, remission rate, and quality of life. However, TRD continues to challenge mental health care providers despite the understanding of psychosocial and biological markers and psychopharmacology of mood disorders.

3. Neuromodulation therapies (NTs) are being increasingly utilized in the management of patients with TRD, as they target specific brain circuits that are important in the pathogenesis of MD. NTs are designed to target specific brain regions, are not systemic, and have a limited side-effect profile compared to medications. Evidence-based data has been emerging continuously about FDA-approved and yet-to-be-approved NTs in the TRD population over the past decade. Multiple computer searches were conducted using various databases for the years 2000-2012.

4. Researchers have categorized NTs into four categories: seizure therapies, noninvasive therapies, neurosurgical approaches, and new approaches on the horizon. Seizure therapies include modified electroconvulsive therapy (mECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST), while noninvasive therapies include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and cranial electric stimulation (CES). Neurosurgical approaches include vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), epidural cortical stimulation (ECS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). New approaches on the horizon include focused ultrasound (FUS), near-infrared light therapy (NIR), low-field",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 36}"

1. Small RNA molecules play a crucial role in regulating various molecular and biological activities in cells, and RNA interference (RNAi) is an important gene regulatory mechanism that causes sequence-specific downregulation of mRNAs. RNAi acts through the RNA-induced silencing complex, which mediates degradation or translational inhibition of targeted mRNAs.

2. In addition to RNAi, small RNA molecules can also modulate gene transcription itself, and in fission yeast, homologs of the RNA-induced silencing complex can regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNA. This mechanism is also seen in plants, ciliates, nematodes, and flies.

3. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing. In human cells, short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon known as RNA activation (RNAa).

4. RNAa has been shown to be conserved in other mammalian species, including mouse, rat, and nonhuman primates, and promoter-targeted small hairpin RNAs have been shown to efficiently upregulate genes in vivo. The mechanism of RNAa is not completely understood, but it appears that naturally occurring antisense transcripts arising from or near the same genetic locus are able to direct recruitment of Argonaute proteins and histone methyltransferases.

5. Short-activating RNAs (SARNAs) may regulate transcription by targeting these antisense transcripts for degradation, resulting in a reversal of epigenetic silencing and upregulation of sense mRNA. Based on this approach, a method to design SARNAs for upregulation of specific cellular genes has been developed.

6. The study focused on the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating important target genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming. Combined expression of the transcription factors Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), Pou5f1 (also called OCT3/4), Sox2, and c-Myc has been shown to reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.

1. Chronic kidney diseases, which lead to end-stage kidney failure, are associated with changes in kidney structure and fibrosis regardless of the underlying cause. Urinary tract obstruction is characterized by tubular atrophy or dilation, tubular cell death by apoptosis and necrosis, interstitial leukocyte infiltration, and increased interstitial matrix deposition. Such an obstruction might be observed after benign prostatic hyperplasia, renal, ureteral, or bladder calculi, urethral stricture, and neoplasm of the bladder, prostate, or urethra.

2. The hydrostatic pressure, which is the result of the blockage, initiates renal injuries. The injuries are characterized by tubular dilatation or atrophy, inflammatory infiltration of leucocytes, fibroblast activation, proliferation, increase in matrix proteins, and progressive interstitial fibrosis with the loss of renal parenchyma. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UOO) is an experimental rat model of renal injury that imitates the process of obstructive nephropathy in an accelerated manner.

3. Taurine, an organic acid and a major component of the bile, has been shown to have beneficial effects on the renal fibrosis that occurs after cisplatin-induced injuries, diabetic nephropathy, and age-related renal changes. Taurine plays an important role in some biochemical and physiological processes in the kidney, including ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, renal vascular endothelial function, and antioxidant properties. It also functions as an osmolyte during the stress response.

4. Paclitaxel, a plant alkaloid derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, works by disrupting the microtubular network essential for cell division and other normal cellular functions, which eventually leads to cell death. Paclitaxel has been reported to have positive effects in cisplatin-induced and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. It can also attenuate oxidative/nitrosative stress, glutathione depletion, enhanced urinary hydrogen peroxide excretion, and the decrease in antioxidant enzymes.

5. The present study aimed to determine whether taurine and taxol can attenuate the tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preserve the normal renal histology in a rat model of UOO.

1. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger innate immune responses after sensing microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoprotein, flagellin, and nucleic acids. PRRs are necessary for the protection of a host suffering from microbial infection. After detecting microbial components, PRRs drive the coordinated activation of transcription factors, leading to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, type I interferons (IFNs), and antimicrobial genes. Although innate immunity is essential for host defense, aberrant activation of innate immune responses results in the development of inflammatory diseases.

2. Protein degradation is critically involved in the control of innate immune responses. The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy are two clearance systems that regulate protein degradation. Autophagy is a bulk degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents into lysosomes, enabling the reuse of intracellular constituents and supplying an amino acid pool during periods of starvation. Autophagy is essential for survival during neonatal starvation and is involved in the clearance of old/damaged organelles, long-lived proteins, and lipid droplets.

3. The autophagic machinery is composed of essential components, including autophagy-related proteins (ATGs). Recent studies have identified mammalian counterparts of yeast ATGs, such as ULK1 (ATG1), ATG35, BECLIN (ATG6), ATG7, LC3 (ATG8), ATG9A, ATG10, ATG12, ATG13L, ATG14L, ATG16L1, FIP200 (ATG17), and WIP1 (ATG18). These ATGs are phylogenetically highly conserved between yeast and mammals. The coordinated action of ATGs mediates the membrane trafficking required for autophagosome formation.

4. Autophagy is induced after sensing various types of stress, such as nutrient starvation, the accumulation of protein aggregates, and invasion by microbes. This system enables the reuse of cellular components and the clearance of unfavorable substances, thus contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the prevention of disease. Autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes to become autolysosomes, leading to the degradation of the constituents trapped inside. Autophagy plays a critical role in host defense responses by promoting the elimination of pathogens and the induction of acquired immunity.

2. The introduction of tobacco to betel quid by European settlers four centuries ago led to the development of a health hazard, and the causal association between chewing of betel quid with tobacco and oral cancer was well established in the second half of the 20th century.
3. Betel nut chewing was found to be responsible for oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), an established precancerous condition, and the frequency of OSMF increased among young people due to the increasing use of gutkha.
4. A retrospective study of 63 oral cancer patients found a direct relation between oral cancer and the duration of betel quid, gutkha, and panmasala chewing, and most patients had betel quid and gutkha panmasala chewing as the etiology of their cancer.
5. Betel nut is a synergistic carcinogen with tobacco, and its chewing has been linked to various cancers, including oral and pharyngeal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cancers of the larynx, stomach, lung, and cervix.
6. There is sufficient evidence that chewing of betel nut with or without tobacco and lime are carcinogenic in humans, and a permanent ban on gutkha and panmasala is necessary to eradicate the menace of oral cancer in India.

1. The concept of patient blood management is gaining attention due to the risks associated with allogeneic red blood cell transfusions, including increased morbidity and mortality, severe postoperative infections, and adverse effects. In cardiac surgery, patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass are at risk of postoperative bleeding, and excessive bleeding may be caused by surgical factors and impaired haemostasis. Studies have reported a higher long-term mortality after blood transfusion in cardiac surgery patients.

2. The use of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, in cardiac surgery patients carries both benefits and risks, including reduced ischemic events but increased perioperative bleeding and transfusion requirements. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that red blood cell transfusions be based on the patient's risk of developing complications of inadequate oxygenation. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion policy has proven effective and possibly superior to a more liberal transfusion strategy, and institutions should evaluate their approach to transfusion and consider individual haemoglobin/haematocrit triggers.

1. The process of neural regeneration requires the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neurogenic stem cells into neurons, and recent studies have shown that neuronal regeneration occurs even after birth in specific tissues like the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium.

2. The olfactory epithelium has the unique ability to renew olfactory receptor neurons throughout adult life, and it contains a heterogeneous population of epithelial cells, including support cells, nerve receptor cells, and progenitor cells.

3. Recent studies have identified stem-like characteristics in a group of cells called globose basal cells (GBCs) residing in the basal compartment of the olfactory epithelium, which are small, round, and morphologically non-descript cells.

4. The GBCs are capable of proliferating at a high rate in the normal olfactory epithelium, are limited to the olfactory epithelium, and are poorly characterized at the level of their molecular phenotype.

5. Further studies have shown that the olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with possible neuropotency, including GBCs and horizontal basal cells (HBCs), which are morphologically distinct cell types.

6. Researchers have proposed the most likely lineage of the cells in the olfactory epithelium using specific markers, determination of various transcription factor expressions, and incorporation of analytical studies using H-thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine.

7. The GBCs have been isolated and characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunostaining with various neural progenitor cell markers, including anti-NCAM, anti-Nestin, and anti-Sox2.

8. The isolated GBCs have been found to be non-excitable, with no voltage-gated sodium channels and only leaky potassium channels, and they have been shown to express neural progenitor cell markers, confirming their neuro-transformation capability.

9. This research work has provided new insights into the nature and behavior of GBCs, which are believed to be the colony of neural stem cells residing in the basal compartment of the olfactory epithelium responsible for ongoing neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium throughout adult life.

1. The central nervous system (CNS) was previously considered a site of immune privilege, but recent findings suggest that it is more constitutively active than previously envisioned. Microglia, a type of immune cell in the CNS, play a pivotal role in innate immunity and are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. These progenitors express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and develop into CD45+ C-KIT+ CX3CR1+ immature cells, which mature into microglia. Microglia are involved in immune surveillance, phagocytosis, and synaptic refinement, and are maintained through cellular division or expansion of progenitors that colonized the brain during CNS development.

2. Microglia are multifunctional cells that protect the postnatal brain from infection and respond to pathogens by phagocytosing pathogens, secreting proinflammatory cytokines, and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). They also play a role in angiogenesis through the synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are involved in synaptic refinement by recognizing apoptotic cells and phagocytosing them. Microglia express voltage-sensitive ion channels, including Nav1.1, Kv1.3, and Kv1.5, and are thought to sense electrical activity related to cortical spreading depression (CSD). Microglia also express the high-affinity receptor for C3, which is required for the precise execution of synaptic pruning.

3. CSD is a wave of rapid, near-complete depolarization of neurons and astrocytes, followed by a period of electrical suppression, and is accompanied by secondary changes in cerebral blood flow. Microglia are activated in response to CSD, and their activation is influenced by the number of CSD episodes, with multiple episodes causing significant release of HMGB1 from cortical neurons. HMGB1 acts on the TLR2/4 receptors on the surface of microglia, leading to microglial activation and hypertrophic morphological alterations. The mechanisms by which microglia induce CSD remain unknown, but the involvement of potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channels, subfamily N, member 4 (KCNN4/KCA3.1) may be worthy of investigation.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

Transposable elements (TES) have been considered as selfish and junk elements, but recent evidence suggests that they play a crucial role in evolution, serving as a genomic reservoir for new regulatory and coding sequences, and allowing genetic innovation and organismal evolution. They can be molecularly domesticated to form new cellular protein-coding genes with properties that can be of interest for host cellular pathways.

2. Several examples of genes derived from TES have been identified in vertebrates, including the gag gene of Ty3/Gypsy elements, which has been domesticated to form the mart gene family, and the env gene of retroviruses, which has been domesticated to form the syncytin gene family. These genes have been shown to have essential functions in placenta development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.

Gin2, one of the gin genes, has been detected in tetrapods, bony fish, and sharks, and possibly in urochordates, suggesting that it may have been formed before the divergence between cartilaginous and ray-finned fish about 500 million years ago.

3. The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy play crucial roles in degrading misfolded proteins, but when these processes fail, protein aggregates accumulate, causing loss of function and gain of pathologic function.
4. Misfolded protein aggregates can cause cell membrane permeabilization, perturbation in membrane protein dynamics, and the formation of novel pathogenic signaling platforms, leading to cell apoptosis and disease progression.

The disease is multifactorial, and epidemiological and animal studies have shown that genetic influences play a significant role in its pathogenesis. The genetic influences are likely polygenic, with multiple genes exerting a small influence on the phenotype.

2. Beta-adrenergic receptors, which are members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, have a seven-membrane spanning domain structure and are receptors for the neurohormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. Several mechanisms contribute to the loss of receptor activity, including uncoupling from adenylyl cyclase activity, internalization, and phosphorylation of internalized receptors. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays a crucial role in atherogenesis by modulating the function of vascular endothelium and regulating serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol.

3. The major non-synonymous SNPs of the 2AR gene have been recognized at nucleotides 46 and 79, causing changes in amino acid residues at positions 16 and 27 of the amino terminus. An enhanced agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation has been observed for the Gly16 variant, while a resistance to down-regulation has been observed for the Glu27 variant. It is hypothesized that the polymorphism in the 2AR gene influences a certain intermediate mechanism for the predisposition of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

This procedure involves the removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries to reduce the risks of breast and ovarian cancer. However, the magnitude of the risk reductions in women with BRCA1/2 mutations who have undergone RRSO compared with those who have not is unclear. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

2. The meta-analysis included 10 published reports of RRSO and the risks of breast and/or ovarian or fallopian tube cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. RRSO was found to be strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The summary risk reduction estimates should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies. However, data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO.

3. The studies that formed the basis of this meta-analysis included case-control studies as well as prospective and retrospective cohort studies. As can be seen in this summary, limitations of the currently available data regarding RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers include variable study designs, small sample sizes for individual studies, many of which are retrospective in nature, and short post-RRSO follow-up times in prospective studies. Eight studies estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were treated with RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment. Three nonoverlapping studies estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who received RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive the procedure.

1. The isolation of pure populations of cells from heterogeneous cell suspensions is an essential part of clinical and basic research, and various techniques have been developed to achieve this goal. For example, the diagnostic test for HIV infection relies on the separation of human lymphocytes from whole blood. This process is crucial for understanding fundamental aspects of the body's response to injury.

2. Recent advances in stem cell biology have led to the development of new methods for isolating rare cells, such as islet 1+ cells that appear to be resident cardiac progenitor cells. These cells are present in very small numbers and are currently isolated by pre-plating of the heart cell suspension for 1 hour. However, this method is not efficient, and only 0.5% of the total cell population is composed of progenitors after 46 days in culture.

3. Miniaturized cell separation devices offer many advantages over conventional separation techniques, including small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential for integration with analytical techniques. These devices are derived from the semiconductor industry or from advances in synthetic chemistry. Cell separation techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: techniques based on size and density, and techniques based on affinity (chemical, electrical, or magnetic).

4. Size-based separation processes are being employed in micro- and nanoscale devices, which are compact, simple, and usually do not require additional energy sources or equipment. These devices force a fluid containing a heterogeneous particle population through a series of channels or obstacles of varied size. The main advantage of the size-based approach is that it does not require the presence of cell-specific markers or proteins to achieve separation.

5. Microfluidic FACs systems have been developed, which are low-cost and operate comparably to their macroscale analogs in terms of purity and throughput. These systems use a laser beam and an array of photodetectors to sort cells based on their scattering and fluorescence properties. An important advantage of microfluidic FACs systems is their ability to operate in a massively parallel fashion to increase scale and throughput without compromising purity and efficacy.

A definitive diagnosis of cirrhosis is made by histological findings after liver biopsy, but imaging examinations are often used before the diagnosis is established due to the high incidence of viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. Several studies have shown that morphological signs on routine clinical imaging examinations often accompany cirrhosis, and knowing these signs can be useful in clinical practice. Different morphological signs have been described on various imaging techniques, including ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

2. The caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL) is a quantitative measurement that has been demonstrated to have high specificity and accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis, but it is time-consuming to calculate and is rarely done in daily clinical work. The size of the caudate lobe has been correlated with the hepatic functional reserve in cirrhotic patients, with larger caudate lobes found in patients with compensated cirrhosis. The C/RL is calculated by measuring the width of the caudate lobe and the width of the right lobe.

3. The right posterior notch (RPN) and the expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF) are simple qualitative visual signs of cirrhosis that have been shown to have high specificity and positive predictive value for the MR diagnosis of cirrhosis. The RPN is defined as a sharp indentation in the right posterior surface of the liver, while the EGF is represented by the enlargement of the pericholecystic space. Both signs are dependent on the same lobar changes of the liver.

The mean sensitivity (MS) in decibels of each eye was calculated by converting each threshold point into a linear scale and then averaging all 52 threshold points.

5. The study used global parameters of structural and functional damage to evaluate the relative ability of different tests in detecting glaucoma progression. The global structural loss was measured by the SD-OCT RNFL average thickness, and the global functional loss was measured by the SITA MS. The study used MS instead of mean deviation (MD) because MD is an age-corrected parameter.

6. The study established confidence limits for the rates of change of SD-OCT average RNFL thickness and SITA MS using longitudinal data available from healthy eyes. The slopes of change were obtained using linear mixed models, and the cutoffs corresponding to the fifth percentile of rates of change in the healthy group were obtained for each parameter. The study required that the slope was statistically significant at p < 0.05 and also faster than the fifth percentile cutoff calculated from the healthy group.

1. The healthcare industry is facing significant challenges, including the need to improve access, cost, and quality of care, which can be addressed through new technologies and innovations. However, research-based institutions are experiencing stress due to increased competition for limited funding, resulting in fewer grants and discoveries. This highlights the importance of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in fundamental research and development.

2. The promise of new technologies and innovations has been cited as a way to address the healthcare industry's current challenges, but it requires navigating a long and challenging journey from basic research to commercialization. This journey is often hindered by the so-called ""valley of death,"" which occurs when technologies from academia lack a promising commercialization pathway and clear value proposition. Financial investors are not typically impressed with technical results and expect teams to address market risks.

3. Academic investigators and research teams often lack the skills and resources to think beyond their work in the lab and anticipate commercial issues, such as market risk. They may be discouraged from considering commercial issues due to concerns about aligning too closely with industry. This can lead to a lack of appreciation for the commercial value of their research.

4. Historically low pay-lines and pressure to focus on novelty have created a challenging funding situation for investigators, particularly new ones. This can lead to a focus on quickly generating publishable results, leaving institutional technology transfer offices with the task of seeking licensees for technologies with unclear commercial value. Financially driven investors are becoming less willing to take risks, particularly those they cannot control.

5. The only teams surviving the commercialization journey are those with robust preparation, demonstrably de-risking both technology and market to succeed in attracting investors. Universities and academic medical centers need to prepare and support investigators interested in translating research into practice, as excellence in science is no longer sufficient. Investigators need new skills and resources to create and develop technologies with a better chance of commercial success.

6. One approach to addressing this challenge is to add a business development function to an institution's technology transfer office, expanding its role to include commercialization support. However, this approach does not address the fundamental issue of improving the commercial readiness of emerging technologies. Another approach is to create programs to assist academic investigators in advancing technologies toward commercialization while conducting their research.

7. Healthcare Commercialization Programs (HCPS) are emerging as an option for academic investigators, attempting to strike a balance between cost-effectively advancing projects and building the skills of team members. HCPS can help teams navigate the commercialization journey and develop a convincing pitch",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27}"

1. Anal incontinence is a bothersome ailment associated with many health complaints and discomfort in daily life, including hygienic problems, limitations in occupational and social life, sexual dysfunction, reduced quality of life, and altered self-esteem. The prevalence and severity of anal incontinence are measured by patient self-reporting, and no objective assessment methods exist. Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is one of the main causes of female anal incontinence reported in nonpregnant women. Additionally, multiple vaginal deliveries can increase the risk of AI regardless of anal sphincter injury.

2. Age, obesity, and medical conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and gastrointestinal disorders also increase the risk of anal incontinence. The prevalence of anal incontinence among women differs largely in previous studies and differs between different study populations. Postpartum studies show a high prevalence of AI in women having suffered from OASIS, with a rate of 38.59%. Women attending gynecological outpatient clinics have a higher prevalence of AI compared to the general female population.

3. Women with pelvic floor disorders have a higher prevalence of AI than women without pelvic floor disorders. Community-based studies show differences in prevalence of AI between age groups, with increasing prevalence by increasing age. Most frequent AI is found among nursing home residents, among the oldest women with frequent additional complaints and comorbidity. Few previous studies have assessed the prevalence of anal incontinence in a female population of fertile age.

4. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors for anal incontinence in an unselected female population across parity groups in the second trimester of pregnancy. The study was conducted as a survey of pregnant women attending a free-of-charge routine ultrasound examination at the second trimester. The pregnant women attending the ultrasound screening in the hospital represent a nonselected population from the entire Oslo area. All pregnant women in Norway are offered a free-of-charge second trimester routine ultrasound examination.

1. The incidence of hypotension in non-obstetric patients undergoing spinal anesthesia ranges from 5% to 66%, depending on various factors such as the definition of hypotension, timing of measurements, and patient characteristics. Previous studies have reported that hypotension due to spinal anesthesia is approximately twice as common in hypertensive patients. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases, making it a significant concern for anesthesiologists.

2. A study was conducted to compare the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive patients under medical treatment. The study included 60 patients aged 18-65 with ASA scores I and II, who underwent elective surgeries under spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine. The patients were divided into two groups: group H (hypertensive patients) and group N (normotensive patients).

3. The study found that there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to age, sex, weight, height, maximal height of sensory block, incidences of hypotension and bradycardia, or the amount of fluids infused. However, the number of patients with ASA II physiologic scores was statistically higher in group H compared to group N. The antihypertensive medications used by the patients are also shown in the study.

4. The study measured the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, as well as heart rate, at various time points after spinal anesthesia. The results showed that the blood pressure values were significantly higher in group H compared to group N at all measurement times. The heart rate values did not show a significant change compared to the basal measurements.

5. The study found that there was no difference between the incidence of hypotension in hypertensive versus normotensive patients who underwent spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine. However, the number of patients who developed hypotension was greater in the hypertensive group compared to the normotensive group. The results support previous findings that effective antihypertensive treatment can reduce the risk of hypotension after spinal anesthesia.

6. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown that the incidence of hypotension after spinal anesthesia is not significantly different between hypertensive and normotensive patients. The results suggest that effective antihypertensive treatment can improve vascular structural changes and decrease basal sympathetic activity, reducing the risk of hypotension after spinal anesthesia.

1. Chronic pain and depression are among the most common health problems reported by patients attending primary care. Diagnosing pain and its coexistence with depression can be challenging and has great consequences for treatment outcomes. Numerous studies have found that pain is associated with significant limitations in daily activities, physical activities, and poor self-rated health. Pain is also associated with an increased prevalence of depressive disorders.

2. Studies from primary care have demonstrated that 22-40% of all contacts to primary care are due to pain. Persistent pain is often comorbid with depression, both in general pain conditions and in disease-specific conditions. Healthcare providers are advised to pay special attention to pain symptoms in patients with depression, but studies have shown that they tend to underestimate the intensity of pain. This tendency to underestimate pain has also been proven for the symptom pain with significant differences between the patient's and the healthcare provider's grading of the intensity of pain.

3. Patients with depression seek care more often for somatic symptoms than for psychological symptoms, which is why care providers must have an increased awareness of this coexistence. There is evidence that optimizing antidepressant therapy and pain self-management in primary care patients may result in improvement of both depression and pain. The coexistence of depression and pain has also shown to be a major risk factor for opioid misuse. It is therefore essential that healthcare providers and patients have an ongoing awareness and understanding of this connection between depression and pain.

4. Dolotest is a validated, pain- and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment tool that integrates measurement of the intensity of pain with assessment of the impact of pain, including mood. The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which Dolotest is useful as a screening tool for depression in primary care. The study included a study population of 715 patients who were asked to fill in the Dolotest and Major Depression Inventory (MDI) questionnaires. The study found that Dolotest was a useful screening tool for patients' experienced pain and the impact of pain on HRQOL as well as a screening tool for patients meeting criteria for depression.

5. The study found that 16.1% of all patients met criteria for depression, and 26.8% of patients whose visit was due to pain met depression criteria. The prevalence of patients with depression in the study group was statistically significantly higher than in the control group for both men and women.

1. Delirium is a common and severe complication among elderly patients, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and increased risk of post-discharge institutionalization and dementia. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium may shed light on the pathophysiology and improve delirium recognition and care. Oxidative stress and disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission might be involved in the pathophysiology of delirium. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor in enzymatic reactions responsible for the production of serotonin and dopamine.

2. The present study investigated BH4 status, potential disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in patients with and without delirium. The study included 86 participants, of whom 23 were diagnosed with delirium. The diagnosis of delirium was made by a geriatrician according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV). The study found that patients with delirium had a higher phe/tyr ratio, suggesting a deficiency in the essential cofactor BH4.

3. The study also found that patients with delirium had a decreased trp/lnaas ratio, which might suggest reduced serotonin production in the central nervous system. The trp/lnaas ratio and the phe/tyr ratio were used to investigate serotonergic neurotransmission. The study found no differences in phe/lnaas ratios, tyr/lnaas ratios, and hva levels between patients with and without delirium, suggesting that dopaminergic neurotransmission is not impaired during delirium. The finding that plasma hva levels are not significantly increased in patients with delirium compared to patients without delirium is not in agreement with earlier results.

4. The study found reduced plasma arginine levels and borderline statistically significantly reduced citrulline levels in patients with delirium. Considering the cross-sectional study design, it is possible that patients with delirium had a pre-existing arginine deficiency or that BH4 deficiency led to the generation of superoxide instead of citrulline and NO from arginine. This would suggest an increased status of oxidative stress, which has been hypothesized to occur in Alzheimer's disease. The study's findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and an increased status of oxidative stress may have played a",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

Optic neuritis related to multiple sclerosis (MS) is an acute optic neuropathy that occurs in young people, especially women, and is characterized by a decline in visual acuity, pain, and changes in the visual field. The clinical picture of optic neuritis includes a decline in visual acuity, pain that increases with eye movements, a decline in contrast sensitivity, dyschromatopsia, and changes in the visual field.

2. The study aimed to determine the onset of optic neuritis as the first MS clinical presentation and analyze the role and significance of morphometric changes in the optic nerve and visual field. The study was conducted at the Eye Clinic and the Neurological Clinic, Sarajevo University Clinical Centre, from March 2009 to 2011.

3. The study found that optic neuritis was most often present in patients aged 18-30 years, and the onset of optic neuritis was more frequent in female patients (70%) compared to male patients. The study also confirmed that optic neuritis is one of the first clinical manifestations of MS.

4. The analysis of ophthalmological parameters showed that visual acuity improved significantly after pulse corticosteroid therapy, with a range of 0.6 to 1.0 after one month. The study also found that the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness decreased in all patients with optic neuritis.

1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population, with diabetes impacting approximately 25% of this group, which is 2-3 times the rate of the general population. Factors such as lower utilization of preventive care and the use of newer antipsychotic medications contribute to this increased rate. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) promotes preventive and population-based care, which may help address this issue.

2. The ACA's Section 2703 introduced Health Home programs to provide services that reduce barriers to care for individuals with chronic conditions, including those with SMI. These programs aim to improve early recognition of developing problems and provide access to necessary preventive somatic care. Placing Health Homes within mental health clinics can maximize exposure to these services.

3. A Behavioral Health Home (BHH) was established at the University of Maryland School of Medicine to provide population-based care and identify abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in individuals with SMI. The BHH aimed to clarify the severity of these findings and provide enhanced, individualized interventions. This program was embedded in the Division of Community Psychiatry.

4. The BHH served 2000 individuals annually, with referrals made to patients who required the most assistance, determined by their enrollment in intensive services such as Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) or Psychiatric Rehabilitation Program (PRP). Once enrolled, the BHH provided a minimum of 2 services per month, coordinated by a nurse case manager. A wide variety of services qualified for BHH services, including care coordination and health promotion.

5. A population-based health management program was created to target highly prevalent somatic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, in individuals with SMI. This program allowed for monitoring of a specific health condition for several consecutive months to provide a better understanding of the population's care needs. Patients who did not have their HbA1c level drawn within 6 months were identified as not in compliance with clinic recommendations.

2. Oppenheimer's theory, which focuses on men's economic uncertainty and instability, suggests that men's economic insecurity can lead to delays in marriage and union formation. This theory is in contrast to other explanations that focus on women's economic independence or cultural changes.

3. The article presents evidence from a large multi-nation project that supports Oppenheimer's theory, showing that men's unemployment and temporary contracts are associated with lower chances of entering marriage. The study also finds that men's income and earnings have a positive effect on union formation.

4. The analysis of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) data reveals that men's employment and income are significant predictors of union formation, with employed men being more likely to enter a union than unemployed men. The study also finds that men's work history and income are associated with higher chances of entering a union.

1. The mir-200 family of microRNAs plays a crucial role in maintaining the epithelial phenotype in well-differentiated, low-grade breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer cells. Mir-200c specifically targets ZEB1, a transcription factor that promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and its expression is lost in aggressive cancer cells. The loss of mir-200c expression is associated with increased chemoresistance and aggressiveness in these cancers. Mir-200c also targets other genes involved in cell motility and invasion, such as arhgdib, ntrk2, ephb1, and fn1.

2. The mir-200c-mediated repression of tubb3, a class III beta-tubulin, is the cause of enhanced chemosensitivity to microtubule targeting agents. Mir-200c expression also decreases adhesion to basement membrane complex, laminin, and collagen type IV, which is relevant to ovarian cancer. The effects of mir-200c on invasion and migration appear to be independent of E-cadherin status. Furthermore, the double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and ZEB1 is not present in all cells, and this can be exploited to identify the distinct roles of mir-200c as compared to ZEB1.

1. The transobturator approach to treat female stress urinary incontinence was first described by Delorme in 2001, aiming to prevent complications associated with the retropubic approach originally described by Ulmsten. This approach was later modified by De Leval in 2003 to further reduce the potential injury to the urethra and bladder. A meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence. The anatomical trajectories of both obturator approaches have been confirmed to be anatomically safe from a neurovascular perspective.

2. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach. The study used CT-scan image analysis to visualize the midurethral tapes throughout their trajectory. The results showed that the inside-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the outside-in approach. The three-dimensional radiographic visualization of the tape's trajectory also allowed for an appreciation of the mus tapes' spatial configuration in relation to the bony pelvis and the urethra.

3. The study found that the outside-in mus tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the inside-out mus tapes. The mean full inner angle in a strict antero-posterior view formed by the inside-out mus measured 122, while it measured 144 for the outside-in mus. The paired differences between the tapes' inner angles were significantly different, with a mean difference of 19.8. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene/polyester tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout their trajectory.

4. The study's findings have clinical implications for surgeons, who must pay more attention to the second half of the helical pass, whichever way they choose to go. For the inside-out passage, one must rotate hard and carefully around the ischio-pubic ramus, while for the outside-in pass, care must be taken that dissection of the peri-urethral tunnel provides for a full thickness vaginal epithelial layer. The advent of three-dimensional ultrasonography will allow for similar measurements of the different tapes' trajectories in vivo in a dynamic setting. The study's results also suggest that the outside-in approach may be associated with a higher risk of postoperative groin pain and superficial placement at the level of the lateral vaginal sulcus",1,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. The meeting discussed various topics, including the Meeting Recorder project, transcription issues, and the NSF ITR proposal. Professor A mentioned that the NSF ITR proposal was a higher-level project that dealt with mapping conversations to different planes. The proposal was a follow-up to the pre-proposal, and the team was working on a larger proposal due in April. The team was excited about the possibility of receiving funding for the project.

2. The team discussed the transcription process, with Postdoc F mentioning that they were working on channel-by-channel transcriptions to provide tighter time bins. However, they discovered that there were time lags involved in this process, and it might be faster to transcribe a channel at a time. The team also discussed the issue of backchannels being overlooked by transcribers, especially in densely populated overlaps. Postdoc F suggested listening densely in places of overlap to avoid missing backchannels.

3. PhD C discussed his work on harmonicity detection, using the instantaneous frequency and phase derivative to identify harmonics. However, he encountered issues with the algorithm, and the team suggested alternative methods, such as using a sieve to hypothesize frequencies and then looking at the energy at multiples of those frequencies. The team also discussed the importance of distinguishing between voiced and unvoiced speech, which would require looking at high frequencies. PhD C planned to prepare his results for the next meeting to discuss further.

4. Postdoc F raised the issue of handling breaths in the transcription process, suggesting that it might be possible to encode them automatically using a breath detector. However, the team discussed the pros and cons of including breaths in the corpus, with some arguing that it was essential for real speech and others suggesting that it might be too time-consuming to annotate. The team proposed a compromise, where transcribers would only annotate breaths within speech chunks, leaving outside regions uncharted. This approach would allow for the development of models that could learn to recognize breaths.

5. The team discussed the importance of marking meaningful components in speech recognition research, which was critical for pulling out the actual, meaningful components from the midst of other things. Professor A emphasized that the core thing they were trying to do was to recognize the actual, meaningful components, and that getting other components that were not meaningful was essential. The team also discussed the issue of noise and convolutional effects, which were not linguistically relevant but still important for speech recognition.

1. The meeting was about discussing the market potential for a new remote control. The project manager, vocalsound, started the meeting by mentioning that there were some changes from ""on high"" that needed to be discussed. The team had previously decided on roles for each member, but these changes would affect their plans. The project manager asked the user interface designer to present their ideas.

2. The user interface designer presented their ideas, which included a design that was inspired by existing remote controls but with a more organic shape. They also mentioned that people between 25 and 35 years old were the main buyers of TVs, and that they should design the remote control with this age group in mind. The designer also suggested that the remote control should be easy to learn and use, with proper manuals provided. They also mentioned that people were willing to pay more for a good-looking remote control.

3. The marketing expert, Rajan, presented his findings on the market potential for the remote control. He mentioned that 75% of users found existing remote controls to be ugly and not good-looking, and that 80% of users were willing to pay more for a good-looking remote control. He also suggested that the company should emphasize what consumers want, rather than adding more functions to the remote control. He mentioned that 50% of users only used 10% of the buttons on their remote control.

4. The marketing expert also mentioned that the company should consider the costs of adding features such as speech recognition. He found that people up to 35 years old were not interested in speech recognition, but that it could be a good feature for the 15-35 age group. He also suggested that the company should consider the fact that people often lost their remote controls and that a feature that would help them find it would be useful. He mentioned that a glow-in-the-dark feature could be a good gimmick to enhance sales.

5. The user interface designer presented their ideas on the design of the remote control, including a more organic shape and a simpler design with fewer buttons. They also suggested that the remote control should be hand-held and portable, and that it should have a rechargeable battery. They also mentioned that the company should consider adding a gimmick to set it apart from other remote controls, such as a whistle function or a rechargeable station. They also suggested that the remote control should have a simple design with a few buttons and a clear layout.

1. The team discussed the functions of the new remote control, considering the market potential and consumer likings. They decided to focus on a simple design with limited buttons, as 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons on existing remote controls. The team also considered the importance of ergonomics and a trendy, fashionable design.

2. The team discussed various features, including speech recognition, glow-in-the-dark material, and a T_F_T_ display. However, they decided to scratch the T_F_T_ display due to its high cost and fragility. Instead, they opted for speech recognition, which would be integrated with the remote control and the TV, allowing users to find the remote control by voice command.

3. The team also discussed the design and materials of the remote control, considering a more organic shape and a rubbery material that is durable and ergonomic. They also discussed the importance of safety, ensuring that the remote control is child-friendly and non-toxic. The team ultimately decided on a design that incorporates a small yellow logo and a rubbery material, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 9}"
