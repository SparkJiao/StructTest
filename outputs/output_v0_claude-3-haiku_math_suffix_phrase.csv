5,"To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the glasses Kylar wants to buy.

Given information:
- One glass costs $5.
- Every second glass costs only 60% of the price, which means $3 (60% of $5).
- Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.

Step 1: Determine the number of glasses that cost $5 and the number of glasses that cost $3.
Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and every second glass costs $3, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of glasses that cost $3.
Number of glasses that cost $3 = 16 ÷ 2 = 8 glasses
Number of glasses that cost $5 = 16 - 8 = 8 glasses

Given information:
- The cost of planting the lemon tree is $90.
- The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.5 each.
- The cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3 per year.

Let's calculate the net profit (revenue - cost) for each year:
- Year 1: Revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5, Cost = $90 + $3 = $93, Net Profit = $10.5 - $93 = -$82.5
- Year 2: Revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5
- Year 3: Revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5
- Year 4: Revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5
- Year 5: Revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Step 1: Find Darrell's age and Allen's age.
Let Darrell's age be x and Allen's age be y.
According to the given ratio, we have:
x : y = 7 : 11
x = 7k and y = 11k, where k is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so:
x + y = 162

115,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought and the total revenue she will make from selling the leftover boards, and then find the difference between the two to determine the profit.

Given information:
- Sasha has 10 leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each.
- Sasha has 5 leftover 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.
Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 × $10 = $100
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 × $16 = $80
Total cost of all the lumber = $100 + $80 = $180

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Sasha will make from selling the leftover boards.
Since the prices for lumber have gone up by 50% in the last few months, Sasha can sell the boards at a higher price.
Selling price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 × 1.5 = $15 each
Selling price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $16 × 1.5 = $24 each
Total revenue from selling 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 × $15 = $150
Total revenue from selling 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 × $24 = $120
Total revenue from selling all the boards = $150 + $120 = $270

Step 3: Calculate the profit Sasha makes.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90.

Given information:
- The trader buys the bags at a rate of $20 per bag.
- The cost of transporting each bag is $2.
- The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the bags.
Total cost = (Cost per bag × Number of bags) + (Cost of transportation per bag × Number of bags)

Given information:
- Both pools have leaks that are emptying them at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- Let y be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

Step 1: Find the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.
Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, we can write:

- John has 54 candies.

Step 1: Find the number of candies that Robert has.
Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can use the following equation:
John's candies = 2 × Robert's candies
54 = 2 × Robert's candies
Robert's candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Step 2: Find the number of candies that James has.
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6 = 33

Step 3: Calculate the difference between John's and James' candies.
Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33 = 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

- He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.
- Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.
- Mike responds in kind.
- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week.
Number of pen pals remaining = 5 - 2 = 3
Number of letters received per week = 3 × 2 = 6 letters
Number of pages received per week = 6 letters × 5 pages = 30 pages
Number of letters Mike writes per week = 6 letters

- Jeans makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
- The makeup is required 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- The makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours for the makeup services.
Total hours per week = 6 hours per day × 4 days per week = 24 hours per week
Total hours for the movie = 24 hours per week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

Given information:
- It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
- It takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.
- After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.
Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees = 20 minutes
Time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees = 20 minutes × 1.4 = 28 minutes
Total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken.
Time to cook the chicken = Time to warm up the oil - 5 minutes
Time to cook the chicken = 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes

Given information:
- Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.
- There are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Rice consumed per person per meal = 0.2 kg
Number of meals per day = 2 (lunch and dinner)
Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg × 2 = 0.4 kg
Total rice consumed by the household per day = 0.4 kg × 5 members = 2 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Number of days = Total amount of rice / Daily rice consumption
Number of days = 42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Given information:
- Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.

Step 1: Find the amount of weight Joey loses in a single week.
Weight loss per week for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

- Lucy sells apples at $4 per piece.
- On Monday, she sold all the apples picked and got $56.
- On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.

Step 1: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday.
Since Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, we can divide this amount by the price per apple to find the number of apples.
Number of apples picked on Monday = $56 / $4 per apple = 14 apples

Step 2: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Tuesday.

Given information:
- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others.
- The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each throughout the day.
- The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds attracted to the store-bought bird feeders.
Number of store-bought bird feeders = 3
Number of birds attracted to each store-bought bird feeder = 20
Total number of birds attracted to store-bought bird feeders = 3 × 20 = 60 birds

Given information:
- The cost of the amusement park ticket is $100.
- Kenny sells each card for $1.5.
- Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
- Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he keeps x/3 cards.
- Kenny sells the remaining 2/3 of the cards, which is 2x/3 cards.

Given information:
- Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
- Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
- Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

Step 1: Find the daily recommended cups of coffee.
Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, we can use this information to find the daily recommended cups of coffee.

Given information:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds.
- Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
- Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.

Given information:
- The jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans.
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of blue jelly beans.
- Let x - 1% of x = 0.99x be the number of red jelly beans.
- Let x + 1% of x = 1.01x be the number of green jelly beans.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up an equation:

Given information:
- The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall.
- The beanstalk doubles its height every day.
- The window is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day 'n' as H(n).

On day 1, the height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, so H(1) = 4.
On day 2, the height of the beanstalk is 4 × 2 = 8 feet, so H(2) = 8.
On day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 8 × 2 = 16 feet, so H(3) = 16.

We need to find the first day 'n' where the height of the beanstalk, H(n), is greater than 20 feet.

- The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
- John brought $125 with him.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines.
Cost of vaccines = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the heartworm check.
Total bill = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check
Cost of heartworm check = 60% of the total bill
Let's represent the total bill as x.
x = $40 + 0.6x
0.4x = $40
x = $100

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the vet visit.
Total cost = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check
Total cost = $40 + $60 = $100

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money John leaves with.
Amount of money left = Amount of money brought - Total cost
Amount of money left = $125 - $100 = $25

Number of small stickers traded for large buttons = 90% of 30 = 0.9 × 30 = 27 small stickers

Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine receives in exchange for the small stickers.
Number of large buttons received = 27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons

Step 3: Calculate the number of large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Number of large stickers traded for large buttons = 50% of 40 = 0.5 × 40 = 20 large stickers

Step 4: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine receives in exchange for the large stickers.
Number of large buttons received = 20 large stickers / 1 large button per large sticker = 20 large buttons

Step 5: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine receives in exchange for the remaining large stickers.
Number of remaining large stickers = 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers
Number of small stickers received = 20 large stickers × 3 small stickers per large sticker = 60 small stickers

Given information:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Kris has played in the first 2 weeks.
Number of days in 2 weeks = 14 days
Hours played per day = 0.5 hours
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days × 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Kris has played in the third week.
Number of days in the third week = 7 days
Hours played per day = 2 hours
Total hours played in the third week = 7 days × 2 hours/day = 14 hours

- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount of citrus zest and fragrance.
- Let y be the amount of salt and sugar.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the variables.
Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we can say that the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, which is x.
Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we can say that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, which is y.
Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2y.
Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2x.

Step 2: Find the total amount of ingredients in the salt scrub.
Total amount of ingredients = Amount of citrus zest + Amount of fragrance + Amount of salt + Amount of sugar + Amount of oil
Total amount of ingredients = x + x + y + y + 2y
Total amount of ingredients = 2x + 4y

Step 3: Find the amount of oil Tanya uses.
Since the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces, we can set up an equation:
2x + 4y = 10
Solving for y, we get:
y = (10 - 2x) / 4
Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2y.

Given information:
- It takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- Four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, need to travel across the same highway.

Step 1: Find the speed of the kangaroos.
Since the 3 kangaroos are traveling at the same speed, we can calculate their speed as follows:
Speed of a kangaroo = Distance / Time
Distance = 1 (since the distance is not given, we can assume it is 1 unit)
Time = 18 hours
Speed of a kangaroo = 1 / 18 = 1/18 units per hour

Step 2: Find the speed of the turtles.
Each turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is:
Speed of a turtle = 1/2 × Speed of a kangaroo = 1/2 × (1/18) = 1/36 units per hour

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for the four turtles to travel across the highway.
Time = Distance / Total Speed
Total Speed = 4 × Speed of a turtle = 4 × (1/36) = 1/9 units per hour

847,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, including the initial investment and the accumulated simple interest.

Given information:
- Brenda invested $300.
- The simple interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.
- The time period is 3 years.

The formula for simple interest is:
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where:
- Principal is the initial investment
- Rate is the interest rate per year
- Time is the number of years

Step 1: Calculate the simple interest for each year.
Simple Interest for Year 1 = ($300 × 0.75 × 1) / 100 = $2.25
Simple Interest for Year 2 = ($300 × 0.75 × 2) / 100 = $4.50
Simple Interest for Year 3 = ($300 × 0.75 × 3) / 100 = $6.75

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years.
Total Amount = Initial Investment + Simple Interest for Year 1 + Simple Interest for Year 2 + Simple Interest for Year 3
Total Amount = $300 + $2.25 + $4.50 + $6.75 = $313.50

Therefore, Brenda will have a total of $313.50 after 3 years.

Given information:
- Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.
- The third person (Collins) got 15 more corn chips than the other two.

Let's assume the number of corn chips each Amora and Lainey got is x.

Since the third person (Collins) got 15 more corn chips, their share would be x + 15.

The total number of corn chips would be the sum of the shares of Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

Total corn chips = Amora's share + Lainey's share + Collins' share
Total corn chips = x + x + (x + 15)
Total corn chips = 3x + 15

We know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, so:
x = 70
Substituting x = 70 in the total corn chips equation:

Given information:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- The third package has 8 sandwiches, but the price is not indicated.

Step 1: Find the cost per sandwich.
Cost per sandwich = Total cost / Number of sandwiches
Cost per sandwich (first package) = $3 / 2 = $1.50

Given information:
- Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.
- The total time to make the meal was 98 minutes.

Let's represent Donovan's part as x minutes.

Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can express Betsy's part as (x + 18) minutes.

The total time to make the meal is the sum of Betsy's part and Donovan's part, which is 98 minutes.

- She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.
- Her current salary is $100,000.

Step 1: Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement.
Annual salary = $100,000
Retirement living expenses = 40% of annual salary = 0.4 × $100,000 = $40,000 per year
Total retirement savings needed = $40,000 × 20 years = $800,000

Step 2: Calculate the annual amount Lauren is saving.
Annual savings = 20% of annual salary = 0.2 × $100,000 = $20,000

Step 3: Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement savings goal.
Number of years needed = Total retirement savings needed / Annual savings
Number of years needed = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

Step 4: Calculate the number of additional years Lauren needs to work.
Additional years needed = 40 years - (current age - retirement age)
Assuming Lauren is currently 40 years old and plans to retire at 60 years old, the additional years needed would be:
Additional years needed = 40 years - (40 years - 60 years) = 40 years - 20 years = 20 years

Given information:
- Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.
- Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day for three weeks.
- Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day for three weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cows after three weeks.
Initial number of cows = 50
Cows added per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 21 (3 weeks × 7 days per week)
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + (Cows added per day × Number of days)
Total number of cows = 50 + (20 × 21) = 470

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chickens after three weeks.
Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens added per day = 10
Number of days in three weeks = 21 (3 weeks × 7 days per week)
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + (Chickens added per day × Number of days)
Total number of chickens = 20 + (10 × 21) = 230

Step 3: Calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.
Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230 = 700

Given information:
- Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels.
- Russell orders 4 packs of bagels.
- He will receive a 10% discount on the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
Total cost without discount = 4 packs × $10.00 per pack = $40.00

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 × $40.00 = $4.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount.
Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost per single bagel.
Cost per single bagel = Total cost with discount / Total number of bagels
Total number of bagels = 4 packs × 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels
Cost per single bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

- Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie.
- After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.

Step 1: Find the initial amount of money given to Rissa.
Rissa's initial amount = 3 × Ronnie's initial amount = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 2: Find the amount of money Ronnie and Rissa gave to their little sister.
Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their little sister, the amount given by each of them is half of the remaining amount after Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.
Rissa's remaining amount = 4/5 × $15 = $12

Given information:
- Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.
- 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the net rate of snowball building.

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 years old now.

Let's assume that Digimon came out x years ago.

When Digimon came out, John's age was (28 - x) and Jim's age was (28 - x) / 2.

Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can write:
(28 - x) = 2 × (28 - x) / 2
(28 - x) = 28 - x
x = 14

Therefore, Digimon came out 14 years ago.

Now, we can calculate Jim's current age:
Jim's age when Digimon came out = (28 - x) / 2 = (28 - 14) / 2 = 7
Jim's current age = 7 + 14 = 21

- Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then 3 days on the medium setting, and finally 5 days on the high setting.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water removed on the low setting.
Water removed on the low setting = 1 liter per day × 3 days = 3 liters

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water removed on the medium setting.
Water removed on the medium setting = 2 × 1 liter per day = 2 liters per day
Total water removed on the medium setting = 2 liters per day × 3 days = 6 liters

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water removed on the high setting.
Water removed on the high setting = 2 × 2 liters per day = 4 liters per day
Total water removed on the high setting = 4 liters per day × 5 days = 20 liters

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier.
Total water removed = Water removed on the low setting + Water removed on the medium setting + Water removed on the high setting

- They start peeling oranges at the same time.

Step 1: Calculate the number of oranges peeled by Ana in an hour.
Number of minutes in an hour = 60 minutes
Number of oranges peeled by Ana in an hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges peeled by Jane in an hour.
Number of oranges peeled by Jane in an hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane.
Difference = Number of oranges peeled by Ana - Number of oranges peeled by Jane
Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

1316,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost that Mark paid for the new radiator and the installation.

Given information:
- The cost of a new radiator is $400.
- Mark gets the radiator at a junk shop for 80% off.
- The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the radiator at the junk shop.
Original cost of the radiator = $400
Discount = 80% of $400 = 0.8 × $400 = $320
Cost of the radiator at the junk shop = $400 - $320 = $80

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the installation.
Cost of the installation = 3 hours × $50 per hour = $150

Step 3: Calculate the total cost that Mark paid.
Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of the installation
Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230.

1317,"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

Given information:
- Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows.
- The total number of legs of all the animals is 70.

We know that:
- Chickens have 2 legs each.
- Cows have 4 legs each.

Let's represent the number of chickens as ""x"" and the number of cows as ""y"".

We can set up two equations:

1. Total number of animals: x + y = 20
2. Total number of legs: 2x + 4y = 70

Solving the first equation for y, we get:
y = 20 - x

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
2x + 4(20 - x) = 70
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is 5.

1318,"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pizza slices and then divide it by the number of people sharing the pizzas.

Given information:
- Henry and 3 of his friends ordered 7 pizzas.
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

Step 1: Find the total number of pizza slices.
Total number of pizza slices = Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza
Total number of pizza slices = 7 × 8 = 56 slices

Step 2: Find the number of people sharing the pizzas.
Number of people sharing the pizzas = Henry + 3 friends = 4 people

Step 3: Divide the total number of pizza slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas.
Number of slices each person can have = Total number of pizza slices / Number of people sharing the pizzas
Number of slices each person can have = 56 / 4 = 14 slices

Therefore, the answer is: 14.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
