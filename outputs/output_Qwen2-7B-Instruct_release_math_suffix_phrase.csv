2,"To calculate the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the final value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

1. **Initial cost of the house**: $80,000
2. **Cost of repairs**: $50,000

The total cost for Josh is the sum of the initial cost of the house and the cost of repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

The house's value increased by 150% after the repairs. This means the value increased by 150% of the total cost of the house (initial cost + repairs).

To find the increase in value:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times \$130,000 = 1.5 \times \$130,000 = \$195,000 \]

The final value of the house is the total cost plus the increase in value:
\[ \text{Final value} = \$130,000 + \$195,000 = \$325,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the final value:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Final value} - \text{Total cost} = \$325,000 - \$130,000 = \$195,000 \]

Given:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- There are 20 chickens.
- In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

First, calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens:

12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net income per year and then see how many years it will take for the total income to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's calculate the annual income from selling lemons:

- Carlos gets 7 lemons per year.
- Each lemon sells for $1.5.
- So, the annual income from selling lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:

- The annual cost is $3.

Now, let's calculate the net income per year:

- Net income per year = Annual income from lemons - Annual cost of watering and feeding = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Finally, to determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we divide the initial cost of planting the tree by the net income per year:

3. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, leaving her with \(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\) vacuum cleaners.
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \(\frac{1}{2}(\frac{2x}{3} - 2)\) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
5. After selling at the orange house, she had \(\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2}(\frac{2x}{3} - 2)\) vacuum cleaners left, which simplifies to \(\frac{1}{2}(\frac{2x}{3} - 2)\) vacuum cleaners.

The total distance Marissa has covered so far is 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles). 

Marissa's goal is to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. 

To find the total time she needs to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we divide the total distance by her desired average speed:

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance he biked before his first stop and the distance he biked after his second stop from the total distance.

So, the calculation is:

Total distance - Distance before first stop - Distance after second stop = Distance between first and second stops

60 miles - 20 miles - (60 miles - 15 miles) = Distance between first and second stops

60 miles - 20 miles - 45 miles = Distance between first and second stops

This simplifies to:

0 miles = Distance between first and second stops

This result indicates that there seems to be a misunderstanding in the question as presented. If Henry stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip, it would imply that the distance between his first and second stops would be the total distance minus the distance before the first stop and the distance after the second stop. However, the calculation provided leads to an incorrect result because it subtracts the distance before the first stop and the distance after the second stop from the total distance in a way that doesn't logically represent the scenario described.

Given the scenario, the distance between the first and second stops would actually be the total distance minus the distance before the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

So, the correct calculation should be:

Total distance - Distance before first stop - Distance from second stop to end = Distance between first and second stops

60 miles - 20 miles - 15 miles = Distance between first and second stops

This simplifies to:

25 miles = Distance between first and second stops

29,"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \(B\). According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(B - 5\). We know one pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

So, the equation representing the total cost of the two pairs of heels is:
\[33 + 66 = B - 5\]

Combining the costs of the two pairs of heels gives us:
\[99 = B - 5\]

To find the cost of the boots (\(B\)), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance she covers in each activity over the six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, two-thirds of the time walking, and the remaining time skipping.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Distance covered while running:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Time spent walking:

62,"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider both the base annual pension and the additional entitlement she receives after 20 years.

1. **Base Annual Pension**: Marcy gets a base annual pension of $50,000.

2. **Additional Entitlement**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. This means for the last 10 years (from year 21 to year 30), she gets an additional 5% of $50,000.

   - Additional entitlement per year = 5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500.

3. **Total Annual Pension after 30 years**: To find the total annual pension, we add the base annual pension to the additional entitlement for the last 10 years.

   - Total annual pension = Base annual pension + Additional entitlement per year * 10 years
   - Total annual pension = $50,000 + ($2,500 * 10) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

For the first half of the year, the cost is straightforward:
\[ \text{Cost for first half} = \$140 \times 6 \]

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = \$140 - (10\% \times \$140) \]
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = \$140 - (\$14) \]
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = \$126 \]

Now, calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for second half} = \$126 \times 6 \]

Finally, add the costs for both halves to get the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for first half} + \text{Cost for second half} \]

Let's calculate the values:

\[ \text{Cost for first half} = \$140 \times 6 = \$840 \]
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = \$140 - \$14 = \$126 \]
\[ \text{Cost for second half} = \$126 \times 6 = \$756 \]

2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{\text{Jamal's phone capacity}}{6} \]

Given Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs:

1. Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps.
2. There are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Since Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, this means that the 30 letters in the already-stamped pile represent two-thirds of the letters needing stamps (because the one-third that got stamped are now in the already-stamped pile, and the remaining two-thirds are still needing stamps).

To find out how many letters were needing stamps initially, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Letters needing stamps} = 30 \]

Solving for the number of letters needing stamps:

\[ \text{Letters needing stamps} = \frac{30}{2/3} = \frac{30}{0.666\ldots} = 45 \]

   - With 500 patients a day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

2. **Total Cost:**
   - The doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour for their services.
   - Each patient takes 0.4 hours, so the cost for the hospital per patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.
   - With 500 patients a day, the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

3. **Profit:**

\[S - \text{Total Cost} = \text{Profit}\]

Given that the profit is $25, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[S - \text{Total Cost} = 25\]

We also know that they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is:

\[20 \times 0.50 = 10\]

Let's denote the number of gallons sold as \(G\). Therefore, the total sales \(S\) can be represented as:

\[S = 10G\]

Substituting \(S = 10G\) into the profit equation:

\[10G - \text{Total Cost} = 25\]

We also know that the cost for each gallon includes $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, making the total cost per gallon:

- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters.
- Each rabbit gets 20 pieces of straw.
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.

First, calculate the total straw given to the hamsters:

Interest for the first month = $100 * 2% = $2

After the first month, the total amount owed is:
$100 + $2 = $102

Next, let's calculate the interest for the second month:
Interest for the second month = $102 * 2% = $2.04

After the second month, the total amount owed is:
$102 + $2.04 = $104.04

Finally, let's calculate the interest for the third month:
Interest for the third month = $104.04 * 2% = $2.0808

After the third month, the total amount owed is:

188,"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we can start by calculating the total cost of buying and transporting the bags, and then subtracting this from the total revenue from selling the bags to find the total cost. Finally, we can use the profit to determine the number of bags sold.

Let's denote the number of bags as \(n\).

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: Each bag costs $20, so the total cost for \(n\) bags is \(20n\).

2. **Cost of transporting the bags**: Each bag costs $2 to transport, so the total cost for \(n\) bags is \(2n\).

3. **Total cost**: The total cost for buying and transporting the bags is \(20n + 2n = 22n\).

4. **Revenue from selling the bags**: Each bag is sold for $30, so the total revenue for \(n\) bags is \(30n\).

5. **Profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400. Profit is calculated as Revenue - Total Cost, so we have:
\[30n - 22n = 400\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[8n = 400\]
\[n = 50\]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

1. **Cost of tickets**: They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.

2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So, the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

4. **Total cost**: The total cost is the sum of the cost of tickets, food, and rides. So, the total cost is $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

5. **Splitting the cost evenly**: They agreed to split all the costs evenly. So, each of them paid $102 / 3 = $34.

Total sentences = 1000
Sentences for each publisher = \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \)

Next, we calculate the payment for each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:

Payment for Publisher A = \( 500 \times 5 \) cents = \( 2500 \) cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so:

Payment for Publisher B = \( 2 \times 5 \) cents = \( 10 \) cents per sentence
Payment for Publisher B for 500 sentences = \( 500 \times 10 \) cents = \( 5000 \) cents

252,"To find out how many animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed on both days. 

On the first night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

On the second day, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars he killed on the second day as \(C\). Therefore, the number of wolves he killed on the second day is \(3C\).

Additionally, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars on the second day.

Now, we can find out how many wolves he killed on the second day by substituting \(C = 12\) into the equation \(3C\):

\(3C = 3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves.

So, on the second day, Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the animals from both days:

3. **Tony's Points**: Tony has 2 times more points than Mike. So, Tony has \(2 \times 21 = 42\) points after 3 rounds.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- **Mike's Extra Point**: Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.

First, let's calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household:

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members eating rice twice a day (lunch and dinner). So, the total daily consumption is:

\[ \text{Total daily consumption} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/person/meal} \times 5 \, \text{people} \times 2 \, \text{meals} \]

\[ \text{Total daily consumption} = 0.2 \times 5 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total daily consumption} = 2 \, \text{kg} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last:

\[ \text{Days the bag lasts} = \frac{\text{Total amount of rice}}{\text{Total daily consumption}} \]

\[ \text{Days the bag lasts} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} \]

\[ \text{Days the bag lasts} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the bag will last:

\[ \text{Weeks the bag lasts} = \frac{\text{Days the bag lasts}}{7} \]

\[ \text{Weeks the bag lasts} = \frac{21}{7} \]

1. **Cost per mile driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is 60 miles per day.
   - He works 5 days a week, so in a week, he travels \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.
   - He works for 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he travels \(300 \times 50 = 15,000\) miles.
   - The cost per mile is $2, so the annual cost for miles driven is \(15,000 \times 2 = \$30,000\).

2. **Driver's monthly bonus:**
   - The bonus is $150 per month.
   - Since he works for 50 weeks a year, there are approximately \(50 / 4 = 12.5\) months in a year (assuming a month is roughly 4 weeks).
   - However, since bonuses are typically given for full months, we consider 12 months in a year for the bonus calculation.
   - The annual bonus cost is \(12 \times 150 = \$1,800\).

3. **Total annual cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the annual cost for miles driven and the annual bonus for the driver.
   - Total cost = \(30,000 + 1,800 = \$31,800\).

Given:
- The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
- The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.
- There are 30 boys in the classroom.

First, let's find the number of girls:
Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).

Next, let's find the number of nongendered children:
Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of nongendered children is \(1/10 \times 30 = 3\).

Finally, let's find the total number of children:
The total number of children is the sum of the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children, which is \(30 + 90 + 3 = 123\).

322,"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to find out how many pencils they have in total.

Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 26.

Meg has 46 pencils.

Together, Jam and Meg have a total of 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils, and given that Jam's three boxes hold 26 pencils, we can find out how many pencils each box can hold by dividing the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes.

So, each box holds 26 pencils / 3 boxes = approximately 8.67 pencils per box. 

However, since you can't have a fraction of a pencil in a box, we'll assume that each box can hold 8 pencils (rounding down to the nearest whole number), which means there's a remainder of 2 pencils that need to be placed in another box.

Therefore, to store all 72 pencils, Jam and Meg would need 9 boxes (3 boxes for Jam + 6 boxes for Meg's 46 pencils, with the last box being shared for the remaining 2 pencils).

323,"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cooling effect and the effect of adding cream.

1. **Cooling effect**: Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide the total cooling needed by the cooling effect of one ice cube:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]
   Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, adding 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \text{ weaker}
   \]

2. **Effect of adding cream**: Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee. Cream is typically less concentrated than the coffee, so it will dilute the coffee.

Combining both effects, the total weakening of the coffee is:
\[
60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (from cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, we can calculate the total number of old records traded in as follows:

Since each person leaves with 7/5 = 1.4 new records on average (because there are 5 people), and each person needs to trade 2 old records to get 1 new record, each person must have brought in 2 * 1.4 = 2.8 old records.

325,"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first determine the number of junior and senior programmers, then calculate their monthly salaries, and finally sum these amounts.

1. **Determine the number of junior and senior programmers:**

Given that the number of junior programmers is \(2/5\) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, and we have 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

2. **Calculate the monthly salaries for junior and senior programmers:**

Given that junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80,000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly salary is:

\[ \text{Monthly salary for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144,000 \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total salary for junior programmers} + \text{Total salary for senior programmers} \]

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 80,000 + 144,000 = 224,000 \]

First, let's calculate the annual cost for food. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food is $25 * 4 = $100. Therefore, the annual cost for food is $100 * 12 = $1200.

Next, we have the annual cost for treats. Treats cost $20 per month, so the annual cost for treats is $20 * 12 = $240.

Lastly, we have the annual cost for medicine. Medicine costs $100 per month, so the annual cost for medicine is $100 * 12 = $1200.

Now, we add up the annual costs for food, treats, and medicine to find the total annual cost. The total annual cost is $1200 (food) + $240 (treats) + $1200 (medicine) = $2640.

Let's break down the costs:

1. **Mini-golf**: $5 per person
2. **Arcade tokens**: $5 (fixed cost)
3. **Go-kart rides**: $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so $20 in total

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the activities:

1. **Daily spending on lollipops**: Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, her daily spending on lollipops is:
   \[4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents}\]

2. **Daily savings**: Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Since she spends 100 cents on lollipops, her daily savings are:

The change he has after buying the candy is \(10 - 1.5x\). 

Next, he spends half of this change on gumballs. The cost of each gumball is $0.05, and he buys 40 of them. So, the total cost of the gumballs is \(40 \times 0.05 = 2\). 

This means that half of his change is equal to $2. So, the total change he had after buying the candy is \(2 \times 2 = 4\). 

Now, we can set up the equation for the change he had after buying the candy:

382,"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we first need to determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Given that Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, and Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has:
\[2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos}\]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has:
\[80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos}\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

Axel's total silver pesos: \(50\)
Anna's total silver pesos: \(100\)
Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)

Axel's total gold pesos: \(80\)
Anna's total gold pesos: \(120\)
Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

383,"To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we first need to determine her total revenue and total cost, then find the profit, and finally divide the profit by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand.

1. **Total Revenue**: Millie sells each cup for $1. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, and she makes 3 pitchers, so she has a total of \(12 \times 3 = 36\) cups of lemonade. Therefore, her total revenue is \(36 \times $1 = $36\).

2. **Total Cost**: She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

3. **Profit**: Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, her profit is \( $36 - $18 = $18\).

4. **Hours Spent Running the Stand**: She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Since she has 36 cups in total, the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand is \(36 \div 4 = 9\) hours.

5. **Profit per Hour**: To find the profit per hour, divide the total profit by the number of hours she spends running the stand. So, her profit per hour is \( $18 \div 9 = $2\).

Carol spends:
- 4 hours writing a song
- \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \) hours recording it (half the time spent writing)
- 90 minutes editing it

First, let's convert all times to the same unit. Since the final answer needs to be in percentage, we'll convert hours to minutes for consistency. Remember, 1 hour = 60 minutes.

- Writing: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) minutes

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid per employee in May is:

$15/hour * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = $2400/month

Since there were 40 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in May is:

$2400/month * 40 employees = $96,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means that 1/4 * 40 employees = 10 employees left the company. So, the number of employees remaining in June is:

40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees

The total amount paid per employee in June is the same as in May, which is $2400/month. Therefore, the total amount paid to all employees in June is:

414,"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for one blouse and then multiply it by the number of blouses Misha picks out.

The discount rate is 30%, which can be written as 0.30 in decimal form. The regular price for each blouse is $20.

The discount amount for one blouse is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \text{Regular price} \times \text{Discount rate} \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$20 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$6 \]

So, the discounted price for one blouse is:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \text{Regular price} - \text{Discount amount} \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \$20 - \$6 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \$14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Discounted price} \times \text{Number of blouses} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$14 \times 4 \]

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 \div 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) apples.
4. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(15 \times 3 = 45\) apples.
5. The sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \(x\). 

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is \(30 + 15 + x\), and the total number of apples gathered by her sister is \(60 + 45\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is:

445,"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance the horse runs.
2. Determine how much hay the horse eats based on the distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the hay.
4. Subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse runs.
The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 2: Determine how much hay the horse eats based on the distance.
For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles:
\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay.
A bail of hay costs $3. Therefore, the cost of 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Cost of hay} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times \$3 \, \text{per bail} = \$24 \]

Step 4: Subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has.
Michael has six $5 bills, which total:
\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times \$5 = \$30 \]
After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:
\[ \text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Cost of hay} = \$30 - \$24 = \$6 \]

Therefore, Michael has $6 in change after he buys the hay.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. 

The cost of the soda is $3. 

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \(P\). 

So, the total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is \(12 + P + 3\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost when you buy the super ticket. 

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. So, the total cost of the super ticket with the popcorn and soda is \(20 + 1 = 21\).

You mentioned that by not buying the super ticket, you ended up saving $2. This means the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

So, we can set up the equation:

Simplifying the equation:

\[15 + P = 23\]

First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets:
- Each plane ticket costs $5000.

Since Tom and his wife are traveling together, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
- $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hotel:
- The normal price per day is $1500.
- The hotel is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend, so the increased cost is $1500 * 20% = $300.
- Therefore, the cost per day during the busy weekend is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
- $1800 * 3 = $5400.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the trip:
- The total cost is the sum of the plane tickets and the hotel cost.

2. Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days.
3. Divide the total consumption by the amount of oats in one bag to find out how many bags are needed.

Step 1: Daily consumption of oats for all horses
Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, each horse consumes:
\[5 \, \text{pounds/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 10 \, \text{pounds/day}\]

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption for all horses is:

1. **Current Weekly Bill:**
   - Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatts is \(12 \times 24 = 288\) kilowatts.
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.
   - Therefore, her current daily bill is \(288 \times 1.50 = \$432\).
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her current weekly bill is \(432 \times 7 = \$3024\).

2. **New Weekly Bill:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.

Next, we calculate the combined rate of 5 people working together. Since one person paints at a rate of 1/10 of a house per day, 5 people would paint at a rate of 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 of a house per day.

To paint a whole house, which is equivalent to 1 house, at a rate of 1/2 of a house per day, it would take 2 days for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

Since he wants to save $1125 in a month and he plans to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, we can divide the total monthly savings target into two equal parts for the first half and the second half.

Total monthly savings target = $1125

First half savings = Total monthly savings target / 2 = $1125 / 2 = $562.5

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can calculate the second half savings as follows:

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:** The alphabet has 26 letters. Writing it in full twice means she writes 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:** Half of the alphabet would be 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters. Writing this once means she writes an additional 13 letters.

3. **Rewriting everything she has already written:** This includes the 52 letters from step 1 and the 13 letters from step 2. So, she writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters again.

Now, let's add up all the letters she has written:

- From step 1: 52 letters

1. **James's Play Set**: We know that James has 80 toys.

2. **Jonathan's Goal**: Jonathan wants to have a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. So, the size of Jonathan's play set should be \(5 \times 80 = 400\) toys.

611,"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the additional funding for the remaining months.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000
   - Duration: 5 months

2. **Additional Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months.
   - The first 5 months are already covered, so we need to calculate the cost for the remaining \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - Each month after the first 5 took 50% more funding than the previous month. This means the cost for each month follows a geometric sequence where the common ratio is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\).

Let's calculate the total cost:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 5 months.**
\[ \text{Cost for first 5 months} = \$100,000 \times 5 = \$500,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months.**
- The cost for the 6th month is \( \$100,000 \times 1.5 \).
- The cost for the 7th month is \( \$100,000 \times 1.5^2 \).
- This pattern continues for 45 months.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[ S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \]
where \(S_n\) is the sum of the first \(n\) terms, \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms.

Here, \(a = \$100,000 \times 1.5\), \(r = 1.5\), and \(n = 45\).

\[ S_{45} = \frac{\$100,000 \times 1.5(1.5^{45} - 1)}{1.5 - 1} \]

Next, we determine the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week. Since there are 7 days in a week and 3 days have already been accounted for, there are \(7 - 3 = 4\) remaining days. On each of these days, the tow truck pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars. So, for the remaining days, the total is:
\[6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}\]

Finally, to find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the cars towed on the first three days to the cars towed on the remaining days:
\[30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}\]

628,"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to reach the minimum height requirement of 4 feet (or 48 inches) to ride the roller coaster, we can set up an equation based on his current height and his annual growth rate.

Let's denote the number of years it will take for Adam to reach the required height as \(y\).

Adam's current height is 40 inches, and he grows 2 inches a year. So, in \(y\) years, he will have grown \(2y\) inches.

The equation to represent Adam's height after \(y\) years is:
\[40 + 2y = 48\]

To solve for \(y\), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[2y = 48 - 40\]
\[2y = 8\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
\[y = \frac{8}{2}\]
\[y = 4\]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as \(t\) (in hours). 

Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour, and Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour. The relative speed between Tom and Bob is the difference in their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour. This is the speed at which the distance between Tom and Bob decreases.

Initially, Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Since the relative speed is 15 miles per hour, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the initial distance by the relative speed:

\[t = \frac{\text{Initial distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\]

635,"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his total cost exceeds $10 per class, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost that would allow him to continue taking the classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. 

Given that the total cost is $60 for 10 classes, we can find the cost per class by dividing the total cost by the number of classes:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

This means each class costs $6. To find out how many classes Manny can miss without exceeding the $10 per class limit, we need to calculate the total cost when he misses a certain number of classes and ensure it does not exceed $60. 

Let's denote the number of classes he can miss as \(x\). The total cost when he misses \(x\) classes is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 60 - 6x \]

To ensure the cost per class does not exceed $10, we set the cost per class to $10 and solve for \(x\):

\[ 60 - 6x = 10 \times 10 \]
\[ 60 - 6x = 100 \]
\[ -6x = 100 - 60 \]
\[ -6x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{-6} \]

However, the number of classes missed cannot be negative, indicating that Manny cannot miss any classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. Therefore, Manny can miss 0 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

659,"To find out how much more it costs for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we first calculate the cost of each mixture.

For the first mixture:
- Cost of almonds = $10 per pound * (1/2) pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts = $15 per pound * (1/3) pound = $5
- Total cost = $5 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $10

For the second mixture:
- Cost of almonds = $10 per pound * (1/5) pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts = $15 per pound * (1/3) pound = $5
- Total cost = $2 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $7

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = $10 (first mixture) - $7 (second mixture) = $3

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

660,"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as \(S\) and the number of geese as \(G\). We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20, and the total number of legs is 70.

The system of equations can be written as:

1. \(S + G = 20\) (the total number of animals)
2. \(4S + 2G = 70\) (the total number of legs)

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of \(S\), the number of sheep.

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:

\(2S + G = 35\)

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation:

\(2S + G - (S + G) = 35 - 20\)

This simplifies to:

724,"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we first need to calculate how many slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Each pizza had 12 slices, and there were 5 pizzas ordered in total (since Bryce and four of his friends each ordered one). So, the total number of slices is:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas, and the other two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. 

Let's calculate how many slices each group ate:

- Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas:
  \[ \text{Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends} = 3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

- The other two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas:
  \[ \text{Slices eaten by the other two friends} = 2 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, let's add the slices eaten by all the friends:

\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices were left:

\[ \text{Slices left} = 60 - 42 = 18 \]

725,"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

Given that the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, and the dog can eat the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = \( \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Cat's time} \)
Dog's time = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \) minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now that we have the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can calculate the average time:

Average time = \( \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} \)
Average time = \( \frac{30 + 20}{2} \) minutes
Average time = \( \frac{50}{2} \) minutes

There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows on students' cars is:
\[64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows/car} = 256 \text{ windows}\]

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows}\]

1. **Extra-small shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.

3. **Medium shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.

4. **Large shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(18 / 2 = 9\) students need size large.

5. **Extra-large shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Given that 20% of 50 people think that horse #2 will win, we calculate this as:

\[ 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think that horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think that horse #2 will win:

789,"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to determine the temperature during the night. 

Given that it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees during the night, Carson needs to heat the house up by:

Required heat = 32 degrees - 12 degrees
Required heat = 20 degrees

Given that each log of wood burns heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs Carson needs to burn as follows:

Number of logs = Required heat / Heat per log
Number of logs = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log
Number of logs = 4

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing during the night.

The final answer is: Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

She spends 2 hours a week on this activity. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month on writing songs.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on doing her makeup:
She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, on doing her makeup. This amounts to 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. Converting minutes to hours, we get 90 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 1.5 hours/week. Over a month, this amounts to 1.5 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 6 hours/month.

Now, let's calculate the time spent on filming TikTok videos:
She records 18 videos each week, each lasting 4 minutes. This amounts to 18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week. Converting minutes to hours, we get 72 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 1.2 hours/week. Over a month, this amounts to 1.2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 4.8 hours/month.

Finally, let's sum up all the time spent on these activities:

835,"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speeds, and the time taken to cross the highway. 

Given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.

Let's denote:
- The speed of a kangaroo as \(v\) (in units of distance per hour).
- The speed of a turtle as \(v/2\) (since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo).

The total distance to be covered is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. Let's denote this distance as \(D\).

For the kangaroos:
\[D = 3 \times v \times 18\]

For the turtles, since there are 4 of them and each travels at half the speed of a kangaroo:
\[D = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t\]

Where \(t\) is the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway.

Since the distance \(D\) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can equate the two expressions for \(D\):
\[3 \times v \times 18 = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[54v = 2v \times t\]

Dividing both sides by \(2v\) to solve for \(t\):

Number of white shirts with no collars = 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's find out how many floral shirts have no buttons. Since 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, we can calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons as follows:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
Number of floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we can find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
Difference = 30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

849,"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays of eggs he has. 

Given that each tray holds 30 eggs and the farmer has 900 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

900 eggs / 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

Next, we know that the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays * $2.5/tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75 from selling all the eggs.

2. **Cost of red food baskets with discount**: Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket of red food. So, the cost for each red food basket after the discount is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars. Since you buy 3 of these, the total cost for red food is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. **Total cost**: To find the total cost, we add the cost of the green food baskets to the cost of the red food baskets, which is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon. Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10 in total, so each pack of bacon costs:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{dollars} \]
Since Kelly bought 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for the chicken is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, so the total cost for the strawberries is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Lastly, we calculate the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{dollars} \]
Since Kelly bought 7 packs of apples, the total cost for the apples is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 10 \, \text{(bacon)} + 24 \, \text{(chicken)} + 12 \, \text{(strawberries)} + 14 \, \text{(apples)} = 60 \, \text{dollars} \]

Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left in her budget after buying all the items is:
\[ 65 - 60 = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

The final answer is Kelly has $5 left in her budget.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
883,"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to first subtract the duration of the encore from the total concert time. The total concert time is 65 minutes, and the encore is 15 minutes long. So, the time spent on the main concert part is:

65 minutes (total concert time) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes (main concert part)

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the main concert part's duration by 2:

Chimichangas made on Fridays = 2 * (Chimichangas made on Tuesdays or Wednesdays)
Chimichangas made on Fridays = 2 * 125
Chimichangas made on Fridays = 250

Now, to find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number made on each day:

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as \(x\) meters per second. According to the problem:

1. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so its speed is \(5x\) meters per second.
2. The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, which means its speed is \(x + 11x = 12x\) meters per second.

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[12x = 121\]

Solving for \(x\), we find:

\[x = \frac{121}{12} = 10.0833\]

Now, to find the speed of the whirligig, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

\[5x = 5 \times 10.0833 = 50.4165\]

894,"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we first need to determine how much she made from mowing lawns. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \(x\).

From the information given:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \(3x\) times.
- She mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \(5x\) times.

Given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and assuming the payment for mowing each lawn is constant, we can set up the equation based on the total payment for mowing lawns:
\[6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns}\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[6x + 18x + 30x = 54x\]

We know that Tasha made $80 in total, which includes both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the earnings from lemonade sales can be calculated as:
\[80 - 54x = \text{Earnings from lemonade sales}\]

To find \(x\), we need to solve the equation for \(x\):
\[54x = 80\]
\[x = \frac{80}{54}\]
\[x = \frac{40}{27}\]

Now, we can calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Since each student sold 10 lollipops and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ \text{Total lollipops sold} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \]

Given that each lollypop was sold for $0.8, the total revenue from selling the lollipops is:

Given that there are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool and the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is:

\[
\text{Initial amount in tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 \text{ gallons} = 5,000 \text{ gallons}

First, let's calculate the total cost of the movies he has already seen:

- 5 movies on Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times \$10 = \$50\)
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times \$7 = \$56\)

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:

- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times \$8 = \$16\)
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times \$2 = \$8\)

Now, let's sum up these expenses:

Total expenses = \( \$50 + \$56 + \$16 + \$8 = \$128 \)

Colby's monthly budget is $150, so let's subtract his total expenses from his budget to find out how much he has left:

Remaining budget = \( \$150 - \$128 = \$22 \)

Now, let's calculate how many movies he can see with the remaining budget. Since he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy on the last day, we need to subtract the cost of these items from his remaining budget:

Cost of popcorn and candy = \( \$8 + \$2 = \$10 \)

Remaining budget for movies = \( \$22 - \$10 = \$12 \)

Finally, let's calculate how many movies he can see with the remaining budget. Since tickets on Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, he can see:

Number of movies = \( \frac{\$12}{\$10} = 1.2 \)

Since he can't see a fraction of a movie, Colby can see 1 more movie on the last day of the month.

1. P + Pa + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years)
2. Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
3. P = Pa + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

From equation 2, we can express J in terms of Pa: J = Pa - 10.

Substituting J in equation 3, we get P = Pa + (Pa - 10), which simplifies to P = 2Pa - 10.

Now, substituting J and P in terms of Pa in equation 1, we have (2Pa - 10) + Pa + (Pa - 10) = 100. Simplifying this, we get 4Pa - 20 = 100, which leads to 4Pa = 120, and thus Pa = 30.

Knowing Pa, we can find J: J = Pa - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Produces 60 widgets per hour
- Runs 24 hours a day
- Operates for 30 days a month

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Produces 45 widgets per hour
- Runs 24 hours a day
- Operates for 30 days a month

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine:

For the Widgeteer 3000:

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. Each copy of the New York Times earns a 10% commission. Since each copy costs $5, the commission per copy is:

\[ \text{Commission per copy of NY Times} = 10\% \times \$5 = 0.10 \times \$5 = \$0.50 \]

For 6 copies, the total commission is:

\[ \text{Total commission from NY Times} = 6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. Each copy earns an 8% commission. Since each copy costs $15, the commission per copy is:

\[ \text{Commission per copy of WSJ} = 8\% \times \$15 = 0.08 \times \$15 = \$1.20 \]

For 10 copies, the total commission is:

\[ \text{Total commission from WSJ} = 10 \times \$1.20 = \$12.00 \]

Finally, to find the total commission Cayley earns, we add the two amounts together:

\[ \text{Total commission} = \$3.00 + \$12.00 = \$15.00 \]

The final answer is that Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00 from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \(M = D - 5\)
3. Deanna is 26: \(D = 26\)

First, we substitute the value of \(D\) into the second equation to find \(M\):

\[M = 26 - 5\]
\[M = 21\]

Now, we substitute the value of \(M\) into the first equation to find \(L\):

2. Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \(A + 20 - 10 = A + 10\) points.

We know the total points scored by all three is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[3A + 30 = 45\]

953,"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was supposed to sleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the extra time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a total of 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.

On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she was supposed to sleep from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes.

She was also sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 2 * 60 + 15 + 2 * 60 + 38 = 153 minutes.

So, the total time she spent not sleeping on her bed is 355 minutes (usual sleep time) - 5 minutes (early wake-up) + 153 minutes (sleepwalking) = 503 minutes.

Subtracting this from the total time she was supposed to sleep gives us the time she actually slept on her bed: 360 minutes (total sleep time) - 503 minutes (time not sleeping) = -143 minutes.

However, this result doesn't make sense as it indicates she spent more time not sleeping than she was supposed to. This discrepancy arises from the calculation method used. The correct approach should be to subtract the sleepwalking time and the extra wake-up time from the total sleep time.

They dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 on the second day, and 8 on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:

\[10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29\]

The problem states that by the end of the third day, there were four times as many holes as there were at the end of the first day. Since they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the third day (which is 29) confirms this condition.

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we need to determine how many holes there were by the end of the fourth day. Since the island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day, and we know there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:

Given:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Let's denote the number of episodes as \(E\). According to the information, there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of minutes per episode is 20. Therefore, the equation to represent the relationship between the number of episodes and the minutes per episode is:

   - He will be half the age of his dad. Let's denote his dad's age at that time as \(D\). So, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}D\). Solving for \(D\), we get \(D = 48\).

2. **When Emil turns 24:** 
   - He will be twice as old as his brother. Let's denote his brother's age at that time as \(B\). So, \(24 = 2B\). Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = 12\).

3. **Current ages:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old. So, when he turns 24, he will be 5 years in the future.
   - His dad's current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
   - His brother's current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

984,"To find out how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to calculate the total number of plants she needs and then multiply that by the cost of each plant.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed into inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[111 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 1332 \, \text{inches}\]

Next, we need to determine how much space each plant will take up, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space required for each plant (including the space between them) is:

\[12 \, \text{inches (for the plant)} + 18 \, \text{inches (for the space)} = 30 \, \text{inches}\]

Now, we can calculate how many plants can fit into the flower bed:

\[1332 \, \text{inches (total length of the bed)} \div 30 \, \text{inches (space per plant)} = 44.4\]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants into her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[44 \, \text{(total plants)} - 17 \, \text{(already owned)} = 27 \, \text{(additional plants)}\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost will be:

First, let's calculate the total temperature change caused by the air conditioner:

- On low, the air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour. It ran for 3 hours on low, so it cooled the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.
- Then, it was turned up to high, which cools the room by 3 degrees per hour. It ran for 4 hours on high, so it cooled the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

So, the total temperature change caused by the air conditioner is \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.

Next, let's calculate the total temperature change caused by the room warming up:

- The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour. It was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's find the net temperature change:

- The net temperature change is the total temperature change caused by the air conditioner minus the total temperature change caused by the room warming up. That is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

991,"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to understand the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, let's find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet for the second time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and his dad saw it when he was 30, we add 75 years to 30 to find out when he saw it the second time:

\[30 + 75 = 105\]

So, Bill's dad saw the comet for the second time when he was 105 years old.

Given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet for the second time, we calculate:

\[3 \times 105 = 315\]

This means Bill was 315 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years (the comet's orbital period) from 315:

\[315 - 75 = 240\]

1. **Electric bill**: Once per month
2. **Gas bill**: Once per month
3. **Church**: Twice per month

First, let's calculate the total number of checks for the monthly activities:

- Electric bill: 1 check/month
- Gas bill: 1 check/month
- Church: 2 checks/month

So, for the monthly activities, Buford writes \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\) checks per month.

Next, let's calculate the number of checks for the quarterly activity:

- Pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, there are \(12 / 3 = 4\) quarters in a year. Therefore, Buford writes \(4\) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up all the checks Buford writes in a year:

- Monthly checks: \(4\) checks/month \(\times 12\) months/year = \(48\) checks/year

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which means it goes to Greece for \(\frac{3}{4}F\) flights. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the remaining flights, which are \(\frac{1}{4}F\), are divided into two equal parts for flights to France and flights to Germany.

The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. This means the total number of flights the first plane makes is twice the number of flights the second plane makes, or \(2 \times 44 = 88\) flights.

Given that the remaining flights, which are \(\frac{1}{4}F\), are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, we can say that the number of flights to France is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F\).

Since the total number of flights the first plane makes is 88, we can find the number of flights to France by calculating \(\frac{1}{8} \times 88\).

2. **Yellow sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ \text{Total sticks} = \text{Red sticks} + \text{Blue sticks} + \text{Yellow sticks} \]
\[ \text{Total sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 \]
\[ \text{Total sticks} = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:

1. **Tank's capacity**: The tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons.

2. **First day's work**:
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water. So, Wanda pumped \(18,000 \times \frac{1}{4} = 4,500\) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped. So, Ms. B pumped \(4,500 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3,375\) gallons.

3. **Total water pumped on the first day**: \(4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875\) gallons.

4. **Second day's work**:
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. So, Wanda pumped \(4,500 \times \frac{2}{3} = 3,000\) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. So, Ms. B pumped \(3,375 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1,125\) gallons.

5. **Total water pumped on the second day**: \(3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125\) gallons.

1012,"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we can work backwards from the final charge. 

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \(x\). 

After 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge would be \(x - 5 \times 0.09x = x(1 - 0.45) = 0.55x\).

Then, for the next 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge would be \(0.55x - 3 \times 0.07 \times 0.55x = 0.55x(1 - 0.21) = 0.55x \times 0.79\).

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining was 28%, or \(0.28x\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[0.55x \times 0.79 = 0.28x\]

Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[0.4315x = 0.28x\]

\[0.4315x - 0.28x = 0\]

\[0.1515x = 0\]

\[x = \frac{0}{0.1515}\]

This equation doesn't make sense as it implies \(x = 0\), which is not the case. Let's correct the approach:

Given that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, we can work backwards to find the initial charge. 

After 5 hours, the charge was \(0.55x\), and after losing 7% each hour for the next 3 hours, it became 28% of the initial charge. 

Let's denote the charge after 5 hours as \(y\), so \(y = 0.55x\). 

After 3 hours of losing 7% each hour, the charge becomes \(y \times (1 - 0.07)^3\). 

We know that \(y \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28x\). 

Substituting \(y = 0.55x\), we get:

\[0.55x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28x\]

1. **Calculate total weekly earnings:**
   - Wages: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week
   - Tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
   - Total weekly earnings: $400 + $600 = $1000/week

2. **Calculate the amount she needs to save each week:**
   - She wants to save 20% of the $10000 car for a downpayment.
   - Downpayment amount: 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000
   - She needs to save $2000 in total, so the amount she needs to save each week is $2000 / number of weeks.

3. **Calculate the number of weeks needed to save the downpayment:**
   - Since she saves $1000 each week, the number of weeks needed to save $2000 is $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks.

1. **Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**

- **Easy questions:** 40% of 60 items = \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\) questions.
- **Average and difficult questions:** The rest of the questions = \(60 - 24 = 36\) questions. Since these are equally divided, there are \(36 / 2 = 18\) average questions and \(18\) difficult questions.

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to answer correctly:**

- **Easy questions:** 75% of 24 = \(0.75 \times 24 = 18\) questions.
- **Average questions:** Half of 18 = \(18 / 2 = 9\) questions.
- **Difficult questions:** Half of 18 = \(18 / 2 = 9\) questions.

1022,"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as \(S\) and the number of large stuffed animals sold as \(L\). We are given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \(S = 2L\).

Each small stuffed animal costs $4, and each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, which is \(3 \times 4 = $12\).

The total earnings from the sales are $120. We can express this total earnings as the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals:

\[4S + 12L = 120\]

Substituting \(S = 2L\) into the equation:

\[4(2L) + 12L = 120\]

Simplifying:

\[8L + 12L = 120\]

\[20L = 120\]

Dividing both sides by 20:

\[L = 6\]

2. **Probability of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension:** 40% or 0.4.

3. **Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate his assignment:** 20% or 0.2.

To find the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework, we multiply the probabilities of each of these independent events happening:

\[ P(\text{No homework turned in}) = P(\text{Substitute}) \times P(\text{Extension}) \times P(\text{Dog ate it}) \]

\[ P(\text{No homework turned in}) = 0.5 \times 0.4 \times 0.2 \]

First, let's calculate the total cost of the loans:
\[ \text{Total cost of loans} = 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had continued working:
\[ \text{Income per year before college} = \$25,000 \]
\[ \text{Total income lost} = 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the income lost:
\[ \text{Total amount to earn} = \text{Total cost of loans} + \text{Total income lost} = \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$300,000 \]

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.
   - Twin beds require 2 sheets each (one for each side), so for 4 twin beds, he uses \(4 \times 2 = 8\) sheets.
   - A king size bed requires 2 sheets, so for 1 king size bed, he uses \(1 \times 2 = 2\) sheets.
   - Therefore, in total, Greg uses \(8 + 2 = 10\) sheets per week.

2. **Calculate the number of loads per week:**
   - His washing machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.
   - Since he uses 8 twin sheets and 2 king sheets per week, he needs to wash all 10 sheets in one load because the machine can't wash the sheets separately (assuming he can't wash the sheets in parts).
   - Therefore, Greg does 1 load of laundry per week.

3. **Calculate the number of loads in a year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

From the information given:
1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \(\frac{1}{4}M\), and she was left with \(M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{3}{4}M\).
2. Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \(\frac{1}{3}R\), and she was left with \(R - \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}R\).

We know that after spending, both Maggie and Riza had $60 left. Therefore, we can write:
- For Maggie: \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\)
- For Riza: \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\)

\[10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}\]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:

1083,"To find out how much Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

1. **Cost of buying bananas individually:**

   Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. So, she buys a total of \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

   The cost of one banana when bought individually is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost of buying 40 bananas individually is \(40 \times 0.80 = \$32.00\).

2. **Cost of buying bananas in bunches:**

   Each bunch costs $3.00, and Jenny buys 10 bunches. So, the total cost of buying bananas in bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = \$30.00\).

3. **Calculating the savings:**

   The savings can be found by subtracting the total cost of buying bananas in bunches from the total cost of buying them individually. 

   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost of buying individually} - \text{Cost of buying in bunches}

Given that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, Marcel sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes. 

15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so Marcel sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes. 

The remaining bikes were MTB type, so Marcel sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes. 

Now, we can calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * ($500/2) = $45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Adding these amounts together, Marcel earned $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

1088,"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has in a week. A normal student has 6 periods per day, and John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he has a total of 8 * 5 = 40 periods in a week.

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class is 40 periods * 40 minutes = 1600 minutes.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday for extra learning time. Since there are 168 hours in a week (24 hours * 7 days), the total number of minutes in a week is 168 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes.

The extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes.

So, the total time John spends learning in a week is the time spent in class plus the extra learning time, which is 1600 minutes + 630 minutes = 2230 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), so John spends 2230 minutes / 60 = 37.1667 hours learning in a week.

Rounded to two decimal places, John spends approximately 37.17 hours learning in a week.

Let's denote the original amount of meat on the triceratops as \(M\).

1. After the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, there was \(\frac{1}{2}M\) left.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they ate \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}M = \frac{1}{4}M\), leaving \(\frac{1}{2}M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{1}{4}M\) of the original amount.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \(\frac{1}{4}M = 270\) kilograms.

To find \(M\), we solve the equation:

1122,"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers in their 10-hour shift.

The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour each will produce:
\[6 \, \text{toys/hour} \times 2 \, \text{workers} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{toys}\]

The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour each will produce:
\[4 \, \text{toys/hour} \times 2 \, \text{workers} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{toys}\]

So, the total number of toys produced by these four workers is:
\[120 \, \text{toys} + 80 \, \text{toys} = 200 \, \text{toys}\]

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by all four workers is:
\[400 \, \text{toys} - 20 \, \text{toys} = 380 \, \text{toys}\]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produced, we subtract the total produced by the other four workers from this number:
\[380 \, \text{toys} - 200 \, \text{toys} = 180 \, \text{toys}\]

Since this is the total produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours, to find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide by 10:

3. \(C = S + 12\) (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)
4. \(A + M + C + S = 56\) (They painted 56 eggs in total)

From 3, we can substitute \(C\) in 2 to get \(S + 12 + S = 30\), which simplifies to \(2S + 12 = 30\). Solving for \(S\), we get \(2S = 18\), so \(S = 9\).

Knowing \(S = 9\), we can find \(C\) using 3: \(C = 9 + 12 = 21\).

Since \(A = M\) and \(A + M + C + S = 56\), we can substitute \(C\) and \(S\) to find \(A\): \(A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\), which simplifies to \(2A + 30 = 56\). Solving for \(A\), we get \(2A = 26\), so \(A = 13\).

1. **Calculate the number of boxes:**

Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total crayons}}{\text{Crayons per box}} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

2. **Calculate the weight of the crayons:**

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

3. **Calculate the weight of the boxes:**

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he has 25 boxes. So, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Weight per box} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

4. **Calculate the total weight in ounces:**

\[ \text{Total weight in ounces} = \text{Weight of crayons} + \text{Weight of boxes} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

5. **Convert the total weight to pounds:**

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the weight in pounds:

Let's denote:
- \(v_b\) as Grandma's speed on the beach (in miles per minute),
- \(v_s\) as Grandma's speed on the sidewalk (in miles per minute),
- \(t_b\) as the time spent walking on the beach (in minutes),
- \(t_s\) as the time spent walking on the sidewalk (in minutes),
- \(d_b\) as the distance walked on the beach (in miles),
- \(d_s\) as the distance walked on the sidewalk (in miles).

Given:
- \(d_b = 2\) miles,
- \(d_s = 1\) mile,
- \(t_b = 40\) minutes,
- \(v_s = 2v_b\) (since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk).

We know that \(d = v \times t\), so:
- \(2 = v_b \times t_b\),
- \(1 = v_s \times t_s\).

Substituting \(v_s = 2v_b\) into the second equation gives:
- \(1 = 2v_b \times t_s\).

From the first equation, we can express \(v_b\) as:
- \(v_b = \frac{2}{t_b}\).

Substituting \(v_b\) into the equation for \(v_s\) gives:
- \(v_s = 2 \times \frac{2}{t_b}\).

Now, we need to find \(t_s\):
- \(1 = 2 \times \frac{2}{t_b} \times t_s\),
- \(1 = \frac{4}{t_b} \times t_s\),
- \(t_s = \frac{t_b}{4}\).

Given \(t_b = 40\) minutes:
- \(t_s = \frac{40}{4} = 10\) minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent walking:

1138,"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of animals Melanie's father receives from Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited over the three weeks, and then add these to the initial number of cows and chickens.

First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, let's calculate the number of cows and chickens Melanie's father receives from Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited over the three weeks:

Cows from Milkie Cows Limited:
20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Chickens from Broilers Limited:
10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add these to the initial number of cows and chickens:

Initial cows: 50
Cows from Milkie Cows Limited: 420
Total cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Initial chickens: 20
Chickens from Broilers Limited: 210
Total chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:

1139,"To find the cost per single bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount, then apply the discount, and finally divide the total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**

   Each pack costs $10.00 and there are 4 packs ordered, so the total cost before discount is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00
   \]

2. **Apply the 10% discount:**

   A 10% discount on the total cost means the customer pays 90% of the total cost. So, the total cost after discount is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \$40.00 \times 0.90 = \$36.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bagels:**

   Each pack contains 9 bagels, and 4 packs are ordered, so the total number of bagels is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost per single bagel after discount:**

   The total cost after discount is $36.00, and there are 36 bagels, so the cost per single bagel is:

1. **Finding out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - It's given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - So, Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. **Finding out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes:**
   - It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - So, it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Finding out how many potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Since Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, we need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops.
   - Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, Gomer ate \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

In the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day, so he eats \(5 \times 30 = 150\) eggs. 

Adding these together, Chester eats \(90 + 150 = 240\) eggs in 60 days. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens he needs: \(240 \div 12 = 20\) dozens.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is 5x + 9x = 14x. 

We know the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation 14x = 84. Solving for x, we get x = 84 / 14 = 6. 

Now, we can find the initial number of women on the bus by multiplying the multiplier x by the ratio for women: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54. 

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is the initial number of women minus the number that left: 54 - 20 = 34.

1145,"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we first need to determine how many sunflowers he sold per day. 

From the sunflower sales, he earned $26 per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day from the individual sunflowers.

From the bouquet sales, he earned $56 per day. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so we divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet to find out how many bouquets he sold:

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, we multiply the number of bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers were sold in bouquets:

7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day in bouquets.

Now, we add the number of sunflowers sold individually to the number sold in bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:

13 sunflowers/day (individual) + 84 sunflowers/day (bouquets) = 97 sunflowers per day.

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers were sold after 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers after 3 days.

1. **Cost of rocks**: Adam buys rocks for $5 each. Let's assume he buys \(x\) rocks. The total cost is \(5x\).

2. **Revenue from selling 60% of inventory**: He sells 60% of his inventory. If he buys \(x\) rocks, he sells \(0.6x\) rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so the revenue is \(7 \times 0.6x = 4.2x\).

3. **Loss calculation**: The loss is the difference between the cost and the revenue. So, the loss is \(5x - 4.2x = 0.8x\).

Since Adam invests all his $100 in the rock stand, we need to find out how many rocks (\(x\)) he can buy with $100. Given that each rock costs $5, he can buy \(x = \frac{100}{5} = 20\) rocks.

Since each juice bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, we need 5 bottles to cover 100% of the needs for one person. For 2300 people, this would be 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles. 

Given that Hortex can produce 4200 bottles a day, to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand, we subtract the current daily production from the total required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles. 

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce an additional 7300 bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. The answer is: 7300 bottles.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
1159,"To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to calculate the proportion of purple-wearing babies who also wear bows, relative to all babies who wear bows.

Let's denote:
- The total number of babies as \(T = 8\).
- The number of babies dressed in purple as \(P = \frac{3}{4}T\).
- The number of babies dressed in blue as \(B = \frac{1}{4}T\).

Given that:
- \(1/3\) of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearing babies who wear bows is \(\frac{1}{3}P\).
- All blue-wearing babies also wear bows, so the number of blue-wearing babies who wear bows is \(B\).

The total number of babies who wear bows is the sum of purple-wearing babies who wear bows and blue-wearing babies who wear bows:
\[ \text{Total bows} = \frac{1}{3}P + B \]

Substituting \(P\) and \(B\) with their expressions in terms of \(T\):
\[ \text{Total bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4}T + \frac{1}{4}T \]
\[ \text{Total bows} = \frac{1}{4}T + \frac{1}{4}T \]
\[ \text{Total bows} = \frac{1}{2}T \]

The number of purple-wearing babies who wear bows is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}P = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4}T = \frac{1}{4}T \]

The percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the proportion of purple-wearing babies who wear bows to the total number of babies who wear bows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}T}{\frac{1}{2}T} \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 50\% \]

   - So, he earned $50 from this sale.

2. **Second Sale**: He sold another 1/4 of his land for $30.
   - A quarter of 80 square meters is \(80 \times \frac{1}{4} = 20\) square meters.

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week.
3. Calculate the total money he makes in a week.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:
\[200 + 200 = 400\] apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes, so it has:
\[400 \times 0.60 = 240\] more apartments than the combined total of the first two complexes.

Therefore, the last complex has:
\[400 + 240 = 640\] apartments.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week

John collects garbage from each place 3 times a week. So, the total number of collections per week is:
\[3 \times 3 = 9\] collections.

The total number of apartments he collects garbage from is the sum of the apartments in all three complexes:
\[400 + 640 = 1040\] apartments.

### Step 3: Calculate the total money he makes in a week

John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, the total money he makes in a week is:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, so \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(F\). So, an 8-year-old tree produces \(F - 200\) fruits.

5. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, so \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Given that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, we can set up the equation:
\[F - 200 = 1000\]
Solving for \(F\), we get:
\[F = 1000 + 200 = 1200\]

Now, let's sum up the fruits produced by each age group:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits (since it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old)
- 10-year-old: 1200 fruits

From the given information, we have:

1. \(R = 4B\) (The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope)
2. \(B = Y - 7\) (The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
3. \(R + B + Y = 37\) (The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters)

First, we substitute \(R\) and \(B\) in terms of \(Y\) into the third equation:

\[4B + B + Y = 37\]

Since \(B = Y - 7\), we substitute \(B\) in the equation:

\[4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 20 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 960 \, \text{square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

1176,"To find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk before recycling it, we need to calculate the total amount of chalk used on Monday and then determine how long the remaining chalk will last if the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.

Let's assume the original length of the chalk is 5 inches. On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, which means he used \(5 \times 0.45 = 2.25\) inches of chalk.

After using 45% of the chalk on Monday, the remaining length is \(5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

Now, if the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to reduce to 2 inches or less.

Let \(x\) be the number of days it takes for the chalk to reduce to 2 inches or less. The remaining length of the chalk after \(x\) days can be represented as \(2.75 \times (0.8)^x\), where 0.8 represents the remaining 80% of the chalk after each day.

We want to find \(x\) when the remaining length is 2 inches or less, so we set up the inequality:

\[2.75 \times (0.8)^x \leq 2\]

To solve for \(x\), we can take the logarithm of both sides:

\[\log(2.75 \times (0.8)^x) \leq \log(2)\]

Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this to:

\[x \cdot \log(0.8) \leq \log(2) - \log(2.75)\]

\[x \geq \frac{\log(2) - \log(2.75)}{\log(0.8)}\]

Calculating the right side:

\[x \geq \frac{\log(2) - \log(2.75)}{\log(0.8)} \approx \frac{-0.58496 - (-0.43136)}{-0.09691} \approx \frac{-0.1536}{-0.09691} \approx 1.58\]

Since \(x\) represents the number of days, and we can't have a fraction of a day in this context, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us \(x = 2\) days.

1185,"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate how many slices of each type of pizza her friends eat in total, and then we divide by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas she needs to buy.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total slices consumed are:
- Cheese pizza: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices
- Pepperoni pizza: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) slices

Given that a cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and a pepperoni pizza into 8 slices, we calculate the number of pizzas needed for each type:

For cheese pizza:
- \(36 \div 12 = 3\) cheese pizzas

For pepperoni pizza:
- \(24 \div 8 = 3\) pepperoni pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) pizza pies.

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

To find out how long it takes to build 60 snowballs at this net rate, we divide the total number of snowballs by the number of snowballs built per hour:

1188,"To find out how old Jim is, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote John's age when Digimon came out as \(J\) and Jim's age as \(I\). According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, so we can write:

\[J = 2I\]

We also know that John is 28 now. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means that 20 years have passed since Digimon came out. Therefore, John's age when Digimon came out was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old. So, \(J = 8\).

Substituting \(J = 8\) into the equation \(J = 2I\), we get:

\[8 = 2I\]

Solving for \(I\), we divide both sides by 2:

\[I = \frac{8}{2} = 4\]

Therefore, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, and assuming the same time has passed for Jim, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50.
2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:

First day: 38 bandages
Second day: 28 bandages
Third day: 25 bandages

Total bandages used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day:

They ordered one bulk pack on the first day, which is 50 bandages. They ordered two bulk packs on the third day, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. So, the total number of bandages they had at the start was:

Total bandages at the start = 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) + 78 (left at the end of the third day) = 228 bandages

To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to subtract the total number of bandages used over the three days from the total number of bandages they had at the start:

Bandages started with on the first day = Total bandages at the start - Total bandages used
Bandages started with on the first day = 228 - 91 = 137 bandages

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, with the deal being ""buy one get one 50% off."" The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price:
\[ \text{Cost of first T-shirt} = \$8 \]

For the second T-shirt, he gets a 50% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on second T-shirt} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.5 \times \$8 = \$4 \]

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so \(D = 4\) miles. Therefore, Aaron ran \(4/2 = 2\) miles.

Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can find Aaron's speed as follows:

1316,"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, and he gets an 80% discount. 

80% of $400 is calculated as \(400 \times 0.80 = 320\).

So, the discount amount is $320. 

The cost of the radiator after the discount is \(400 - 320 = 80\).

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic charges $50 an hour for 3 hours of work.

The labor cost is \(50 \times 3 = 150\).

Finally, to find the total amount Mark paid, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost together:

Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost = $80 + $150 = $230.

### Mark paid $230.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}
1317,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \(C\) and the number of cows as \(K\). We know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. We have two equations based on the given information:

1. \(C + K = 20\) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \(2C + 4K = 70\) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and together they have 70 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2, which gives us \(C + 2K = 35\).

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this simplified second equation:

\(C + 2K - (C + K) = 35 - 20\)

This simplifies to:

\(K = 15\)

Knowing that \(K = 15\), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \(C\):

\(C + 15 = 20\)

So, \(C = 5\).

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
