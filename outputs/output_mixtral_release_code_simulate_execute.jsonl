Initialize a 2D list `bell` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` and set all elements to `0`. Set `bell[0][0]` to `1`.\n2. For each `i` in the range `[1, n]`, set `bell[i][0]` to `bell[i-1][i-1]`.\n3.

Return `bell[n][0]`.\n\nApplying these steps to `n = 56`, we get:\n\n1. Initialize `bell` and set `bell[0][0]` to `1`.\n2.

Calculate the result of the function using the returned values from the recursive calls:\n   - Multiply `(n - m)` with the result of the first recursive call `eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)`. As a result, we have `(2 - 1) * 1 = 1`.\n   - Multiply `(m + 1)` with the result of the second recursive call `eulerian_num(n - 1, m)`. As a result, we have `(1 + 1) * eulerian_num(1, 1) = 2 * eulerian_num(1, 1)`.\n6. Calculate the result of the second recursive call `eulerian_num(1, 1)` using the same steps as before.\n7. Return the final result `1 + 2 * eulerian_num(1, 1)`.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of `eulerian_num(1, 1)`:\n\n1. The function `eulerian_num` is called with arguments `n = 1` and `m = 1`.\n2. Check the first condition `(m >= n or n == 0)`. Since `m` is not greater than or equal to `n` and `n` is not equal to `0`, we proceed to the next condition.\n3. Check the second condition `(m == 0)`. Since `m` is not equal to `0`, we proceed to the calculation part of the function.\n4. Calculate the recursive calls:\n   - For the first recursive call `eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)`, we call the function with arguments `n - 1 = 0` and `m - 1 = 0`.\n   - For the second recursive call `eulerian_num(n - 1, m)`, we call the function with arguments `n - 1 = 0` and `m = 1`.\n5. Calculate the result of the function using the returned values from the recursive calls:\n   - Multiply `(n - m)` with the result of the first recursive call `eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)`. As a result, we have `(1 - 1) * 1 = 0`.\n   - Multiply `(m + 1)` with the result of the second recursive call `eulerian_num(n - 1, m)`. Since `n - 1 = 0`, the first condition `(m >= n or n == 0)` is true and we return `0`.\n6. As a result, the first recursive call `eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)` returns `0`.\n7. Return the final result `0 + 2 * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) = 0`.\n\nNow, let's go back to the calculation of `eulerian_num(3, 1)`:\n\n1. The second recursive call `eulerian_num(2, 1)` returns `1 + 2 * eulerian_num(2, 1) = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1`.\n2. Return the final result `2 + 2 * eulerian_num(2, 1) = 2 + 2 * 1 = 4`.\n\nSo the final result is\n<ans>\n4\n</ans>", "format_properties": {}}
