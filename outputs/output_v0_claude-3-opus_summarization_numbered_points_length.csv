1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems with asymmetric periodic potentials, are not well understood. There is interest in these systems due to their potential for extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems. Recent attention has focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic and Hamiltonian ratchets. The behavior of these nonlinear systems is sensitively dependent on initial conditions and system parameters, leading to complicated phase-space structures.

2. Changes in parameters can significantly alter the phase-space structure, including merging or breaking apart of stability islands, changes in the chaotic sea, and bifurcations of attractors. This leads to dramatic changes in transport properties. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model and showed that the current direction could reverse depending on the forcing amplitude, and conjectured a connection between current reversal and a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior. However, Barbi and Salerno argued this was not universally valid, presenting results showing current reversals without such bifurcations.

3. Barbi and Salerno based their arguments on the behavior of a single particle, implicitly assuming ergodicity which is not generally true for the chaotic systems being considered. The dynamics can have extreme dependence on the ensemble statistics, as pointed out in earlier studies. This is particularly relevant for experimental validation, as experiments are conducted over finite time and ensembles. The authors therefore study the properties of current in the same deterministic ratchet system, considering the impact of different particle ensembles and the importance of discarding transients.

4. The authors emphasize that broad heuristics are rare in chaotic systems, making it critical to understand ensemble-dependence in studies of chaotic ratchet transport properties. They then discuss the connection between the bifurcation diagram for individual particles and the current behavior. While disagreeing with some details of Barbi and Salerno's results, they find it is indeed possible to have current reversals without bifurcations from chaos to periodic behavior, and vice versa. However, they find evidence for a generalized version of Mateos's conjecture - bifurcations for trajectory dynamics seem generally",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 32}"

1. We investigated six extrasolar planetary systems with highly eccentric planets using dynamical simulations and observational data.
2. The six systems studied were HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B.
3. Observations from McDonald Observatory and published data were combined to derive updated Keplerian orbital solutions for the known planets.
4. Test particle simulations were performed to determine regions where additional planets could remain in stable orbits.
5. No evidence was found for additional planets in any of the six systems based on examination of the residuals to the orbit fits.
6. Dynamical simulations showed that for some systems, test particles could remain in stable orbits in protected resonance regions.
7. Detection limits were computed to place constraints on the masses of additional planets that could exist in the stable regions.

1. This paper studies the rare Z-decays Z→Aγ, Z→AAA, and Z→AA in the Type-II 2HDM, Lepton-specific 2HDM, NMSSM, and nMSSM models, which predict a light CP-odd Higgs boson A. In the allowed parameter space, the branching ratios can reach 10^-5 for Z→Aγ, 10^-8 for Z→AAA, and 10^-6 for Z→AA, making the first two decays potentially observable at the GigaZ option. Different models predict different branching ratios, allowing them to be distinguished by measuring these rare decays.

2. The Type-II 2HDM predicts the largest ratio for Z→Aγ, varying from 10^-7 to 10^-5, due to the enhanced AZγ coupling. The L2HDM predicts the largest rate for Z→AAA, reaching 10^-5 in the optimal case, while the other three models predict rates at least one order of magnitude smaller. The decay Z→AA may have the largest branching ratio among the exotic Z decays, reaching 10^-6 in the optimal cases of the Type-II 2HDM, L2HDM, and NMSSM.

3. In the NMSSM, the intermediate state h_i in Z→AA may be on-shell, leading to large Z→AA branching ratios, while this seems impossible in the nMSSM. Therefore, Z→AA may help distinguish the NMSSM from the nMSSM if supersymmetry is found at the LHC and Z→AA is observed at the GigaZ with a large rate. In the nMSSM, the Higgs boson A may be lighter than 1 GeV without conflicting with low-energy data, and the largest branching ratio comes from Z→Aγ→μ+μ-γ, which can reach 10^-5.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartner particles, which should have masses below the TeV range to maintain naturalness. The mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology.

2. The no-scale type Kähler potential, in which the hidden and observable sectors are separated, is investigated. In this scenario, scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish, and the only source of SUSY breaking is gaugino masses. This leads to a highly predictive scenario with suppressed flavor-changing neutral currents.

3. Phenomenological aspects of the no-scale scenario are investigated, focusing on the mass spectrum for three cases: universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale, and non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale. Constraints from direct searches, cosmology, the lightest Higgs mass, and the branching ratio for b → sγ are considered. The minimal scenario with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale is severely constrained, while the other two scenarios have larger allowed parameter regions.

4. The Higgs mass bound and b → sγ constraint are important when the higgsino-like neutralino is the LSP in the non-universal gaugino mass scenario. Combining these constraints with direct search limits and cosmological bounds, the minimal scenario is almost completely excluded, while the scenarios with boundary conditions above the GUT scale or non-universal gaugino masses still have allowed regions. The wino LSP and sneutrino LSP cases are less constrained, but the small mass differences between the LSP and parent particles may require unusual acceptance cuts at colliders.

1. The paper analyzes the stability of quasiregular (QR) singularities in the collision of cross-polarized electromagnetic (EM) plane waves, known as the CPBS spacetime.
2. QR singularities are the mildest type of singularities and occur on the null boundaries of the interaction region in the CPBS spacetime.
3. The stability of QR singularities is tested using the Helliwell-Konkowski (HK) conjecture by adding test EM fields, scalar fields, and null dust to the CPBS background.
4. For test EM fields, the conjecture predicts QR singularities will become non-scalar curvature singularities, but fails to predict the correct singularity nature in the interaction region.
5. For test scalar fields, the conjecture correctly predicts QR singularities will become scalar curvature singularities, which is confirmed by an exact back-reaction solution.
6. For test null dust, the conjecture predicts the Cauchy horizon will become a scalar curvature singularity, which is confirmed by an exact back-reaction solution.
7. The paper presents a new exact solution for the collision of cross-polarized EM waves coupled with a scalar field, which represents the back-reaction to the test scalar field.
8. An exact back-reaction solution for colliding null shells in the CPBS background is also given, showing the horizon becomes a singularity even for a single shell.

1. X-ray studies of normal galaxies have been extended to cosmologically interesting distances in the Chandra Deep Field (CDF) surveys, reaching 1 Ms of exposure. Galaxies with L_X < 10^42 erg/s are detected in appreciable numbers at 0.5-2 keV fluxes below 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1. These normal galaxies contribute 5-10% of the X-ray background (XRB) flux in the 0.5-2 keV band. The CDF-N survey has reached the depths necessary to detect many normal L_X < 10^42 erg/s galaxies to z ~ 1.

2. The authors estimate the X-ray emission of galaxies at z ~ 0.4-1.5 using stacking techniques on the CDF-N survey data. They focus on this redshift range due to extensive spectroscopic redshift coverage and superb HST imaging allowing a comprehensive galaxy morphology study. Spectroscopic redshifts are used for 0.4 < z < 0.75, while photometric redshifts are used for 0.5 < z < 1.5. The authors attempt to construct a sample of galaxies similar to spiral galaxies in the local universe.

X-ray imaging data at each galaxy position are stacked, keeping pixels within a 1.5"" radius aperture.

1. The paper considers bipartite quantum correlations between two spatially separated parties, Alice and Bob. Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with degrees ranging from non-separability (entanglement) to Bell-nonlocality. In between lies EPR-steering, where one party can steer the state of the other party's system.

2. The paper investigates EPR-steerability for two-qubit states with maximally mixed reduced states, known as T-states. The steering ellipsoid formalism is used to develop a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for projective measurements on these states. The authors conjecture this model is optimal.

3. Two sufficient conditions for T-states to be EPR-steerable are obtained via EPR-steering inequalities. These conditions touch the necessary condition from the LHS model in some regions, with a small gap elsewhere. The paper aims to determine the EPR-steerable boundary for T-states.

4. EPR-steering is demonstrated if the joint probability distributions of measurement outcomes cannot be explained by a local hidden state model for one party. This is a form of quantum nonlocality intermediate between Bell-nonlocality and non-separability. The steering ellipsoid provides a geometric representation of the set of states to which one party's qubit can be steered.

5. For T-states, the authors construct a deterministic LHS model that reproduces the steering scenario, with the steered states lying on the surface of the quantum steering ellipsoid. The model depends on the harmonic mean radius of the steering ellipsoid matrix and provides a necessary condition for EPR-steerability. Comparison with sufficient conditions suggests the model may be optimal.

6. The first sufficient condition for EPR-steerability is derived from a linear steering inequality involving the spin covariance matrix. The second sufficient condition comes from a nonlinear steering inequality. Both conditions are stronger than the necessary condition from the LHS model in some parameter regions.

2. In 1994, a scheme for realizing a universal NAND logic gate using three exchange-coupled electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots was proposed.
3. However, the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction prevents unidirectional flow of logic signals in these devices, leading to metastable states that produce incorrect outputs.
4. A proposed solution to enforce unidirectionality is to use a three-phase clock with gate pads between quantum dots, but this presents fabrication challenges and negates the low-power advantage of spintronic devices.
5. Reversible quantum logic gates using exchange-coupled spins have been proposed to overcome the Landauer limit on energy dissipation in irreversible logic gates.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The observed orbital period distribution of CVs shows a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes, which theoretical models have been unable to reproduce precisely. This paper investigates ways to increase the minimum period by increasing the mass transfer rate through consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) and to ""hide"" the spike in the distribution by introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population.

2. Calculations of the long-term evolution of CVs show that the minimum period increases with increasing CAML efficiency, up to a maximum of around 70 minutes. The tidal deformation of the secondary, as suggested by 3D simulations, can also increase the minimum period, but a large deformation factor of around 1.18 is required to raise it to the observed value of 77 minutes. The authors also consider the possibility that CVs may die or fade before reaching the period bounce, becoming undetectable.

3. The authors test the statistical significance of the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the period minimum (the ""period spike"") by calculating period distributions of model populations for various assumptions about evolutionary parameters. They find that none of the synthesized model populations fits as well as a distribution that is simply flat in orbital period. Models designed to ""wash out"" the period spike by introducing a large spread of CAML efficiency generally perform better than those based on donor stars with a large spread of intrinsic deformation factors.

1. Powerful H2 emission was detected by Spitzer in the Stephan's Quintet galaxy group, representing a fraction of the group-wide warm H2 that dominates the mid-infrared emission. There is evidence for another shock-excited feature called the ""H2 bridge"" between the main shock and NGC 7319, likely a remnant of past tidal interactions.

2. The global L(H2)/LX-ray ratio in the main shock is >3, confirming that mid-IR H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-ray emission over the shock structures. This modifies the traditional view that X-rays dominate cooling at later stages of compact group evolution.

3. Infrared ionic lines are interpreted as fast (100-300 km/s) ionizing shocks, and comparison between NeII, NeIII, SIII and FeII line intensities implies that silicon and iron are depleted onto dust. This suggests dust is not destroyed in the shock.

4. Star formation in Stephan's Quintet is dominated by SQ-A and 7318b-south, located at the ends of the radio shock ridge, suggesting they are shock triggered starbursts. However, regions dominated by warm H2 emission exhibit very low star formation rates, consistent with a turbulent model where H2 is reheated and cool clouds are too short-lived to collapse.

5. The projected coexistence of SIII and H2 produced by 200 km/s and 20 km/s velocity shocks, respectively, is observed. The results are consistent with a model of a multiphase postshock medium produced by a galaxy-wide collision.

The warm H2 emission cooling pathway observed in Stephan's Quintet is a significant mechanism in shock systems, potentially crucial in systems ranging from ULIRGs to radio galaxies to supernova remnants.

1. The spectra of type 1 AGN show broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of gas near the central black hole. Two populations of type 1 AGN have been identified based on the widths of the broad H-beta emission line: population A with FWHM H-beta of 1000-4000 km/s and population B with FWHM H-beta of 4000-12000 km/s. Narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are usually regarded as a reliable measure of the AGN rest frame, except in the case of ""blue outliers"" that show large [OIII] blueshifts. Broad FeII emission is almost ubiquitous in high S/N spectra of type 1 quasars and appears to arise from the same region as other low ionization lines like H-beta.

2. A recent study by Hu et al. 2008 (H08) claimed to find evidence for a systematic redshift of FeII emission relative to [OIII] in a majority of type 1 quasars, which they interpreted as FeII emission arising from inflowing gas at larger radii than the H-beta emitting region.

1. Nuclear multifragmentation is being intensely studied theoretically and experimentally to search for signs of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter, similar to the nucleon-nucleon interaction and van der Waals forces. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve by the ALADIN group in 1995 identified a wide plateau at around 5 MeV temperature lasting from 3 to 10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy, associated with a possible liquid-gas phase transition. Similar experiments by EOS and INDRA groups followed, obtaining slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region absent in most cases. Discrepancies are attributed to precision of experimental measurements and finite-size effects of the caloric curve manifested through the dependency of equilibrated sources on reaction type.

2. Recent reevaluations by the ALADIN group brought corrections of about 10% to kinetic energies of emitted neutrons for the Au+Au reaction at 600 MeV/nucleon. More importantly, it was proven that energies of spectator parts grow by approximately 30% in the 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon bombarding energy interval. The universality of the quantity subject to bombarding energy variation, theoretically proven to be a signature of statistical equilibrium, suggests that the equilibrated sources sequence should be the same for these reactions. This implies a significant nonequilibrium part is included in measured source excitation energies, possibly from pre-equilibrium or pre-break-up stages.

3. SMM calculations suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even for the 600 MeV/nucleon bombarding energy reaction. Accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and sequential secondary particle emission are necessary to distinguish between equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of measured excitation energies, strictly obeying microcanonic constraints of the physical system in nuclear multifragmentation. Despite success in reproducing some experimental data, the widely used SMM and MMMC statistical multifragmentation models do not strictly satisfy microcanonical rules.

The ISO satellite provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared, showing that water vapor is ubiquitous in molecular clouds with an abundance of 10@xmath7.

1. This paper introduces subordinators into the definition of nonconvex penalty functions, leading to a Bayesian approach for constructing sparsity-inducing pseudo-priors. The authors illustrate the use of two compound Poisson subordinators: the compound Poisson gamma subordinator and the negative binomial subordinator. They establish the relationship between the two families of compound Poisson subordinators, proving they share the same limiting behaviors and their densities at each time have the same mean and variance.

2. The authors develop ECME algorithms for solving sparse learning problems based on the nonconvex log, exp, LFR and CEL penalties. They conduct experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches, showing their nonconvex penalization approach is potentially useful in high-dimensional Bayesian modeling. The approach can be cast into a point estimation framework, and the authors note it would be interesting to fit a fully Bayesian framework based on MCMC estimation in future work.

3. The paper reviews the use of Lévy processes in Bayesian sparse learning problems. It studies two families of compound Poisson processes: continuous compound Poisson subordinators based on a gamma random variable and discrete compound Poisson subordinators based on a logarithmic random variable. The corresponding Lévy measures are generalized gamma and Poisson measures, respectively.

4. The authors show that both the gamma and Poisson subordinators are limiting cases of the two families of compound Poisson subordinators. The two families of nonconvex penalty functions can be defined via composition of log and exp, while the continuous and discrete compound Poisson subordinators are mixtures of gamma and Poisson processes. The latent shrinkage parameter is defined as a stochastic process of the regularization parameter.

5. The authors formulate a hierarchical model with multiple regularization parameters, giving rise to a Bayesian approach for nonconvex penalization. To reduce computational expenses, they devise an ECME algorithm which can adaptively adjust the local regularization parameters in finding the sparse solution simultaneously. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews Lévy processes in Bayesian sparse learning, Section 3 studies compound Poisson processes",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30}"

1. The nonlinear current response of superconductors can provide insights into the order parameter symmetry, and has been proposed as a probe of d-wave superconductivity. Recent work has examined the nonlinear response in the two-band superconductor MgB2, which is thought to be a classic s-wave electron-phonon superconductor. The authors compare the differences between one-band and two-band s-wave superconductors in terms of their nonlinear response, considering issues of dimensionality, impurities, and strong electron-phonon coupling. They find new effects in the one-band case due to strong coupling at both high and low temperatures.

2. For two-band superconductors, the authors look for signatures of the smaller gap, the effect of band integration, and the response to inter- and intraband impurities. They find behavior distinctly different from the one-band case that cannot be understood as a simple superposition of two separate superconductors. Using the complete microscopic theory with parameters from band structure calculations, they provide detailed predictions for the nonlinear coefficient of MgB2.

3. The authors conclude that for nearly decoupled bands, a strong signature of the small gap band appears in the nonlinear coefficients, but disappears with increased interband coupling or scattering. Intraband impurities in the small gap band wash out its temperature variation, while impurities in the large gap band primarily affect the nonlinearity at higher temperatures. The authors predict the nonlinear coefficient for MgB2 and find that the increased nonlinearity due to the small gap band is best reduced by adding impurities to that band.

1. Classification is an important task in time series data mining. The 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) classifier with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is one of the best approaches for classifying time series data. Selecting an appropriate distance measure is crucial for 1-NN classification, and DTW distance has been shown to be more appropriate and accurate than Euclidean distance. The Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band) speeds up DTW calculation and is used as a global constraint, originally with a fixed width of 10% of the time series length.

2. Recent work reveals that classification accuracy depends on the global constraint size, which varies based on data properties. To determine a suitable size, all possible constraint widths are tested, and the band with maximum training accuracy is selected. The Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band) generalizes the global constraint model using a one-dimensional array, with the array size and maximum constraint value limited to the time series length. The R-K band allows for multiple bands, each representing a data class, and can be adjusted according to the class warping path.

3. Although the R-K band offers flexibility in adjusting the global constraint, a learning algorithm is needed to discover the best multi R-K bands. The original R-K band work proposes a hill climbing search algorithm with accuracy and distance metrics as heuristic functions. The search algorithm climbs through a space by increasing/decreasing specific band parts until terminal conditions are met. However, this learning algorithm suffers from overfitting since accuracy is used as a heuristic function to guide the search.

4. To address the overfitting problem, two new learning algorithms are proposed: band boundary extraction and iterative learning. Band boundary extraction obtains the maximum, mean, and mode of path positions on the DTW distance matrix. In iterative learning, band structures are adjusted in each iteration round based on a silhouette index. Both algorithms are run, and the band yielding better results is used. In the prediction step, 1-NN with DTW distance and the discovered band is used to classify unlabeled data, with the LB_Keogh lower bound used to spee",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40}"

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems is a unique property that plays an important role in quantum information processing. The study of its essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence has attracted much attention in recent years.

2. Entanglement of qubits under Markovian decoherence can terminate in finite time (entanglement sudden death or ESD), despite single qubit coherence losing asymptotically, which has been observed experimentally. However, entanglement can also revive after some time of ESD or even not undergo ESD at all, preserving finite residual entanglement.

3. The lost entanglement of qubits has been found to transfer to the reservoirs, with ESD of qubits accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of reservoirs. In a double Jaynes-Cummings model without decoherence, entanglement is periodically transferred among all bipartite partitions while satisfying an identity.

4. This paper shows that the identity is still valid for two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs, despite the irreversibility introduced by the reservoirs' infinite degrees of freedom. The entanglement distribution among bipartite subsystems depends on the reservoir properties and its coupling to the qubit.

5. The model of two independent qubits in two local reservoirs is given, and the dynamical entanglement invariance is obtained based on the exact solution of the non-Markovian decoherence dynamics. The entanglement distribution over subsystems when reservoirs are photonic band gap (PBG) mediums is studied explicitly.

6. A stable entanglement-distribution configuration is found in the non-Markovian dynamics. The identity about entanglement in the whole system is satisfied at any time, revealing the profound physics of entanglement dynamics under decoherence.

1. Celestial gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful flashes of gamma-rays lasting from less than one second to tens of seconds, with an isotropic distribution in the sky. The most likely explanations for these events, which involve huge energy releases, are the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) or the coalescence of a compact binary system, and emission of gravitational waves (GW) is expected to be associated with them.

2. The authors launched a program to study the presence of correlations between GRB events detected with BeppoSAX and the output signals from the gravitational antennas NAUTILUS and EXPLORER. They use an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of the two GW detectors to deal with the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts and the unmodeled noise.

3. The authors infer the values of GW amplitude consistent with the observation using a Bayesian approach. They consider a uniform distribution bounded to non-negative values of the GW amplitude as the prior probability density function.

4. The highest beliefs are for very small values of GW amplitude, while values above a certain threshold are practically ruled out. The authors provide an upper limit, defined as the value below which there is a given probability for the amplitude of GWs to be, and exclude the presence of signals of amplitudes above a certain value with 95% probability.

5. The authors also provide the likelihood rescaled to the asymptotic limit, where experimental sensitivity is lost completely, as a prior-independent result. This rescaled likelihood can be interpreted as a ""relative belief updating ratio"" or a ""probability density function shape distortion function"".

6. Using the cross-correlation method applied to the data of EXPLORER and NAUTILUS, the authors determine new experimental upper limits for the burst intensity causing correlations of GWs with GRBs. They exclude the presence of signals of amplitude above a certain value with 95% probability, improving the previous GW upper limit.

1. This paper presents a model for studying the growth and linking behavior of two coupled networks. The model considers two networks A and B, where at each time step, a new node is added to each network simultaneously. The new nodes have a certain number of outgoing links that connect to existing nodes within the same network (intra-links) and to nodes in the other network (cross-links).

2. The attachment of new nodes to existing nodes is preferential and depends on the number of connections and initial attractiveness of the existing nodes. The paper defines various distributions to describe the average number of nodes with different types of links (intra-links and cross-links) in each network. The time evolution of these distributions is analyzed using a rate equation approach.

3. The analysis reveals that the total in-degree distribution in both networks follows a power-law form, with the exponent depending on the average total in-degree and initial attractiveness of nodes. The distribution of intra-links also follows a power-law, with the exponent depending on the intra-linking rate and a coupling parameter. The distribution of cross-links follows a power-law as well, with the exponent being inversely proportional to the coupling parameters.

4. The model is simplified by setting the number of outgoing links of new nodes in both networks to be the same and defining a coupling parameter that represents the ratio of cross-linking to intra-linking rates. In the weak coupling case, where cross-linking is negligible, the model recovers the exponents observed in empirical studies of citation networks. By varying the coupling parameter, the model can yield different values for the power-law exponents of intra-link and cross-link distributions.

5. The model is also applied to the web of human sexual contacts, where males and females are represented by the two networks. By setting appropriate values for the coupling parameter and initial attractiveness of nodes, the model can reproduce the power-law exponents observed in empirical studies of sexual contact networks. The flexibility of the model in representing various complex systems is highlighted, and the authors acknowledge the financial support from China Scholarship Council and EPSRC, as well as useful discussions with Geoff Rodgers.

1. The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum in high-energy collisions traditionally involves a two-step process of hard parton scattering followed by fragmentation. The first part is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second part uses phenomenological fragmentation functions. However, this production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for intermediate transverse momentum particles in heavy-ion collisions, where parton recombination is more appropriate, especially for soft partons.

2. To achieve a universal description applicable at any transverse momentum based on the same hadronization scheme, it is necessary to treat fragmentation as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet. This work introduces the notion of shower partons and determines their distributions to represent the fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The shower parton distributions become crucial when they recombine with partons not in the jet but in the ambient medium, which is an important process in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate transverse momentum.

3. The authors focus on determining the properties of shower partons and illustrating the importance of their recombination with thermal partons. The shower parton distributions are determined phenomenologically by solving integral equations that relate them to the fragmentation functions, similar to how the fragmentation functions are determined by fitting experimental data. The authors determine the shower parton distributions at a fixed momentum scale and demonstrate their usefulness in heavy-ion collisions where hard partons are produced over a range of transverse momenta.

4. The authors consider light quarks (u, d, ū, d̄) and gluons, which can all fragment into pions. They reduce the fragmentation functions to three basic types corresponding to valence, sea, and gluon fragmentation. The sea quark shower parton distribution is determined first, followed by the valence quark and gluon-initiated shower distributions. The authors then extend the consideration to the strange sector, introducing two additional fragmentation functions and two more shower parton distributions.

5. The recombination functions, which depend on the meson wave functions, are specified. Gluons are implicitly converted to quark-antiquark pairs in the sea before hadronization, and the gluon degree of freedom is not included in the list of shower partons.

1. The paper considers a nonconvex semidefinite programming problem with convex objective function, convex constraint set, and nonconvex matrix-valued mapping constraints. These problems have applications in static output feedback controller design and topology optimization. Many attempts have been made to solve these nonconvex and NP-hard problems using convex semidefinite programming techniques.

2. The authors previously proposed a method based on convex-concave decomposition of the bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints and linearization. In this paper, they generalize that approach to develop a new local optimization method for the nonconvex semidefinite programming problem. The main idea is to approximate the feasible set by a sequence of inner positive semidefinite convex approximation sets.

3. The key contributions are: 1) generalizing the inner convex approximation method from scalar to nonlinear semidefinite programming, 2) proving convergence to a stationary point under mild conditions, and 3) providing ways to form overestimates for bilinear matrix-valued mappings and showing applications in static output feedback. The algorithm is simple to implement using standard semidefinite programming tools and requires no globalization strategy like line search. Matrix operators, positive semidefinite convexity, and inner convex approximations of nonconvex sets are defined and discussed.

4. Two key examples of convex overestimates for nonconvex functions are provided. For a Lipschitz continuous gradient function, a quadratic overestimate can be formed. For a difference of convex functions, a linearization-based overestimate can be defined.

5. The concept of convex overestimate is generalized to matrix-valued mappings. Two important examples are a parametric quadratic overestimate for a bilinear form and a linearization-based overestimate for a difference of positive semidefinite convex mappings.

They show how these two lattices can be used to describe chiral symmetry and extend the idea to describe exact flavor projection, which requires introducing two new lattice structures and a new operator.

3. To implement simultaneous chiral and flavor projection, a duplicate set of complexes is introduced, with chiral projection operating between sets and flavor projection within sets. This allows projecting a single flavor of chiral field onto each complex.

4. The path integral is evaluated for this formulation, considering the effects of chiral and flavor projection. Prior to flavor projection and without simultaneous chiral projection, the form on each complex is equivalent to the quarter-root trick used in lattice QCD.

The problem is formulated as a semidefinite programming problem and an optimization framework is provided. Two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes are also proposed to simplify the computation.

2. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the different beamforming schemes. The sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes are found to achieve near-optimal performance, especially at high SNRs, while being much less computationally complex. Imposing individual relay power constraints leads to only small losses in secrecy rates compared to a total power constraint. The proposed beamforming schemes are able to achieve good performance even when the eavesdropper and primary user channels are stronger than the legitimate receiver channel.

1. The paper discusses the quantization of the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS) while maintaining conformal invariance. A classical conformally invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFSs, so the quantization process should also maintain this invariance. The work extends a previous result for the Maxwell field in de Sitter space to general CFSs, using Dirac's six-cone formalism to realize CFSs as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space.

2. Auxiliary fields and the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme are used to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field. A well-suited coordinate system allows conformally invariant CFS formulas to take a Minkowskian form. The main result is a set of Wightman two-point functions for Maxwell and auxiliary fields, obtained by solving the dynamical equations, constructing the quantum field, determining the subspace of physical states, and computing the two-point functions.

3. The Wightman two-point functions on CFS are obtained from their Minkowskian counterparts using the extended Weyl transformation. In the particular case of de Sitter space, simple expressions for the two-point functions are obtained. The paper concludes that maintaining conformal invariance during the quantization process in CFS is beneficial, as the problem reduces to the Minkowski case, making calculations easier, and suggests that the classical and quantum structures of the free Maxwell field are locally the same in all CFSs.

The authors performed mean-field calculations (site and pair approximations) and Monte Carlo simulations for different concentrations of inert sites.

The production rate of CO2 molecules attains its maximum value at the first-order transition for low concentrations of inert sites, and inside the reactive window for higher concentrations.

1. The study of harmonic maps was initiated by Fuller, Nash, and Sampson, with the first general existence result due to Eells and Sampson. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional on the space of smooth maps between Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The energy of a smooth map φ between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds M and N is defined using the energy density e(φ), which depends on the differential dφ and the metrics on M and N. The second fundamental form of a harmonic map has vanishing trace.

2. The Hessian of a harmonic map φ is defined using a smooth two-parameter variation of φ and the corresponding variational vector fields. The index of a harmonic map is the dimension of the largest subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite. A harmonic map is stable if its index is zero and unstable otherwise. For a non-degenerate point p, the tangent space splits into vertical and horizontal subspaces.

3. A map is horizontally conformal if its differential is either zero or surjective and conformal when restricted to the horizontal space at regular points. Harmonic maps have been applied in various fields, including computational fluid dynamics, minimal surface theory, string theory, gravity, and quantum field theory. Most works on harmonic maps are between Riemannian manifolds, while harmonic maps between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds behave differently and must be studied under restricted classes.

1. The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is one of the most important measures for understanding the evolution of the universe. Simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high mass galaxies, so some process must be able to quench star formation.

2. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of galaxies grow through accretion of cold material, and the energy released can deposit into the interstellar medium (ISM) through jets or outflows, providing feedback to regulate star formation. Indirect evidence of this feedback is seen through scaling relationships between the SMBH mass and properties of the host galaxy bulge.

3. Accurate estimates of the SFR in active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies are difficult because well-calibrated indicators like H-alpha emission and UV luminosity are contaminated by the AGN. Many studies use the infrared (IR) regime where dust re-emits stellar light.

4. Dust efficiently absorbs optical and UV emission from recently formed stars and re-radiates it in the mid and far-IR. The total IR light from dust provides a measure of the current SFR.

5. However, dust also obscures our view of AGN by absorbing and re-emitting the AGN's optical and UV light. AGN dust emission peaks in the mid-IR while stellar dust peaks in the far-IR, making the far-IR ideal to study star formation in AGN hosts.

6. Space-based IR telescopes like IRAS, Spitzer, and ISO expanded our knowledge of the IR universe. The Herschel Space Observatory, with the SPIRE instrument, pushed into the submillimeter range with observations at 250, 350, and 500 microns, crucial for measuring dust properties.

A conjugation-free geometric presentation of the fundamental group is defined, and the problem is posed of characterizing which line arrangements have such a presentation.

2. The main result is that real line arrangements whose graph is a disjoint union of cycles, with no line having more than two multiple points, have a conjugation-free geometric presentation of their fundamental group. The exact group structure is also given for the case of a triangle arrangement with all multiple points of multiplicity 3. It is noted that there exist arrangements, like the Ceva arrangement, whose fundamental group does not have a conjugation-free geometric presentation.

3. The proof proceeds by analyzing the possible configurations of multiple points, computing their braid monodromies, and showing that all conjugations in the resulting group presentation can be simplified. The result is generalized from a single cycle to a disjoint union of cycles using a decomposition theorem of Oka and Sakamoto. The conjugation-free geometric presentations obtained are noted to be examples of Dehornoy's complemented positive presentations.

1. The text discusses various models and studies related to flavor symmetry and neutrino mass and mixing patterns. Continuous symmetries like U(1) and discrete symmetries like S3 exchange symmetry have had some success in describing the leptonic sector. To avoid mass degeneracy of νμ and ντ under S3 symmetry, the A4 symmetry was introduced by E. Ma and G. Rajasekaran.

2. After the introduction of the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern, many works tried to fit this pattern using the A4 symmetry. In a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model with A4 symmetry, the tri-bimaximal mixing arises naturally from the neutrino sector, with a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix. The model admits hierarchical masses for charged leptons and quasi-degenerate or hierarchical neutrino masses.

3. Although the model predicts θ13 = 0 consistent with experimental bounds, a non-zero complex θ13 allows exploring CP violation in the leptonic sector, which is a goal of future experiments. Non-zero θ13 can be generated in the A4 model through radiative corrections or higher dimensional mass terms. CP violation and non-zero θ13 have been studied in the Altarelli-Feruglio model with explicit soft A4 symmetry breaking.

4. The authors investigate generating non-zero θ13 through the seesaw mechanism by considering a small perturbation in mD, the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, while keeping the same texture for the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix MR as in a previous reference. They first study perturbations by adding a small real parameter to different entries of mD and analyze variations of the three mixing angles. They then extend the analysis to the complex case for a suitable texture.

5. The approach to get non-zero θ13 is minimal, breaking A4 symmetry explicitly by a single complex parameter in one element of mD. Generating CP violation at low and high energies is also minimal, considering only one complex parameter.

1. Organic molecular crystals composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces are emerging as excellent candidates for fabricating nanoscale devices with potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, solar energy harvesting, surface photochemistry, organic electronics, and spintronics. These devices are composed of both an organic and inorganic component, with the organic component forming the active part and the inorganic component providing electrical contact to external circuitry. The electronic structure of the interface between these two parts plays a crucial role in determining device performance. It is important to understand charge transfer between the organic and inorganic components and the energies at which transfer takes place.

2. Adsorption of a molecule on a substrate changes the electron addition and removal energies compared to the gas phase values. This is due to polarization of the substrate when an electron is added to or removed from the physisorbed molecule, altering the addition or removal energy. A common way to calculate these energies is using a quasiparticle description, ignoring relaxation effects and aligning the metal Fermi level with the LUMO and HOMO of the molecule. The adequacy of this approach depends on the level of theory used to calculate the HOMO and LUMO energies.

3. Density functional theory is commonly used, but Kohn-Sham orbitals generally cannot be interpreted as quasiparticle energies except for the HOMO. Local and semi-local DFT functionals perform poorly for molecules, though hybrid functionals, self-interaction corrections, and range-separated functionals show improvement. Calculating energy level alignment of a molecule near a metal is challenging for DFT due to the non-local nature of image charge formation, which is not captured by local functionals. Many-body approaches like the GW approximation can describe image charge effects but are computationally demanding for molecule-metal interfaces.

4. Constrained density functional theory is a more efficient alternative for evaluating charge transfer energies of an organic molecule physisorbed on an inorganic substrate. In CDFT, an electron is transferred between the molecule and substrate, and the energy difference is calculated relative to the neutral configuration.

1. MOPED (Multiple Optimised Parameter Estimation and Data compression) is a patented algorithm for compressing data and speeding up likelihood function evaluations in astronomical data analysis. It is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the model parameters and must be calculated and inverted at each likelihood evaluation. However, MOPED only guarantees maintaining the Fisher matrix of the likelihood at a chosen point, so it has limitations with multimodal and some degenerate distributions. When MOPED does accurately represent the likelihood function, it provides orders of magnitude improvement in runtime.

2. The authors introduce MOPED and define the original and MOPED likelihood functions. They comment on the potential speed benefits of MOPED. They then introduce an astrophysical scenario where MOPED did not accurately portray the true likelihood function.

3. The authors expand upon the scenario where MOPED did not work to another where it does work and two other scenarios where it does not. They present a discussion of the criteria under which they believe MOPED will accurately represent the likelihood. They also discuss an implementation of a solution provided in a previous paper.

4. The authors provide a limited introduction to the MOPED method, defining the data as a vector and the model as a signal plus random Gaussian noise. The full likelihood requires calculating the determinant and inverse of a matrix at each point, which scales poorly. MOPED allows compressing the data points into values for each model parameter, creating independent compressed data values with unit variance, simplifying the likelihood calculation.

5. MOPED generates a set of weighting vectors to compress the data and theoretical model. The weighting vectors must be computed at an assumed fiducial set of parameter values. The only choice that will truly maintain the likelihood peak is when the fiducial parameters are the true parameters, which are not known in advance for real analysis situations.

Precise measurements in higher excited states accessible through two-step transitions have renewed interest in improving calculations where theoretical methods are yet to be tested against experimental results. However, precise measurements in excited states beyond the first one have several experimental complications due to low population transfer and lack of available detectors.

2. Two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy is presented as a tool for studying atomic properties of higher excited states. It involves two counter-propagating lasers (pump and probe) through a thermal vapor, with one laser modulated before the interaction region. The pump connects the ground state to a resonant intermediate state, while the probe scans over the desired energy manifold, and the absorption of the pump laser is monitored as a function of probe laser detuning.

3. The technique overcomes the low signal-to-noise ratio and non-availability of detectors at the desired wavelength. Two ladder systems in Rb are used to illustrate the main features and different applications of the modulation. The amplitude of the probe laser is modulated for the first system, while the second system has its pump frequency modulated, allowing the probe laser to be locked to the excited atomic resonance.

The spectra show resonant features of the hyperfine manifold with little probe power, and higher probe power increases the signal size and width of the features.

2. Due to broken time-reversal symmetry, the two types of vortices (l-vortex and r-vortex) are not equivalent and have different Hall and Vinen coefficients.

The Hall conductivity shows strong positive peaks and sign changes above the transition temperature at suitable frequencies, while the AC conductivity behaves similarly to the AHNS results.

Based on contour plot analysis, Conroy concluded that H3+ is not stable.

Other researchers like Schwartz and Schaad, and Somorjai and Yue reported single-point calculations of H3++ at the supposed equilibrium equilateral triangular configuration of H3+, but did not address stability. Berkowitz and Stocker searched for H3+ through charge stripping experiments on H3 but found no evidence of stable H3+. Later, Shoucri and Darling examined equilateral configurations with the variational LCAO method, while Hernndes and Carb studied two configurations with a more compact variational approach, obtaining lower total energy values than before, but no bound state was determined.

1. Transverse spin fluctuations are gapless, low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry and play an important role in properties like long-range order, order parameter, and spin correlations at low temperatures. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, they are important in both two and three dimensions where AF long-range order exists. In the strong-coupling limit, they significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in 2D to nearly 60% of the classical value, and the Néel temperature in 3D to nearly 70% of the mean-field result for the equivalent spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet. There has also been recent interest in spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet.

2. In this paper, a new method is described for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state, in terms of magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA). The method is applicable in the whole U/t range of interaction strength, and is illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: (i) the pure model in 2D/3D, (ii) spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit in 2D, and (iii) low-U impurities in 2D. The RPA approach properly interpolates between the weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity and magnetic phase diagram.

The time-ordered, transverse spin propagator is written at the RPA level in frequency space in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the particle-hole propagator matrix.

1. The paper introduces a formalism to study the dynamics of N nonequilibrium, coupled, time-varying scalar fields, showing that one-loop corrections to the mean field evolution can be renormalized by dimensional regularization.
2. The formalism is applied to a two-field case, studying the behavior of quantized mode functions and the effect of fluctuations on zero mode equations of motion for various parameters including small and large amplitude oscillations and couplings.
3. As a special example, a two-field supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model is analyzed, finding that accounting for fluctuations leads to uneven contributions to the renormalized masses of the fields, resulting in irregular trajectories of the zero modes and reduced particle production from vacuum fluctuations.

1. Dark matter has been established and its thermal relic abundance determined by WMAP. The weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a promising dark matter candidate that can be accommodated by introducing an inert scalar field. The imposed Z2 parity ensures the stability of the dark matter candidate.

2. Neutrinos have been confirmed to have tiny masses compared to the electroweak scale, with a different flavor structure than quarks and leptons, possibly indicating Majorana-type masses. The seesaw mechanism and Higgs triplet model are simple ways to explain tiny neutrino masses but do not contain dark matter candidates. Higher order perturbative models can naturally contain dark matter candidates.

3. This paper considers an extension of the Higgs triplet model (HTM) with a Z2 parity that generates neutrino masses at one-loop level and includes a dark matter candidate. In the HTM, neutrino masses are generated by a Yukawa interaction with a triplet scalar field that acquires a small vacuum expectation value (VEV). The VEV is related to the Higgs doublet VEV and a dimensionful parameter that breaks lepton number conservation.

4. The neutrino mass matrix in the HTM has the same structure as the Yukawa matrix. Information on the mass matrix could be extracted from the decay of the doubly charged component of the triplet field, which has been searched for at the LHC. Triplet scalars can also contribute to lepton flavor violation in charged lepton decays.

5. To explain small neutrino masses with a detectable light doubly charged scalar, the dimensionful parameter breaking lepton number must be unnaturally small. This paper extends the HTM to include a natural suppression mechanism for this parameter and a dark matter candidate. Lepton number conservation is imposed, forbidding the dimensionful parameter at tree level, but allowing the triplet Yukawa term.

1. The introduction of quantum mechanical technologies promises to fundamentally change communication, but requires a new quantum-enabled telecommunications infrastructure.
2. To quantify how well devices preserve quantum correlations, entangled states can be sent through a channel and the remaining entanglement measured, which can be done in a prepare-and-measure scenario.
3. The goal is to estimate the entanglement remaining after transmission through an optical channel by projecting the output states onto their most significant 2-dimensional subspace.
4. Homodyne measurements are used to estimate parameters that identify this subspace, and the projected density matrix is constructed.
5. Entanglement of the full state is lower bounded using the entanglement of the projected state, exploiting strong monotonicity of entanglement measures under local operations and classical communication.
6. The projected density matrix elements are estimated using bounds derived from homodyne measurement results and constraints.
7. The minimal entanglement compatible with the estimated density matrix is found via semidefinite programming, using the negativity entanglement measure.
8. Results show the method provides non-trivial entanglement bounds for low-noise optical channels, but the bounds weaken as noise increases due to approximations made.

1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles over the past 83 years has provided valuable insights into subatomic physics. The pioneering work of Stern and the discovery of large anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron laid the groundwork for the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the development of QED and QCD. The magnetic moment of a charged particle with spin is given by μ = g(Qe/2m)s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio and a is the anomaly. For point particles, the anomaly arises from radiative corrections, and the lowest-order correction gives the famous Schwinger result of α/2π.

2. The electron anomaly is now measured to a relative precision of about four parts in a billion (ppb), and the muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million (ppm). The standard model value of aμ has measurable contributions from three types of radiative processes: QED loops containing leptons and photons, hadronic loops containing hadrons in vacuum polarization loops, and weak loops involving the W and Z weak gauge bosons. A significant difference between the experimental value and the standard model prediction would signify the presence of new physics, such as lepton substructure, anomalous W couplings, and supersymmetry. The hadronic contribution cannot be calculated directly from QCD, but dispersion theory relates it to the cross section for e+e- → hadrons.

The method used in the third CERN experiment and the BNL experiment are based on the fact that for g≠2, the spin precesses faster than the momentum vector when a muon travels transversely to a magnetic field. The spin precession frequency ωa consists of the Larmor and Thomas spin-precession terms, and the difference frequency ωa is proportional to the anomaly.

This design enables the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling, which arise from the mechanical motion dependence of the disk resonator's extrinsic losses.

2. The authors examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields and report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting. Previous works on normal mode splitting in optomechanical devices only used dispersive coupling.

Reactive coupling results in normal mode splitting of the output fields, with the peak separation increasing with pump power.

1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4100 planetary candidates in 3200 systems, revealing that small planets are nearly ubiquitous and that super-Earths to mini-Neptunes are very common. Accurate planetary radii are crucial for understanding the distribution of planetary structures, but only about half of Kepler candidate stars have been observed to determine stellar parameters and rule out false positives.

2. The current Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) list assumes all host stars are single, which can introduce systematic errors in planetary radii if the stars are actually binaries or multiples. This paper explores the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample.

3. The authors calculate possible radius correction factors for each KOI considering different multiplicity scenarios (single, binary, triple) and whether the planet orbits the primary or a companion star. On average, assuming a KOI is single when it is actually a multiple system leads to underestimating planetary radii by a factor of 1.5.

4. Vetting KOIs with radial velocity measurements and high-resolution imaging can significantly reduce the fraction of undetected companions and lower the mean radius correction factor to 1.2. For closer stars like K2 and TESS targets, vetting can be even more effective, with the mean correction factor reduced to only 1.1.

5. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine how undetected companions affect the occurrence rates of different sized planets. If no vetting is done, the fraction of Earth-sized planets may be overestimated by 15-20% and the fraction of Neptune-sized and larger planets may be underestimated by up to 30%.

6. Understanding the detection limits of stellar companion vetting via radial velocities and high-resolution imaging is important for accurately determining planetary radii and occurrence rates. The stellar companion detections or lack thereof must be accounted for when calculating occurrence rates and their uncertainties, especially for Earth-sized planets.

1. The range of HI column densities seen in 21-cm emission observations of nearby galaxies is similar to those of damped Lyman-α systems (DLAs). Mapping the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission to measure their gas mass, disk extent, and dynamics would provide a direct link between DLAs and local galaxies. However, such studies are currently impossible due to the weakness of the 21-cm line and the rapid decrease in DLA number density at lower redshifts.

2. Identifying DLA host galaxies through direct imaging has been largely unsuccessful, with a few positive identifications mostly from HST imaging of low-redshift systems. The known DLA galaxies span a wide range of properties, from LSB dwarfs to giant spirals and early-type galaxies. A statistical study comparing DLA properties with HI in the local universe can provide insights into the nature of DLA host galaxies.

3. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys have accurately measured the HI mass function in the local universe. High-resolution 21-cm maps from the WHISP survey, consisting of 355 galaxies, are used to constrain the column density distribution function. Each galaxy is weighted according to the HI mass function, providing a data volume equivalent to 10^7 DLAs at z=0.

1. The vast majority of stars are thought to form in star clusters during the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds. Only a modest percentage of the gas is turned into stars, so young star clusters contain both gas and stars. Stellar winds and supernovae explosions inject enough energy to remove the gas on short timescales, leaving the cluster out of equilibrium.

2. Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by measuring the velocity dispersion and half-mass radius, assuming virial equilibrium, and comparing the dynamical mass to the observed light. The results have been discrepant, with some studies finding non-standard IMFs and others finding standard Kroupa or Salpeter IMFs. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence, suggesting the youngest clusters may be out of equilibrium.

3. This work examines the luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters: M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1. M82-F and NGC 1705-1 have been reported to have non-standard IMFs based on dynamical measurements. The authors provide evidence that these clusters are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss.

4. The luminosity profiles are well-fit by King and EFF profiles in the inner regions, but all three clusters show an excess of light at large radii compared to the best-fitting profiles. This suggests the clusters are not tidally truncated and have undergone rapid gas expulsion. The authors model the clusters using N-body simulations, representing the gas expulsion by starting the simulations out of virial equilibrium.

5. The simulations show that for effective star formation efficiencies of 40-50%, significant stellar mass loss occurs but a bound core remains. Escaping stars produce a 'tail' in the surface brightness profile for 10-20 Myr after gas expulsion, matching the observed excess light at large radii.

1. The authors numerically investigated the influence of polychromatic perturbation on wave packet dynamics in a one-dimensional double-well potential. They classified the motions into coherent and irregular based on the transition rate, time-fluctuation, uncertainty product, and phase space portrait. The critical perturbation strength dividing regular and irregular motion depends on the number of frequency components.

2. Within the regular motion range, the tunneling oscillation period is reduced as the number of colors and/or perturbation strength increases. This could be explained by the increased instanton tunneling rate due to the stochastic layer near the separatrix. The perturbed instanton picture is an expression of chaos-assisted tunneling in this parameter regime.

3. In the irregular motion under polychromatic perturbation, the uncertainty product initially increases and saturates at a certain level due to quantum interference. In contrast, under stochastic perturbation, the uncertainty product grows unboundedly as the external stochasticity breaks the internal quantum interference. The uncertainty product growth is strongly related to the wave packet energy growth.

4. Quantum fluctuations are expected to be larger for classically chaotic trajectories compared to regular ones. This implies quantum corrections to the phase space fluctuation evolution become more dominant for classically chaotic trajectories. The semiquantal approximation shows partial quantum fluctuation enhances chaotic behavior, while chaos simultaneously enhances wave packet tunneling and decoherence.

5. Classical stroboscopic phase space portraits were shown to demonstrate the effect of polychromatic perturbation on chaotic behavior. Increasing the perturbation strength destroys the separatrix and forms a chaotic layer near it. In polychromatically perturbed cases, smaller perturbation strengths can generate chaotic classical trajectories for larger numbers of frequency components.

6. The width of the chaotic layer grows faster with perturbation strength in polychromatic cases compared to monochromatic ones. Increasing the number of colors contributes to widening the stochastic layer under polychromatic perturbation.

1. This paper presents a unified stochastic formalism to study open quantum systems coupled to bosonic, fermionic, and spin baths. The stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) prescribes the quantum dissipative dynamics when bath effects are modeled as colored noises. Different bath models are distinguished by assigning distinct noise variables and associated statistics.

2. For Gaussian baths, the required conditions only involve two-time statistics determined by the bath's correlation functions. For non-Gaussian baths, the noises are further characterized by higher order statistics and multi-time correlation functions. The authors devise a family of generalized hierarchical equations (GHE) to solve the SLE with deterministic simulations.

3. The paper extensively discusses the spin bath, which can be characterized by a spectral density or composed of nearly identical nuclear/electron spins. For the former, the generalized hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach efficiently simulates the non-Gaussian bath, while for the latter, the authors propose mapping the spin bath onto an enlarged Gaussian bath model of fermions via the dual-fermion representation and applying the dual-fermion GHE.

4. Numerical examples illustrate the dual-fermion GHE method for a pure dephasing model with a 50-spin bath and a spin star model. The results demonstrate the importance of going deep into the hierarchical tiers to accurately capture the quantum dissipation induced by the spin bath. The dual-fermion GHE provides an accurate account of quantum dynamics in scenarios where the spin bath is composed of nearly identical spins.

Lifshitz generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics, relating the Helmholtz free energy associated with the electromagnetic field fluctuations to the dielectric functions of the interacting materials. Parsegian, Weiss and Barash further extended the theory to anisotropic dielectrics, predicting that a torque should develop between two parallel birefringent slabs, causing them to spontaneously rotate to align their optical axes.

1. The study of complex networks has increased in recent years with applications in various fields. A central problem is the study of random walks on graphs and how network topology affects diffusion properties. Random walk theory has implications for issues like epidemics, web page ranking, and community detection algorithms.

2. This paper sets up a framework for studying topologically biased random walks (TBRW) on graphs to address problems of community detection and synchronization. By using topological properties to bias the random walks, the network structure can be explored more efficiently. Mathematical tools like perturbation methods and parametric equations of motion are developed to investigate the ""bias parameter"" space.

3. The behavior of the spectral gap in biased random walks is analyzed, and conditions for a maximal spectral gap are defined. Numerical evidence suggests this maximum is global. An invariant quantity is presented for the biased random walk that depends only on topology for a broad class of biased walks.

4. A general methodology is introduced for applying different TBRW to community finding problems. The paper discusses how to use TBRW for community detection based on the ideas that vertices in the same community should have similar eigenvector component values and that relevant eigenvectors should have the largest eigenvalues. Varying the bias parameters can help shrink the spectral gap and maximize separation between relevant eigenvalues and the rest of the spectrum.

5. The expected differences between frequency of biased variables within and outside communities are computed for the Girvan-Newman (GN) benchmark. Edge multiplicity is found to be more common within communities than between them, even for difficult cases. The number of communities is related to the number of eigenvalues in a ""community band"" separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum.

6. TBRW is a promising approach for community detection in complex networks. While no single precise method is proposed, the framework allows creating different community finding methods with ad hoc strategies tailored to specific network types. TBRW could also potentially describe the feedback between function and topology observed in some real-world networks. Further development of this methodology by the network science community is encouraged.

1. Gravity is a universal force that affects anything with energy, although its effects are often too weak to measure due to the small value of Newton's constant. Quantum gravity theories like string theory predict a minimum measurable length, which can be understood from the breakdown of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle at Planck scale energies. Earlier studies combining quantum mechanics and general relativity also showed limits on measuring spacetime distances and clock synchronization.

2. Two authors (SD and ECV) showed that certain quantum gravity effects are universal and can influence any system with a well-defined Hamiltonian, although the effects are typically small. One formulation of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) holds at all scales and is represented by an equation involving the Planck mass and Planck energy. The dimensionless parameter α is usually assumed to be of order unity, but if not constrained a priori, current experiments allow large upper bounds compatible with observations.

3. The GUP is consistent with string theory, black hole physics, and doubly special relativity theories. It leads to modified commutation relations between position and momentum operators. These in turn imply a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum.

4. Another dimensionless parameter β is introduced, which if not assumed to be of order unity, allows all measurable lengths to be quantized in units of β times the Planck length. The energy-time uncertainty principle can be derived using characteristic system timescales. In cosmology, the Planck time is a turning point when quantum gravity corrections are significant before classical general relativity takes over.

5. Various physical quantities at the Planck epoch are derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, including the Planck time, length, mass, energy, density, effective number density, and entropy. Modified versions of these quantities are then calculated using different forms of the GUP. Depending on the values of the GUP parameters α and β, the modified Planck time can range from the standard value to much larger values.

2. At weak coupling, one can compute these couplings by diagonalizing the anomalous dimension matrix using integrability and then evaluating the matrix elements of its derivative. The authors implement this for the Lagrangian deformation and discuss extending it to other deformations.

3. At strong coupling, the authors compute 3-point functions with two heavy operators dual to classical string states and one light chiral operator using the AdS/CFT duality. They find agreement with renormalization group expectations when the chiral operator is the Lagrangian.

4. The heavy classical string acts as a tadpole that sources the supergravity field dual to the light operator. The authors discuss generalizing this approach to higher-point functions and exploring connections to integrability.

1. The paper develops an embedding scheme for the Dirac equation that enables solving it explicitly only in a limited region I of a larger system, with the influence of the rest of the system (region II) taken into account via an energy-dependent non-local potential acting on the boundary between the regions. The scheme uses a trial function that is continuous in the large component but discontinuous in the small component across the boundary, and the discontinuity vanishes when the embedding potential is evaluated at the same energy as the Dirac equation itself.

2. The embedding method is illustrated by calculating bound states of a hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity, showing it reproduces exact results, and the corresponding Green function is derived. The method is further tested by calculating the local density of states for a silver monolayer embedded between gold surfaces, yielding results identical to a direct calculation for an extended sandwich structure.

3. The use of a trial function with a discontinuous small component is discussed, noting it leads to a valid expectation value for the Dirac equation and can provide useful approximations for energies even if the discontinuity remains. Potential extensions and applications of the relativistic embedding method are considered, such as embedding a relativistic region within a non-relativistic one and adapting efficient techniques from non-relativistic embedding.

1. The paper studies open dielectric resonators, which have applications as microlasers, sensors, and paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities ranges from a few to several hundred wavelengths. Semiclassical methods provide approximate solutions for wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the wavelength, in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system. For dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard, where rays travel freely inside and are partially reflected and refracted at the boundary according to Snell's law and the Fresnel formulas.

2. Field distributions of resonance states can be localized on periodic orbits of the corresponding billiard, and far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from the ray dynamics. Semiclassical corrections due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are being investigated for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics. Trace formulas are important tools in semiclassical physics that relate the density of states to the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system. A trace formula for 2D dielectric resonators was recently developed and successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and polymer microlasers.

3. Typical microlasers are 3D systems, but there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators due to the difficulty of numerically solving the full 3D Maxwell equations. Flat microlasers have in-plane extensions large compared to the wavelength but height smaller than or on the order of the wavelength. They are often treated as 2D systems by introducing an effective index of refraction, called the neff model, which introduces uncontrolled errors. The purpose of this work is to carefully compare experimental length spectra and the trace formula computed within the 2D neff approximation, investigate the effect of dispersion of the effective index of refraction, and consider higher-order corrections to the trace formula.

1. This work investigates the gravitational wave background produced by the coalescence of double neutron star systems using Monte Carlo simulations. The coalescence rate is estimated based on the cosmic star formation rate and the probability distribution of the coalescence timescale.

2. The simulations show that a continuous background is formed by sources beyond a critical redshift, while sources at lower redshifts produce a ""popcorn"" noise. The density parameter Omega_gw has a maximum amplitude of about 10^-9 around 670 Hz for one star formation model and 10^-9.7 around 630 Hz for another.

3. The computed signal is below the sensitivity of the first and second generation of gravitational wave detectors. However, using the planned sensitivity of third-generation interferometers like the Einstein Gravitational Wave Telescope (EGO), a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.33 could be achieved after one year of integration with two coincident detectors.

4. The ""popcorn"" noise contribution is about an order of magnitude higher than the continuous background, with a maximum of 10^-8.3 (or 10^-8.7 for the alternative star formation model) at 1.65 kHz. This signal is characterized by the spatial and temporal evolution of the events and its unique signature.

5. Although the ""popcorn"" noise cannot be detected by the first two generations of detectors, it could potentially be distinguished from instrumental noise using advanced data analysis strategies that are currently under investigation. These include searching for anisotropies, using maximum likelihood statistics, and methods based on the ""probability event horizon"" concept.

1. This paper presents an analytical treatment of the nonlinear effects of particle acceleration and reacceleration at shock fronts. The backreaction of the accelerated particles on the shock structure is investigated, including the case where pre-existing seed particles are present. The approach is based on the assumption that particles with different energies diffuse in different regions of the shock, allowing the problem to be treated semi-analytically. The thermodynamics of the system, including the gas, seed particles, freshly accelerated particles, and the shock itself, are described by the mass and momentum conservation equations.

2. The velocity, density and pressure profiles of the fluid around the shock are determined by solving the conservation equations. The cosmic ray pressure includes the contributions from adiabatic compression of pre-existing particles and the pressure of freshly accelerated particles. The approach assumes the diffusion coefficient is momentum-dependent, so particles with different energies affect the fluid at different locations. The integral-differential equation for the fluid velocity is solved together with the boundary conditions to obtain the full solution for the particle distribution function and shock compression ratio.

3. The paper first investigates the case of shock reacceleration of pre-existing seed particles, without any freshly accelerated particles. The appearance of multiple solutions for the shock compression ratio is found, depending on the maximum momentum the particles can achieve. Three regimes are identified: weakly modified shocks at low maximum momentum, multiple solutions at intermediate maximum momentum, and strongly modified shocks at high maximum momentum. The same behaviour is found when varying the shock Mach number instead of the maximum momentum.

4. The case of combined acceleration of particles from the thermal pool and reacceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays is then considered. It is shown that the presence of seed particles can lead to shock modification even for low injection efficiency of thermal particles. The nonlinearity of the shock in this case can be dominated by the seed particles rather than the freshly accelerated ones. The spectra of reaccelerated particles are calculated, showing a hardening compared to the test-particle case.

5. The appearance of multiple solutions for the shock modification in the case of combined thermal and seed particle acceleration is confirmed. This phenomenon, already known for pure thermal acceleration, suggests the shock may behave as a self-reg",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 32}"

1. Cosmological observations from type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large scale structure provide evidence that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase. This result is generally attributed to the existence of a dark energy sector with negative pressure. At late times, dark energy dominates over cold dark matter and drives the observed accelerating expansion.

2. The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, which has an equation-of-state parameter w=-1. However, the cosmological constant model suffers from the cosmological constant problem related to the small observational value of dark energy density compared to quantum field theory expectations. Moreover, the ΛCDM paradigm may also have an age problem, and current data slightly favor an evolving dark energy with w crossing -1.

3. Over the past decade, several dark energy models have been proposed, such as quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, Chaplygin gas, generalized Chaplygin gas, holographic dark energy, new agegraphic dark energy, and Ricci dark energy. There are also models that induce effective dark energy from modifications of the gravitational sector, such as f(R) gravity, gravity with higher curvature invariants, scalar-tensor theories, vector field contributions, and higher-dimensional gravity.

4. An alternative approach to explain the accelerated expansion is to consider a theory of gravity based on the Weitzenböck connection instead of the Levi-Civita connection, leading to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR). In TEGR, the gravitational field is described by the torsion tensor, and the field equations are equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but based on torsion instead of curvature.

5. Starting from TEGR, one can construct various gravitational modifications based on torsion, with f(T) gravity being the most studied one. In f(T) gravity, the Lagrangian density is a function of the torsion scalar T, and the field equations are second-order, making these theories simpler compared to other extended theories of gravity.

1. The acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated from CMB measurements. This ""standard ruler"" scale could potentially be measured at low redshifts in galaxy surveys to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe. However, if the CMB measurements were misled by undetected new physics, it could bias the low-redshift inferences.

2. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly measures the baryon-to-photon ratio and epoch of matter-radiation equality, which are well-constrained. The actual matter and radiation densities are not needed; only their ratio matters. Thus, even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, the dark energy inferences from combining CMB and low-redshift data are unchanged.

3. The acoustic peak method relies on measuring the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance sound waves travel between the end of inflation and recombination. Nearly all this distance is accumulated just before recombination at z~1100. The sound horizon integral depends only on the Hubble parameter H(z) and sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma.

4. Assuming dark energy is subdominant at z>1100, the sound horizon depends on the redshift of matter-radiation equality. The baryon-to-photon ratio is precisely measured by the CMB acoustic peak ratios and Silk damping tail. This fixes the sound speed, so the sound horizon depends only on the redshift of equality aside from an overall factor of (Ωmh2)−1/2.

5. The redshift of equality is robustly constrained by the CMB potential envelope, even if the matter density Ωmh2 is misinterpreted due to undetected relativistic components. The sound horizon decreases by only 5% if zeq is lowered by 10%. Measuring the acoustic scale at low redshift constrains H(z) and the angular diameter distance, which depend only on the bare Ωi values, not the overall prefactor.

1. The author investigates the ansatz m_ν^T = -m_ν for the 3 generation neutrino mass matrix, motivated by SO(10) grand unification. Assuming the dominance of a certain term, the ansatz corresponds to the well-known unification of b quark and τ lepton masses. The ansatz itself is not very predictive but can be combined with results from neutrino oscillation experiments to reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix.

2. The author uses results from a best fit to all present neutrino experiments by Ohlsson and Snellman, which found no CP violation, agreeing with assuming m_ν to be real. Two different solutions were found in this case. The first solution, with two neutrinos of mass 0.608 eV and a third of mass 1.217 eV, is borderline ruled out by non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay. The second solution, with two degenerate neutrinos of mass 1.054 eV and a third of mass ~10^-5 eV, is safe from being ruled out and has an extremely small (11) element in the reconstructed m_ν.

1. The Levi-Civita (LC) spacetime, a solution to Einstein's equations, has two essential constants α and σ that are difficult to physically interpret. For small σ > 0, LC describes the spacetime of an infinite line mass, but the spacetime becomes flat when σ = 1/2 or 1.

2. The absence of circular test particle orbits for σ > 1/2 and the decreasing Kretschmann scalar as σ increases from 1/2 to 1 have led to differing interpretations of LC.

1. Quantum information processing has attracted significant interest in recent years, following investigations into the potential of quantum computers for storing and processing information in quantum systems. Quantum information carriers enable possibilities like secret communication through quantum cryptography and the implementation of more efficient quantum networks and algorithms. Many studies focus on transmitting quantum information between two parties, Alice and Bob, through a communication channel, with the information encoded in qubits.

2. If the qubits are perfectly protected from environmental influence during transmission, Bob receives them in the same state prepared by Alice. However, in realistic scenarios, the qubits have nontrivial dynamics due to interaction with the environment, resulting in Bob receiving distorted qubits. Investigations have mainly focused on determining the channel capacity and reconstructing the original quantum state, assuming the quantum channel's action is known.

3. The problem of determining the properties of the quantum channel, which precedes capacity determination and state reconstruction schemes, has not been investigated much until recently. Reliable quantum information transfer requires a well-known intermediate device, and knowledge of the channel's behavior is essential for constructing quantum codes. This article considers the case where Alice and Bob use a finite number of qubits and have partial or no knowledge of the quantum channel's properties, aiming to estimate the characterizing parameters.

According to the standard cosmological model, ordinary matter (in baryonic form) only makes up 4% of the total mass-energy of the universe, as deduced from primordial nucleosynthesis of light elements and measurements of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. There is also 23% dark matter in non-baryonic form whose nature is unknown. The remaining 73% is in the form of mysterious dark energy, discovered through the Hubble diagram of type Ia supernovae, whose origin is unknown except that it could be in the form of a cosmological constant.

2. Dark matter explains the difference between the dynamic mass of galaxy clusters (deduced from the motion of galaxies) and the mass of luminous matter including galaxies and hot intergalactic gas. It is thought to play a crucial role in the formation of large structures, by pulling ordinary matter into gravitational collapse, which explains the distribution of visible matter from the scale of galaxy clusters to the cosmological scale. Precise numerical simulations confirm this hypothesis.

3. For this to be possible, dark matter must be non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation, called ""cold"" dark matter or CDM. There is no explanation for dark matter (or dark energy) in the standard model of particle physics, but extensions beyond the standard model provide good candidates for the possible dark matter particle, such as the neutralino in supersymmetry models, the axion, or Kaluza-Klein states predicted in certain models with extra dimensions.

1. This paper studies the properties of heteropolymers, specifically polyampholytes (PAs) which are polymers with a random sequence of positively and negatively charged monomers. While homopolymers are well-understood, heteropolymers of biological significance like proteins are more complex due to the specific monomer sequences that determine their folded shape and activity. Statistical approaches sacrifice specificity to obtain general properties of random heteropolymers, which are also of interest as disordered systems related to spin glasses.

2. The behavior of PAs depends on the space dimension d, with the excess charge Q playing a key role. For d<4, weak electrostatic interactions are irrelevant and the PA behaves as an ideal polymer at high temperatures before collapsing into a dense state at low temperatures, similar to the theta-point transition of polymers with short-range interactions. For d>4, electrostatic interactions are relevant and the high temperature phase depends on Q, with a critical charge Qc separating expanded and contracted states.

2. Half-metallicity is maintained in these alloys over a wide range of lattice parameters, with exceptions for alloys involving S, Se, and Te at low lattice parameters where antiferromagnetic ground states are indicated.
3. Ferromagnetism is robust in CrAs and CrSb for all lattice parameters studied, while CrS, CrSe, and CrTe show antiferromagnetic tendencies at low lattice parameters.
4. Mixed pnictide-chalcogenide alloys CrAs0.5X0.5 (X = S, Se, Te) do not show antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for the entire range of lattice parameters studied.
5. Curie temperatures are estimated using the mean-field approximation and random phase approximation based on exchange interactions between Cr atoms.
6. Pnictides generally have higher Curie temperatures than chalcogenides, and large changes in Curie temperature can be achieved by changing carrier concentrations.
7. The study provides guidance for experimentalists in fabricating stable zinc blende half-metallic materials by varying pnictogen and chalcogen concentrations to achieve lattice-matching with substrates.
8. Errors in Curie temperature calculations for ferromagnetic reference states due to neglecting induced moments are discussed, with disordered local moment results being free from such errors.

1. This paper studies closed graphs, which are simple graphs with a closed labeling. A labeling of a graph is a bijection from the vertex set to {1, ..., n}, and a labeling is closed if for any distinct edges {i,j} and {i,k}, {j,k} is also an edge whenever j < i < k or j > i > k. Closed graphs were first encountered in the study of binomial edge ideals, where the generators form a Gröbner basis for the ideal if and only if the graph labeling is closed.

2. The goal of the paper is to characterize when a graph has a closed labeling based on graph properties. It is shown that every closed graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. A graph is narrow if every vertex is distance at most one from every longest shortest path.

3. The main result (Theorem 2.1) states that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. This extends to disconnected graphs by considering connected components (Corollary 2.2). The paper introduces layers L_n of vertices at distance n from vertex 1 under a closed labeling.

4. An algorithm is presented for labeling the vertices of a connected graph. The algorithm selects an endpoint of a longest shortest path, labels it 1, and then labels vertices in order of increasing distance from vertex 1, breaking ties by choosing vertices with the fewest unlabeled neighbors. Properties of the labeling produced by the algorithm are studied.

5. The main theorem is proved by showing that for a connected chordal, claw-free, narrow graph, the labeling produced by the algorithm is closed. The proof proceeds by induction on the vertex labels and considers several cases. It is noted that the chordal hypothesis can be weakened to only require that cycles of lengths 4, 5, and 6 have chords.

2. Cosmic rays have always been the highest energy elementary particles known, giving birth to particle physics. Techniques taking advantage of extensive air showers are required to measure the highest energy cosmic rays which have a flux of only a few particles per square km per century.

3. The cosmic ray spectrum follows a featureless power law that decreases approximately as the cube of the primary energy. Above a few hundred TeV, the arrival directions are remarkably isotropic, understood in terms of diffusive propagation in galactic magnetic fields.

4. There is increasing evidence for a different component at the highest energies, with a change in spectral slope and composition just above 10^18 eV. The highest energy events are a serious challenge to explain theoretically.

5. If the highest energy cosmic rays are protons, they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background over distances of ~50 Mpc, producing a predicted cutoff (the GZK cutoff) that is not observed. Composition studies are crucial to constrain models and interpret anisotropy measurements.

3. Analysis of XMM-Newton observations from 2000 and 2004 revealed dips in some orbital cycles but not others, suggesting the disk was precessing in a ""superhump"" phenomenon associated with a low mass ratio.
4. The authors conducted a series of 30 Swift observations spaced ~1 day apart to search for evidence of a super-orbital period expected to be on timescales of a few days.
5. The Swift observations revealed the 0.3-10 keV luminosity varied by a factor of ~5 over ~30 days, and fitting the lightcurve with a sinusoid yielded a period of 5.65 ± 0.05 days.
6. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the Swift data showed a single strong peak at 5.60 days, consistent with the period from fitting the lightcurve.

1. This work proposes generalizations of one-dimensional PT-symmetric nonlinear oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which can be used as building blocks for constructing PT-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. Four basic types of plaquettes are introduced, three in the form of four-site squares and one as a five-site cross. The analysis is restricted to modes that can be found analytically, while their stability against small perturbations is analyzed numerically. Many effects are found, including solution branches that terminate at critical points of the respective linear PT-symmetric systems, and branches that continue past the critical points due to nonlinearity.

2. The spectral stability of different configurations is examined, with most modes being unstable, although stable branches are also found. The perturbed dynamics of the modes are studied, with unstable modes typically leading to growth of amplitudes at gain-carrying sites and decay at lossy ones. Passive sites without gain or loss may be tipped towards growth or decay depending on the particular solution. The next step may be to search for more sophisticated stationary modes produced by symmetry breaking of the simplest modes considered.

3. The work may pave the way for further considerations of two-dimensional PT-symmetric lattice systems and even three-dimensional ones. Natural generalizations include constructing periodic two-dimensional lattices of the building blocks presented and identifying counterparts of the reported modes in infinite lattices, along with new modes. In the three-dimensional realm, examining a PT-symmetric cube composed of eight sites and the nonlinear modes it can support would be a first step towards constructing full three-dimensional PT-symmetric lattices. These topics are under present consideration and will be reported elsewhere.

1. The cataclysmic variable HU Aqr consists of a 0.80 solar mass white dwarf accreting from a 0.18 solar mass main-sequence companion star in a tight orbit. Irregularities in the observed variations have led to explanations including the presence of circumbinary planets. Detailed timing analysis suggests HU Aqr is orbited by two planets: a 5.7 Jupiter-mass planet in a 7.1 AU orbit with eccentricity 0.036, and a 7.6 Jupiter-mass planet in a wider 12.8 AU orbit with eccentricity 0.18.

2. Although this two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 10,000 year timescale, a small fraction of simulations show long-term stability. Planets orbiting cataclysmic variables could be common and a natural consequence of binary formation. The presence of planets can constrain the cataclysmic variable's evolution and reconstruct the history of the inner binary.

3. The original binary likely lost over half its mass in a common-envelope phase, reducing the binary separation by over an order of magnitude. The white dwarf's mass and composition limit the mass and evolutionary phase of its progenitor star at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow. The inner planet breaks the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and core mass at Roche-lobe overflow, allowing derivation of the common-envelope mass-loss rate.

4. The outer planet validates this calculation and determines the conditions when the cataclysmic variable was born. Dynamical stability requirements further constrain the initial stellar masses and orbital separation. During the cataclysmic variable phase, little mass is lost, so the current total binary mass was not affected by past evolution.

The @xmath0 NCSM/RGM is a promising technique for treating structure and reactions in light nuclear systems, combining a microscopic cluster approach with realistic interactions and a consistent @xmath0 description of nucleon clusters. It has been introduced for two-body cluster bases and shown to work efficiently in various systems. However, many interesting systems have a three-body cluster structure that cannot be successfully studied with a two-body cluster approach. Extending the NCSM/RGM approach to properly describe three-body cluster states is essential for studying nuclear systems with such configurations.

2. Systems with three-body cluster configurations include two-nucleon halo nuclei like @xmath1He and @xmath4Li, resonant systems like @xmath5H, and transfer reactions with three fragments in their final states. The authors recently introduced three-body cluster configurations into the NCSM/RGM method and presented initial results for the @xmath1He ground state. Here they present those results along with first results for the continuum states of @xmath1He within a @xmath2He+n+n basis. Extending the NCSM/RGM approach to three-cluster configurations requires expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states built from the NCSM wave functions of each cluster.

1. The layered organic material α-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 (α-I3) has recently attracted renewed interest because it reveals low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure (≥1.5 GPa). Compared to graphene, the most popular material with low-energy Dirac fermions, α-I3 is strikingly different in several respects. Apart from the tilt of the Dirac cones and the anisotropy in the Fermi surface, its average Fermi velocity is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that in graphene. This, together with an experimentally identified low-temperature charge-ordered phase at ambient pressure, indicates the relevance of electronic correlations.

2. The material α-I3 opens the exciting prospect to study strongly-correlated Dirac fermions that are beyond the scope of graphene electrons. Another specificity of α-I3 is the presence of additional massive carriers in the vicinity of the Fermi level, as recently pointed out in ab-initio band-structure calculations. However, the interplay between massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers has, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been proven experimentally. Finally, one should mention a topological merging of Dirac points that is expected for high but experimentally accessible pressure.

Furthermore, they show that the measured mobilities for the two carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.

The Fermi surface consists of hole sheets around the Γ point and electron sheets around the M points. Nesting between these sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations.

2. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure. The RPA-SF approach gives an extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron sheets (s± state), while orbital fluctuations promote a sign-preserving s++ symmetry. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) can probe the gap structure by measuring the dynamical spin susceptibility.

3. A well-defined peak in neutron spectra appears only for Q=QM at or around Tc, commonly explained as a spin resonance due to the s± state. However, ARPES and Andreev spectroscopy show at least two distinct gaps: a larger gap (Δ0) on electron sheets and inner hole sheet, and a smaller gap (Δ1) on the outer hole sheet. This raises the question of what the spin resonance frequency would be in a system with two distinct gaps.

1. The presence of impurities usually modifies the spectrum and coherence properties of a quantum system. In the absence of interactions, all states are exponentially localized in 1D and 2D if the impurity distribution is random, while a mobility edge exists in 3D. If impurity positions are correlated, such as having a minimum distance between impurities, some delocalized states can appear.

2. The effects of correlated disorder have been studied in 1D in the context of the random dimer model (RDM) and dual random dimer model (DRDM). In 2D, the effect of correlations is mostly unexplored, except for speckle potentials and pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions. The main difference between speckle potentials and the DRDM is the decay of the correlation function, which is algebraic for the former and exponential for the latter.

3. In interacting systems, disordered impurities give rise to rich phenomena such as modifying the condensate and superfluid fraction, shifting the onset of superfluidity, and inducing exotic phases like the Bose glass. This work studies the effect of short-range correlated disorder on a Bose gas confined on a 2D square lattice by introducing a 2D generalization of the DRDM (2D-DRDM). Using decimation and renormalization, it is shown that in the non-interacting regime, there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent and states around this energy are delocalized.

4. The resonance energy in the 2D-DRDM is independent of system dimensionality and is the same as in the 1D DRDM. Within a Gutzwiller approach, the effect of the 2D-DRDM on a weakly interacting Bose gas is shown to drive the homogeneity of the ground state. The disorder induces non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and fraction as a function of disorder strength, enhancing both near the resonance energy.

1. Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be proven secure against eavesdropping assuming users' devices meet certain requirements. However, it is difficult for practical devices to meet these requirements, leading to attacks on practical QKD systems. Some countermeasures have been proposed, including device-independent security proofs, but these cannot be applied to practical systems.

2. Measurement-device-independent QKD (MDIQKD) was recently proposed, where neither Alice nor Bob performs any measurement, but they send quantum signals to an untrusted measurement unit (MU). After MU announces a successful detection, Alice and Bob proceed with post-processing their data. The security relies only on characterizing the quantum signal sources, not the detectors.

3. This paper studies the security of MDIQKD with imperfect sources that have basis-dependent flaws. It proposes two phase-encoding MDIQKD schemes - one using phase-locking of separate laser sources, the other converting phase encoding to polarization. The security is proven against the most general attacks, taking into account basis-dependent flaws.

4. Key generation rates are simulated using realistic parameters. The first scheme covers shorter distances but may require less precise state preparation. The second scheme can cover much longer distances with very precise state preparation.

5. The security proof assumes MU is completely untrusted and proves unconditional security. It generalizes previous security proofs to consider basis-dependent flaws from both Alice and Bob. The key generation rate is derived based on estimating the phase error rate.

6. Simulations show the first scheme can tolerate some basis-dependent flaws by controlling the signal intensities. With state-of-the-art technologies, it can generate keys without requiring extremely precise state preparation. The second scheme's performance drops significantly with slight decreases in fidelity between density matrices in the two bases.

7. In summary, the work highlights the importance of very accurate state preparation to avoid basis-dependent flaws in MDIQKD. The proposed schemes can generate secure keys with certain practical assumptions.

1. Massive stars play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation process remains enigmatic due to large distances and clustered mode of formation. Recent high-resolution observations point toward an accretion formation scenario for massive stars, similar to low-mass stars. Further discrimination between competing formation models is possible by examining the properties and young stellar populations of hot molecular cores. The mid-infrared (MIR) window offers a powerful view of these regions, as the large column densities of material process the stellar light to infrared wavelengths.

2. Class II methanol masers exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are generally offset from ultra-compact HII regions. Previous multi-wavelength observations by M05 found that maser sites with weak radio continuum flux are associated with massive, luminous, and deeply embedded cores characterizing protoclusters of young massive (proto)stars in an earlier evolutionary stage than ultra-compact HII regions. However, the spatial resolution was too low to resolve individual sources inside the clumps. High-resolution MIR observations were subsequently carried out on three of the M05 regions using the Gemini North telescope.

3. The observations used standard chop-nod techniques and covered the dust emission observed by M05 in each region. Absolute positions were determined by comparing the MIR data to sensitive, high-resolution cm continuum VLA images. Flux calibration was performed using standard stars, and regions confused with many bright sources were deconvolved using the Lucy-Richardson algorithm. The resulting deconvolutions revealed multiple point sources within the protoclusters, with the methanol masers found closest to the brightest MIR point source.

4. The spatial distribution of point sources is similar between the clumps, with close sources toward the cluster center. Using a simple harmonic model, the time required for migration from the edge to the center is comparable to the predicted hot molecular core lifetime. Massive stars in clusters are observed to have a high companion star fraction, and the observed regions show two or more point sources at close angular separations corresponding to linear separations of 1700 to 6000 AU. Proper motions are too small to confirm physical association, but velocity differences may be det",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The paper proposes an all-optical scheme to detect Majorana fermions (MFs) in iron chains on a superconducting lead surface using a coupled quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator (QD-NR) system. The scheme avoids direct contact between MFs and the QD-NR system, preventing interference from other signals. The interaction between MFs and the QD is mainly due to dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted.

2. The QD is modeled as a two-level system, and the NR is characterized as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The coupling between the NR and QD is described, and the Hamiltonian of the coupled QD-NR system is obtained. The coupling between the nearby MF and QD is also described, and the Hamiltonian is transformed to the regular fermion representation.

3. An optical pump-probe technique is applied to the QD to stimulate coherent optical effects and observe linear and nonlinear optical effects via the probe absorption spectrum. The Hamiltonian of the exciton coupled to the pump and probe fields is given, and the total Hamiltonian of the system is obtained in a rotating frame. Quantum Langevin equations of the system are derived, introducing corresponding damping and noise terms.

4. The coherent optical properties of the QD are investigated under different coupling conditions. Without any coupling, normal absorption and dissipation of the QD are observed. With QD-NR coupling, two sharp peaks appear in the spectra due to mechanically induced coherent population oscillation. With QD-MF coupling, the spectra show a remarkable signature of MFs.

5. The conditions of coupled and uncoupled MF modes are considered. In the uncoupled mode, the absorption spectrum shows a symmetric splitting, while in the coupled mode, an unsymmetric splitting is observed due to detuning. A comparison of the absorption spectra under both conditions reveals an analog of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) attributed to destructive quantum interference between MF modes and the beat of optical fields via the QD.

1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by strong Si lines in their spectra at maximum brightness and are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from its companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes. There have been significant progress in this model since the introduction of stellar wind from the accreting WD. According to this model, there are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel, which predict the types of companion stars.

2. Observational confirmation of the evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia requires identifying the companion star that should remain near the explosion site. It has been argued that a G2IV star was identified as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) based on its velocity and distance measurements. Although an alternative explanation suggests the star might belong to the thick disk population, the expected stellar mass in thick disk stars within the observed angular distance is very low, making this alternative unlikely. Confirmation by other means would be useful to support the identification of the companion star.

3. The authors propose a direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta by investigating absorption line features in the star's spectrum. Observations of a star called S-M star near the Type Ia SNR 1006 showed very broad wings on both sides of Fe II absorption lines, indicating that the star is located behind the SNR ejecta. If a star is inside the SN Ia ejecta, broad absorption wings should only be present on the blue side, as the ejecta moving towards us absorb the photons. This unique absorption line feature can be used to identify companion stars of SNe Ia.

1. Quantum entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics that is essential for quantum information processing. It can be characterized independently of its physical realization and obeys conservation laws, making it useful to quantify entanglement. For pure bipartite systems, the entropy of entanglement is a well-established measure, but for mixed states that interact with the environment, quantifying entanglement becomes less clear. Various measures like entanglement of formation and distillation have been proposed to address this issue, but they assign zero entanglement to certain mixed states that seem intuitively entangled.

2. Nha and Carmichael introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based on quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics. Their approach considers how information is extracted from the environment through measurements, and the system's evolution is conditioned on the measurement record. This allows the entanglement measure to be contextual and dependent on the type of measurements made. The authors apply this idea to analyze the entanglement dynamics of a cascaded qubit system coupled through one-way photon exchange.

3. The cascaded qubit system, consisting of two cavities each containing a single atom, can produce unconditional entangled states as the steady-state solution to a master equation. At resonance, a maximally entangled Bell state is achieved, but the approach to steady state takes infinite time. Quantum trajectory theory is used to unravel the master equation and illuminate the dynamical creation of entanglement, particularly explaining the slow approach to steady state at resonance. The conditional dynamics exhibit bimodality at resonance, with the approach to the Bell state being one possibility and a sustained stochastic switching between two Bell states (an ""entangled-state cycle"") being the other.

4. The authors demonstrate the distinct asymptotic behaviors of the system using a phase space representation and eigenstates of the evolution between quantum jumps. Imperfect inter-cavity coupling is also considered, showing the persistence of entangled-state cycles settling into either symmetric or antisymmetric Bell states. The choice of cycle depends on the number of photon counts at one detector over a substantial time interval.

1. This paper studies the infrared anisotropy of luminous radio-loud AGN at redshift z~1 using an isotropically selected sample of quasars and radio galaxies. The average SEDs were calculated for the quasar (type 1 AGN) and radio galaxy (type 2 AGN) samples to examine the intrinsic anisotropy of the dust torus IR emission. The ratio between type 1 and type 2 AGN gradually decreases from 20 to 2 at wavelengths 2 to 8 μm, with a slight increase in the 10 μm silicate feature.

2. The intrinsic type 1 to type 2 ratio is ~1.44 at 15 μm, indicating the mid-IR emission becomes more isotropic at longer wavelengths. Analysis of the silicate feature shows a ""shift"" of the central peak of silicate emission with respect to the center of the absorption feature, consistent with previous reports. The findings are consistent with upper limits from the X-ray/mid-IR correlation of local Seyfert galaxies but show some discrepancy with a similar study of nearby Seyferts by Hönig et al. (2011).

3. The discrepancy may imply that nearby, radio-quiet, lower-luminosity AGN have a higher degree of IR anisotropy than higher luminosity, radio-loud sources, possibly explained by a receding torus model with luminosity-dependent obscuration. The relatively small overall anisotropy is consistent with the torus being clumpy rather than smooth, and the clumpy torus model reproduces the observed type 1/type 2 ratio reasonably well. The paper discusses the results in the context of other anisotropy estimators.

1. Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is an unconditionally secure communication scheme between two parties, Alice and Bob. Practical implementation systems, such as fiber-based Gaussian-modulated and discrete-modulated coherent-state protocol QKD systems, have been demonstrated over tens of kilometers. However, traditional security analysis of the entanglement-based (EB) scheme of CVQKD does not include the local oscillator (LO), leaving potential security loopholes.

2. This paper describes an attacking scheme exploiting the fluctuation of LO intensity and analyzes the security of practical CVQKD implementation under this attack. The authors calculate the secret key rate with and without Bob monitoring the LO for reverse and direct reconciliation protocols. They find that LO intensity fluctuations could severely compromise the secret keys if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values.

3. The authors propose a LO intensity attack (LOIA) where Eve intercepts both the signal beam and the LO, replacing the quantum channel with her own perfect quantum channel. By attenuating the LO intensity, Eve can reduce the estimated channel excess noise, potentially stealing partial or full secret keys without being detected. Numerical simulations demonstrate the impact of LOIA on the secret key rate for various LO transmission values.

4. To ensure the security of practical CVQKD implementation, accurate monitoring of LO intensity is crucial. Scaling measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values or the lowest intensity value (for small fluctuations) is recommended, rather than using the average intensity value. The authors emphasize that LO intensity fluctuation presents a significant challenge, particularly for reverse reconciliation communication over long distances, and that imperfections in balanced homodyne detection (BHD) may further exacerbate the impact of LO intensity fluctuations on secret key rate estimation.

1. The goal of the development of the code was to have a simple and efficient tool for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models, with an emphasis on accuracy. The code offers flexibility in the choice of integration method and the ability to determine all frequencies of a given model in a specified range of degree and frequency. The equilibrium model is defined using a minimal set of dimensionless variables, as well as the mass and radius of the model. Extensive documentation is provided with the code distribution package.

2. The equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations are expressed in terms of a set of dimensionless variables. For nonradial oscillations, the displacement vector is written using spherical harmonics, and the equations are solved on an interval from the center of the star to a point in the stellar atmosphere. Boundary conditions are obtained from series expansions at the center and surface of the star.

3. The code permits solving the oscillation equations using two main techniques: a shooting method and a relaxation method. In the shooting method, solutions satisfying the boundary conditions are integrated separately from the inner and outer boundaries, and the eigenvalue is found by matching these solutions at a suitable inner fitting point. The relaxation method involves solving the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions using a relaxation technique, with the eigenvalue found by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point.

4. To achieve high precision in the computed frequencies, the code employs techniques such as using a variational principle and Richardson extrapolation. The code also calculates various properties of the oscillation modes, including the mode order, normalized inertia, and eigenfunctions. Several revisions and improvements to the code are under development, such as implementing a fourth-order integration scheme and a new classification scheme for dipolar modes in centrally condensed models.

1. Highly structured HI distributions with cavities, shells and supershells have been discovered in the disks of gas-rich galaxies, including the Milky Way and other spirals. Exceptionally huge HI arcs and loops extending across several kiloparsecs have been identified in edge-on spirals such as NGC 5775, NGC 4631, NGC 3044 and NGC 3556. These features have been interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like or circular appearance and evidence for expansion. Two main explanations for the origin of supershells involve internal sources such as starbursts and supernovae, or external sources such as infalling gas clouds.

2. The ""chimney model"" attempts to explain disk-halo features via processes related to underlying star formation. Correlations between halo emission and in-disk star formation tracers argue in favor of such models. However, the main difficulty with the starburst model lies in the required input energies for the largest shells, which would require staggering numbers of spatially correlated supernovae. Growing evidence suggests that HI shells are not always related to star formation processes.

3. The alternative external source hypothesis invokes infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies. This resolves the energy problem since input energy is then a function of the mass and velocity of the infalling cloud. Evidence in favor includes high velocity clouds around the Milky Way and signatures of interaction in some galaxies. However, it requires the galaxy to be interacting with a companion or have massive clouds in the vicinity.

4. Recent observations are revealing apparently isolated galaxies harboring extremely large HI supershells, such as NGC 3556 and NGC 3044.

1. The article is motivated by a result of Berestycki et al. for the Laplacian perturbed by a divergence-free drift in dimensions d ≥ 3. The result asserts that the principal eigenvalue λ_a remains bounded as a → ∞ if and only if the equation b ⋅ ∇u = 0 has a solution u ≠ const such that u ∈ H^1_0(D) and ∇u ∈ L^∞(D). The result can be interpreted intuitively in terms of the flow of the vector field b and the existence of non-trivial first integrals.

2. The purpose of the paper is to verify that a similar property of the principal eigenvalue holds when the classical Laplacian is replaced by the fractional Laplacian (-Δ)^α/2 with α ∈ (0,2). The main difficulty stems from the roughness of general elements of H^α/2 and the non-locality of (-Δ)^α/2, which prevent a direct application of differential calculus. Instead, the authors use conditioning, approximation techniques for flows, and properties of the Green function and heat kernel.

In some systems like topological states, the order parameter can only be defined in a complicated non-local way, necessitating new methods to identify phase transitions.

Monte Carlo simulations are used to predict the lattice spacing of the crystals as a function of the electric field strength and are compared with experimental measurements.

Some deviations are observed at low field strengths near the melting transition, where fluctuations increase the lattice spacing, and at high field strengths, where the pairwise additivity assumption may break down.

The results suggest that intermediate particle sizes (1000-1500 nm) offer the highest degree of tunability for a given maximum field strength, as smaller particles require higher fields to form stable crystals, while larger particles have a relatively short-ranged repulsion, limiting the maximum lattice spacing at melting.

However, the spectra had strange features and evolution, including a bright blue continuum at early times and a brightening red wing leading to a ""U""-shaped spectrum, in contrast to normal supernovae. Photometric observations showed a rapid optical decline 50 days after discovery, while near-infrared emissions brightened. The epoch of near-infrared brightening corresponded to the development of the red wing in the optical spectra, interpreted as evidence of ongoing dust formation.

1. The micro-quasar GRS 1915+105 exhibits extreme variability classified into 14 classes, believed to be due to accretion rate close to the Eddington limit. IGR J17091-3624 is a recently discovered black hole binary that shows similar variability patterns to GRS 1915+105, including the ""heartbeat"" pattern, but is 20 times fainter.

2. Simultaneous spectral fitting of IGR J17091-3624 at different phases of the ""heartbeat"" oscillations suggests the black hole has very low or possibly negative spin, in contrast to the high spin of GRS 1915+105. This indicates that extreme variability in black hole binaries is a generic phenomenon related to high accretion rate, and not dependent on black hole spin.

They introduce weights associated with errors in each UV band in a chi-squared minimization procedure to compute Rv and Av values and their errors. The authors give formulae to calculate maximum errors and errors in quadrature for Rv and Av, taking into account mismatch errors that significantly affect the color excesses. They present the sky distribution of Rv values and show their behavior as a function of galactic coordinates.

1. The paper proposes a qubit controlled by symmetry breaking in a triangular triple quantum dot (TQD) system.
2. The qubit states are encoded in the doublet subspace, with each dot containing one spin, and are controlled by applied gate potentials that break the triangular symmetry.
3. A new method for reading out the qubit state is demonstrated using electric transport through the TQD and the doublet blockade effect, which is compatible with pure electrical manipulations and does not require spin-to-charge conversion.
4. The doublet blockade effect is related to an asymmetry of tunnel rates between the doublet states and the electrodes, with one doublet state being a dark state that blocks electron transport.
5. Time-dependent electron transport in the doublet blockade regime provides information about qubit dynamics, coherent oscillations, and relaxation processes due to the presence of electrodes.
6. The role of leakage processes from the doublet to two-electron states is studied, with leakage being larger for the triplet case due to activation of the quadruplet state.

1. Symbiotic systems (SS) consist of a white dwarf (WD), a red giant (RG) star, and circumstellar and circumbinary nebulae. Z Andromedae (Z And) is a binary system with a cool giant of spectral type M4.5 and a hot compact component with a temperature of 1.5 x 10^5 K. It has exhibited many periods of activity over more than 100 years, with outbursts sometimes coming in pairs or series.

2. The 1984-1986 outburst of Z And was exceptionally low in brightness but was monitored closely by spectral observations. The authors aim to reveal unpredicted episodes by detailed modeling of the spectra, focusing on the physical conditions in the nebulae and their fluctuations during this period. They calculate line spectra using the SUMA code, which accounts for shocks and photoionization.

3. The visual light curve of Z And during the 1984-1986 outburst is mainly contributed by HeII 4686 and H-beta lines, which depend on the WD temperature and ionization parameter. The UV light curve would have a different profile due to lines from various ionization levels being affected differently by fluctuations in temperature, ionization parameter, shock velocity, and compression. Modeling the spectra reveals unexpected physical conditions compared to the visual light curve.

4. The sudden increase in density and velocity in April 1984 indicates a collision between the WD wind and a shell ejected from the RG. The WD temperature slightly increases to a maximum of 170,000 K during the outburst maximum. The drop in ionization parameter after June 1985 suggests that the shock front has shifted farther from the WD.

5. The second density peak in December 1985-January 1986 reveals another collision between the WD wind and an RG shell. The sharp decline in the black body flux reaching the nebula could be due to high-density fragments obstructing the radiation. The whole picture is likely explained by the ejection of a new shell from the RG atmosphere and its collision with the WD wind at a relatively large distance.

1. Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks are emerging as novel electronic materials. The nanotube-nanotube junction resistance dominates the overall network resistance, leading to percolation behavior and nonlinear thickness dependence for sub-monolayer networks. For thicker networks, metallic tube conductance dominates, resulting in metallic overall resistance. Frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity have been investigated for individual SWCNTs and some SWCNT networks.

2. This paper systematically studied the frequency- and electric-field-dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks with varying densities. The onset frequency extracted from frequency dependence measurements increased with film thickness, while the length scale extracted from electric field dependence decreased. An empirical relation was developed between the two transport measurement methods using the measured onset frequency and extracted length scale for different films.

3. SWCNT networks were prepared by spraying on polyethylene terephthalate substrates, with network density controlled by solution concentration and spraying time. Corbino reflectometry and 4-probe methods were used to measure frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity, respectively. The real part of conductance remained at the DC value up to a characteristic onset frequency, then increased at higher frequencies, fitting well to the extended pair approximation model. Onset frequency increased linearly with DC sheet conductance over 4 decades.

4. The linear proportionality between onset frequency and DC conductance is a characteristic feature of AC conductance in disordered solids, known as Taylor-Isard scaling. A correlation length was defined as the distance between junctions in the SWCNT network. As network density increased, correlation length decreased and onset frequency increased. Electric-field-dependent conductance measurements showed a localization length scale that decreased with increasing film thickness. An empirical relation was established between the onset frequency and the nonlinear transport length scale, helping to understand the electric transport properties of SWCNT films.

1. The paper proposes a scheme for implementing a three-qubit Grover's search algorithm using four-level SQUIDs coupled to a superconducting resonator. The scheme is based on a three-qubit controlled phase gate and single-qubit gates. The three-qubit phase gate is realized through a series of resonant and off-resonant interactions between the SQUIDs and the cavity field, along with the application of microwave pulses.

2. The scheme offers several advantages over previous proposals, such as faster operation times, accommodation of non-uniformity in device parameters, and no requirement for adjusting level spacing or using slowly changing Rabi frequencies. The authors analyze the effects of imperfections, including cavity field decay and relevant level decay, on the fidelity and success probability of the algorithm. They show that high fidelity can be achieved even in the presence of these imperfections.

3. The total operation time for the three-qubit controlled phase gate is estimated to be around 13 ns, which is significantly faster than schemes based on adiabatic passage. The authors also discuss the effects of unwanted off-resonant interactions during gate implementation and provide conditions to minimize these effects. They compare their scheme with a recent proposal for implementing Grover's algorithm using flying qubits in cavity QED.

4. In conclusion, the proposed scheme demonstrates the feasibility of realizing a three-qubit Grover's search algorithm using stationary qubits in superconducting circuits. The scheme's robustness against imperfections and its fast operation times make it an attractive candidate for practical quantum information processing. The authors highlight recent experimental progress in generating single microwave photons using superconducting qubits, which supports the feasibility of their proposal.

2. The excitation of a core electron is not adiabatic and leaves the conduction band electrons in a nonequilibrium state, analogous to removing a cork from water very briskly. In a metal, the collective excitations of conduction band electrons correspond to plasmons.

3. The shake-up effects appear as plasmon replicas in the XPS spectrum, with the main peak at the adiabatic position and replicas at positions shifted by multiples of the plasma frequency. Single-particle excitations also contribute, leading to a deformation and low-energy tail of the peaks.

4. In pristine graphene, the Fermi surface is just two points in the Brillouin zone, making it a special case. In doped graphene, the chemical potential is inside an energy band, and the 2D plasmons give contributions starting from zero frequency.

1. The phase-field method has become popular for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity. However, some fundamental questions remain open regarding the thin-interface limit of two-sided models, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification, and the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations. The common point of these topics is that they pose challenges or limitations for straightforward computations. A mathematical analysis is often required to understand the detailed properties of the phase-field equations.

2. The thin-interface limit involves analyzing the phase-field equations under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than other physical length scales. This yields effective boundary conditions valid at the macroscale, containing effects of the finite interface thickness. For the symmetric model of solidification, a thin-interface correction to the kinetic coefficient was obtained. However, the generalization to arbitrary diffusivities is not trivial, as several new thin-interface effects appear that cannot all be eliminated simultaneously.

3. An antitrapping current was introduced as a solution for the one-sided model with zero diffusivity in the solid. This approach was extended to finite diffusivity in the solid, but it is only a partial solution. A second, independent thin-interface effect, the Kapitza resistance, cannot be removed by an antitrapping current. The temperature jump at the interface is proportional to the current crossing it, corresponding to a surface thermal resistance.

4. Two independent thin-interface effects exist, one proportional to the interface velocity and one to the current. They are a consequence of the two independent boundary conditions of the diffusion equation driving interface motion. A general solution to eliminate both effects simultaneously does not seem to exist currently. Simple criteria can be used to determine when the antitrapping current prescription can be applied, such as for equiaxed dendritic growth.

5. Orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification describe the geometry using a single scalar field in 2D or three scalar fields in 3D. They are appealing due to their simplicity, but the standard equation of motion for the orientation field is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter. It does not take into account the connectivity of matter and the resulting geometrical conservation laws.

1. The effects of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure have been detected in samples of high redshift QSOs, galaxies, and GRBs. In the case of point sources like QSOs and GRBs, weak lensing manifests as angular correlations with foreground mass, while for galaxies it is detected through coherent shear.

2. Another way to detect weak lensing is to use fluxes of standard candles like Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). If observed SNIa magnitudes are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen, with brighter SNIa lying behind mass overdensities and fainter ones behind underdensities.

3. The authors analyze a sample of 50 high-redshift SNIa and find that brighter SNIa preferentially lie behind regions with higher projected number densities of foreground galaxies. This relation has a slope of -0.3 to -0.5 mag per galaxy overdensity and a statistical significance of >99%.

4. Modeling of this effect shows it depends on the total lensing optical depth and the probability distribution of lensing convergence, but not on the details of galaxy biasing. Standard models of mass distribution have some difficulty reproducing the observed slope, favoring more extreme lensing models.

5. Weak lensing is unlikely to significantly bias cosmological parameters derived from current SNIa samples. However, future large samples of SNIa could provide a powerful probe of mass inhomogeneities on ~Mpc scales by combining magnification and shear information.

1. The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied for decades and is important in biology, such as in DNA looping and protein/RNA folding. DNA in cells is constantly interacting with subcellular structures in a crowded, nonequilibrium environment. Single molecule experiments have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation, showing the effects of mechanical constraints like tension and torsion. Recent studies found that small tensions of 100 fN scale can increase looping time and that fluctuating tension greatly reduces looping time.

2. Theoretical studies have used transfer matrix methods and elastic theories to study the effects of DNA bending, tension, and protein binding on loop formation probability and rate. However, it is difficult to quantitatively compare these theories to experiments. The authors aim to understand the basic physical mechanism of biopolymer looping using Brownian dynamics simulations of extensible wormlike chains combined with a one-dimensional theory of barrier crossing over the free energy of loop formation.

3. The authors model semiflexible polymers as bead-spring chains with stretching and bending energies, and simulate their dynamics using the overdamped Langevin equation. They study the effects of static tension and time-dependent dichotomically fluctuating tension on the looping time, defined as the mean first-passage time to cross the free energy barrier. For static tension, the looping time steeply increases with applied tension, in agreement with simulations and distinct from previous theories. The free energy of loop formation is modeled using the mean-field wormlike chain model.

4. For time-dependent tension, the authors find that the looping times are reduced, consistent with experiments. Importantly, they observe resonant activation, where the looping time is minimum at an optimal flipping time of the dichotomic force. The minimum looping time is associated with the maximum probability of the force being in the inward direction at the instant of looping. The effects of fluctuating tension are more significant for longer chains.

1. This paper considers the tidal interaction between a star and a point source (which can be a star or planet) in a close binary system. Tidal interactions can lead to phenomena like synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture or disruption, and the object falling onto the star. The evolution time scales of the orbital parameters strongly depend on the orbital period and stellar model, and can take up to 108 years or more for periods around 5 days.

2. The problem is reduced to determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations, calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange, and calculating the characteristic orbital parameters as a function of time. Low-frequency g-modes of stellar oscillations play an important role in dynamical tides. The tidal interactions are intense at small periastron distances, corresponding to g-mode excitation.

3. The change in orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity over time is determined from energy and angular momentum conservation laws. To calculate the overlap integral, a measure of tidal interaction intensity, the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of stellar oscillations need to be known. There are three types of eigenfrequencies for a non-rotating star: p-, f-, and g-modes, with g-modes being the focus here.

The properties of g-modes are determined by the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, which has a structural part related to pressure and density, and a compositional part related to changes in chemical composition from nuclear reactions.

1. The glassy wormlike chain (GWLC) model is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike chain (WLC) model for semiflexible polymers that incorporates interactions of a test polymer with the surrounding network. The GWLC model describes the mechanics of an isolated semiflexible polymer in an isothermal viscous solvent using a mode decomposition ansatz. Short-wavelength modes are taken directly from the WLC model, while long-wavelength modes are modified by an Arrhenius factor to account for the slowdown due to the constrictions from the sticky contacts with the background network. The GWLC model has been successful in describing rheological data for polymer solutions and living cells over many time scales with few parameters.

2. To extend the GWLC model to non-equilibrium situations, the number of closed bonds and the interaction length are considered as dynamic variables that depend on the strain and stress history. A mean-field description is provided to account for the dynamically evolving bond network, using the notion of an effective interaction potential. The dynamics of the fraction of closed bonds is determined by the competition between force-dependent bond breaking and bond formation rates, which are represented using an adiabatic approximation and depend on the barrier heights and force pulling on the bonds.

3. The extended inelastic GWLC model predicts several key features of the nonlinear mechanical response of sticky biopolymer networks. These include: (i) a pronounced fluidization (softening) response that develops upon strong deformations, in addition to the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening from the individual polymers; (ii) slow recovery to the initial state after cessation of loading; (iii) rate-dependent yield force for the onset of fluidization; and (iv) cyclic softening or inelastic shake-down effect accompanying the fluidization. The theory qualitatively agrees with recent experimental results for living cells and can be further extended to account for irreversible plastic deformations.

1. Graphene has garnered interest for both atomic scale circuit devices and new topological phases. Gating bilayer graphene can induce a band gap, bringing graphene-based transistors closer to reality. However, sub-gap conductance with weak temperature dependence well below the measured gap introduces a new puzzle and obstacle.

2. The authors predict the existence of topological gapless channels of transport along recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary networks, solving the sub-gap conductance puzzle. These predicted topological edge states could be the first realization of topological surface states hosted by structural topological defects. The tilt boundaries are structural topological line defects along which each neighboring layer is displaced by one inter-atomic spacing.

3. Microscopic tight-binding and ab-initio calculations show that AB-BA tilt boundaries in gated bilayer graphene support gapless edge states. The existence of these gapless edge states is robust against long-range perturbations such as tilt boundary width, bond-length variations, and strain at the tilt boundary. The edge states are valley-filtered, with right and left moving edge states spatially separated between the two edges.

4. The authors investigate the topological aspects of the low-energy effective theory and show that the AB-BA tilt boundary can be mapped to a gate-polarity boundary of uniform bilayer graphene.

Applying the notion of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, they identify chirally-stacked multi-layer graphene as a realization of Z2-type SPT, protected by time-reversal, absence of valley mixing, and charge conservation symmetries.

They consider additional symmetries in multi-layer graphene beyond previous work. The procedure involves finding a gapless Dirac Hamiltonian with the same symmetries, expressing the Hamiltonian and conserved quantities in the Majorana basis, and finding the space of mass matrices that anti-commute with",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21}"

1. Macromolecules containing ionizable groups dissociate into charged macromolecules and counterions when dissolved in polar solvents like water. Depending on the acidic or basic properties of their monomers, ionizable polymers in solution can be classified as polyelectrolytes (with a single sign of charged monomers) or polyampholytes (with both positively and negatively charged monomers). These water-soluble charged polymers have numerous industrial and medical applications. Many biological macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins are also charged polymers.

2. In polyelectrolyte chains, intra-chain electrostatic interactions are repulsive and tend to swell the chain. In contrast, polyampholyte chains have attractive interactions between oppositely charged monomers that decrease the chain size. The behavior of polyampholytes depends on the sequence of charged monomers along the chain, whether randomly distributed or arranged in blocks. Studies have shown that the charge distribution affects properties such as aggregation, self-assembly, and adsorption to charged surfaces.

3. Polymers anchored to a surface, known as polymer brushes, are of great interest in industrial, biological, and academic research. With sufficient repulsion between the polymers, the chains become stretched, forming planar or curved brushes. Polyelectrolyte brushes have been extensively investigated theoretically and computationally. In these brushes, competition between counterion osmotic pressure and chain elasticity determines the brush thickness at high grafting densities and charge fractions, a regime known as the osmotic regime.

4. In polyampholyte brushes, electrostatic interactions cause most counterions to be outside the brush, and correlations tend to decrease the chain size and brush thickness. The average thickness and equilibrium properties of polyampholyte brushes are mainly determined by factors such as the fraction and sequence of charged monomers, bending energy, and grafting density. Brushes formed by grafted diblock polyampholytes have been studied using lattice mean field modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

1. The light flavor scalar mesons are difficult to accommodate in the naive quark model, with some proposed to be glueballs, molecular states, or tetraquark states. The a0(980) and f0(980) are good candidates for KK molecular states, but the a0(1450) and K0*(1430) lie considerably higher than the corresponding thresholds, making it difficult to identify them as KK and Kπ molecular states. There may be different dynamics dominating the scalar mesons below and above 1 GeV, resulting in two scalar nonets below 2 GeV. The strong attractions between diquark states in relative S-wave may result in a nonet of tetraquark states below 1 GeV.

2. In this article, the authors construct color singlet tetraquark currents using scalar diquark fields, parameterize the nonperturbative effects with new vacuum condensates besides the gluon condensate, and perform QCD sum rule analyses to study the nonet scalar mesons below 1 GeV. The numerical values obtained are compatible with experimental data and theoretical estimations. Compared to conventional quark currents, the diquark currents more easily satisfy the criteria of QCD sum rules. The new sum rules can be extended to study other multiquark states.

1. Pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) is a physically-motivated method for temporal integration of dynamical systems that can accelerate convergence to steady state compared to conventional implicit integration methods. PTC follows the solution accurately in early stages and then increases the time step to sacrifice temporal accuracy and gain rapid convergence to steady state.

Numerical examples demonstrate that PTC can provide correct stability assessment for the long-term stability model, overcome numerical difficulties in the QSS model, and offer good accuracy for intermediate trajectories while being significantly faster than implicit integration methods.

1. The problem of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2D) has attracted increasing interest in recent years. This interest is stimulated by proposals to create exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases, such as anisotropic superfluidity, 2D dipolar fermions, and few-body dipolar complexes. The recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in confined optical traps has opened up ways to realize these phenomena. There is also a long history of research on 2D quantum effects in condensed matter physics, including superfluid films, high-temperature superconductivity, 2D materials like graphene, and possibilities for topological quantum computation.

2. The development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2D Bose and Fermi ultracold gases has provided unique opportunities to model 2D effects in a highly controlled environment. Interest in 2D processes and effects has stimulated the theory of elementary quantum two-body systems and processes in the plane, with special consideration given to the anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction. Usual partial-wave analysis becomes inefficient for describing dipole-dipole scattering due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial waves in the asymptotic region. Recently, considerable progress has been made in analyzing 2D and quasi-2D scattering of dipoles.

3. In this work, the authors develop a method for quantitative analysis of 2D quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer, which permits the description of 2D collisions of unpolarized dipoles. The approach is based on a method suggested previously for few-dimensional scattering and successfully applied to dipole-dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in 3D free space. The key elements of the method are described in section II, and in section III, the method is applied to 2D scattering on a cylindrical potential with an elliptical base and 2D dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles.

1. G65.2+5.7 is a supernova remnant that was studied in several observational papers soon after being identified. It was then ignored for a long time until recently, when it became interesting again for helping explain the unusual class of thermal composite supernova remnants. These remnants have a shell-like radio continuum morphology combined with a centrally-bright X-ray morphology where the X-ray emission is due to thermal processes. Various explanations have been proposed for the origins of these remnants.

2. Optical observations indicate that G65.2+5.7 has entered the shell formation phase, while radio and low-resolution X-ray observations show it has a shell-like radio continuum morphology and emits thermal X-rays. Analysis of archival ROSAT observations establishes that the remnant has a centrally filled X-ray morphology, the third requirement for being classified as a thermal composite remnant. Model fits to the ROSAT data imply the temperature peaks in the center and decreases mildly with radius, similar to other thermal composite remnants.

3. The remnant's size and distance have been estimated using various techniques, with a diameter of 56-64 pc and a distance of 800-900 pc. At this distance and a galactic latitude of 5.7°, the remnant lies 90 pc above the galactic disk. Its age is estimated to be 3×10^5 years, making it potentially the oldest known thermal composite supernova remnant if this age is correct.

4. X-ray observations with HEAO-1 and ROSAT show the remnant's X-ray emission is thermal, extended, and fills the remnant's outline without a bright shell. The X-ray emission is slightly harder in the interior than the edges. Spectral modeling indicates the best-fit temperatures range from 2.5 to 3×10^6 K and decrease slightly with radius, a common feature of thermal composite remnants.

1. The paper studies the relation between adaptive sorting algorithms and compression techniques for permutations. It shows that concepts like runs and shuffled upsequences, originally defined for adaptive sorting, are useful for compressing permutations. Conversely, concepts like the entropy of the set of run sizes, originally defined for compression, are useful difficulty measures for adaptive sorting.

2. The authors present several encodings of permutations that use fewer than the trivial n log n bits on classes of permutations that arise in applications. The encodings support efficient computation of the permutation and its inverse. They are based on the decomposition of a permutation into runs (contiguous ascending subsequences) or shuffled upsequences (not necessarily contiguous ascending subsequences).

3. One encoding uses at most R log(n/R) + O(R log log(n/R)) bits for a permutation with R runs, and supports computing the permutation and its inverse in O(log n) worst-case or O(1+log(n/R)) average-case time. Similar results are obtained by encoding the permutation's strict runs (contiguous subsequences where each element is the preceding one plus 1). Another encoding uses 2n H(1/n,1/2n,...,1/nn) + O(n log log n / log n) bits for a permutation with n shuffled upsequences of lengths n1,...,nn, and supports computing the permutation and its inverse in O(log n) time.

4. The authors apply their encodings to various scenarios. One is the encoding of an inverted index for text retrieval, where the concatenation of the inverted lists forms a permutation with few runs. They achieve a space close to the zero-order entropy of the inverted lists and support list access operations efficiently.

5. Another application is to suffix arrays, used to index texts that cannot be handled with inverted lists. The Burrows-Wheeler transform of the text is a permutation with few runs that can be encoded in compressed form. This yields a compressed suffix array that can efficiently count, locate, and extract pattern occurrences.

They study the probability distribution of relevant elements and how they are subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules.

They perform numerical simulations to study the distribution of relevant elements and its connection with the properties of the attractors in the chaotic phase and on the critical line. The results show that the number of relevant elements scales as the square root of the system size on the critical line, and the average cycle length grows almost exponentially with the number of relevant elements in the chaotic phase and on the critical line.

1. This paper studies spin-superflow turbulence (SST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature using the spin-1 spinor Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations. Theoretical analysis suggests that the spectrum of superflow kinetic energy can exhibit the Kolmogorov -5/3 power law, while the spin-dependent interaction energy spectrum can show a -7/3 power law.

2. Numerical simulations of the spin-1 spinor GP equations, with a phenomenological small-scale energy dissipation term, confirm the emergence of both the -5/3 and -7/3 power laws in SST. The Kolmogorov spectrum in SST is found to be generated by the nonlinear spin term rather than the inertial term in the velocity equation.

3. The vortical structure of the velocity field is significant for the Kolmogorov spectrum in SST, similar to quantum turbulence in one-component BECs. The time period sustaining the Kolmogorov spectrum becomes shorter when the relative velocity between spin components is large, due to increased density fluctuations and higher energy injection wave numbers.

4. The study discusses the possibility of inverse energy cascade in two-dimensional SST, suggesting that it may not occur for superflow kinetic energy due to the lack of enstrophy conservation. However, the spin-dependent interaction energy may exhibit signs of inverse energy cascade, possibly caused by the ferromagnetic interaction aligning the spin density vector and forming spin domains.

They found that at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz, using published VLA data at 15 GHz and their own NMA measurements at 96 GHz.

2. Submillimeter fluxes measured with SCUBA on the JCMT were used to estimate dust contamination in the NMA measurements. The authors confirmed little diffuse contamination from dust, free-free, and extended nonthermal emissions for LLAGNs showing inverted spectra, indicating the inverted spectra are intrinsic properties of the cores.

3. In their sample of 20 LLAGNs, radio cores with inverted high-frequency spectra reside in at least ten sources. The authors found an inverse correlation between the high-frequency radio spectrum and the low-frequency radio core power.

4. The inverse correlation can be explained by the idea that flux ratios between the steep-spectrum jet and the inverted-spectrum ADAF disc vary among LLAGNs. The disc components could only be seen if the jets are faint.

This study demonstrates three methods for determining the dust extinction law slope R_V in the direction of differentially-reddened galactic globular clusters, and tests the methods on simulated cluster data sets. For cluster data with low photometric error of 0.003 mag, the ""A_V rms"" and ""A_V slope"" methods can determine R_V to an accuracy of ±0.3.

2. For cluster data with 0.030 mag error, the two methods yield R_V within ±0.6, with some systematic biases. The ""optical/IR"" method generally provides relatively imprecise R_V estimates of ±1.0 over the full range of photometric errors explored.

3. Combining results from all three methods gives a mean extinction law slope of R_V = 3.0 ± 0.2 for the line of sight towards the low-latitude galactic globular cluster NGC 4833. The scatter in the cluster horizontal branch is used to estimate the amount of small-scale structure in the foreground dust complex.

1. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider represents a major step towards understanding the origin of mass of fundamental particles. The Higgs field may have a nonminimal coupling to spacetime curvature, which could affect gravitation. Bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity can be obtained from strong-gravity astrophysical objects like active galactic nuclei, primordial black holes, and white dwarfs.

2. The presence of strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles like electrons. Nucleons are minimally affected since their mass arises mainly from gluonic fields which are not coupled to the Higgs field. Peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions that should be strongly suppressed for molecular transitions.

1. The authors post-processed simulation snapshots of a galactic disk with ray tracing and chemical network integration to model the distribution of H2 and CO gas. They compared these results to various local approximations for radiative shielding to assess their validity and accuracy. The authors found that significant concentrations of H2 gas are vertically restricted near the midplane and trace the underlying gas distribution, while CO gas is further confined to the highest density clumps. Radiative shielding, dominated by self-shielding for H2 and a combination of dust, H2, and self-shielding for CO, is crucial for the development of molecular gas.

2. Among the local shielding approximations tested, the six-ray approximation, temperature-capped Jeans length, and a calibrated power-law performed best in matching the molecular abundances from the ray tracing models. The authors recommend caution in applying such approximations and suggest their use depends on the specific physics being probed in a simulation. The assumption of chemical equilibrium in the models is assessed, with the authors noting it likely overestimates H2 fractions at low densities and underestimates CO abundances due to the lack of time delay in the supernova feedback prescription. However, since the primary focus was on understanding the role of radiative shielding and numerical approximations, these limitations do not significantly impact the study's main conclusions.

1. The fraction of star-forming galaxies declines with increasing local galaxy density in the low redshift universe, known as the star formation-density relation. Mid-infrared data from ISO and Spitzer/MIPS have revealed highly obscured, dusty star-forming galaxies previously undetected by optical or UV surveys. However, only a small number of low redshift clusters have been systematically surveyed for dusty star-forming galaxies out to the virial radius. The relationship between star formation in clusters and global cluster properties, such as the correlation between cluster mass and mass-normalized cluster star formation rate (SFR), remains uncertain.

2. This paper uses data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to study obscured star formation in relation to cluster mass and radius in 69 clusters at z < 0.1. Cluster membership is determined using SDSS DR7 spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies brighter than r = 17.7. Star formation rates are determined from WISE 22 μm photometry, and stellar masses are estimated from SDSS photometry. AGN are identified and excluded using WISE color selection and optical emission line diagnostics.

3. The mean specific star formation rate (SSFR) of cluster galaxies increases with projected distance from the cluster center, but remains below the field value even at 3 times the virial radius. This suggests infalling galaxies may already be pre-processed in intermediate-density environments like groups or filaments. The total cluster SFR normalized by cluster mass (CSSFR) shows no significant correlation with cluster mass over the range 10^14 to 10^15 M_sun. This indicates that cluster mechanisms strongly dependent on mass, such as ram-pressure stripping or galaxy harassment, do not play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in these clusters.

Once the remaining star-forming galaxies enter the cluster, a mass-independent mechanism like strangulation may operate to further quench star formation.

1. This work presents a fast and efficient method to calculate inclusive 2-particle 2-hole (2p-2h) responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model using the frozen nucleon approximation. The approximation assumes initial nucleon momenta can be neglected for high momentum transfers and reduces the hadronic tensor integral from 7 to 1 dimension. The presence of virtual delta excitations requires introducing a ""frozen"" delta-propagator, designed by averaging over the Fermi sea. The frozen approximation is well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux and can help implement 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo codes.

2. The frozen approximation is validated by comparing approximate 2p-2h response functions with exact results for carbon-12, showing good agreement from low to high momentum transfers. The validity of the approximation suggests that detailed information about the two emitted nucleons' momenta is lost in the inclusive 2p-2h responses, except for the low-energy threshold region. Although a specific meson-exchange current model was used, the frozen approach is expected to be valid for other 2p-2h models and can enable efficient calculations for event generators. The study will be extended to explore the nuclear species dependence of 2p-2h responses.

Using reverberation mapping, a time lag of 3.01 +1.03/-0.80 days was measured between variations in the H-beta emission line flux and the continuum flux at 5100 Angstroms. From this time lag, the radius of the broad line region was deduced to be 2.39 x 10^-3 parsecs. Using the line dispersion of 1170 +/- 100 km/s measured from the rms spectrum, the mass of the supermassive black hole was estimated to be 9.62 x 10^6 solar masses.

The authors used standard cross-correlation techniques, including the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) and discrete correlation function (DCF) methods, to determine the time lag. Monte Carlo simulations using flux randomization and random subset selection were employed to estimate the uncertainties in the time lag. The resulting estimate of the black hole mass relies on the empirical scaling factor of 5.5, which assumes active galactic nuclei follow the same relationship between black hole mass and host galaxy bulge velocity dispersion as quiescent galaxies.

1. The broad emission iron lines found in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries are thought to originate close to the black hole by reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc. The spin of the black hole plays a key role in shaping the line profile and determining the position of the marginally stable orbit.

2. The widely used laor model assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole and does not allow the spin to be fitted. The ky model suite relaxes this limitation, and other numerical codes have been developed with similar functionality.

3. This paper compares the laor and ky models applied to XMM-Newton data of MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit extremely skewed iron lines. The data was reduced using SAS software and standard HEASARC tools.

4. The iron line is better constrained for MCG-6-30-15 due to a longer exposure time. The ky model leads to a better defined minimum of chi^2 for the best fit value and more regularly shaped confidence contour plots, allowing for more reliable constraints on spin.

5. Discrepancies between the ky and laor results are within the uncertainties of spin determination for current data, but become apparent for higher quality simulated XEUS data. The laor model tends to overestimate spin and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.

6. Correct re-binning of the data with respect to instrumental energy resolution is crucial for obtaining statistically relevant results. The paper concludes that the ky model is more reliable for constraining black hole spin using the skewed iron line profile.

1. The ""displace, cut and reflect"" method can be applied to solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates to generate disk-like configurations of matter. These solutions can be static or stationary, with or without radial pressure. Static disks without radial pressure were first studied by Bonnor, Sackfield, Morgan and Morgan, while disks with radial pressure or tension have been considered more recently.

2. The method involves choosing a surface that divides the space into two parts, one with singularities and one without. The singular part is disregarded and the non-singular part is inverted, resulting in a disk with a singularity as a delta function. The method separates the Einstein equations into two parts - one valid off the disk, and one with distributions with support on the disk.

3. Applying the method to a static sphere of perfect fluid results in a disk surrounded by a halo of the fluid. Matching conditions at the sphere boundary lead to continuity of metric functions and derivatives. Density, pressure and sound speed of the disk and halo can be calculated from the metric functions.

4. Several examples of disks are presented, based on exact solutions for static fluid spheres. The disks have positive energy density, equal radial and azimuthal pressures, with density and pressure decreasing rapidly with radius. Regions of unstable circular orbits are more likely for highly relativistic disks. The disks could potentially describe realistic galaxy models without needing counter-rotating matter for stability.

1. Pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic waves from ground transmitters are used to sound the density profile and drift velocity of the ionosphere. Theoretical work in 1971 showed that if the injected radio beams are strong enough, weak-turbulence parametric instabilities would be excited in the ionospheric plasma. Ionospheric modification experiments at Platteville, Colorado demonstrated heating of electrons, deformation of ionosonde traces, and excitation of spread F after the transmitter was turned on.

2. The triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities was first observed in 1970 at Arecibo, Puerto Rico using a scatter radar diagnostic technique. A decade later, experiments at Tromsø found that under similar conditions, strong, structured, wide-band secondary radiation escapes from the interaction region. These observations showed that complex interactions including weak and strong electromagnetic turbulence and harmonic generation are excited.

3. Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence, such as Langmuir turbulence and upper-hybrid/lower-hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas. This study presents a full-scale simulation of an electromagnetic wave propagating into the ionosphere with parameters typical for the EISCAT heating facility in Tromsø, Norway.

The electromagnetic wave is injected vertically, and the model uses Maxwell's equations, the electron momentum equation, and Poisson's equation. The initial condition is a linearly polarized electromagnetic pulse with a carrier frequency of 5 MHz and a Gaussian amplitude modulation.

1. The Mott-Hubbard model describes the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition in systems like Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. Recent experiments with cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices have renewed interest in this transition. The transition is driven by the competition between the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and their kinetic energy, with the ratio of on-site energy to bandwidth being the key parameter. Absorption imaging of the expanding atomic cloud after release from the lattice yields the initial momentum distribution, reflecting the state of the system.

2. The Mott-Hubbard model has been studied using mean-field approaches like the Gutzwiller ansatz as well as numerical techniques like DMRG, exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo. This work uses perturbation theory to find corrections to the Gutzwiller mean-field solution, focusing on the short-range correlations that affect the momentum distribution. The Gutzwiller ansatz is a product of single-site wavefunctions and becomes exact in the limit of zero or infinite interaction strength, but it fails to capture short-range correlations.

3. Perturbative corrections to the Gutzwiller solution are derived up to second order. Single-site observables like the order parameter, compressibility, and number fluctuations are calculated, with the corrections being strongest near the Mott-insulator to superfluid transition. The single-particle density matrix, which determines the momentum distribution, is also computed. Comparisons to exact diagonalization results in 1D show that the perturbative corrections give a significant improvement over the Gutzwiller ansatz for short-range correlations.

4. The presence of a harmonic trapping potential leads to alternating shells of Mott-insulator and superfluid regions. Perturbation theory is used to calculate the density distributions and momentum distributions in the presence of the trap. The results show significant corrections to the Gutzwiller solution, with the nature of the corrections depending on whether the Mott-insulating or superfluid regions dominate.

1. This paper develops a geometrical method for classifying and visualizing homogeneous isotropic cosmologies in multi-scalar models with an arbitrary scalar potential. In the first step, the target space of scalar fields is augmented to a larger Lorentzian space, with the logarithm of the scale factor playing the role of time. Flat cosmologies correspond to geodesics in this augmented target space with respect to a conformally rescaled metric, with the trajectories being timelike, null, or spacelike based on the sign of the potential. Accelerating cosmologies have trajectories with tangent vectors lying within an acceleration subcone of the lightcone.

2. The paper also analyzes cosmological trajectories for exponential potentials, which are characterized by a sign and a dilaton coupling constant. Fixed point solutions for these potentials correspond to straight lines in the augmented target space, with the k=0 case being geodesics. Exponential potentials serve as reference potentials in determining the asymptotic behavior of cosmologies with other potentials - potentials falling slower than the critical exponential lead to eternal acceleration, while those falling faster than the hypercritical exponential behave like models with zero potential. The authors hope these methods will be useful for interpreting future observations related to the potential energy of scalar fields that may model dark energy.

1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where quarks and gluons are mostly liberated from confinement within hadrons. Experiments at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron in the 1980s and 1990s first tried to create the QGP, with hints of a new state of matter obtained from global observables, event-by-event fluctuations, direct photons, and dileptons. In April 2005, the formation of quark matter was tentatively confirmed by results from experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), with a consensus that a quark-gluon liquid at very low viscosity was created. QGP is expected to exist in two places in nature: in the early universe about 10^-5 seconds after the Big Bang, and at the core of super-dense stars like neutron stars and quark stars.

2. This work generalizes previous QGP calculations to the region with finite temperature and baryon density by considering weakly interacting quarks in the one-gluon exchange scheme. The Landau Fermi liquid theory, which describes relativistic systems like quark matter and QGP, is used to evaluate the energy density of weakly interacting quarks. The Landau-Fermi interaction function, related to the two-particle forward scattering amplitude, is calculated using Feynman rules for QCD. The total energy of interacting quarks is then evaluated.

1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the early 1980s to describe the periodic advance of glaciers on Earth. It refers to the nonmonotonic dependence of a system's response on noise when the noise is added to a periodic input signal.

2. From a statistical perspective, stochastic resonance involves estimating a signal transmitted through a channel with a receiver that can only detect signals above a certain threshold. Adding noise to a subthreshold signal can make it detectable, allowing for inference on the original signal.

3. This paper studies the problem of estimation and hypothesis testing for a model with a constant subthreshold signal perturbed by noise from a diffusion process. Two observation schemes are proposed: observing the proportion of time the perturbed signal spends above the threshold, and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.

4. For both observation schemes, the authors prove asymptotic properties of estimators and provide an example where stochastic resonance emerges. They also solve the problem of testing a simple hypothesis against a simple alternative using the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion.

5. The authors show that the overall probability of error in the hypothesis test is nonmonotonically dependent on the noise level, exhibiting stochastic resonance. This finding is noted for the first time in this context.

6. The paper also discusses the use of ergodic diffusions as noise in the stochastic resonance problem. While characterizations of classes of ergodic processes that enhance stochastic resonance can be done, it is not as simple as in the case of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations.

1. The order parameter in high-temperature superconductors has been proven to have mainly a d-wave pairing symmetry. Thermal transport measurements have shown the predominance of this symmetry for the gap function, with a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO2 planes. This oscillation can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles, assuming a d-wave gap. However, deviations from the expected angular pattern within a pure d-wave symmetry have been attributed to the effect of pinning of vortices.

2. The authors address two main questions in this paper: the temperature range at which the nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity, and whether thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature can explain the experimental results, particularly the change of symmetry of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. They perform angle scans in a magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO2 planes to measure the angular variation of the longitudinal thermal conductivity in two single crystals of YBa2Cu3O7-δ high-temperature superconductor. The overall results agree with the theoretical model and confirm the predominance of the d-wave gap up to the critical temperature. The measurements also provide new results that improve the understanding of thermal transport at temperatures where the nodal properties of the gap are not directly observable.

3. The experimental results show that at low temperatures (below 15 K), a magnetic field parallel to the CuO2 planes produces a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity as the field is rotated. As the temperature increases, the fourfold oscillation is no longer observable, which can be understood by considering the thermal activation of quasiparticles at different orientations from those of the nodes of the order parameter. The amplitude of the oscillations is smaller than the simulation results at higher temperatures, which can be explained by the inclusion of inelastic scattering in the calculations.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties such as calculable soft SUSY breaking terms and solving the SUSY flavor and CP problems. However, AMSB models suffer from tachyonic slepton masses. The original solution is to add a universal scalar mass m0, leading to the minimal AMSB (mAMSB) model with parameters m0, m3/2, tan β, and sign(μ).

2. An alternative AMSB setup is hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB), where SUSY breaking is localized in a hidden region geometrically separated from the visible MSSM sector. In HCAMSB, the bino mass M1 can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation. The HCAMSB parameter space is given by α, m3/2, tan β, and sign(μ).

3. In HCAMSB, the mass hierarchy is typically M1 > μ > M2, with the lightest neutralino being a mixed bino-higgsino state. As α increases, the bino mass and scalar masses increase, while the wino mass remains nearly constant. The Higgs mass parameter μ decreases with increasing α.

1. The zero range potential (ZRP) approach allows obtaining exact solutions to scattering problems and can be represented as a boundary condition on the matrix wavefunction or as a pseudopotential. The Darboux transformation (DT) technique can be used to dress the ZRP in order to improve the model's possibilities. DT modifies the generalized ZRP boundary condition and creates a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.

2. The DT combines solutions corresponding to different eigenvalues and can introduce short-range cores of centrifugal type in the potential, requiring modification of boundary conditions on the dressed wavefunctions. ZRP with angular momentum generates complex poles of the S-matrix corresponding to quasi-stationary states (resonances). The principal observation allows building a zero-range potential eigenfunction in the multi-center problem, where the wavefunction can be expressed in terms of the Green function.

3. Scattering problems for dressed multi-center potentials, such as structures with identical scatterers involving only S waves, can be investigated within the ZRP model framework. Integral cross sections for CH4 (closed-shell ground-state 1A1) are calculated using the ZRP model, but polarization effects need to be considered at low impact energies to reproduce the Ramsauer-Townsend minimum. DT allows correcting the ZRP model at low energies and can induce long-range forces depending on angular momentum, leading to singularities in the cross section at zero energy.

1. Rapidity gaps, regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron. They are attributed to color singlet exchange between partons, with two-gluon exchange being the simplest model. At the Tevatron, around 1% of dijet events with jet transverse energies above 20 GeV and pseudorapidity separations greater than 3 exhibit rapidity gaps. This suggests color singlet exchange effects are relevant at high momentum transfers, potentially allowing perturbative QCD descriptions.

2. Bjorken predicted the gap fraction in terms of the fraction of dijet events due to t-channel color singlet exchange and the survival probability of rapidity gaps. He estimated the color singlet fraction for quark-quark scattering using the imaginary part of the two-gluon exchange amplitude. In this model, the color singlet fraction increases with the color charge of the scattered partons, predicting a decrease in the gap fraction at higher jet transverse momenta, which is not observed in Tevatron data.

3. The authors reconsider the two-gluon exchange model, demonstrating its limitations and the non-perturbative nature of determining the color singlet exchange fraction. Unitarity fixes the imaginary part of the two-gluon exchange amplitude, but the one- and two-gluon amplitudes are found to be incompatible with unitarity. Phase shift unitarization leads to a more realistic description where the total cross section is unchanged but the color singlet exchange fractions differ from the two-gluon exchange model expectations.

4. The authors perform a numerical analysis with running coupling constant, finding the color singlet fractions strongly depend on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer and cannot be reliably calculated perturbatively. In their unitarized model, the non-perturbative effects are summarized by two parameters: the gap survival probability and a universal Coulomb phase shift. They calculate how the gap fraction varies with jet transverse energies and pseudorapidity separation and compare predictions with Tevatron data.

1. Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) consist of a compact object primary and low mass secondary star, with the secondary transferring mass via Roche-lobe overflow to form an accretion disk around the compact object. LMC X-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z-source, thought to be a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit.

2. Despite being X-ray luminous, little is known about the system parameters of LMC X-2, with orbital period estimates ranging from 6.4 hours to 12 days. Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, narrow emission lines have been detected in several LMXBs, interpreted as coming from the irradiated side of the donor star.

3. The authors applied this Bowen fluorescence technique to LMC X-2 and detected a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset identified as the orbital period. They also detected narrow emission lines in the Bowen region, giving the first constraints on the system parameters of LMC X-2.

4. The radial velocity curve of the He II λ4686 emission line shows a periodic variability interpreted as the orbital period, but the Doppler maps suggest the He II emission is dominated by a bright spot on a warped accretion disk. The authors detected narrow Bowen emission lines, tentatively identified as coming from the irradiated donor star, despite the absolute phasing of the system being unknown.

5. Assuming the compact Bowen spot arises on the donor star, the authors use its velocity (351 ± 28 km/s) as a lower limit to the center of mass velocity of the secondary. This gives a lower limit to the mass function and can be used to constrain the mass ratio and component masses.

6. The authors speculate that LMC X-2 harbors a neutron star based on its X-ray properties as a Z-source. Combining the lack of eclipses with the lower limit on the mass function suggests the compact object is likely more massive than the canonical 1.4 solar masses.

1. The axial anomaly is a fundamental issue in quantum field theory that has been analyzed deeply over the years. The dolgov and zakharov approach interprets the axial anomaly as an infrared phenomenon due to a singularity in the chiral limit in the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram.

2. The authors extend the dolgov and zakharov approach to study radiative decays of pions and Z bosons, calculating decay rates for outgoing leptons in definite helicity states. They examine the structure of mass singularities and their cancellation, studying how the kinoshita-lee-nauenberg theorem applies.

3. For helicity changing processes, the cancellation of collinear singularities occurs through a mechanism different from the usual one of real and virtual compensation. The coefficients of the collinear terms go to zero in the chiral limit, producing the finiteness of the distribution.

4. The authors conclude that the collinear singularity cancellation mechanism for helicity changing processes is controlled by the anomalous breaking of chiral symmetry. The extension of these remarks to other gauge theories like QCD could allow a more systematic treatment of infrared and collinear singularities.

1. The authors explore the problem of salient object detection and segmentation in complex scenes. They note that while many models perform well on simple scenes with a single salient object, performance drops on more cluttered scenes with multiple objects. The authors aim to provide benchmark datasets and a definition of the most salient object to help advance research in this area. They situate salient object detection among related fields like fixation prediction, object detection, and objectness proposal generation.

2. The authors conduct an experiment where participants are asked to choose the single most salient object in a set of images. They find moderate agreement between participants (higher for simpler scenes) and that the selected objects align with free-viewing fixations better than chance. Based on this, they create a dataset (Bruce-A) defining salient objects as those selected by a majority of observers. They note limitations of existing salient object datasets as being biased towards center objects and lacking complex scenes.

3. The authors create an additional salient object dataset (Judd-A) based on an existing dataset of images with eye tracking data. Two observers manually segment all objects in 900 images following specified guidelines. The most salient object in each image is determined based on the object receiving the most fixations. Statistics of the dataset are analyzed, showing a range of 1-31 annotated objects per image, with salient objects having a median size of 10% of the image area.

4. Further analysis of the Judd-A dataset reveals that on average, the most salient object contains over 50% of fixations, despite only occupying a median 10% of the image. The dataset has less photographer bias compared to other datasets, with more off-center salient objects. Salient objects in Judd-A are also smaller on average and the scenes are more complex as measured by the number of superpixels. Common salient objects include people, text, animals, cars, faces, and signs.

It establishes a baseline fluid rate, then alarms visually, audibly and telemetrically if the rate increases beyond a set threshold, indicating bleeding. Vibration buffers isolate the canister and scale.

7. Methods are described for both non-regenerative and regenerative tissue treatment using the device. For non-regenerative treatment, hydrostatic pressure is eliminated, and higher fluid flow rates and suction pressures are used. For regenerative treatment, minimal hydrostatic pressure and lower flow rates and suction are used to avoid disturbing the scaffold. Intermittent dosing is possible in both cases.

1. This patent application describes a biological oil composition derived from the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus that is rich in wax esters, stearidonic acid (SDA), EPA, and DHA. The oil composition differs from other marine oils like fish oil and krill oil in its chemical composition. It contains 70-100% wax esters, 5-20% SDA, 3-15% EPA, and 2-10% DHA.

2. The inventors found that the Calanus oil composition has markedly different biological effects compared to a concentrated EPA/DHA preparation, despite the common understanding that the health benefits of marine oils are primarily due to EPA and DHA. In a mouse study, the Calanus oil significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aorta compared to a control diet, while the EPA/DHA concentrate did not have a statistically significant effect. This suggests the Calanus oil may prevent atherosclerosis through additional or different mechanisms beyond EPA and DHA alone.

3. The Calanus oil also lowered total blood cholesterol levels in the mice, while the EPA/DHA concentrate did not differ from the control. Both the Calanus oil and EPA/DHA slightly lowered triglyceride levels compared to control. Interestingly, the Calanus oil reduced plaque formation despite leading to higher fat deposition in adipose tissue.

4. The Calanus oil composition is proposed for use as a medicament in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and elevated blood cholesterol. It may be used in dietary supplement, functional food, or pharmaceutical formulations. A typical dose range is 4-100 mg/kg body weight per day.

5. In addition to the high wax ester, SDA, EPA and DHA content, the Calanus oil also contains 1000-4000 ppm astaxanthin, mainly in esterified form. The fatty acids are predominantly present as monoesters with long-chain monounsaturated fatty alcohols. Despite the high wax ester content, the oil is a low-viscosity, free-flowing liquid at room temperature.",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 18}"

The ventilatory assistance can be for subjects who are spontaneously breathing or not spontaneously breathing. The invention is especially suitable for spontaneously breathing subjects requiring long-term ventilatory assistance, particularly during sleep.

2. Subjects with severe lung disease, chest wall disease, neuromuscular disease, or diseases of respiratory control may require in-hospital mechanical ventilatory assistance, followed by long-term home mechanical ventilatory assistance, particularly during sleep. The ventilator delivers air or air enriched with oxygen to the subject, via an interface such as a nose mask, at a pressure that is higher during inspiration and lower during expiration. Existing ventilatory devices do not accurately match the amplitude and phase of mask pressure to the subject's spontaneous efforts, leading to discomfort and inefficiency.

3. The goals of an ideal ventilatory assistance device are: (i) to match the phase and degree of assistance to the subject's spontaneous efforts when ventilation is well above a target ventilation; (ii) to automatically adjust the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum ventilation without relying on the integrity of the subject's chemoreflexes; and (iii) to provide some immunity to the effects of sudden leaks. Most simple home ventilators either deliver a fixed volume or cycle between two fixed pressures, and do not meet these goals. Servo-ventilators can maintain a target ventilation but do not meet goals (i) and (iii).

1. This application is a continuation-in-part of previous applications for a disposable depressed center grinding wheel with an integral mounting hub. The invention relates to finishing articles with a mounting hub permanently affixed for quick attachment and release to a portable power tool. A serious problem with such devices is preventing accidental disassociation of the article from the rotatable drive shaft or spindle, especially when the connection is intentionally detachable to facilitate replacement. Traditional methods involved a backing flange, central opening aligned with the wheel opening, and a bolt or nut to clamp the wheel in place, requiring tools for removal.

2. Later developments permanently affixed the mounting hub to the grinding wheel so the entire unit could be quickly attached, detached and discarded when worn down. Adhesives like epoxy resin were used between the backing flange and wheel to secure them rotationally. However, the adhesive could sometimes break loose, so various keyways and corresponding key structures were developed between the wheel and hub, used with the adhesive to prevent rotational movement. The prior art devices generally worked but had disadvantages like added manufacturing labor, need for proper alignment of keyed parts, lack of additional clamping force during use, and bulky, heavy, costly die-cast mounting hubs.

3. The present invention is a finishing article with a drive member non-removably affixed for mounting on a power tool spindle. It includes a backing flange with radially extending gripping means secured by a retaining nut on the opposite side from the flange. The nut extends through an opening from the face to the back of the finishing article and has a radial flange seated against the face and protrusions securing the nut and flange together without adhesives. A pressure cap with a central opening is held by the gripping means and extends to engage the power tool spindle seat, placing the finishing article in compression during use.

4. The depressed center grinding wheel has a disposable drive member or hub assembly permanently affixed without adhesives. When placed in operation on the spindle, the wheel is put in compression - the more force applied during use, the greater the compression becomes. This maintains the wheel on the spindle and prevents it from rotating relative to the drive member. The spent wheel can be easily",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28}"

1. The invention relates to a hydraulic unit for a vehicle brake system that is designed to be immersion-proof. The unit has at least one pump with a piston that is driven by an electric motor via an eccentric rotating in an eccentric chamber. To prevent pressure fluid entrained by the piston from entering the eccentric chamber, a conduit extends downward from the chamber and opens to the atmosphere through the housing block. A check valve in the conduit can open to allow the fluid to flow out and prevent the eccentric chamber from filling with fluid.

2. In another known hydraulic unit, the electric motor is located above the eccentric chamber. A conduit leads from the chamber to a central venting point with an element permeable to air but not water, to equalize pressure while preventing water entry. The unit also has a reservoir for temporarily receiving pressure fluid, consisting of a cylindrical chamber divided into a variable storage chamber and a spring chamber by a displaceable piston. A pressure equalization conduit extends from the spring chamber to the electric motor or a covering hood.

3. The invention aims to deliver pressure fluid entrained into the cam element chamber by the pump piston to the spring chamber, far from electrical components. This allows collecting the fluid in the spring chamber and potentially eliminating the need for permeable elements or check valves at a central venting point. The invention provides cost savings and a hermetic seal, allowing the housing block and pump to be immersed without risk of damage.

4. The invention offers the advantage of economical production of the housing block with fewer conduits that are easier to clean. It allows using a known housing block design without changing its size or basic internal layout. The engineer can decide on the amount of entrained pressure fluid to be stored based on the intended use of the hydraulic unit.

5. The containers for storing the fluid can be practically made using known deep-drawing techniques. The invasion of water between the container fastening portion and housing block is prevented in a production-friendly way. The motor can be delivered complete to the assembly line and fixed to the housing block while simultaneously sealing against water invasion from the environment into the motor and cam element chamber. The seal can be made economically with less sealing material by mounting it as a closed circular worm.

1. This invention relates to a grounding product for railroad car center plate assembly bowl liners made of an all polymeric type. Prior art liners were made of hard metal alloys that required lubrication, ultra high molecular weight polymers that were nonconductive and required separate grounding, or hybridized composite liners with metal reinforcement in a polymer matrix. A molded polyurethane bowl liner using entrained carbon fiber is known, but has different properties and proportions from the present invention.

2. The liner material has similar mechanical properties to the liner disclosed in the Chierici and Murphy patent, but has improved electrical properties. Railroad cars commonly have a body resting on and swivelly connected to a pair of trucks, with the swivel connection formed by the car body bolster center plate resting on the truck bolster bowl. Manganese steel liners between these components required frequent lubrication to avoid inhibiting the swiveling motion and causing excess wear.

3. The Chierici and Murphy patent discloses a truck bolster bowl liner made of an ultra high molecular weight polymer with dry self lubricating characteristics. The bowl liner is shaped to space the car body bolster center plate from the truck bolster bowl side wall and hold it against end of car impacts. Alternative embodiments include a flat horizontal disk formed liner and additional configurations for a top edge seal.

4. The all plastic bowl liner establishes two slip surfaces in the center plate assembly, ensuring adequate truck swiveling action and providing wear resistance. However, the polymeric material is electrically insulating, so the car body bolster center plate and truck bolster bowl require grounding, even though the bolster center pin may provide some electrical conductivity. Cars using the Chierici and Murphy liner had to incorporate grounding apparatus like conductive shunt clips and metal rivets, which are subject to wear and tear and can provide increased friction.

1. This invention relates to a novel sanitizable rotary valve that may be used with liquid chromatographic columns and sanitary liquid handling systems to separate biological molecules. The valve combines elements from the prior art but adds the unique feature of partial separation of the rotor-stator faces to allow flushing across the fluid-contacting surfaces. A novel diaphragm-like elastomeric seal functions to both seal the faces together in normal use and retain the sanitizing fluids when the faces are separated for cleaning.

2. The valve comprises a rotor with an elastomeric diaphragm molded to form multiple sealing ports that engage ports in the stator face. The diaphragm has molded ports or grooves that form sanitary ducts leading through the rotor body and terminating as flanges for connecting to sanitary piping. The external limit of the diaphragm forms a flexible wiping lip seal that maintains fluid-tight sealing with the stator face even when the rotor is moved away to permit cross flushing of the sealing faces.

3. The sealing force is minimized by relieving material from the stator or rotor diaphragm to form port-sealing ledges and adjoining gutters. The gutters may carry a barrier fluid to capture and sweep away any process fluid that escapes the port seals, preventing accumulation of dried material and environmental contamination. The valve allows the rotor-stator faces to be intermittently flushed and cleaned while maintaining the sterile condition of the process system.

1. This invention relates to an improved process for the deacylation and desulfurization of a compound having a specific formula. The improved process employs hypophosphorous acid to improve product yield and reduce unwanted impurities. Pyrazolotriazoles, such as those described, are useful magenta couplers for photographic products but are difficult to synthesize with only a few known synthetic routes. One preferred route involves preparing triazolothiadiazines and subsequently desulfurizing them to give the pyrazolotriazoles.

2. The desulfurization of the triazolothiadiazines to pyrazolotriazoles is done in two steps: first, a ring contraction reaction by heating in acetic anhydride to give an acetylated intermediate, and second, hydrolysis of acetyl groups and simultaneous desulfurization with hydrochloric acid. Although this is the most attractive method, it has drawbacks for manufacturing. The ring contraction is clean but slow, while the hydrolysis and desulfurization generate elemental sulfur and many sulfur-containing organic impurities. These impurities, especially two major ones identified as a thione and disulfide, seem to result from the action of elemental sulfur on a mercapto intermediate.

3. The elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities are considered detrimental as they can interfere with subsequent reaction steps and are potential foggers in photographic systems. The process of this invention is a significant advance as it produces much smaller amounts of these impurities and is straightforward to carry out. The improvement comprises a deacylation and desulfurization step conducted in the presence of hypophosphorous acid, which reduces the amount of elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities compared to when it is not used.

4. Using hypophosphorous acid provides several advantages beyond reducing undesirable by-products and increasing product yield. It results in the formation of H2S by-product rather than sulfur, which is readily removed and trapped due to its gaseous nature and chemical reactivity. Furthermore, hypophosphorous acid does not reduce nitro groups commonly present on",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 36}"

1. The invention relates to a method and apparatus for forming fiber mixtures from different fiber bales by sequentially taking small partial quantities. Existing methods have disadvantages such as fiber residuals remaining in bales and non-homogeneous mixtures.

2. The invention aims to eliminate these disadvantages by measuring the entire quantity of each fiber bale before each pass of the bale opener and determining a partial quantity corresponding to a proportion of the momentary entire quantity. This partial quantity is then continuously removed only from the measured fiber bale.

3. An alternative is to measure only the initial total quantity of each bale and calculate a constant partial quantity to be removed in a fixed number of passes. To maintain a time schedule, the invention sets a predetermined time period for removing the partial quantity from each bale.

4. The apparatus includes a bale opener for removing fibers, a quantity measuring device associated with the opener, and a control device that controls the opener based on signals from the measuring device. The quantity measuring device is preferably a height-measuring arrangement that moves with the bale opener.

5. The control arrangement has a computer that determines precise partial quantities and controls fiber removal. It also includes a timing relay to ensure partial quantities are removed within the predetermined period.

6. The control apparatus controls the carriage displacement, positioning, and starting, as well as the beginning and end of fiber removal for each partial quantity. Limit switches are used for reversing the bale opener direction and reducing the number of remaining passes.

7. In one embodiment, the bale opener moves horizontally on a carriage past the bales, with a light barrier height-measuring device. In another embodiment, the bale opener moves vertically, engaging bale tops, with an electromechanical height-measuring device.

8. Examples illustrate removing partial quantities from multiple bales over a set number of passes. The removal speed is adjusted if the predetermined time period for removing the partial quantity is not met.

1. The invention is directed to a method and apparatus for forming bias laid, non-woven fabrics where the yarns in at least two layers are laid at an angle of 30° to 150° to the long axis of the fabric. A rake mechanism, synchronized with but driven separately from the conveyors, yarn carrying means, and bonding mechanism, is associated with needles on the conveyors to ensure parallelism of the yarns. The rake needles are angled to correspond to the angle of the approaching yarns being fed by the yarn carriers at each end of their travel. The rake accepts and retains the yarns carried by the yarn carriers at the extremities of their travel, and through movement opposed to the conveyor direction, places the yarns onto or between the conveyor needles.

2. Two modes of rake operation are possible - the rake may move a distance equal to the width of the yarns being carried (a full course) or a fraction of the width (a partial course), allowing control of overlap and density of each layer. While the disclosure primarily describes using a sewing machine to bind the fabric layers together, other methods like knitting or adhesive bonding can also be employed. The number of yarn carriers, and thus the number of layers, is determined by the end use of the fabric, and warp or weft layers can also be included in addition to the bias laid layers.

1. The invention relates to weft insertion in multiple-color air jet looms, where different weft threads require different weft carrying forces. Prior looms used uniform air pressure regardless of the weft thread type, resulting in varying insertion speeds and wasted air. The invention aims to provide appropriate weft carrying forces for each weft thread type to ensure consistent insertion speed and prevent air waste. This is achieved by ejecting air at different pressures or for different time intervals based on the selected weft thread.

2. In the first embodiment, the invention divides the subnozzles into groups spaced at different intervals to produce varying combined air stream pressures. The second embodiment uses subnozzles with different orifice sizes and supplies air at different pressures to the subnozzle groups. The third embodiment employs directional control valves to selectively supply air to the appropriate subnozzle groups. These arrangements allow the weft carrying force to be adjusted for each weft thread type.

3. The fourth embodiment uses regulators, accumulator tanks, and control valves to supply air at different pressures to the main nozzle and subnozzles based on the selected weft thread. An electric signal generator synchronizes the pressure control with the loom operation. The fifth embodiment simplifies this by using a single remotely controlled pressure regulator valve. The sixth embodiment uses separate on-off valves and tanks to supply different air pressures to a pair of main nozzles.

2. The bobbin housing has a triangular shoulder with front and rear side faces on the loop cast-off side. A spring rod is fastened between front and rear cams, with its free end located between the rear side face of the shoulder and the rear cam.

3. When the sewing machine is running, the rear side face of the shoulder engages the spring rod, preventing the bobbin housing from co-rotating with the hook body. A capsule release device can give the bobbin housing a rotational impulse counter to the hook rotation direction, briefly moving the rear side face away from the spring rod to allow unhindered passage of the needle thread loop.

4. During stitch formation, the hook tip seizes the needle thread loop and expands it around the bobbin housing. The needle thread loop moves through the gap between the capsule release device finger and the bobbin housing cutout abutment surface without hindrance at its greatest expansion.

5. As the thread take-up lever pulls back the needle thread loop, it drops off the hook tip, moves through the gap between the front side face and front cam, slides over the shoulder tip, and passes through the gap created by the capsule release device between the rear side face and spring rod. The needle thread loop is then pulled back completely through the stitch hole with a section of the hook thread.

6. The rotary hook allows for especially jerk-free and low-friction motion of the needle thread loop. Even without the capsule release device, only slight bending of the low-mass spring rod occurs, resulting in comparatively good sewing properties with only a small increase in required needle thread tension compared to conventional rotary hooks.

1. The present invention relates to a sewing machine detector for detecting the position of a sewing needle and the speed of the sewing machine. The detector is integral with the drive and control elements of the sewing machine. Conventional detectors use rotary reflective discs which are prone to vibration and wear, leading to misalignment of optical axes and inability to receive signals. The reflective discs are also difficult and expensive to machine, and make the detecting section thick and non-compact.

2. In the conventional detector, the optical fibers used for sending and receiving light must be flexed due to the curvature of the reflective discs. This imposes significant stress on the optical fibers, especially at the point of insertion into the optical fiber supporter. The elasticity of the fibers combined with the vibration can cause the optical fiber supporter to fracture. Large curvature radius also decreases the light transmitting efficiency of the optical fibers, necessitating expensive optical fibers.

3. The conventional apparatus also includes a power indicating light with lead wires running through the cable. These lead wires can act as antennas, picking up electromagnetic interference from nearby high frequency welders and affecting the control circuitry. The present invention aims to overcome these disadvantages by providing a low-price, durable, compact detector that minimizes stress on the optical fibers and eliminates electrical interference in the power indicating light.

4. The preferred embodiment of the present invention uses flat, sheet-shaped first, second and third light shielding discs mounted coaxially to the sewing machine shaft. The first disc detects sewing machine speed and needle UP position, the second disc detects needle DOWN position, and the third disc detects thread trimmer timing position. The discs are made of light-transmitting synthetic resin with light shielding areas, angle setting scale, and angle indications printed on them.

1. The patent application is a continuation-in-part of a previous application. It addresses the problem of washing pulp after oxygen bleaching, where entrained oxygen reduces vacuum and causes foam in the washer. Previous solutions like the ""Deculator"" process and others involve expensive equipment like vacuum systems and pressure vessels.

2. The inventors devised a small, inexpensive deaeration tank with no moving parts that can operate at atmospheric pressure or low pressure/vacuum. It is the same diameter as the oxygen reactor so it can be placed on top and supported by the reactor. The tank has an inlet pipe, outlet, and tangential swirl-inducing inlet pipe at optimized locations and sizes.

3. In the overall oxygen bleaching process, pulp is pumped, mixed with steam to heat it, and mixed with oxygen. The oxygenated pulp flows to the top of a tower, then to the deaeration tank inlet. The deaerated pulp exits the bottom of the tank to a pulp washer.

4. The washer mat is washed, dewatered, and the washed pulp exits. Filtrate from the mat goes to a filtrate tank. Some filtrate is used as counterflow wash water in an earlier washer, while some goes to the deaeration tank as the swirling fluid to maintain 1-5% consistency.

5. The cylindrical deaeration tank has an open top, flat bottom, and diameter 0.75-1.5 times the oxygen reactor diameter. The exterior height is 1-3 times the diameter to prevent spillover. The nominal pulp slurry height is 0.4-1.0 times the diameter.

It uses a combination of electrohydraulic (EH) and electromagnetic (EM) pulses to stimulate oil flow in reservoirs. The EH pulses generate acoustic waves while the EM pulses induce high-frequency vibrations in the reservoir.

2. The invention improves upon prior acoustic stimulation methods by using EM pulses to induce vibrations at greater distances and higher frequencies than possible with just acoustic waves. Multiple pulse sources can be placed in one well or multiple wells to optimize stimulation of the reservoir. The pulse characteristics can be customized to activate specific scales of reservoir features.

3. The downhole sonde includes a power conversion system, capacitor bank, and EH and/or EM discharge devices. Improvements include processors for control, a gyro for orientation, and sequential firing of multiple sondes. The EM source is a single-turn magnetic coil that produces a magnetic pulse without a strong acoustic pulse.

4. The acoustic and EM pulses stimulate oil flow at different scales in the reservoir, from pores to fractures to bedding planes. The EM pulse induces high-frequency vibrations while the acoustic pulse assists at further distances before attenuating. Multiple sources can be arranged and fired to direct stimulation to desired regions between injector and producer wells.

Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) structures use horizontally positioned soil inclusions to reinforce an earth mass in combination with a facing element. The basic MSE technology involves sequentially positioning layers of backfill and horizontally placed soil reinforcing elements until a desired height is achieved. A typical soil reinforcing element includes a welded wire grid with longitudinal wires joined to transverse wires, and has a wall end for connecting to a vertical facing.

2. The longitudinal wires of the soil reinforcing element extend several feet into the backfill before terminating at reinforcing ends. Longer soil reinforcing elements are needed where added tensile resistance is required, but single elements often cannot be manufactured or transported at the required lengths. A system and method of splicing soil reinforcing elements to extend their length is needed. Embodiments provide a splice for a soil reinforcing element, including first and second wave plates with transverse protrusions to receive transverse wires of the reinforcing element and a grid-strip.

It comprises steps at the traveling path ends with an expansion gap between, elastic members mounted inside the steps, and a joint block mounted on the elastic members across the expansion gap. The joint block prevents tire fall-in and stuck-in situations for smooth and safe vehicle traveling while maintaining the expansion gap function. The joint block, made of the same concrete as the traveling path, provides increased slip resistance compared to rubber or steel expansion joints.

2. Supporting blocks can be mounted inside the steps with the joint block between to protect the traveling path ends from damage due to tire impingement and impact. The supporting blocks, made of concrete or high-strength fiber-reinforced concrete like the traveling path and joint block, are detachably fitted to the intra-step traveling path side walls to form a continuous traveling path surface and can be easily replaced if damaged. Intermediate joint blocks can also be mounted inside the steps with the joint block between to decentralize the expansion gap into smaller gaps, further preventing tire fall-in and stuck-in situations and improving driving quality.

3. Using joint blocks, supporting blocks, and intermediate joint blocks of the same concrete quality as the traveling path leads to uniform wear and easier difference-in-level management of the joints.

The key components are designed to be stronger and deliver more power compared to previous tools where critical parts were delivered on a dart.

2. The tool has a central passage that can be open to allow wireline or other tools to pass through. This passage can be subsequently closed by landing a removable plug on a seat. The dump valve is annularly disposed around the central passage so it does not slam against a seat during cycling.

3. The tool delivers additional power per stroke using modular stacked piston units. It can be operated to apply high amplitude, low frequency oscillating forces to a stuck fish with or without impacts of the pistons on the housing. The amount of overpull applied by rig personnel determines whether impacts occur.

4. The outer tool body has a lower end attached to the stuck fish and an upper end connected to the mandrel. The mandrel extends uphole and connects to the surface through a string. Pressure is delivered from the surface through the mandrel passage to lateral ports at different elevations.

5. Each lateral port leads to an annular space that communicates with a piston attached to the mandrel. Pressure in this space pushes the piston and mandrel down while displacing fluid from a chamber. The piston arrangement is modular, allowing the number of stacked pistons to be varied to increase the total piston area and delivered power.

6. With the plug landed, pressure is applied to the mandrel passage and builds on the piston(s) to move the mandrel downward. The cylindrical dump valve initially rides on a surface to hold pressure as the mandrel movement stretches the string. At some point, the valve moves off this surface, breaking the seal and relieving pressure.

1. This invention relates to a mechanism for installing and removing objects in wells, including objects that may be stuck or lost within a well bore. The mechanism can take the form of an external pull tool or overshot, or an internal pull tool or spear. It consists of an outer tubular body with an inner body structure disposed in movable relation, and telescoping movement of the inner and outer body structures causes the overshot or spear to selectively move into gripping relationship with the object to be removed. A catch mechanism with a locking and unlocking position, depending on the relative positions of the inner and outer body structures, is used to secure the tubular outer body about the inner body.

2. A pin structure forming part of the catch mechanism is selectively positioned within pin receiving grooves, and a control spring ensures the pin alternately enters either the unlocking or locking grooves each time the inner and outer body structures are cycled linearly relative to one another. If the tool is locked to the object in the well bore, unlocking can be achieved by downward movement of the control line tool followed by subsequent upward movement. Conversely, if the pulling tool is unlocked from the down hole object, locking can be achieved by downward movement followed by subsequent upward movement. The invention is effectively adapted to be provided on a wire line controlled pulling tool and run into the well casing or well bore to establish a mechanical connection with an object and apply sufficient force to remove it.

1. The present application claims priority to several previously filed patent applications. It relates to modular composed stave floors, also known as engineering floors. These floors have drawbacks in the prior art related to the thin thickness of the sight substrate which can lead to deformation and detachment.

2. Known stave floors have a sight substrate thickness of only 2-3 mm, which is too thin. When this thin layer is sanded or rushed for maintenance, the remaining material can deform and detach, ruining the floor's appearance and properties. The sight substrate is made of ""de-rolled"" wood from a tree trunk, which tends to want to curl back to its original cylindrical shape.

3. The base substrate is typically made of plywood sheets joined by glue. Using only glue has disadvantages - the sheets can deform or displace relative to each other during the long glue curing time of several days. A uniform, level assembly surface and constant pressure are needed for proper glue adhesion between the substrates.

4. The thin noble layer gives the floors a short lifespan with no possibility for corrective maintenance. Though the materials come pre-varnished, the thin sheet doesn't provide a solid attachment base, so the varnish resistance is poor and susceptible to scratching and peeling. Preventing displacement between the bonded sheets has been an ongoing problem not optimally solved by prior patent applications.

5. The example embodiment provides a method to manufacture composed stave floors. It uses a sight substrate at least 4 mm thick and a base substrate at least 12 mm thick. The substrates are assembled together with glue and multidirectional holding means consisting of dendrites, horizontal adhesion and reinforcement in the union plane, and vertical adhesion and reinforcement perpendicular to the union plane.

6. The example embodiments aim to preserve the physical, aesthetic and functional properties of the sight substrate, prevent sight substrate deformation, bond the sheets without displacement using various means, provide longer floor life with the ability for corrective maintenance, and allow pre-applied glazes for improved hardness without aesthetic changes. Numerical ranges are approximations that can vary based on desired properties.

1. The invention relates to ladder attachments for positioning the ladder away from the work surface and preventing slipping or defacing the surface. Ladders are used to reach high places for tasks like climbing onto roofs, washing windows, or painting. The bottom of the ladder rests on the ground while the top leans against the building or work surface at an angle that makes climbing easy and prevents slipping. However, ladders can be unstable, especially when reaching outside the rails, causing the ladder to slide and damage the work surface.

2. Another problem is that the small contact area of the ladder rails can dent, scrape, or deface the work surface. It is desirable to have a ladder with a broad contact surface that does not damage the work surface. Additionally, work surfaces with corners are problematic because positioning the ladder on one surface makes the other difficult to reach, while straddling the corner with the ladder is unstable. The invention aims to overcome these problems.

3. The invention is a brace for a ladder with two siderails connected by rungs. It has an extension arm with a flange on one end with openings for a U-bolt. The U-bolt legs go through the flange openings and have threaded ends spaced to receive a ladder rung, secured by nuts. A resilient pad assembly is pivotally connected to the extension arm's distal end.

4. The invention's objectives are to provide a non-slip gripping portion that doesn't damage the work surface, increase the ladder's contact area with the work surface, improve the ladder's lateral stability, and enable the ladder to straddle corners without losing stability.

1. The invention relates to a collated nail strip for use in fastener driving tools. The nail strip includes a row of nails arranged parallel to each other, with each nail having a shank. A plastic collation system is molded onto and adhered to the nails, defining a collar portion that encircles the nail shank and a connecting portion extending between adjacent collar portions.

2. The plastic collation material is formulated from an adhesive polymer such as a polyolefin, polyolefin blend, or epoxy. Preheating the nails to 450-600°F prior to molding the plastic material onto the nails results in significantly increased adhesion. The collar portion remains adhered to the nail as it penetrates the substrate, minimizing debris generation.

3. The connecting portion can be formed as a bridge and rib with a cruciform shape, with the rib parallel to or angled relative to the collation axis. Alternatively, the connecting portion can have an embossed pattern. Upper and lower plastic moldings can be formed parallel to each other, with the lower molding within 1/2 inch of the nail tip.

4. Preferentially weakened regions, such as notches or thinner cross-sections, can be formed in the connecting portions to influence separation at desired locations and reduce debris. The nails can be positioned eccentrically in the collars to create thinner regions. Tapered elements and shorter, thicker ribs can also facilitate penetration and reduce debris.

5. Additional features to reduce debris include rings or serrations on the nail shanks to expand the opening in the substrate, deformations under the collation to increase adhesion, and forming the lower collation narrower than the upper one. Placing the collation closer to the nail tip increases penetration depth. Separating the connecting portion as close as possible to the trailing nail further minimizes debris.

6. The various embodiments are configured to minimize corrugation of the nail strip while reducing debris generated when a nail is driven. The collation system provides increased rigidity and predictable separation without requiring significant additional force to drive the nails. The disclosed concepts can be applied to other strip-formed fasteners and consumables.

1. The invention relates to position and motion sensors, particularly for monitoring moving parts in mechanical systems like diesel engine fuel injectors. Multiplexing sensors on a minimum number of wires is desirable to reduce cost and wiring complexity.

2. The sensor comprises a waveform generator that modifies an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer based on an error correction signal, and an error correction generator that provides the error correction signal. The error correction generator has a comparator, controller, and signal processor to determine and eliminate static and error signals that would waste energy.

3. A window reference circuit compares the conditioned sensor output to preset high and low reference signals and adjusts it if needed. The signal processor generates a small reference signal to eliminate drift and a large reference signal to allow rapid recalibration after sudden offset changes.

4. Upon power-up, a preset causes the sensor output to go to zero, minimizing current draw during startup and initial calibration. The sensor connects to a remote monitoring system through two wires, with a resistor converting the sensor's voltage output to a modulated current.

5. A voltage divider network sets the window comparator levels. If the sensor output is below the window, the controller causes rapid counting to raise the output, and slow counting once inside the window to maintain the baseline at the lower edge.

6. Sudden parameter changes causing a rapid, large increase in the sensor output will not trigger a recalibration since the upper window level is set higher than the dynamic signal range from object movement. This allows the sensor to maintain calibration during normal object motion.

2. The main objects of this invention are to provide a waste fuel burner that emits minimal particulate matter, produces little slag or clinkers, can burn wet wood effectively, is self-regulating with fast response times, and burns wood cleanly to produce ash free of clinkers. This is achieved by forming a conical pile of waste fuel, fed from below, with controlled amounts of preheated underfire air percolating up through the pile to dry and gasify the fuel.

3. Volatile gases driven off the pile are partially oxidized by swirl air introduced tangentially in a primary combustion chamber, with the total combustion air kept below stoichiometric proportions to maintain a lower temperature. The swirl air also forces particulate out of the gas stream leaving the primary chamber.

4. The gases then pass around an air-cooled flame holder which forces them and any entrained particulate to the walls of the throat, causing the particulate to separate and fall back. In the secondary combustion chamber, secondary air is introduced tangentially to an amount above stoichiometric for complete combustion.

5. The swirl air and secondary air interact to maintain good separation of particulate from the gas stream leaving the primary chamber, keeping it out of the secondary chamber where high temperatures could cause slag.

1. The invention relates to an air intake device for an internal combustion engine that utilizes dynamic air flow effects to improve engine volumetric efficiency. Analysis has shown that placing the air inlet pipe upstream of the air cleaner as short as possible enhances the dynamic effect. However, this also increases intake noise.

2. The invention comprises a tank connected to the intake passage by a first pipe and a second pipe, with the second pipe having a smaller cross-sectional area than the first pipe. A valve is disposed in the first pipe and actuated based on engine operating conditions. The second pipe acts as a resonator with the tank to reduce intake noise.

3. Volumetric efficiency curves show that controlling the valve to select the peak portions of the curves with the valve open and closed can improve engine performance. The noise reduction is achieved by the resonator effect of the tank and second narrow pipe, bringing noise within permissible levels. The second pipe should be located as close to the air cleaner as possible to minimize its impact on the dynamic effect.

4. The valve is controlled to open and close based on the engine speed and load conditions. At low loads, the valve remains closed at all speeds. At higher loads, the valve is opened and closed at specific speed thresholds where the efficiency curves intersect. Preferably, the valve is only opened at higher loads and speeds above a certain threshold, as determined by a control map based on speed and throttle position sensors.

It uses control valve positions as feedback to maintain constant total mass flow through parallel turbine inlet control valves. This maintains steam generator pressure constant and minimizes turbine power changes during testing. The flow characteristics for each valve in the N and N-1 valve conditions are determined during turbine design.

2. Figure 1 shows the difference in flow characteristics between N and N-1 turbine flow control valves. Curve 12 shows total flow vs. stem lift for four valves, while curve 14 shows total flow for three valves with one closed for testing. Curve 16 represents the actual flow difference between the four-valve and three-valve conditions. Curve 18 is a smoothed version of curve 16 used to control flow change in the three open valves to minimize disturbance when the fourth valve is closed and reopened.

3. Figure 2 shows a block diagram of how mass flow through parallel turbine inlet control valves is controlled. Outputs from load, speed, and pressure sensors are used by controllers to generate a total flow demand signal (TCV Reference). This signal is fed to a test control circuit that converts it to a valve position demand signal for closed-loop control of each valve's lift position. A test compensation circuit uses control valve positions as feedback to adjust flow through parallel valves and minimize disturbance during valve testing.

The test compensation array translates the TCV Reference signal to a flow compensation value for the valves not being tested. This is multiplied by a compensation reference signal that varies from 0 to 1 as the tested valve is closed and reopened. The multiplier output is added to the TCV Reference signal to determine the valve lift for the non-tested valves to maintain constant total flow.

The valve has two inlets A and B, and one outlet, where the outlet mixture can range from 0% inlet A fluid and 100% inlet B fluid to 100% inlet A fluid and 0% inlet B fluid. Various pressurized cleaning apparatuses are known, such as using a garden hose connected to a household faucet, or systems at car washes that mix water with soap or wax.

However, many applications require electric fans to move air across components at a higher rate to prevent overheating. Cooling fans are a low cost solution for keeping electronic components within acceptable temperature ranges.

Although widely used, this fastening technique significantly increases product cost due to the labor, tools, and handling required to install the fasteners. The disclosed embodiments eliminate the need for traditional fasteners to secure cooling fans to an enclosure.

1. Spacecraft structures require lightweight composite materials, but these have little inherent damping, subjecting instruments to high vibration levels. Precision kinematic mounts (KMs) used to support instruments also have very little damping. Efforts to modify graphite structures to reduce vibration may not be sufficient, necessitating additional vibration reduction techniques for instruments.

2. Conventional kinematic mounts provide restraint against translations and rotations but have limited success in minimizing loads transmitted to instruments. The present invention provides kinematic mounts that incorporate damping features using passive energy dissipating mechanisms. These damped mounts aim to protect instruments from potentially damaging flight loads while preserving fundamental features like strength, stiffness, and kinematic properties.

3. One embodiment uses a spherical damper with viscoelastic material between two shells, while another uses o-rings or washers in cylindrical slots. The viscoelastic material's frequency-dependent properties allow high damping during launch and negligible added stiffness during on-orbit thermal loads. Analysis indicates that damped mounts can increase damping by an order of magnitude, significantly reducing the instrument's vibration response.

4. Alternative damped kinematic mount designs, such as using truss structures or a set of three damped mounts, can also be employed. A center-of-gravity mounting system with uncoupled modes can be achieved by arranging the mounts in a specific manner, which is beneficial for instruments with dynamic disturbances.

1. This application claims benefit of a German patent application and relates to a system for compensating electromagnetic interfering fields, particularly magnetic fields, using two sensors and a digital processor. Feedback control systems are commonly used to measure the interfering field amplitude with sensors and generate compensation fields using actuators. The magnetic field to be compensated may be the Earth's field or fields from nearby current-carrying devices.

2. Magnetic field compensation systems are used with devices like scanning electron microscopes that are sensitive to magnetic fields. For homogeneous interfering fields, the compensation fields should also be homogeneous, which can be generated using Helmholtz coil pairs. Using one Helmholtz coil pair for each spatial axis forms a cube-shaped cage around the location where fields are to be compensated.

3. Some systems use only a single coil per axis, resulting in a smaller compensation region compared to Helmholtz coils. A single sensor cannot detect if the interfering field is homogeneous or inhomogeneous at the object location. It is also problematic to measure the field directly at the object location and undesired feedback can occur between two closely spaced compensation systems.

4. The invention aims to compensate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields, simulate measuring at the object location, and equalize feedback between adjacent systems. It uses two triaxial sensors, three compensation coil pairs, and a digital control unit. The six sensor outputs are combined into three virtual sensor outputs through a definable averaging method.

1. This invention pertains to using waveguide holograms as illuminators for objects with specific illumination requirements, such as display holograms or spatial light modulators. The illumination system comprises a thin substrate waveguide optically coupled to a coherent light source like a laser. These waveguide holograms provide extremely high diffraction efficiencies. Non-uniformity of the diffracted wavefront can be compensated for by exposing a photographic emulsion to the beam or by recording the hologram non-uniformly.

2. Waveguide hologram illuminators are compact and rugged compared to conventional lens illumination systems. They occupy much less space, with the active volume being significantly smaller than conventional systems. Waveguide holograms can achieve very high diffraction efficiency approaching 0.99, and importantly, the absence of stray light propagating forward to the observer is ideal.

3. However, waveguide holograms have some drawbacks, such as critical alignment of the laser beam leading to lack of ruggedness, and time delay across the hologram causing clock skew issues. Nonuniformity of the diffracted wavefront along the propagation direction is inevitable unless combated, as light diffracted out at one point is not available for diffraction later. The hologram tends to produce two diffracted beams, one out of each side, which can be an advantage for display holograms but not for illuminator holograms.

4. Alignment sensitivity can be addressed by firmly attaching the source to the waveguide edge or input coupler, or by using a broad source and allowing the waveguide to select the properly matched portion of light. Illumination depletion can be compensated for a priori by recording the hologram nonuniformly, or a posteriori by exposing a photographic emulsion to the uncompensated beam. The two-sidedness problem can be solved by absorbing light from one side, placing a mirror on one side, or using off-axis illumination.

5. Two basic architectures were used to record the waveguide hologram grating: a modified conventional holographic recording system with a cubic glass prism to create a steep incidence angle reference beam, and a configuration",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The invention relates to a method and apparatus for non-destructive testing of dynamoelectric machine rotors, particularly squirrel cage rotors for induction motors. The apparatus comprises a test head that accepts the rotor and causes relative angular movement between the rotor and test head, and includes exciting means for magnetizing the rotor during this angular movement in response to an alternating current. Voltage and current sensing means generate signals responsive to the magnetic flux variations and alternating current magnitude, which are used by processing means to determine the rotor's resistance and reactance.

2. The apparatus may also include skew sensing means for generating a signal responsive to the rotor's effective electrical skew, which the processing means uses to determine the rotor's skew. The test apparatus automatically performs the rotor test and makes pass/fail determinations when a test sequence is initiated, controlling the rotor's rotation, data acquisition, and data processing without further operator intervention. The apparatus can test the rotor independent of the stator and provides detailed statistical data on the rotor's electrical characteristics.

3. The test head has a unique construction similar to a dynamoelectric machine stator, with a magnetic core, primary windings that magnetize the rotor, and secondary windings that sense the induced voltage and skew. During a test, the primary windings are energized by an alternating current, creating an alternating magnetic field that magnetizes the rotor as it rotates in the test head. This induces voltages and currents in the rotor, generating magnetic flux that is sensed by the secondary windings.

4. The sensed signals are sampled and digitized by a data acquisition system, and the digitized data is processed to calculate the rotor's resistance, reactance, effective skew, and other statistical parameters. These calculated values are compared to predefined thresholds to determine if the rotor passes or fails the test. The test results and statistical data are displayed for the operator and can be printed and stored for further analysis.

1. The invention relates to a method for easily and quickly determining optimum feedback gain values used in feedback control. It involves provisionally determining feedback gain values, executing feedback control, detecting errors, calculating evaluation values, and determining optimum gain values based on the relation between gain values and evaluation values.

2. The method is applied to controlling an automatic guidance vehicle (AGV) to run along a predetermined course. The AGV has a lateral deviation detector to detect its deviation from an induction wire laid along the course, and the deviation is used as an error signal for feedback control.

3. Evaluation functions are introduced to evaluate the influence of each gain (proportional P, integral I, and differential D) on the error curve. The ratio of the length of the error curve to the measurement time (LR) evaluates the P gain, the integral of error (Svv) evaluates the I gain, and the integral of the absolute error (Asv) evaluates the D gain.

4. Optimum gain values correspond to the minimum of the LR curve, zero of the Svv curve, and minimum of the Asv curve when plotted against their respective gains. Optimum values can be determined by checking if the evaluation value is within a predefined optimum range or by function interpolation using multiple evaluation values.

5. In the first embodiment, the AGV runs repeatedly in each section of an oval course and optimum P, I and D gains are determined for each section separately. The gains are initialized to small values, then increased in steps until the evaluation value meets end conditions, at which point the gain is considered optimum.

1. The invention relates to zoom lenses with increased relative aperture and good optical performance while minimizing size, particularly suited for photographic and video cameras. There is a demand for zoom lenses with a good compromise between high relative aperture, high zoom range, and compactness while maintaining high optical quality. Current video cameras commonly use 2/3 in. image pickup tubes, but there is a trend towards more compact 8 mm video cameras using 1/2 in. image pickup tubes or plates. Achieving a high relative aperture of F/1.4-1.6 in a 4-unit zoom lens requires proper lens design, particularly for the fourth lens unit after the zoom section and the fifth lens unit forming the image.

2. To shorten the total length of the zoom lens, the size of the front or first lens unit should be reduced, which can be achieved by increasing the F-number, but this must be balanced to avoid an excessive increase. Merely strengthening the refractive power of each lens unit to reduce size and increase relative aperture leads to large increases in aberrations such as spherical aberration, coma, and sagittal halo, making it difficult to maintain high optical performance. Increasing the refractive power of the first lens unit requires a compensating increase in the overall magnifying power of subsequent lens units, increasing aberrations and making lens design tolerances more severe. Prior art zoom lenses for 2/3 in. image pickup elements have total lengths of 10 to 12 times the diagonal of the effective picture frame, which is relatively long and difficult to shorten below 10 times the diagonal while preserving good optical performance.

3. The object of the invention is to provide a zoom lens with a small F-number, high zoom ratio, reduced total size, and high optical quality throughout the zoom range. The invention achieves this in a zoom lens with a positive first unit for focusing, negative second unit for varying magnification, negative third unit for compensating image plane shift, positive fourth unit for converting the diverging light from the third unit to nearly parallel light, and a fifth unit for image formation with six lenses of positive, negative, positive, negative, positive and positive powers.

1. The present invention relates to content synchronization frameworks using dynamic attributes and file bundles for connected devices. Existing data synchronization methods have limitations in terms of attribute-based synchronization, prioritization, bundling of related data sets, and handling of connection disruptions. The present invention aims to address these limitations and provide a more flexible and efficient synchronization framework. The framework includes a central reference point that processes synchronization requests from connected client devices and returns responses containing file bundles.

2. A content synchronization method involves the client device sending context and dynamic attributes to the central reference point. The central reference point constructs response bundles compatible with the client device, prioritizes the download order of files, and sends the response bundles to the client. The client creates a delta list of files to be downloaded, downloads the files in the specified order, overwrites outdated local files, and confirms complete download of bundles while rejecting incomplete bundles. The framework supports multiple languages, character sets, and client operating systems.

3. The synchronization framework consists of four main components: client devices, a central reference point server, a network, and external partners. Client devices synchronize content from synchronization servers and external partners over the network. The central reference point server hosts algorithms and communicates with clients and external partners to provide relevant content based on client context. Data compression is used to optimize bandwidth usage and support low-bandwidth connections.

4. The synchronization process involves the client sending a request with contextual information to the central reference point server. The server analyzes the request, combines it with additional attributes from external partners if needed, and composes a response containing prioritized file bundles. The client device creates a delta list of files to be downloaded, retrieves the files from the specified servers, and synchronizes them with local copies. The server can cache responses for efficiency, and the client can optimize download order based on communication speed and geographical proximity of download sites.

2. The glasses contain a digital sensor to capture images from the motion picture, a processor to analyze the images for synchronization events, and circuitry to control the darkening of each lens. The processor detects lateral motion in the images and darkens the appropriate lens to create the Pulfrich 3D illusion.

3. The invention solves problems with previous 3D motion picture systems by not requiring any special filming or projection equipment. It works with any standard motion picture format.

4. The Pulfrich 3D effect is created by selectively darkening one lens, which causes a slight delay in the image reaching that eye. When lateral motion is present, the delay causes the eyes to see the images from slightly different perspectives, resulting in the perception of depth.

5. The glasses can take 3 lens states: both clear, left clear/right dark, or left dark/right clear. The lens state is determined by the direction of lateral motion detected - left-to-right motion darkens the right lens, right-to-left motion darkens the left lens.

6. The glasses include a Glass Lens Controller Unit (GLCU) which has a digital sensor, processor, lens control circuitry, and battery. The processor runs a lens control algorithm that analyzes the digitized images for synchronization events and controls the lens states.

7. The lens control algorithm uses an intensity edge finding method to detect prominent vertical edges in successive frames. By tracking the position of the edges, it can determine the direction of lateral motion and the appropriate lens state.

8. A decision rule is continuously evaluated to determine if a synchronization event is detected that requires darkening a lens. If no event is detected, both lenses are set to clear.

Conventional FED devices emit electrons from a cathode that strike nitrogen and oxygen gas, forming positive ions. These ions discharge to the cathode, causing electrical current surges that can burn and damage the field emission elements.

2. The protection structure of the present invention includes one or more reduction plates or electrodes, typically provided on the cathode, to alter the discharge path of ionized gases. A voltage source applies a negative voltage to the reduction plate, attracting the positive ions and preventing them from inducing damaging current surges at the cathode. This prolongs the lifetime of the field emission elements.

3. In one embodiment, multiple elongated reduction plates or electrodes run parallel and adjacent to rows of field emission elements. In another embodiment, the reduction plates or electrodes are arranged in a meshwork or net-shaped configuration among the field emission elements. The reduction plates are electrically insulated from the cathode.

4. The FED device operates by applying an operating voltage between the cathode and anode to establish an electric field. Simultaneously, a negative bias voltage is applied to the reduction plate. Emitted high-energy electrons strike nitrogen and oxygen molecules, forming positive ions that are attracted to the negatively-charged reduction plate instead of the cathode, preventing damage to the field emission elements.

1. The invention relates to using a recessed mask structure to prevent high electrical fields at intersections in very small semiconductor devices. This results in lower electrical breakdown in high speed, high density integrated circuits and chip interconnects with fine metal features and low dielectric constant insulators.

2. At sub-150 nanometer dimensions, abrupt physical discontinuities at interfaces between different materials produce high electrical fields that cause enhanced leakage and breakdown. Different low dielectric constant (low-k) materials are being used to lower device parameters like line-to-line capacitance, cross talk noise, and power dissipation, but these materials behave differently in processing.

3. The invention provides a metal plus low-k interconnect structure for semiconductor devices with sub-250 nanometer dimensions. It achieves reduced lateral leakage current between adjacent metal lines and a lower effective dielectric constant by positioning a mask member 0.5 to 20 nanometers (preferably 5 nm) below the surface to be planarized, where the electric field is lower.

4. The invention is particularly useful in damascene type device structures where adjacent conductors lined with a conductive diffusion barrier film are disposed in thin trenches in an intralevel dielectric (ILD) material. Connections are made through metal filled vias in the ILD, and masking protects the dielectric during processing and assists in patterning the trenches.

5. The recessed mask structure is achieved through a process that allows selecting the final mask thickness to be as thin as possible, since mask material has a higher k value that increases overall capacitance. The process involves removing mask material between the conductors after chemical-mechanical polishing, down to a level away from the high field surface points, until the selected mask thickness is reached.

6. The invention provides several benefits, including moving high field points away from the cap-mask interface, minimizing the higher-k mask material to reduce overall capacitance, minimizing damage to the conductive diffusion barrier liner, and resulting in a lower, predictable overall capacitance that enables faster signal propagation in the interconnect wiring. The structure can be made using standard damascene processing techniques with an additional etching step to recess the mask/dielectric",1,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

1. The invention is an individually fitted helmet liner made of multiple layers of elastic thermoplastic sheets, each formed with an array of open, unfilled pockets. The pockets can deform in response to compressive contact with adjacent layers. The liner is fitted to an individual's head by heating the sheets to a plastic state, placing the liner between an outer fixture and the wearer's head to deform the sheets, and removing the liner once it has cooled and rigidified.

2. Leaving the pockets open and unfilled allows the liner to provide necessary spacing between the outer shell and head while being compliant enough to smooth out effects of layer alignment. This simplifies manufacturing as pockets do not need to be registered between layers. The increased bulk compliance allows the liner to better conform to head contours, minimizing shifting of the outer helmet.

They consist of a long cylindrical outer tube with a coaxial rotating central drive shaft, and the material being processed flows through the annular space between them.

2. Radially extending blades, also called paddles, are hingedly connected to the drive shaft to mix the material and scrape the inside of the outer tube. In one known mounting method, the blades have holes that fit onto pins welded to the drive shaft, allowing pivoting but restraining lateral movement. The blades are installed when the drive shaft is removed from the outer tube, such as during initial setup or after cleaning cycles.

1. The invention relates to a device for interconnecting high voltage cables up to 400 KV and above, providing a common connection system for all accessories and interconnections. The interface between cable ends and accessories, between two cable ends, or between two apparatus is generally applicable, resulting in advantages such as factory pretesting, reduced installation time and cost, and simplified field testing. The stress cone design and dimensions are the same for all applications, with only variations in the diameter of the cable or apparatus entrance.

2. Three interface methods are described: an inner cone concept, an outer cone concept, and a no cone or slight inner cone concept. The outer cone concept separates the cable connection further from the connected apparatus, reducing the likelihood of a fault on one side affecting the other. The substantially plane surface interconnection simplifies alignment of meeting surfaces without risking glow discharges.

3. Various applications of the invention are illustrated, including SF6 terminals, transformer terminals (with and without oil-filled boxes), outdoor terminals (with and without surge suppressor devices), straight-through joints, transition joints between dry and oil-filled cables, and joints between two apparatus. The rigid insulator used in these embodiments should have a cone angle between 15° and 45° for optimal performance and reliability in high or extra high voltage installations.

1. This patent application, a continuation of an earlier application, relates to switching circuitry for driving display drivers at high speeds while producing low electromagnetic interference (EMI). Charge pump circuits and switching regulator circuits are two well-known techniques for generating supply voltages for display drivers. Charge pumps provide energy efficiently but at lower current, while switching regulators can supply high current but typically generate radiated noise. Conventional charge pumps may not provide enough current to drive larger displays like those used on the iPhone and iPod Touch.

2. The invention provides methods and apparatus for generating display driver supply voltages at high efficiency and low EMI by using modified switching regulator circuits. Multiple circuit paths are created to carry current in opposite directions to cancel out radiated noise. Additional terminal lines are provided to sink any EMI generated in the outermost active current paths.

3. A typical switching regulator includes a voltage source, inductor, diode, capacitor, and transistor switch. When the transistor gate receives a HIGH control signal, current flows from the voltage source through the inductor and transistor to ground, ramping up the inductor current. When the control signal goes LOW, the inductor end coupled to the transistor swings positive, forward-biasing the diode and allowing current to charge the capacitor to a voltage higher than the source voltage while also supplying the load.

4. In a conventional implementation for driving displays, indium tin oxide (ITO) is used instead of copper for bonding wire because it is transparent, but it has much higher resistance. To reduce resistance, multiple parallel traces are used for a single switch, with the ITO resistance represented as resistors. The circuit operates similarly to a basic switching regulator, but the high resistance ITO can produce large amounts of problematic EMI.

5. The invention provides a switching regulator configuration that produces little to no EMI while providing high efficiency output for driving large displays. The key aspect is interleaving the parallel source and drain paths connected to the transistor switch. Current flowing in opposite directions through adjacent source and drain paths cancels out the EMI generated in each path.

6. Operation is similar to a standard switching regulator, except EMI from source paths is canceled by opposite EMI from drain paths when current flows through the",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28}"

TSA is pursuing initiatives to strengthen control over access to secure areas of airports and improve passenger screening, such as the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program and the next-generation Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System. The Federal Aviation Administration has worked to enhance the security of the nation's air traffic control computer systems and facilities. However, vulnerabilities remain in areas such as air cargo, general aviation, and airport perimeter security.

3. TSA's efforts to strengthen aviation security face several long-term challenges related to risk management, funding, coordination, strategic human capital management, and building a results-oriented organization. A risk management approach could help set strategic priorities and direct resources to the greatest needs. Funding the costs of aviation security and controlling these costs are major challenges.

4. Sustaining aviation security improvements will require effective partnerships among federal, state, local, and private stakeholders, as well as a results-oriented culture within TSA and the Department of Homeland Security.

1. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) and Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 4911 and 162(e) were passed at different times for different purposes. LDA, enacted in 1995, requires organizations that lobby certain federal officials to register with Congress and report lobbying expenditures semiannually, with the intent of providing greater public disclosure of paid lobbying efforts to influence federal decisions. IRC section 4911, enacted in 1976, limits the amount of lobbying by 501(c)(3) organizations to help clarify the extent to which these public charities can lobby without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. IRC section 162(e), amended in 1993, denies businesses the federal income tax deductibility of certain lobbying expenses but does not otherwise restrict lobbying activities.

2. LDA requires lobbying organizations to register with Congress within 45 days of first making a lobbying contact on behalf of a client, and those with employees who lobby on the organization's behalf must also register. Registration is required if total lobbying expenses exceed $20,500 in a 6-month period and the organization has an employee who makes more than one lobbying contact and spends at least 20% of their time lobbying. Registered organizations must file semiannual reports disclosing total lobbying expenses, issues and agencies lobbied, lobbyists, and certain other information. Unless registration is terminated, reports must be filed regardless of lobbying activity during the period.

3. LDA allows organizations lobbying on their own behalf to use applicable IRC definitions for determining registration thresholds and calculating reportable lobbying expenses, but the IRC definitions must be used consistently for a calendar year. For all other LDA reporting, organizations using IRC definitions must use the IRC definition for executive branch lobbying and the LDA definition for legislative branch lobbying. Allowing use of IRC definitions helps organizations avoid tracking lobbying expenses under two different definitions. GAO was required to report on the differences between the LDA and IRC definitions, the impact of those differences on LDA filings and reporting, and any recommended changes to harmonize the definitions.

1. GAO has been assessing strategic sourcing in federal acquisitions for over a decade. In 2002, GAO reported that leading companies committed to a strategic approach to acquiring services, moving away from numerous individual procurements to a broader aggregate approach.

2. Strategic sourcing encompasses tactics like leveraged buying, demand management, standardization, evaluating total cost of ownership, and supplier relationship management. Spend analysis is crucial for strategic sourcing, providing knowledge about spending patterns, buyers, suppliers, and opportunities for savings and performance improvements.

3. Despite the benefits, federal agencies have not fully leveraged strategic sourcing due to decentralized procurement. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) was established in 2005 to encourage agencies to aggregate requirements, streamline processes, and coordinate purchases.

4. In 2012, GAO found that most agencies leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing. Agencies reported savings of 5-20% through strategically sourced contracts, but utilization of FSSI contracts was low at 15%.

5. Impediments to federal strategic sourcing include challenges in obtaining reliable spending data, lack of expertise and leadership support, and underdeveloped metrics. Some agencies have made progress despite data flaws, developed training, and introduced practices to address disincentives.

6. Federal agencies have difficulty managing services acquisition, which represents over half of all procurements. Agencies have been reluctant to strategically source services due to difficulty standardizing requirements or a focus on less complex commodities.

2. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund, established in 1970, provides funding for FAA's capital accounts and part of its operations through excise taxes on users. Revenues have generally exceeded spending commitments, but the uncommitted balance has declined in recent years as revenues have been less than forecasted.

3. Some stakeholders support the current excise tax system, stating it has successfully funded FAA with low administrative costs. Others, including FAA, argue the disconnect between revenues contributed by users and costs they impose raises revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency concerns.

4. Alternative funding options, including modifications to the current excise tax structure and more direct user charges, present both advantages and disadvantages. The degree to which they could address concerns depends on the extent to which user contributions reflect the costs they impose on the system.

5. Given FAA's diverse activities, a combination of alternative options may best link revenues and costs. Switching to any alternative would raise administrative and transition issues, requiring FAA to complete appropriate cost analyses.

6. Some argue that if user charges are adopted, users should have more input into FAA's operations, but no evidence was found that a governance change would be required. France has moved toward a cost-based charging system without changing its air navigation service provider's underlying governance structure.

7. Allowing FAA to use debt financing for capital projects has advantages, such as providing a stable funding source and spreading costs over a project's life, but also raises concerns. Debt financing encumbers future resources, may lack congressional oversight, and is subject to federal budget scoring rules.

1. HUD, established in 1965, is the principal federal agency responsible for housing assistance, community development, housing finance, and regulatory issues. It provides public housing assistance through allocations to public housing authorities and private-market housing assistance under section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. HUD's housing assistance programs are limited by budgetary constraints to only about one-fourth of those who are eligible.

2. HUD provides community planning and development funds for local economic development, housing development, and assistance to the homeless primarily through grants to states and local areas. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) within HUD insures lenders against losses on mortgages. HUD is also responsible for regulating various housing-related issues and supporting fair housing programs.

3. For fiscal year 2000, HUD is proposing a budget of about $28 billion in new discretionary budget authority, a 9-percent increase over fiscal year 1999. This budget request includes 19 new initiatives and programs not funded in fiscal year 1999, with some funded as set-asides within existing programs like CDBG and HOME. However, there are concerns about HUD's capacity to effectively initiate and oversee these new programs while undergoing a significant organizational reform.

4. Issues have been identified with HUD's budget proposals for the Section 8 housing assistance program in recent years, including inconsistencies and not fully considering unexpended balances. HUD's fiscal year 2000 budget raises additional questions about the basis for the substantial increases in Section 8 costs. GAO believes these issues warrant further review to ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of HUD's budget request.

1. The Military Health System operated by the Department of Defense (DOD) has a dual mission of readiness and benefits. The readiness mission involves deploying medical personnel and equipment to support military forces, while the benefits mission provides health care services to servicemembers, their families, and other eligible beneficiaries. Health care is delivered through military treatment facilities and civilian providers via TRICARE.

2. In 2008, plans were approved to renovate Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) and the 86th Medical Group (MDG) clinic at their existing locations. In 2009, a cost-benefit analysis determined that consolidating LRMC and the 86th MDG clinic into one new facility adjacent to Ramstein Air Base would be more efficient and cost-effective. The Army will operate and maintain the replacement medical center, with the Air Force providing certain clinical services.

3. DOD used beneficiary population data, contingency operations, and known troop strength changes to plan the replacement medical center. Four catchment areas were defined based on historical patterns of patient migration and contingency operations. The replacement medical center is being sized for peacetime operations but designed with the flexibility to expand capacity during surges to support contingency operations.

4. DOD has been reducing its posture in Europe, with plans to remove one of four brigade combat teams by 2015. This change was not expected to significantly impact the size of the replacement medical center. In January 2012, DOD announced the decision to remove a second brigade combat team, and officials are assessing the ramifications of this change on medical facility needs.

5. DOD incorporated patient quality of care and environmentally friendly design standards into the facility requirements for the replacement medical center. Checklists, discussions with external health care providers, and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building standards were used to ensure the inclusion of evidence-based design, world-class standards, and environmental features. The current design is expected to qualify for a ""silver"" or potentially ""gold"" LEED certification.

1. The alien population subject to removal from the U.S. has grown in recent years, with estimates of approximately 12 million unauthorized aliens as of 2006. Over 100 violations of immigration law can serve as the basis for removal. In 2005, ICE investigations resulted in 102,034 apprehensions, or about 8% of the 1.3 million DHS apprehensions that year. The four main categories for removal in 2005 were: aliens entering without inspection, aliens attempting entry without proper documents, aliens with criminal convictions, and aliens violating terms of entry.

2. ICE officers exercise the most discretion in the initial phases of the alien apprehension and removal process, including initiating removals, apprehending aliens, issuing removal documents and detaining aliens. Officers have more latitude when encountering aliens who are not investigation targets, particularly those with humanitarian issues. Officers decide how to exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis with guidance from supervisors. Factors like availability of detention space, travel time, and competing priorities affect decisions to initiate removal.

3. Officers' discretion is limited for aliens who are investigation targets, like criminal aliens and fugitive aliens, due to prescribed policies and procedures. In contrast, officers can exercise discretion by deciding to apprehend an alien, issue an NTA by mail, or schedule an appointment for later processing for aliens who are not targets or have humanitarian circumstances. In some instances, officers will mail an NTA or schedule appointments rather than apprehend aliens who are sole caretakers of children or have medical issues.

4. Most of an officer's discretion in the charging phase relates to the decision to grant voluntary departure when not prohibited. Officers may consider humanitarian concerns and ICE priorities when exercising this discretion. There was significant variation in the use of voluntary departure across field offices. If detention is not mandated, officers have discretion to determine if an alien will be detained or released pending the immigration court hearing, considering factors like humanitarian issues, flight risk, detention space, and threat to the community.

5. ICE attorneys and officers have less discretion in the later phases of the apprehension and removal process, with most aliens having few alternatives to appearing in immigration court after entering removal proceedings.

1. Ground ambulance services are provided by a variety of organizations that differ in structure, staffing, types of transports offered, and revenue sources. Medicare pays ambulance providers through a national fee schedule, with a service-level payment for the type of transport and a mileage payment. Providers may be affiliated with institutions like hospitals or fire departments, or be independent. They can be for-profit, nonprofit, or government-based.

2. Providers may rely on volunteers, paid staff, or a mix. They may specialize in emergency or nonemergency transports, or offer both. Some provide only basic life support (BLS) while others also provide advanced life support (ALS) requiring more specialized staff. Revenue sources vary by community and may include taxes, donations, grants, insurance, and patient payments.

3. In 2010, providers' median cost per ground ambulance transport was $429, but costs were highly variable, ranging from $224 to $2,204 per transport. Variability reflected differences in provider characteristics like transport volume, Medicare transport mix, and government subsidies. Personnel costs were the largest component of total costs. Super-rural providers had significantly higher estimated median costs per transport than urban providers.

4. In 2010, the median Medicare margin for providers, including temporary add-on payments, was positive 2%. Without the add-ons, the median margin was -1%. From 2004 to 2010, Medicare ambulance transports increased 33% overall and in all geographic areas. The increase was driven by a 59% rise in BLS nonemergency transports, with super-rural areas seeing the largest increase at 82%.

5. Factors like beneficiary age, race, and sex remained stable from 2004-2010 and did not appear to cause the increase in transports. Provider representatives suggested the increase was partly due to more local governments billing Medicare and other insurers for ambulance services due to budget pressures. The national fee schedule introduced in 2002 may have also contributed by allowing providers to better anticipate Medicare revenues. The HHS OIG has cited improper payments, particularly for nonemergency dialysis transports, as another potential factor.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has policies and procedures for managing Security Risk Category I (SRC I) ammunition, which is treated as higher risk than other conventional ammunition. The Army procures most of DOD's ammunition and provides wholesale storage at Army depots. The military services collectively had approximately 226,000 SRC I missiles and rockets in the continental U.S. as of April 30, 2015. The U.S. Transportation Command is DOD's single manager for transportation of SRC I ammunition.

2. GAO found that the military services maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition at 11 sampled locations in their automated information systems. However, the Air Force does not track SRC I ammunition by serial number as required, but has plans to revise its guidance. The Air Force also does not maintain accountability for items owned by other services and stored at Air Force locations. The services generally recorded shipment and receipt in their systems, but the receipt was not always timely.

3. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps have policies regarding maintaining in-transit accountability for shipped SRC I ammunition, but the Army's processes do not fully adhere to DOD requirements. GAO made six recommendations to enhance DOD's policy and procedures and improve accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition. DOD concurred with all six recommendations and described planned actions to address them.

4. To determine if the military services maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition, GAO reviewed DOD policies, visited 11 military locations and 1 contractor location, interviewed officials, and compared a sample of over 600 SRC I items against records in the services' systems. GAO also analyzed DOD policies and service guidance on conducting physical inventories and reviewed documentation to determine if inventories were conducted according to requirements. GAO examined the services' procedures for maintaining accountability of items owned by one service but in the custody of another.

5. To determine if DOD maintained visibility of SRC I ammunition, GAO reviewed DOD policies, interviewed officials, obtained SRC I ammunition data from the services' systems as of April 30, 2015, and analyzed this data for timely, complete and accurate information.

1. The federal government is the largest collector and user of personal information in the U.S. Federal agencies collect personal data like names, birth dates, addresses, and SSNs to administer programs and benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) issues SSNs and maintains information on individuals' wages and earnings as part of its responsibility for administering Social Security programs. SSA has protected the confidentiality of personal information it collects since the inception of the Social Security program in the 1930s.

2. SSA's disclosure policy is designed to protect individuals' privacy rights while allowing necessary information exchanges. The policy has been revised over the years to comply with about 25 statutes, including the Privacy Act of 1974, which is the primary law governing protection of personal information by federal agencies. The Privacy Act requires agencies to inform individuals about information collection and usage, and prohibits disclosure of records without consent, with some exceptions. The law enforcement exception permits disclosure if specific criteria are met.

3. SSA's disclosure policy is more restrictive than the Privacy Act and most federal agencies' policies. SSA requires additional factors to be considered before allowing disclosure to law enforcement, such as the nature of the alleged criminal activity, the information requested, and the agency making the request. SSA will share information if the criminal activity involves fraud in Social Security programs, fraud in similar government benefit programs, violent crimes where the individual has been indicted or convicted, or if disclosure is required by federal statute.

4. SSA's detailed disclosure policy is contained in regulations and internal guidance. Disclosures can be made through SSA's headquarters, field offices, regional offices, or the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The OIG is authorized to disclose information to law enforcement under a memorandum of understanding with SSA.

5. SSA maintains a restrictive disclosure policy to protect the personal information it collects, even from law enforcement requests. SSA cites the especially personal nature of the information, the agency's limited control over safeguarding disclosed information, and SSA's long-standing pledge of confidentiality as reasons for its policy. However, some SSA field office staff are confused about the policy, which could lead to inconsistent application.

2. RCRA's requirements, particularly land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and permit requirements, can increase costs and delays for cleanups, discouraging the cleanup of some sites.
3. Land disposal restrictions require waste to be treated to specific, stringent standards before disposal, which may be more costly than necessary for some lower-risk remediation waste.
4. Minimum technological requirements, designed for waste from ongoing industrial operations, may be overly stringent and costly for some remediation waste.
5. The process of obtaining a RCRA permit for treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste can be costly and time-consuming, causing some parties to avoid triggering the permit requirement.
6. To avoid RCRA requirements, some property owners may choose to leave waste in place without treatment, which may pose health or environmental risks.
7. EPA has modified RCRA's application to remediation waste through policy statements and regulatory alternatives, but states have varied experiences using these and some find them burdensome or overly complicated.
8. EPA proposed new rules in 1996 to reform RCRA's requirements for remediation waste but withdrew the proposal in 1997 due to unresolved technical and legal issues, concluding that legislative reform is needed.

1. Prior to 1996, Medicare program integrity activities were constrained by budget procedures and funding limitations. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) to provide dedicated funding for program integrity activities outside the annual appropriations process. From fiscal years 1997 to 2005, total MIP expenditures increased by about 63 percent, from $438 million to $714 million. MIP funds are used to support contractors' program integrity efforts, including audits, medical reviews, secondary payer activities, benefit integrity, and provider education.

2. CMS has generally increased funding for each of the five MIP activities from fiscal years 1997 to 2005, with provider education receiving the largest percentage increase and audit and medical review receiving the largest amounts overall. CMS calculates quantitative benefits for secondary payer and medical review activities, but assesses only qualitative benefits for the other three activities. The agency has not routinely collected information to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of MIP activities that it could use in allocating funds. CMS is developing initiatives to give the agency objective measures of the results of audit and provider education activities.

3. After allocating funds to the five MIP activities, CMS must decide how to further distribute those funds to contractors. However, CMS has not always taken steps to ensure optimal allocation within activities based on vulnerabilities for improper payment, contractor workload, and relative effectiveness of activities performed. CMS's audit function continues to focus on verifying aspects of providers' cost reports that affect individual payments, addressing a small portion of payments, while a greater portion is based on overall industry costs under prospective payment systems.

4. Medicare is undergoing significant changes, including the addition of the Part D prescription drug benefit and reform of contracting, which will require CMS to make new choices in allocating MIP funds. CMS's current allocation approach, relying primarily on previous fiscal year funding, will not be adequate to address emerging risks and programmatic changes. The usefulness of award payments to encourage superior contractor performance depends on CMS's ability to develop and consistently apply performance measures.

TSA has implemented a basic screener training program, deployed an Online Learning Center with self-guided training courses, and developed hands-on training tools. TSA also requires screeners to participate in 3 hours of recurrent training per week and has implemented leadership and technical training programs for Screening Supervisors.

2. TSA lacks adequate internal controls to ensure screeners are completing required training. TSA policy does not clearly define responsibility for ensuring screeners complete training, and TSA headquarters lacks formal policies and procedures for monitoring completion of training. At airports without high-speed connectivity, training records must be entered manually, making it challenging to keep accurate and up-to-date records.

3. TSA has made progress in assessing and enhancing screener performance in detecting threat objects, but efforts have focused more on passenger screening than checked baggage screening. TSA has increased covert testing, enabled Federal Security Directors to conduct local covert testing, fully deployed the Threat Image Projection system to passenger checkpoints, and completed the first round of annual screener recertification. However, the Threat Image Projection system is not yet available for checked baggage screening, and the recertification program does not include an image recognition component for checked baggage screeners.

4. TSA has established performance measures and indexes for passenger and checked baggage screening but has not established targets for all index components. The passenger and checked baggage screening indexes measure effectiveness through indicators like machine probability of detection and covert testing results. However, without performance targets for each component, such as covert testing, TSA will have difficulty performing meaningful analyses to direct performance improvement efforts.

Despite its declining share of the overall MBS market, which is largely due to rapid growth in the conventional MBS market, Ginnie Mae continues to serve its key public policy goal of providing a strong secondary market outlet for government housing programs. Further declines in Ginnie Mae's volume could have implications related to credit quality, liquidity, and the agency's contribution to offsetting the federal budget deficit.

2. Ginnie Mae faces the challenge of adjusting its products and policies to address market changes while meeting the needs of borrowers and industry stakeholders. The agency has added new products, solicited feedback from partners, expanded disclosures for investors, and worked to assist loan programs, but some changes like provisions of certain loan programs remain beyond its scope. Ginnie Mae also faces the challenge of avoiding the need to ration its commitment authority, which can disrupt the secondary market and harm its credibility.

3. As an agency with a small staff that contracts out most operations, Ginnie Mae must manage its internal operations efficiently and ensure appropriate internal controls are in place. Weaknesses in data integrity and losses from fraud indicate the need for continued improvements in data systems and internal controls, and Ginnie Mae has taken some steps and has ongoing initiatives to address these issues. Given its reliance on contractors, Ginnie Mae will need to ensure its staff have sufficient resources, training, and qualifications for proper contract planning, monitoring, and execution.

1. Mission-critical skills gaps within the federal workforce pose a high risk to the nation. These gaps can be due to insufficient staff or staff not having the appropriate skills, and are exacerbated by budget pressures, changing federal work, and potential retirements.

2. By 2020, over 34% of federal employees will be eligible to retire, which could create gaps in institutional knowledge and leadership. While some turnover can be beneficial, it needs to be strategically monitored and managed.

3. Problems have been identified across federal personnel systems and functions, including the classification system, recruiting and hiring, the pay system, performance management, and employee engagement. The General Schedule (GS) pay system has not kept pace with the government's evolving requirements and does not align pay with skills, knowledge, and performance.

5. Congress has provided some agencies with exemptions from the current pay system to give more flexibility in setting pay. Implementing a more market-based and performance-oriented pay system is doable and desirable, but not easy, and requires effective performance management systems and a cultural shift.

6. Lessons learned from public, private, and nonprofit organizations that have implemented market-based and performance-oriented pay systems include focusing on values and objectives, examining total compensation, building in safeguards for fairness, devolving decision-making, providing training, building consensus, and monitoring and refining the system. While statutory changes may be needed in some cases, many improvements are within the control of federal agencies.

1. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, about 90 percent of the costs associated with the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) fell into two accounts - military personnel and operation and maintenance. Military personnel funds cover pay and allowances for mobilized reservists and special payments for qualifying personnel, while operation and maintenance funds are used for transportation, operating support, intelligence, communications, and logistics.

2. Estimating the cost of ongoing military operations is difficult because operational requirements can differ substantially from budget estimates. If operations cost more than estimated, the Department of Defense (DOD) may transfer funds between accounts, reprogram funds within an account, or reduce planned spending to meet its needs.

3. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received about $52.4 billion and $62.1 billion respectively in supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses. However, DOD and the services lost visibility over additional GWOT funds provided through annual appropriations.

4. Beginning in fiscal year 2003, the administration increased DOD's annual appropriation request by more than $10 billion per year to support GWOT. Program Budget Decision 736 provided for this permanent increase, but DOD's accounting systems do not separately identify which programs or activities received these funds.

5. Our assessment of reported obligations through May 2005 suggests the services should have sufficient supplemental appropriations for military personnel expenses in fiscal year 2005. However, there could be gaps for operation and maintenance expenses for the Army and Marine Corps.

6. The services' more detailed midyear budget review forecasts suggest a $500 million gap for Air Force military personnel expenses, and gaps of $2.7 billion and $1 billion for Army and Air Force operation and maintenance expenses respectively. The Navy and Marine Corps expect their supplemental appropriations will be sufficient.

7. To cover gaps between supplemental appropriations and GWOT obligations, DOD used authorities such as transferring funds, reprogramming, and reducing or deferring planned spending.

1. The aging of the baby boom generation will significantly increase the ratio of the population age 65 or older to the working age population (age 20-64) in the coming decades. This ""aged dependency ratio"" is projected to rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% by 2030, meaning there will be fewer than 3 working-age persons for every person over 65. Recent changes to Social Security aim to encourage people to work longer by eliminating benefit reductions after normal retirement age and increasing delayed retirement credits.

2. The number of older workers (over 55) is projected to grow rapidly, reaching 31.8 million by 2015 and 33.3 million by 2025. This growth is due to the aging baby boomers and increased labor force participation among older persons, especially women. The occupational composition of older workers is shifting toward more white-collar jobs as baby boomers have higher education levels compared to previous generations.

3. While older workers are less likely to lose their jobs compared to younger workers, those who do become unemployed are less likely to be re-employed. Older and younger workers tend to lose jobs for similar reasons, but many older displaced workers choose to retire after job loss. A small percentage of fully retired older persons (1.3% or over 750,000 people age 55-74) are unemployed and seeking work or want a job.

4. Some employers are experimenting with flexible employment arrangements to retain older workers, such as part-time schedules, consulting, and reduced responsibilities. However, these programs are not yet widespread in the private sector. Unions have not broadly addressed the issue in collective bargaining. Public employers, especially in education, have been more active in implementing incentive programs to retain older workers.

5. Several factors can discourage continued employment of older workers, including negative employer perceptions, perceived higher costs of hiring older employees, and the health limitations of aging workers. The ERISA Advisory Council has made recommendations to the Secretary of Labor to address obstacles to private employers instituting flexible retirement programs. An interagency task force could help develop sound policies and proposals to extend the work lives of older Americans as they become an increasingly critical segment of the labor force.",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 15}"

1. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was created in 1986 to facilitate legitimate business and tourism travel to the U.S. It allows travelers from 36 participating countries to enter the U.S. without a visa for stays of up to 90 days.

2. In 2007, Congress added requirements for VWP countries to enter into information-sharing agreements with the U.S. It also mandated that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) evaluate the effect of each country's participation on U.S. security, law enforcement, and immigration interests at least once every 2 years.

3. DHS implemented the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) in 2008 to pre-screen VWP travelers before they board U.S.-bound carriers. DHS took steps to minimize the burden of ESTA on travelers, such as only requiring a new application every 2 years instead of every trip.

4. ESTA reduced the average processing time for VWP travelers and allows DHS to notify ineligible travelers before they embark. However, VWP travelers expressed dissatisfaction with the $14 ESTA fee implemented in 2010, viewing it as a step away from visa-free travel.

5. Carriers are required to verify that VWP passengers have ESTA approval before boarding, and compliance reached almost 98% in 2010. However, DHS has not fully analyzed the potential risks posed by the 2% of travelers that were boarded without verified ESTA approval.

6. DHS, in coordination with the Departments of State and Justice, has made progress in negotiating information-sharing agreements with VWP countries as required by the 9/11 Act. However, as of early 2011, only half of the countries had signed all required agreements and many agreements had not yet been implemented.

7. Challenges in negotiating the agreements include privacy concerns, domestic laws limiting information sharing, and the lengthy process of updating technical systems to enable the agreed-upon data exchange.

1. State child welfare systems are complex networks of policies and programs designed to protect children. From 1984 to 1995, the foster care population grew from 276,000 to 494,000 children, with 261,000 supported by federal funds in 1995.

2. Federal law requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent removing children from their homes and to provide services to reunite families if removal occurs. States must develop a case plan for each child and hold a permanency hearing within 18 months to determine the child's future status.

3. Twenty-six states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time to the first permanency hearing to less than 18 months. Ohio and Minnesota require a permanency decision to be made after a limited extension period.

4. States have implemented various changes to expedite and improve the permanency process, such as reuniting families more quickly, expediting termination of parental rights when reunification is not feasible, and reducing the number of foster care placements per child. Some states have implemented low-cost, creative methods to address specific barriers to reuniting families, such as Arizona's Housing Assistance Program.

5. Arizona and Kentucky focused on expediting the process to terminate parental rights. Some states are experimenting with concurrent planning, working simultaneously on reunification and an alternate plan for permanent removal if reunification fails.

6. All foster care placement decisions come through states' court systems. Hamilton County, Ohio, revised court procedures to expedite case processing, resulting in fewer children experiencing multiple placements and more children leaving foster care within 2 years.

7. Assessing the overall impact of these initiatives is difficult due to the lack of systematic evaluations and limited outcome data. States increased their chances of success when initiatives involved long-term leadership, stakeholder involvement, consensus building, and sustained resources.

8. As foster care caseloads are expected to rise, states will face increased pressure to develop initiatives to move children into permanent homes more quickly. While promising initiatives exist, they often lack evaluations to assess their impact and identify unintended consequences.

It requires government-wide reporting on a greater variety of federal funds at multiple points in the spending lifecycle, with data complying with new standards established by OMB and Treasury.

2. OMB has taken steps to help agencies meet DATA Act reporting requirements, including establishing 57 standardized data element definitions, issuing guidance to clarify reporting requirements, and meeting with agencies to assess their readiness. Treasury developed technical guidance and reporting systems, including the DATA Act broker, to facilitate agency reporting in compliance with the data standards.

3. The DATA Act requires agency Inspectors General (IGs) and GAO to assess and report on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of agency spending data submissions. As of February 2017, many agency auditors had reported material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that may affect data quality, and several IGs identified issues that may impact agencies' ability to submit quality data.

OSC's mission is to protect federal employees from prohibited personnel practices through investigations, informal resolution, and prosecuting corrective and disciplinary actions before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Employees subject to adverse actions may appeal to the MSPB or pursue resolution through the federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) process if the prohibited practice relates to covered discrimination. Going to OSC may be an employee's only recourse for alleged prohibited personnel practices in some cases.

VA's 6-year strategic plan from 2014 emphasizes goals such as increasing veterans' access to benefits and services, eliminating the disability claims backlog, and ending veteran homelessness through the use of technology. The department spent about $3.9 billion on IT in fiscal year 2015 and requested $4.3 billion for fiscal year 2017. VA's CIO initiated a transformation strategy in 2016 to focus on stabilizing processes, mitigating weaknesses, and improving outcomes.

HCFA faces additional challenges, such as preparing its information systems for the year 2000, repairing managed care enrollment systems, and modifying existing systems to implement BBA payment changes and modernize anti-fraud measures. The agency also recently restructured its organizational units, leading to transition-related disruptions.

4. Focus groups with HCFA managers revealed concerns about the distribution of agency resources, the need for specialized expertise, loss of institutional experience, and reorganization issues. Managers worry that efforts to implement BBA and solve computer problems may compromise the quality of other work or lead to neglect of certain tasks.

5. HCFA's traditional approach of hiring generalist staff and providing on-the-job training is no longer well-suited to the agency's need to implement reforms expeditiously. Managers identified a need for staff with specialized technical expertise in various areas, such as computer systems, data analysis, managed care, and health education.

The program has five goals: meet agency needs, obtain best value, encourage competition, respond to the changing marketplace, and provide opportunities for small businesses. Networx will include two acquisitions: Networx Universal for a full range of services, and Networx Select for more geographically limited services.

3. GSA faces challenges in finalizing the Networx strategy, including ensuring adequate inventory information is available, establishing measures of success, structuring contracts to ensure agencies have access to competitively priced services, and initiating transition planning. An accurate inventory of existing services is essential for informed acquisition planning, but it's unclear if comprehensive inventories have been established. GSA has not yet defined a comprehensive set of performance measures corresponding to the Networx program goals.

1. Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a compact, mixed-use, walkable neighborhood located near transit, typically within a half-mile of a station. Local governments, transit agencies, private developers, and other stakeholders play important roles in planning and implementing TOD. While the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) does not have a specific program for TOD, it has expanded its role in recent years by funding TOD research, coordinating with other federal agencies, and implementing a TOD planning pilot program.

2. The amount of TOD near the six case study transit lines varied widely, from minimal development to significant TOD activity. Stakeholders attributed this to factors supporting TOD like real estate demand, available land, resident support, and transit connecting to jobs, as well as challenges hindering TOD such as higher construction costs, reluctant lenders, lengthy approval processes, unsupportive residents, and unattractive land around stations. Local governments can encourage TOD through zoning regulations, station area planning, infrastructure investments, and tax incentives, which are most successful when aligned with residents' preferences and market demand.

3. The FTA assesses factors supporting TOD when reviewing transit projects for potential New Starts funding, but these factors only make up a small percentage of the overall evaluation. The economic development and land use criteria consider transit-supportive plans, policies, and impacts, similar to factors identified by stakeholders. However, inherent limitations exist in fully evaluating some factors like real estate market strength and cultural influences on resident support for TOD.

4. Among the case studies assessed for New Starts funding, the amount of realized TOD and factors supporting or hindering it were generally consistent with FTA's pre-construction evaluation of TOD-related factors. Projects rated highly for transit-supportive land use, like the Charlotte and San Francisco light rail lines, are now surrounded by several new TOD projects. Ridership performance compared to expectations varied, with some projects exceeding targets as development occurred and others falling short, particularly those lacking surrounding development.

2. The PEBES legislation requires SSA to send statements to eligible workers according to a schedule, with a projected cost of $80 million in fiscal year 2000.
3. The PEBES provides benefit estimates to help workers plan for their financial future, and while the estimates are reasonable for most workers, they may not account for certain special circumstances that could affect actual benefits.
4. SSA has conducted surveys and focus groups to assess public reaction to the PEBES, and overall reaction has been favorable, but the current statement still provides too much information in a way that undermines its usefulness.
5. The PEBES lacks a clear purpose, attractive design and organization, and easy-to-understand explanations, which can be attributed to SSA's piecemeal development process without sufficient user testing and feedback from front-line workers.
6. There is no standard benefit statement model or consensus on how to present the information, and while SSA is considering a redesign for fiscal year 1999, it is focusing mainly on reducing printing costs rather than improving the statement's effectiveness.

However, the government is not adequately tracking and reporting on the use of these funds from a governmentwide perspective.

2. FEMA does not have mechanisms to collect and report information from other agencies performing work on its behalf through mission assignments, limiting the usefulness of its weekly reports to Congress. Additionally, there is no framework to collect and consolidate information from the 22 other agencies that directly received funding to report on hurricane relief spending.

3. FEMA's reported obligations for mission assignments do not represent actual obligations incurred by agencies performing the work. Some agencies recorded obligations much less than the amount FEMA reported, while others did not have mission assignments recorded in their systems at all.

4. FEMA's reported expenditures understate actual spending due to the timing and process of reimbursing agencies for mission assignment work. Agencies recognize expenditures when paying costs, but FEMA does not report them as expenditures until billing documentation is reviewed and approved, leading to significant differences.

5. Some agencies have not provided adequate documentation to support their reimbursement requests, resulting in FEMA ""charging back"" $267 million from agencies. The Army Corps of Engineers, which does not use the standard reimbursement system, has experienced payment delays due to billing and documentation issues.

In GAO's 2013 and 2017 surveys, only about a third of federal managers reported having recent evaluations of their programs, but the majority of those with evaluations said they contributed to assessing program effectiveness and making improvements. The key reported barrier to using evaluation results was lack of resources to implement changes.

However, nearly 2 years after the executive order was signed, the federal government is not on track to achieve the order's goals, with many agency plans not meeting essential criteria identified by OPM. OPM has not fully developed the mandatory training programs required by the order.

2. Agencies and OPM use data on disability status that employees voluntarily self-report on the SF-256 form to measure progress, but the accuracy of this data is unknown and likely undercounted. Concerns have been raised by stakeholders about the reliability of these statistics, which hinder the ability to measure the population of federal workers with disabilities and develop needed policies.

The President determines the maximum number of refugees to admit annually in consultation with Congress. Refugees are assigned to communities throughout the U.S. by nine national voluntary agencies that maintain a network of about 350 local affiliates.

2. Voluntary agencies consider factors such as the availability of housing, jobs, and social services when determining how many refugees a community can resettle. However, they have received limited guidance on consulting with local stakeholders to assess community capacity. As a result, some communities have felt unprepared to properly serve the refugees resettled there.

1. In the late 1970s, First City Bancorporation of Texas had a high concentration of loans to the energy industry in the Southwest United States. When the energy industry experienced financial difficulties in the early and mid-1980s, First City also struggled financially. By 1986, First City was reporting operating losses and needed major infusions of capital to survive.

2. In 1988, after considering available alternatives, FDIC and First City entered into a recapitalization agreement that provided $970 million in FDIC assistance and $500 million in private capital. As part of the agreement, First City reduced its subsidiary banks from nearly 60 to about 20 and created a ""collecting bank"" to dispose of troubled assets. FDIC received $970 million in preferred stock of the collecting bank and a $100 million guarantee from First City payable in 1998.

3. The recapitalized First City banks pursued an aggressive growth strategy from 1988 to 1990, increasing assets from $10.9 billion to $13.9 billion. The banks' loan portfolios included high-risk loans and some losses were attributed to poor underwriting practices by the new management. Despite reporting $183 million in profits and paying $122 million in dividends during this period, problems with loan quality caused operating losses and eroded First City's capital by 1990.

4. From September 1990 to October 1992, First City's financial condition continued to deteriorate, with assets decreasing from $13.9 billion to $8 billion and total losses of about $625 million. The primary reasons were the continued decline in the Texas economy, weaker-than-anticipated loan portfolios, questionable lending practices, and high operating expenses. Regulators projected the lead Houston and Dallas banks would become insolvent by the end of 1992.

1. In the early 1980s, Congress had concerns about inadequate oversight and accountability for federal assistance to state and local governments. The Single Audit Act of 1984 was passed to promote sound financial management and establish uniform audit requirements for federal awards administered by nonfederal entities.

2. The act required single audits for entities receiving at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance, with the objectives of promoting effective internal control, establishing uniform audit requirements, promoting efficient use of audit resources, and ensuring federal agencies rely on audit work done under the act. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 extended coverage to all federal grant recipients, raised the audit threshold to $300,000, and required a Federal Audit Clearinghouse as the single audit repository.

3. Federal oversight responsibility for the Single Audit Act is shared among OMB, federal agencies, and their Offices of Inspector General. The grant recipient is responsible for having the audit performed and taking corrective action, while the auditor must perform the audit in accordance with Government Auditing Standards.

4. Single audits are the federal government's primary accountability tool over billions in federal funds to state and local governments and nonprofits each year. However, single audit quality has been a longstanding concern, with deficiencies similar to those identified in the 1980s still persisting.

5. In 2007, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) issued a report on a statistical sampling of single audits, estimating that 49% were acceptable, 16% had significant deficiencies and were of limited reliability, and 35.5% were unacceptable and could not be relied upon. The PCIE report recommended revising guidance and standards, establishing minimum continuing professional education requirements for auditors, and enhancing processes to address unacceptable audits.

1. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, with hospital insurance (Part A) and supplemental medical insurance (Part B). Claims are paid by 49 intermediaries and carriers, which are responsible for reviewing and paying claims, maintaining program safeguards, and educating providers and beneficiaries. Medicare contracting differs from most federal programs, as it is authorized to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) under the Social Security Act.

2. There is no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts, with intermediaries selected through nomination by provider associations and carriers chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of insurers. The Social Security Act calls for cost-based reimbursement contracts without profit and limits contract termination. Medicare could benefit from contracting reforms such as competitive selection from a broader array of entities, allowing contractors to specialize in specific functions, and paying based on performance.

3. When Medicare was implemented in 1966, health insurers were used to process and pay claims to win provider acceptance. Subsequent regulations and agency practices have limited contracting options, even as the number of willing insurers has declined and the number of capable entities has increased. The agency has repeatedly proposed legislative changes to repeal provider nomination and allow contracting with non-insurers.

4. Functional contracting, allowing separate contractors for specific claims administration activities, could improve program management by enabling specialization and better performance. Current regulations constrain CMS from awarding separate contracts for individual functions. CMS has some experience with functional contracting through program safeguard contractors (PSCs), which compete for task-specific contracts.

5. Allowing Medicare to offer financial incentives for high-quality performance may have benefits, as the Social Security Act currently precludes such incentives by stipulating cost-based payments. Repeal of cost-based restrictions would allow CMS to test different payment options to encourage better contractor performance. However, implementing performance-based contracting will have significant challenges.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) aims to increase investments in modernization without increasing overall defense budgets by reducing the cost of support operations and infrastructure. The Defense Science Board (DSB) was requested to identify DOD activities that the private sector could do more efficiently and determine the expected savings from outsourcing. DSB issued two reports in 1996 addressing outsourcing and other opportunities for reducing DOD support services costs.

2. DSB's first report concluded that DOD could save 30-40% on logistics costs and improve service by outsourcing support services traditionally done by government personnel, potentially saving $7-12 billion annually by 2002. The second report built on this, envisioning DOD providing only warfighting, battlefield support, policy-making and oversight activities while the private sector does everything else, saving $30 billion annually by 2002 after a $6 billion investment. Of this, $6 billion in savings would come from continental US (CONUS) logistics infrastructure activities.

3. The Office of the Secretary of Defense's (OSD) Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) assessed DSB's savings estimates in preparation for the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). GAO's analysis also focused on the second DSB report's findings and recommendations. DSB's $6 billion CONUS logistics savings estimate represented a 40% reduction in the roughly estimated $14 billion annual CONUS logistics cost.

4. DSB stated that to achieve significant savings, DOD must dramatically change how it does business, get out of the material management/distribution and repair business, expand contractor logistics support to all fielded weapon systems, and expand the use of ""prime vendors"" for all commodities. GAO's reviews indicate DOD has significant opportunities to reduce logistics costs and improve performance by changing business processes, but the most cost-effective processes require evaluating costs and benefits for each situation. GAO's findings are consistent with DSB's general theme that savings opportunities exist in DOD's logistics support activities.

Over the past years, DOD has considered actions to improve its logistics system's efficiency and effectiveness, which should include using accurate information systems, consolidating activities, streamlining methods, and outsourcing.

1. Between fiscal years 1993 and 1996, federal employment levels were cut to reduce costs and control deficits, with goals established through executive orders and legislation like the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994. The National Performance Review recommended that reductions be accomplished through agency efforts to streamline operations, reduce management control and headquarters positions, and improve operations through reinvention and quality management techniques. Agencies were also required to measure their performance under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993.

2. Certain agencies experienced larger workforce reductions than the overall 12 percent federal civilian workforce cut between fiscal years 1993 and 1996, including HUD (14%), DOI (13%), GSA (22%), NASA (13%), and OPM (42%). To determine which components were most affected and how they maintained performance, GAO examined FTE data and selected one component from each agency to study in more detail. The selected components were HUD's Office of Housing, GSA's PBS, DOI's BOR, NASA's KSC, and OPM's Investigations Service.

3. The selected components took actions to maintain performance during downsizing that fell into three main categories: refocusing their missions, reengineering work processes, and building/maintaining employee skills. Component officials, employee representatives, and employees generally believed performance had been maintained, which was supported by the limited performance data available, although some expressed concerns about the impact of future downsizing. Most also believed customer satisfaction had been maintained based on limited survey data, but some customers interviewed by GAO disagreed.

4. Key lessons learned by components for maintaining performance during downsizing included: openly communicating with employees, involving employees in planning, treating people with compassion, avoiding favoritism in reductions, planning buyouts to prevent sudden loss of expertise, providing training to cope with change, and ensuring critical skills are not lost. However, GAO did not independently assess how well these lessons were followed in practice. The report's results are limited to the specific components reviewed and cannot be generalized to entire agencies or government-wide.

Thorough planning is crucial given the census's scope, magnitude, immutable deadlines, and past problems with poor planning that increased costs and risks. Sound planning is critical to obtain congressional support and funding by demonstrating the optimal design was chosen and costs will be controlled. However, the Bureau's 2010 planning process still has weaknesses that could undermine a successful census if not addressed.

The Bureau has involved experienced staff in planning and recognized the need to strategically manage its human capital in the face of potential turnover. It has also incorporated some lessons learned from 2000 Census evaluations.

The Military Health Services System (MHSS) spends over $15 billion annually, with a main mission of medical readiness to support active-duty personnel during combat and maintain their health during peacetime. The MHSS has uniformed health care providers to meet readiness needs, and may also care for nonactive-duty beneficiaries using available resources, purchasing civilian services when necessary. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists both provide mental health services to help military personnel perform their duties, but only psychiatrists can prescribe medication due to their medical training.

2. The MHSS created the Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP) in 1991 to train military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication under certain circumstances. The PDP aimed to increase psychologists' scope of practice to treat patients with medication when needed. PDP training initially consisted of 2 years of coursework and clinical experience, with an additional year of supervised practice. Graduates could then prescribe a limited formulary of psychotropic drugs to patients aged 18-65 with mental conditions without medical complications.

3. The PDP faced several implementation problems, including lack of a clearly defined purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, unspecified selection criteria, curriculum changes, delays in granting prescribing privileges, and unresolved supervision issues. These problems were partly due to lack of precedent and experience with authorizing psychologists to prescribe medication. The PDP cost about $6.1 million, or $610,000 per graduate. Determining the PDP's cost-effectiveness is currently not possible.

It will have a 6.5-meter primary mirror and is expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of Hubble. JWST is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment.

2. JWST has experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays since its early development. Prior to 2011, technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low cost reserves, and poorly phased funding levels contributed to cost and schedule overruns. Following an independent review in 2010 and a subsequent replan in 2011, Congress placed an $8 billion cap on the formulation and development costs for the project.

3. As of 2015, the JWST project remained on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining. However, all of JWST's elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the project's critical path, potentially reducing schedule reserve further. The project must complete five integration and test periods, three of which have not yet started, and address over 100 technical risks before the planned October 2018 launch.

4. The JWST project continued to meet its cost commitments in fiscal year 2015 despite delays with the cryocooler that used a disproportionate amount of cost reserves.

However, the extent of participation in these voluntary initiatives is unclear, and the industry faces challenges in preparing facilities against attacks, such as the cost of security improvements and the need for guidance.

2. Social Security benefits represent a significant source of income for recipients, with average monthly benefits in 2007 of $1,051 for retired workers, $995 for widows/widowers, and $979 for disabled workers. The program balances goals of income adequacy with individual equity, providing higher benefits relative to wages for lower income beneficiaries while giving higher benefits to those with higher lifetime income.

3. The Social Security program expanded over time to include benefits for dependents in 1939 and Disability Insurance in 1956. Facing solvency crises, legislative efforts in the mid-1970s and early 1980s reduced the growth of benefit levels.

1. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was established in October 2008 to address the U.S. financial crisis. Treasury created various TARP programs to stabilize the financial system, including programs to support banks, the auto industry, the housing market, and restart credit markets.

2. As of September 2014, Treasury had recovered $423.6 billion of the $428.3 billion in total TARP disbursements, exceeding the original investment by $15.3 billion. Many TARP programs have ended and Treasury continues to wind down the remaining programs, though housing programs remain active.

3. The Making Home Affordable program, which includes several housing programs, has provided assistance to a large number of homeowners. However, the number of new HAMP modifications has declined in recent quarters as the pool of eligible mortgages shrinks.

1. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) does not consistently determine the eligibility of estates kept open for more than 2 years to receive farm program payments, as required by regulations. Without performing these annual determinations, FSA cannot identify estates being kept open primarily to receive payments and ensure the payments are proper.

2. A review of FSA case files found that only 39 of 181 estates received all required annual eligibility determinations, and 73 estates (40%) received no determinations at all from 1999-2005. Some estates that received no determinations were open for over 10 years and received substantial payments.

3. Even when FSA conducted eligibility determinations, there were shortcomings, such as approving eligibility based on insufficient information or explanations. In some cases, FSA field offices approved payments to groups of estates without any apparent determination.

4. The extent to which FSA makes eligibility determinations varies widely by state, ranging from 0% to 100% of estates reviewed, suggesting inconsistent implementation of eligibility rules. Proper determinations could also uncover other issues, like violations of the three-entity rule limiting the number of entities through which an individual can receive payments.

5. FSA paid $1.1 billion in farm program payments to 172,801 deceased individuals from fiscal years 1999-2005. 40% of these payments went to individuals dead for 3+ years, and 19% to those dead for 7+ years.

6. FSA lacks appropriate management controls, such as matching payment databases with the Social Security Administration's Death Master File, to verify it is not making payments to deceased individuals. Complex farming operations with multiple entities also make it difficult for FSA to prevent improper payments to the deceased.

7. Payments to deceased individuals through entities accounted for a disproportionately high 58% ($648 million) of the $1.1 billion in total payments to the deceased. Deceased individuals were most often members of corporations and general partnerships, which accounted for nearly 75% of payments to the deceased through entities.

2. In 1996, funding appears to have declined substantially, possibly due to problems with USAID's automated information system. On a regional basis, Latin America and the Caribbean received the largest share at about 36 percent, while Africa, Central Europe, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union each received about 15 percent.

3. From 1993 to 1998, rule of law funding shifted primarily from Latin America and the Caribbean to other regions, mainly Central Europe. Funding for Central Europe grew from about $9 million in 1993 to over $67 million in 1998, accounting for 31 percent of the worldwide rule of law assistance that year.

1. Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting enterprises that provide common administrative services like contracting to federal agencies. They are required to recover their full costs of business and can retain up to 4% of annual income. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized six federal agencies to establish franchise fund pilot programs. The original operating principles included offering services competitively, using performance measures, and benchmarking against competitors.

2. DOD primarily uses two franchise funds for contracting services: GovWorks (Department of the Interior) and FedSource (Department of the Treasury). Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and attention to regulatory requirements to protect the government's interests. When DOD uses a franchise fund, responsibilities are shared between the DOD customer, the franchise fund, and the contractor.

3. Prior work has identified problems with interagency contracting, including lack of competition and contractor oversight. Increasing demands on the acquisition workforce and insufficient training are some causes. The fee-for-service model incentivizes increasing sales volume over compliance, and responsibility for critical contracting functions is not always clear.

4. Reviews found GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain competition, ensure fair and reasonable prices, or achieve savings for DOD. With limited evidence of price reasonableness, GovWorks sometimes added millions of dollars to existing orders. FedSource did not compete orders under multiple-award contracts or analyze prices.

5. DOD chose franchise funds based on convenience rather than acquisition planning or analysis of best value. Franchise funds' performance measures focus on customer satisfaction and revenue rather than contract compliance and delivering good value. DOD, GovWorks, and FedSource paid limited attention to defining requirements, negotiating terms, and overseeing contractors.

6. Poorly defined requirements, lack of oversight plans, and reliance on customer satisfaction rather than quality criteria contributed to contracting problems. Franchise funds relied on untrained personnel rather than contracting officers for key responsibilities. Recent internal reviews identified issues and the funds are working to address them.

1. Wildland fires play an important ecological role in shaping the composition of forests and grasslands across the United States. However, various land use and management practices over the past century have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many ecosystems, contributing to abnormally dense vegetation that can fuel uncharacteristically large or severe fires. Changing climate conditions have also increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons in certain parts of the country. As a result, the risk to lives, health, property, and infrastructure has increased, particularly with more homes and communities built in or near areas at risk from wildland fire.

2. Working collaboratively across federal-nonfederal boundaries to address wildland fire issues can involve the nation's federal, state, local, private, or tribal lands. The challenge of balancing the benefits of periodic fires with fire's negative effects on communities is particularly difficult in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where development has increased in recent decades. Federal agencies and nonfederal entities collaborate in various ways to reduce wildfire risk before a potential incident occurs, through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. Individuals and communities may also take actions to mitigate fire risk, such as using fire-resistant building materials or creating defensible space.

3. In recent decades, federal agencies have placed greater emphasis on coordinating efforts with nonfederal entities to reduce wildfire risk to communities. Key efforts have included the National Fire Plan in 2000, the 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy in 2001, and the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (Cohesive Strategy) in 2014. The Cohesive Strategy, developed collaboratively by federal, state, local, tribal, and nongovernmental representatives, outlines a framework to address wildland fire across jurisdictions and emphasizes a proactive approach to managing fire-prone landscapes. Congress has also passed several laws aimed at actions federal agencies can take to reduce wildland fire risk across jurisdictions.

In 1992, the World War II 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coins Act directed the U.S. Treasury to mint commemorative coins and transfer the first $3 million in surcharges to the Foundation to create a D-Day and Battle of Normandy Memorial in Normandy. The Foundation received the $3 million in 1993 and constructed the Memorial Garden on leased land adjacent to a World War II museum in Caen, France.

2. The Foundation has experienced significant managerial, financial, and internal control problems, with liabilities substantially exceeding assets. An audit showed that the $3 million from the Treasury, plus interest, was used for the Memorial Garden's design, construction, and other costs totaling $3.6 million as of June 30, 1994. However, due to the Foundation's precarious financial condition, it is uncertain if it can fund future operating and maintenance costs of the Memorial Garden or proceed with other projects like the Wall of Liberty.

1. Pension plans invest in hedge funds and private equity to diversify their portfolios and seek higher returns, but these investments pose greater risks and challenges compared to traditional investments. Surveys indicate that a considerable number of mid to large-size plans invest in hedge funds and private equity, with larger plans more likely to invest. However, individual plan allocations are typically a small portion of total assets, around 4-5% on average. Data on the extent of hedge fund and private equity investments by small plans is unavailable.

2. Pension plans take steps to mitigate the risks of hedge fund and private equity investments, such as conducting extensive due diligence, diversifying across multiple funds, and negotiating key contract terms. However, these steps require greater expertise, effort and expense that may be too costly or complex for some plans, especially smaller ones.

It examines both crashworthiness (protecting automobile occupants) and aggressivity (protecting other roadway users struck by automobiles). The report also considers prospects for improving the safety of automobile occupants.

3. Since the mid-1960s, the number of traffic fatalities and fatality rate per registered vehicle have sharply decreased in the United States, with the fatality rate for automobile occupants declining by 36 percent since 1975. Continued emphasis on reducing drunk driving, increasing safety belt use, and introducing safety features like antilock brakes and air bags have contributed to this trend. Nonetheless, automobiles were still associated with nearly 29,000 traffic deaths in the United States in 1991.

1. Agencies often budget and allocate resources incrementally based on historical precedent rather than conducting bottom-up reviews and aligning resources with strategic plans and goals. Many agencies have not fully implemented portfolio management approaches to ensure IT investments support mission priorities and provide the best return on investment.

2. Agencies sometimes have fragmented decision-making processes for acquisition investments and fail to consider agency-wide needs and resource limitations. This can lead to a focus on individual over collective interests, duplication of effort and costs, and investments that undercut agency-wide goals.

3. Congressional spending directions sometimes require agencies to buy items and provide services that have not been planned for and may not be needed. This circumvents strategic planning, diverts resources from critical needs, and can exacerbate the government's fiscal imbalance.

4. Agencies often overpromise and underdeliver on major acquisitions due to competition for funding that incentivizes optimistic cost and schedule estimates. Programs frequently experience requirements instability, delays, and cost growth as they proceed without adequate technology maturity or design knowledge.

5. Contracts, especially for services, often lack definitive requirements at the outset to control costs and enable accountability. Agencies do not always use the most appropriate contracting approaches given the level of risk and complexity involved.

6. Agencies often pay contractors incentive and award fees without a clear link to acquisition outcomes in terms of cost, schedule, and quality. Even when programs do not meet goals, contractors are still paid significant portions of available fee.

7. The acquisition workforce faces serious challenges including declining numbers, inadequate skills and knowledge, and a lack of strategic human capital planning. At the same time, acquisition workloads and complexity are increasing, in part due to greater reliance on contractors.

8. Frequent turnover of key acquisition personnel reduces accountability for program outcomes. The revolving door between government and industry also creates risks of conflicts of interest.

9. Inadequate oversight and a lack of sustained leadership attention perpetuate recurring acquisition problems and reduce accountability. Establishing chief management officer positions and elevating the role of procurement organizations could help drive reform efforts.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) establishes a standard price per barrel each fiscal year to charge its fuel customers. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), along with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), estimates this standard price based on crude oil price forecasts from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a markup for refinement costs, and an estimate for nonproduct costs like transportation and storage. In fiscal years 2009-2013, DOD's actual fuel costs differed considerably from its budget estimates, largely due to fuel price fluctuations.

2. DOD uses the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund to absorb the effects of fuel price fluctuations. When actual fuel prices are higher than the standard price, the fund's cash balance decreases, and when actual prices are lower, the balance increases. To manage the fund's cash balance, DOD has transferred money into the fund from other accounts, obtained appropriations from Congress, and adjusted the standard price charged to customers.

3. Since 2004, DOD has conducted several studies on aspects of its bulk fuel program, but it has not updated its approach for setting the standard price to reflect current market conditions. The studies looked at DOD's management of working capital funds and alternatives like hedging fuel prices on the open market. However, DOD has not reevaluated whether using the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil benchmark with a refinement markup is still appropriate given recent market changes.

4. DOD's assumptions for setting the standard price do not account for differences between crude oil benchmarks, differences between domestic and international crude oil prices, and the decreasing correlation between crude oil and refined product prices. Other federal agencies have shifted from WTI to the Brent crude oil benchmark for estimating energy prices. DLA purchases about half its fuel from overseas, but WTI is a domestic benchmark.

5. DOD has not fully documented its rationale and assumptions for establishing each component of the standard price. While DOD's Financial Management Regulation provides overall principles for working capital funds, it does not require detailed documentation of the step-by-step process and rationale for the assumptions used in setting the standard price.

1. The objective was to assess the IRS' performance during the 1994 filing season, focusing on processing returns and refunds accurately and efficiently and providing taxpayer access to forms, information, and electronic filing. The work was done from January through August 1994 in accordance with government auditing standards. There were many positive aspects, with the number of returns increasing, computer systems performing well, and IRS exceeding accuracy and timeliness goals for refunds. However, there were problems with the Earned Income Credit (EIC) being a leading source of errors and the number of fraudulent refund claims growing.

2. The number of individual income tax returns received increased to 113.4 million compared to 112.7 million in 1993, although not as much as originally anticipated by IRS. Taxpayer use of alternative filing methods like electronic filing and TeleFile increased in 1994. IRS' computer systems generally performed well with only minor delays, and IRS exceeded its goals for issuing refunds within an average of 40 days and with at least 98% accuracy.

3. IRS tested the use of lockboxes and required service centers to develop procedures for depositing revenues to improve check processing and deposit tax receipts more timely. IRS also used a new system to measure the accuracy of returns processing, with separate goals for the Code and Edit and Transcription Sections that were exceeded. However, the EIC continued to be a source of many mistakes by taxpayers and tax practitioners, increasing IRS' error resolution workload.

4. The number and dollar amount of IRS-detected fraudulent refund claims continued to increase in 1994, with it being unclear how much was due to increased fraud versus improved detection and how much fraud might be going undetected. IRS took several steps to better control filing fraud, such as adding computer checks, increasing staff, initiating studies, and engaging the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Almost all identified fraudulent returns involved EIC claims, and recent EIC expansion is expected to encourage even more fraud attempts in 1995.

The authors interviewed officials, reviewed documents, spoke with stakeholders, and analyzed financial data to meet the reporting objectives.

4. Tennessee's TennCare demonstration project was designed to expand coverage to the uninsured while controlling costs through a capitated managed care system. The state contracted with 12 MCOs to provide services in exchange for monthly per-enrollee payments.

5. To finance expanded coverage while keeping expenditures within budget limits, Tennessee set capitation rates substantially below historical Medicaid costs and discontinued its DSH program. The federal government pays a portion of qualifying TennCare expenditures, subject to spending limits for the 5-year waiver period.

1. In the 1980s, the rapid increase in crack cocaine use was referred to as a drug epidemic. Federal agencies look for changing drug use patterns to identify emerging drug problems, such as the use of a new illicit drug, changes in how a drug is taken, increased use among populations that routinely abuse drugs, or use by a new population group or in a different geographic area. While national drug epidemics are considered rare, local areas more frequently experience emerging drug crises before they spread.

2. In the 1970s and 1980s, NIDA sponsored several surveys and a work group to help identify and monitor changes in drug use patterns, detecting that cocaine was being smoked as well as snorted, which was later associated with the emergence of the crack epidemic. However, NIDA was not able to collect national prevalence data on crack use in the general population until the late 1980s due to limitations and infrequent administration of the surveys used. There were also concerns about the accuracy and representativeness of data from NIDA's other drug detection mechanisms.

3. The federal public health response to crack in the 1980s focused primarily on cocaine in general rather than specifically on crack. NIDA's research aimed to develop best practice prevention and treatment approaches, and the agency launched education and outreach efforts related to cocaine. There was no significant change in block grant funding for state drug prevention and service delivery activities until congressional actions in the late 1980s changed the organization within ADAMHA to focus more on administering prevention and treatment programs.

4. To better identify and monitor changes in drug use activity, NIDA modified its drug detection mechanisms and new federal mechanisms were created to address coverage, timeliness, and methodological concerns. The creation of ONDCP and organizational changes to HHS' drug abuse agencies since the late 1980s were intended to strengthen the federal response to drug abuse problems. However, the effectiveness of these changes depends on how well the agencies carry out their roles and responsibilities under the Government Performance and Results Act.

1. In the mid-1970s, structural changes in the US economy led to many workers losing their jobs. In response, the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993 required states to establish a system to profile new UI claimants and identify those likely to exhaust regular compensation, referring them to reemployment services. States must consider certain factors in their profiling models and provide an orientation, assessment, and individual service plan to referred claimants. However, a recent Labor Department survey found that many states have not updated their profiling models in many years, potentially reducing their predictive accuracy.

2. Studies from the 1990s found that referring UI claimants to reemployment services reduced UI duration and benefit amounts. However, more recent data on the effectiveness of worker profiling is limited, and Labor's current data has reliability issues. Furthermore, most of the states studied do not provide the in-depth, individualized reemployment services originally envisioned by Labor. To improve the worker profiling program, GAO recommends that Labor reevaluate its data collection, take a more active role in ensuring profiling model accuracy, clarify its expectations for reemployment services, and evaluate the program's impact.

The military health system has three missions: maintaining the health of active-duty service members, maintaining readiness to treat wartime casualties, and providing care to dependents of active-duty personnel, retirees and their families, and survivors. In fiscal year 1999, DOD's annual appropriations included about $16 billion for health care, with over $1 billion funding care for seniors. TRICARE, implemented in the mid-1990s, provides care through over 600 MTFs and a network of civilian providers. TRICARE offers three options: TRICARE Prime (managed care), TRICARE Extra (preferred provider), and TRICARE Standard (fee-for-service).

2. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees. Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries choose their own providers and Medicare reimburses on a fee-for-service basis, with beneficiaries responsible for paying a share of costs. Most beneficiaries have supplemental coverage that pays for many costs not covered by Medicare, such as employer-sponsored insurance, ""Medigap"" policies, and Medicaid. Beneficiaries also have the alternative Medicare+Choice option to enroll in private managed care plans.

3. About 1.5 million retired military personnel, dependents, and survivors aged 65 or older are eligible for certain military health care services, with about 600,000 living within 40 miles of an MTF. Retirees have access to all MTF and network services through TRICARE until age 65 when they become eligible for Medicare, after which they can only use military health care on a space-available basis.

However, DOD has historically faced challenges in transitioning technologies from the lab environment to real-world use. To address these challenges, DOD and Congress have established several ""technology transition"" programs, each with a specific focus.

2. Three recent initiatives are the Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP), and Quick Reaction Fund, all managed by DOD's Office of Defense Research and Engineering. While these programs represent a small portion of DOD's overall investment in technology development, they have reported benefits such as improvements to performance, affordability, manufacturability, and operational capability for the warfighter. However, it is too early to determine the long-term impact of these programs due to the limited number of completed projects and lack of comprehensive performance measures.

3. To effectively transition technologies, transition programs need to establish effective selection, management and oversight, and assessment processes. The DACP had the most disciplined processes for selecting and managing projects, while the TTI had disciplined selection processes but less formal management and oversight. The Quick Reaction Fund was the least formal and disciplined, relying on flexibility and senior management attention.

Factors contributing to the EPA missing deadlines included an emphasis on stakeholder review, the need to prioritize the large number of new requirements, and competing demands from litigation on some rules. As of April 2005, 45 of the requirements with statutory deadlines remained unmet, so improvements in air quality from those actions are unrealized.

1. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) was created in 1991 to standardize and consolidate the Department of Defense's (DOD) finance and accounting operations, which were previously handled separately by each military service. DFAS assumed control of the large finance and accounting centers from the services and began taking over the functions at 332 local finance offices. By 1994, DFAS announced plans to consolidate activities from those 332 offices into just 5 centers and 21 operating locations. The military services use their operations and maintenance funds to pay DFAS for its services.

2. When DFAS was established, the military services transferred varying percentages of their finance and accounting personnel to the new agency - 75% for the Army, 50% for the Air Force, and 29% for the Navy. As a result, DFAS negotiated different levels of responsibility with each service for functions like travel pay. DFAS and the services now share finance and accounting duties, with DFAS reporting to the DOD Comptroller and the services managing their remaining personnel who report up to their respective secretaries.

3. DOD estimated it had 46,000 people performing finance and accounting in 1994, with 28,000 transferring to DFAS and 18,000 remaining with the services. As of 1996, DFAS had reduced its workforce to 23,500 through consolidation. The services were unable to provide exact numbers but estimated they currently have about 17,300 finance and accounting personnel, for a total DOD-wide workforce of 40,800.

1. The distribution of prescription drugs involves interactions among drug wholesalers, independent pharmacies, pharmacy services administrative organizations (PSAOs), and third-party payers and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Wholesalers purchase drugs from manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies. Independent pharmacies, which accounted for almost 34 percent of retail pharmacies in the U.S. in 2010, primarily purchase drugs from wholesalers and dispense them to consumers.

2. Independent pharmacies rely on PSAOs to negotiate contracts with third-party payers or their PBMs on their behalf. These contracts determine reimbursement rates, payment terms, and audit provisions for the pharmacies. Pharmacies must carefully choose which contracts to accept as payments from third-party payers significantly affect their financial viability.

3. At least 22 PSAOs were in operation in 2011 or 2012, representing between 20,275 and 28,343 pharmacies. Most PSAOs contracted with fewer than 1,000 pharmacies, and the largest 5 PSAOs combined contracted with more than half of all pharmacies represented by a PSAO. PSAOs provide services primarily to independent pharmacies, with nearly 75 percent of independent pharmacies associated with PSAOs.

4. PSAOs provide a broad range of services to independent pharmacies, with contract negotiation, communication, and help-desk services being the most consistent. PSAOs negotiate various contract provisions on behalf of pharmacies, including reimbursement rates, payment terms, and audit provisions. However, PSAOs reported having little success in modifying certain contract terms due to PBMs' use of standard terms and their dominant market share.

1. Hate crimes, defined as criminal offenses motivated by bias against protected characteristics, have become a prominent concern for policymakers. Congress has enacted several laws to address hate crimes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, and the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1994.

2. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, signed into law in 2009, expanded the scope of hate crime victims to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability. However, there are questions about Congress's authority to expand hate crimes legislation in light of the United States v. Morrison decision.

3. The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13th and 15th Amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing Congress's authority to enact hate crimes legislation. The commerce clause allows Congress to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, but the Morrison decision narrowed this category.

4. While the expansion of hate crime legislation may be suspect under the commerce clause, it may be within the scope of the legislative clauses of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. However, the 14th Amendment only covers state action, not private action, limiting its applicability to hate crimes committed by private individuals.

5. Section 2 of the 13th Amendment, which proscribes slavery and involuntary servitude without reference to federal, state, or private action, may be a more viable option for broadening hate crime legislation. It is unclear whether violence based on bigotry constitutes a ""badge and/or incident of slavery"" and if remedial legislation must be limited to the descendants of those for whose principal benefit the amendments were adopted.

1. Some analysts argue that certain East Asian nations, particularly China, Japan, and South Korea, have intentionally kept their currencies undervalued to gain an unfair trade advantage. The U.S. Treasury is required to analyze the exchange rate policies of major trading partners and determine if any are manipulating their currencies. In its April 2017 report, the Treasury did not find any major trading partner met all three criteria for currency manipulation. However, it placed six major trading partners, including four East Asian economies, on a ""Monitoring List"" for close attention to their currency practices.

2. Countries can choose from a range of exchange rate policies, from free floating to fixed pegs. A free float allows greater monetary policy autonomy but has disadvantages like exchange rate risk. A fixed peg eliminates exchange rate risk but sacrifices monetary autonomy and can be vulnerable to speculative attacks.

3. Many East Asian countries have adopted a ""managed float"" as a middle ground between the extremes. Hong Kong maintains a ""linked"" exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, while most other East Asian governments intervene in markets to keep their currencies from excessively appreciating or depreciating. Categorizing a country's de facto exchange rate policy can be complicated, as the official policy may differ from actual practice, especially during times of financial turbulence.

4. There are indications that some East Asian countries try to keep their currencies in line with others in the region to maintain export competitiveness. Some analysts point to the emergence of a ""renminbi bloc"" in Southeast Asia at various times, with several currencies seeming to follow the movements of China's currency against the U.S. dollar. However, this correlation has weakened in recent years.

COMs are responsible for overseeing nearly all U.S. government activities in their host countries, with the primary exception of military operations. The State Department's 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) emphasized the need to equip COMs to better coordinate interagency activities as the chief executive officers of multi-agency missions.

2. The authorities and responsibilities of COMs are explained primarily in the Foreign Service Act of 1980 and are also shaped by executive orders, presidential directives, and State Department regulations. COMs have responsibility for directing, coordinating, and supervising executive branch employees in their countries, authority over personnel, and the right to be fully informed about executive agency activities. The scope of COM authority has expanded over time through executive orders and directives.

3. COMs have authority over Department of Defense personnel in their countries, except for those under the command of a Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC). In countries without a U.S. embassy or diplomatic presence, fully authorized COMs still exercise authority over diplomatic relations and limited U.S. government activities. COM authority is not necessarily terminated or curtailed if the U.S. engages in hostilities with or within a country, unless the diplomatic mission is permanently closed.

In 2007, China became the world's second-largest merchandise exporter after the EU, and its net exports contributed one-third of its GDP growth that year. China's exports as a share of GDP rose from 9.1% in 1985 to 37.8% in 2008.

2. The global economic slowdown, especially among China's major export markets, has had a significant negative impact on its export sector and industries that depend on FDI. China's economic growth slowed sharply in 2008 and early 2009, with some analysts contending that annual growth of less than 8% could lead to social unrest. As the single most important contributor to world economic growth in 2007, a Chinese slowdown or recovery could have significant global implications.

3. The extent of China's exposure to the global financial crisis, particularly from the U.S. sub-prime mortgage problem, is unclear. China's restrictions on capital flows limit the exposure of its private sector and individual investors to sub-prime mortgages, but Chinese government entities may have more exposure through their investments in U.S. securities. As of June 2008, China was the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. securities at $1.2 trillion.

4. China's economy has been significantly affected by the global financial crisis due to its heavy reliance on trade and FDI.

The majority of itemizers (86.8%) had AGI under $200,000, but those with AGI over $100,000 claimed 63.6% of the total dollar amount of itemized deductions. Tax filers with AGI over $1 million, who were 0.8% of itemizers, claimed 13.1% of deductions.

The United States has strategic interests in the region and provides economic assistance to Pacific Island countries, particularly to the Freely Associated States of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. Congress plays key roles in approving and overseeing the Compacts of Free Association that govern U.S. relations with these states.

The United States conducts diplomatic outreach to the Pacific Islands region and is one of the largest providers of development assistance, along with Australia, New Zealand, France, Japan, and increasingly China. U.S. foreign assistance aims to promote sustainable economic development, good governance, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The United States also has significant economic interests in the region's fisheries and administers assistance through the South Pacific Tuna Treaty.

Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service to determine if their actions could jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat. In rare cases where a federal action cannot avoid jeopardizing a species, the agency, governor, or permit applicant may seek an exemption.

2. The exemption process allows consideration of economic factors and provides an opportunity for them to override jeopardy to a species. However, exemptions apply to specific federal projects rather than species. In over four decades, exemptions were sought only six times and granted twice.

3. Congress created the exemption process after the Tellico Dam controversy, where the Supreme Court ruled the ESA prohibited completing the dam to save the snail darter fish. The process involves a committee of top government officials balancing protecting species against the national interest in federal projects. Mitigation measures are required for approved exemptions, and the applicant must fund them.

4. Exemption applications have been rare, likely due to the stringent process, permanent mitigation funding requirement, and the fact that exemptions apply to actions rather than species. The ESA consultation process allows agencies to modify actions to avoid species jeopardy. Underlying resource allocation conflicts often drive ESA controversies more than species protection alone.

5. Three exemption applications were withdrawn or abandoned: for the Pittston oil refinery in Maine, a docking area in Illinois, and dredging in Florida. In California, some proposed seeking exemptions for Central Valley water projects due to ESA pumping restrictions to protect fish like Delta smelt and salmon.

1. The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has been a topic of debate since the introduction of the individual income tax in 1913. Currently, long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%, while short-term gains and ordinary income can be taxed at rates up to 35%. Net capital losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to an annual limit of $3,000, with excess losses carried forward indefinitely. The $3,000 loss limit prevents taxpayers from selectively realizing losses to minimize taxes.

2. Empirical evidence indicates that capital gains and losses are heavily concentrated among high-income taxpayers, with the majority of gains and losses realized by the top 2% of the income distribution. Increasing the net capital loss deduction would primarily benefit a small proportion of high-income individuals and may not effectively stimulate the economy. To address the growing asymmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and losses, adjustments could be made to the netting process or a tax credit for capital losses could be implemented.

2. The right to engage in collective bargaining under the NLRA extends only to ""employees"" and not to supervisors. The NLRB and courts have sought to define the term ""supervisor"" based on the 12 functions listed in Section 2(11) of the Act and whether the exercise of authority requires independent judgment.

The NLRB found that the process of equalizing workloads involved independent judgment.

It represents a strategically and economically important region that accounted for around 5% of total U.S. trade in 2008. The Obama administration has pursued a policy of expanding relations with ASEAN and Southeast Asia, in contrast to the Bush administration which was perceived as narrowly focused on terrorism and not sufficiently committed to multilateral dialogue.

2. The United States has deep-seated interests in Southeast Asia including maritime security, promotion of democracy and human rights, encouragement of trade and investment, counterterrorism, and combating illegal trafficking. As China has deepened ties in the region, some view it as an important site of ""soft power"" rivalry where the long-standing U.S. leadership role could be challenged. Despite considerable U.S. initiatives, particularly at the bilateral level, a perception developed among Southeast Asian elites that the U.S. placed little priority on ASEAN itself, demonstrating a lack of commitment to the region as a whole.

The Obama administration has taken symbolic steps to increase engagement with ASEAN, such as Secretary Clinton visiting the ASEAN Secretariat, the U.S. acceding to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and President Obama attending the first U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting in 2009.

5. Cuba was originally added to the list in 1982 for its support of terrorist groups in Latin America and Africa, though the economic sanctions had little practical effect since the U.S. already had a comprehensive embargo on Cuba.
6. The State Department's 2005 terrorism report contends Cuba actively opposes the U.S. war on terror, has close ties to other state sponsors of terrorism, provides safe haven to members of foreign terrorist organizations, and harbors U.S. fugitives from justice.
7. Supporters of keeping Cuba on the list point to its history of supporting terrorism, while critics argue it is a Cold War holdover and that Cuba's presence on the list diverts attention from more serious threats.
8. The level of terrorist activity varies considerably among countries on the terrorism list, with Iran considered the most active while Cuba and Sudan are considered less active supporters.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is an alternative tax calculation that adds back certain deductions and taxes income above an exemption at 26% and 28%. While originally affecting few taxpayers, the number paying AMT has increased significantly due to inflation and is projected to reach over 9 million taxpayers (6.3% of returns) by 2009.

2. The AMT is increasingly affecting middle and upper-middle income taxpayers, with dramatic increases in the share of AMT taxpayers in these brackets. Correcting the AMT is costly, with indexing exemptions estimated to cost $13.9 billion by 2008 and eliminating credit limits costing $26 billion by 2009.

3. The AMT significantly interacts with tax cuts by limiting their benefit for many taxpayers, especially for cuts aimed at married couples. For example, Treasury estimated that 28% of the marriage penalty tax cuts proposed in 2000 would be taken back by the AMT over 10 years.

4. Approaches to dealing with the AMT include: indexing exemptions to maintain its relative importance, examining the AMT structure itself in light of tax principles, eliminating the AMT entirely and directly limiting preferences instead, or keeping the AMT as a limited back-up while making its base more rational. How to adjust the AMT in tandem with regular tax changes to maintain its intended role is unclear.

5. The growth of the AMT has long been recognized as a problem that increases in importance with tax cuts. Reductions in the regular tax that are not accompanied by AMT adjustments increase the number of AMT taxpayers and the cost of future corrections.

1. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate draft bills to provide annual funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six small related agencies. DOT is primarily a grant-making and regulatory organization that supports transportation infrastructure and safety, while HUD's programs address housing problems for low-income households and other special housing needs.

2. Most THUD programs are funded through regular annual appropriations, but some funding comes from other sources like advance appropriations, emergency appropriations, and mandatory contract authority. Appropriators are subject to limits on discretionary funding but can stay within these limits by appropriating no more than the allocated amount or by offsetting higher funding levels through rescissions and offsetting receipts and collections.

3. For FY2018, the Trump Administration requested $106.65 billion for THUD programs, a $9.7 billion reduction from FY2017, while the House-passed bill would provide $115.3 billion (a reduction of less than 1%) and the Senate-reported bill recommends $119.1 billion (an increase of just over 2%). Key differences between the bills include funding levels for DOT programs like Essential Air Service, TIGER grants, and New Starts, as well as HUD programs like CDBG, HOME, and public housing.

The U.S. aims to isolate Iran and ensure its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only. India has traditionally had positive relations with Iran and does not share U.S. views of Iran as an aggressive regional power.

2. India and Iran have strong historical and cultural ties, and India is unlikely to abandon its relationship with Iran despite growing U.S.-India ties. Many in the U.S. Congress are concerned about India's relations with Iran, especially in the areas of defense and energy. The U.S. strongly opposes India's plans to purchase Iranian oil and gas and construct a pipeline to deliver Iranian gas through Pakistan.

3. India aims to balance its relationships with the U.S. and Iran, facing domestic political pressure to maintain ties with Tehran. India has voted with the U.S. on IAEA resolutions finding Iran in noncompliance with its obligations. The U.S. has occasionally sanctioned Indian entities for transfers of sensitive technology to Iran, although India denies a government-directed policy of assisting Iran's weapons programs.

4. India and Iran have maintained relatively low-level defense ties since the 1980s, with no evidence of significant military assistance. The 2003 ""New Delhi Declaration"" aimed to expand defense cooperation, but major new deals have not materialized. India and Iran have held some joint naval exercises and discussed upgrades to Iran's conventional weapons systems.

5. India-Iran commercial relations are dominated by Indian imports of Iranian crude oil, accounting for 90% of Indian imports from Iran. India is building energy ties with Iran, including a major long-term deal for Iranian LNG and potential investments in Iran's energy sector that could violate U.S. sanctions. The proposed Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline is a major point of contention, with the U.S. expressing strong concerns.

6. India and Iran have tacitly cooperated to secure mutual interests in Afghanistan, supporting the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. Both countries seek to prevent a Taliban return to power and have provided economic aid to the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.

1. The federal government has supported energy storage and electric power system technology since the 1970s, before the Department of Energy (DOE) was established. Early programs focused on energy storage to even out variable power from wind and solar and to support large coal and nuclear plants. Advances in computing, miniaturization, and industrial controls have expanded grid operators' ability to monitor and control power flows. However, the increase in Internet-connected networks has made the grid vulnerable to cyber intrusions and disruptions.

2. The nation's energy infrastructure is diverse, including electricity, oil, and natural gas transmission and distribution networks, both public and private, with assets dispersed geographically. Interdependency within the energy sector and across critical infrastructure sectors is significant. Key challenges facing the electric power industry include a changing generation mix, aging infrastructure, modernizing networks, accommodating new technologies, planning for increased interdependencies, and managing challenges while providing reliable and affordable electricity.

3. The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through R&D, demonstration projects, partnerships, modeling, and emergency preparedness. OE works with stakeholders to address aging infrastructure, achieve policy objectives, sustain economic growth, support environmental stewardship, and mitigate risks. OE's goal is to support economic growth and energy innovation through reliable, affordable, and clean electricity delivery to consumers.

4. OE funding is divided into five areas: R&D and deployment, modeling and analytics, institutional support and technical assistance, coordination of federal transmission permits, and emergency preparedness and response. In 2007, DOE established an independent Assistant Secretary for OE, elevating the office to an equal status with other major energy technology offices. OE's mission is guided by DOE's Quadrennial Technology Review and the Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan.

5. DOE's 2015 Quadrennial Technology Review outlined the department's strategy for grid modernization, emphasizing the need for a more flexible, agile grid that can dynamically optimize operations.

1. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was enacted in 1986 to guide the process of establishing memorials on federal land in Washington, D.C. It defined a commemorative work as any statue, monument, sculpture, memorial, plaque, inscription, or other structure designed to perpetuate the memory of a person, group, or event. The CWA does not apply to military properties, the Smithsonian, or the Architect of the Capitol.

2. The CWA divided Washington, D.C. into three areas for placing memorials: the Reserve, Area I, and Area II. The Reserve, created in 2003, is the cross-axis of the National Mall and is considered a completed work of civic art where no new memorials are permitted. Area I is reserved for memorials of preeminent historical significance and requires Congressional approval, while Area II is for subjects of lasting historical significance and does not require Congressional approval.

3. Establishing a memorial requires authorization by Congress, site selection and approval, design approval, fundraising, and construction. The National Park Service has a 24-step process to guide memorial sponsors through this process. Most memorials are sponsored by non-governmental groups that must raise their own funds, as federal funds are generally not used.

4. Once authorized, memorial sponsors work with the National Park Service, National Capital Planning Commission, Commission of Fine Arts, and other agencies on site selection and design. The Secretary of the Interior or Administrator of General Services has authority to issue construction permits once funds have been raised and the memorial design has been approved. After completion, the memorial is transferred to the National Park Service for management.

5. Since 1986, Congress has authorized 33 memorials under the CWA, with 18 completed, 11 in progress, and 4 with lapsed authorizations.

1. In an effort to expand health coverage options, 35 states have established high risk health insurance pools (HRPs). These programs target individuals who cannot obtain or afford private market health insurance, primarily due to preexisting health conditions. HRPs cover people denied coverage, quoted higher premiums, or offered policies that exclude preexisting conditions. Many states also use HRPs to comply with HIPAA portability and guaranteed availability provisions.

2. State HRPs tend to enroll a small percentage of the uninsured, with approximately 200,000 individuals enrolled in 34 HRPs in 2008, compared to an estimated 4 million potentially eligible. This limited enrollment reflects the narrow focus on individuals with preexisting conditions who lack access to public or group coverage and seek non-group market insurance. The Affordable Care Act also required the HHS Secretary to establish a temporary federal high risk pool program prior to 2014. This report focuses on the original state-established HRPs.

3. HRPs fill a niche in the patchwork health insurance system of private markets and public programs. Individuals without access to employer-sponsored insurance or ineligible for public programs may seek coverage in the nongroup market, where they undergo medical underwriting. Federal and state laws somewhat restrict insurers' ability to reject applications or design coverage based on health factors in this market. Nonetheless, some applicants are rejected, offered riders excluding certain conditions, or charged higher premiums, resulting in a fairly healthy nongroup market enrollee population that largely excludes those with moderate to severe health conditions.

4. Proponents argue that states can efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals using existing regulatory infrastructure and market knowledge, while also making the nongroup market more affordable by removing high-risk individuals. HRPs also function as a nongroup market safety net. Critics contend that HRPs are too small and underfunded to substantially reduce the uninsured, particularly among those with serious conditions, and that premiums and cost-sharing can make HRP coverage unaffordable. Consumer groups generally advocate for expanding the federal role in providing coverage through existing programs or broader reforms.

It prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality."" The act applies only to the sale of goods purchased for resale within the United States. Since its enactment, the Department of Justice has viewed the act less than enthusiastically, believing it is not beneficial to consumers.

2. Enforcement of the act has been entrusted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has acted inconsistently over the years. Most R-P cases have been brought by disfavored buyers. Defendants may assert affirmative defenses such as the ""meeting competition"" defense, where a lower price was necessary to meet a competitor's price, or that price differentials were ""cost justified"" based on production or delivery costs.

3. The 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act created a broad exemption from the R-P prohibition for purchases by schools, hospitals, and charitable institutions for their own use. The Supreme Court interpreted this exemption strictly in Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Association, Inc. (1976), holding it applies only to purchases enabling the hospital to meet its own needs and those of certain affiliated individuals. In Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Ass'n., Inc. v.

1. The Obama Administration has faced scrutiny for limiting or delaying enforcement of certain federal laws based on practical or policy considerations rather than constitutional concerns. These nonenforcement decisions have been justified as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the criminal context and administrative enforcement discretion in the civil context.

2. Prosecutorial discretion derives from the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause, and courts generally will not review discretionary prosecutorial decisions. However, prosecutorial discretion is not unfettered, and decisions based on impermissible factors like race or that infringe constitutional rights may be subject to judicial review.

3. Similar to prosecutorial discretion, administrative enforcement discretion is presumptively unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act. However, this presumption may be overcome where the substantive statute provides guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers or the agency has abdicated its statutory responsibilities.

4. Courts are more willing to review general enforcement policies than individual enforcement decisions. Remedies for invalid nonenforcement policies are more likely to involve invalidating the policy rather than compelling enforcement in a specific case.

5. Congress may guide or restrict executive enforcement discretion through statute. The executive branch has historically opposed legislative interference with enforcement decisions as a violation of the Take Care Clause.

6. General limits on Congress's authority over enforcement likely include: Congress may not itself enforce the law; Congress may not appoint or remove officers who enforce the law; and Congress likely cannot compel prosecution of a specific individual. The precise scope of Congress's power to structure executive enforcement discretion remains unclear.

In 2013, 45.3 million people were in poverty, statistically unchanged from 46.5 million in 2012. Poverty tends to rise during economic downturns and fall during periods of growth. The poverty rate increased markedly over the past decade due to two recessions, rising to 15.1% by 2010 before declining recently.

2. Poverty is more prevalent among certain groups, including minorities, women and children, the aged, those with low education, the unemployed, and those with a disability. In 2013, poverty rates were much higher for blacks (27.2%) and Hispanics (23.5%) compared to non-Hispanic whites (9.6%) and Asians (10.5%). The poverty rate for children was 19.5% in 2013, down from 21.3% in 2012 but still well above the 2006 pre-recession rate of 16.9%. Poverty among the aged 65+ was 9.5% in 2013, statistically unchanged from 2012.

1. Trade plays a critical role in the U.S. agricultural sector, with exports accounting for about 20% of total U.S. agricultural production according to USDA estimates. U.S. farm policy, renewed every five or six years through omnibus farm legislation called the farm bill, is often scrutinized for compliance with WTO rules. The current farm bill, the Agricultural Act of 2014, made several changes to the previous farm safety net and most of its provisions will remain in effect until September 30, 2018 or the 2018 crop year.

2. The U.S. is subject to WTO commitments governing domestic agricultural support under the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). The AoA categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs based on their potential to distort markets, with amber box subsidies that are the most market-distorting subject to strict spending limits. The U.S. is limited to $19.1 billion annually in amber box support, with exemptions for minimally distorting support under the green box, blue box, de minimis, or special treatment categories.

3. The SCM prohibits certain export and import subsidies and allows domestic support policies to be challenged if they cause adverse effects to other WTO members through market distortion. To evaluate WTO compliance of U.S. farm programs, policymakers consider a program's design, objectives and cost, and whether it fits AoA exemption criteria. If a program is AoA-compliant but still causes market distortion effects that spill over into international markets, it may be subject to WTO challenge under SCM rules.

4. Green box programs are minimally or non-trade distorting and exempt from AoA spending limits.

1. The campus-based aid programs - Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan - are authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. These programs are unique in that federal funds are awarded directly to institutions, which then determine the mix and amount of aid awarded to students.

2. The campus-based programs are among the oldest federal student aid programs, but now play a relatively smaller role compared to Direct Loans and Pell Grants. As Congress considers reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, issues related to the campus-based programs may include their distinctive purpose, the allocation formula for funds to institutions, and program-specific provisions.

3. The current allocation formula for campus-based funds to institutions is criticized for not adequately reflecting current student demographics and financial need. Proposals to change the formula aim to allocate funds based more on factors like the number of low-income students enrolled and student outcomes.

4. For the FSEOG program, Congress could consider amending award rules to better target funds to low-income students. The program was retained to serve as a supplement to Pell Grants, with institutions required to prioritize Pell recipients.

5. Issues for the FWS program include whether community service should continue to be an explicit purpose, with institutions currently required to use 7% of their allocation for community service employment. There are also questions about the extent to which FWS jobs align with students' career or educational goals and the program's impact on academic performance.

6. The authorization for institutions to make new Perkins Loans expired on September 30, 2017, and institutions are required to begin the process of distributing the assets of their Perkins Loan funds. Issues related to the wind-down include the assignment of outstanding loans to the Department of Education and reimbursement to institutions for loan cancellations.

7. With the expiration of the Perkins Loan program, undergraduate students will lose access to this form of aid, which helped cover a portion of the cost of attendance. It is unclear if students will be able to access other aid to replace Perkins Loans.

1. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks drew attention to the security of the nation's water supply and water quality infrastructure, which have long been recognized as potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks. These systems are highly linked with other infrastructure like electric power and transportation, making their security a broad concern. Damage or destruction by terrorist attack could disrupt water delivery, threaten public health and the environment, and cause loss of life. Water infrastructure is largely government-owned and may serve as a symbolic target for terrorists.

2. Water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources, dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, treatment facilities, distribution systems, and wastewater collection and treatment facilities. The federal government has built hundreds of water projects, primarily dams and reservoirs for irrigation, flood control, and municipal water use. The largest federal dams and hydropower facilities are critically entwined with the nation's overall infrastructure and are operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers. However, the vast majority of the nation's water infrastructure is owned by non-federal entities.

3. Federal dam operators went on ""high alert"" after 9/11, and coordination with law enforcement has been ongoing. For some time, less attention was focused on protecting wastewater treatment facilities than drinking water systems, but since 9/11, many water and wastewater utilities have switched from using chlorine gas as disinfection to safer alternatives. More than 2,800 drinking water and wastewater utilities are subject to risk management planning requirements under the Clean Air Act. Some advocate requiring utilities to use inherently safer technologies to reduce hazards.

4. There are no federal standards or agreed-upon practices within the water infrastructure sector to govern readiness, response to security incidents, and recovery. EPA is not authorized to require specific security measures, but the agency has provided guidance and grants to assist utilities with vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans. EPA has expanded its focus to an ""all hazards"" approach and supports mutual aid agreements among utilities to facilitate sharing of resources during emergencies.

1. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV) reauthorized and amended the Perkins Act, which provides federal support for career and technical education (CTE). The act was passed by the 109th Congress and signed by the President, authorizing funding for FY2007-FY2012. It refers to ""career and technical education"" rather than ""vocational and technical education"" and retains the overall purpose and structure of the previous Perkins Act. Perkins IV requires the Secretary of Education to make certain reservations from the funds appropriated for the act.

2. Perkins IV made changes to the funding formulas for state allotments and within-state allocations. It maintains the state allotment formula used under Perkins III unless additional funds are available above the FY2006 level, in which case up to one-third of the additional funds are allotted to qualifying states below the minimum grant amount, and the remaining funds are allotted to other states. The act does not change the postsecondary substate allocation formula but codifies a procedure already allowed by the Secretary for the secondary substate allocation formula. Perkins IV authorizes funding for national programs and activities, requiring an interim report on the national assessment by 2010 and a final report by 2011.

3. The act substantially strengthens and changes the accountability requirements and associated sanctions for failing to meet the requirements. It specifies separate core indicators of performance for secondary and postsecondary levels, requires disaggregation of data, and requires eligible agencies and recipients to meet at least 90% of an adjusted level of performance for each indicator or face sanctions. Perkins IV allows the Secretary to withhold only state leadership and administrative funds from agencies failing to meet requirements. It also permits agencies to withhold funds from recipients not meeting requirements, which must be used to provide services to students who would have been served by the recipient.

Cabo Verde's location makes it a transshipment point for drugs from Latin America to Europe and a key refueling stop for flights between Africa and the U.S.

2. Cabo Verde was uninhabited until colonized by Portugal in the 15th century and remained a Portuguese colony until 1975. Most Cabo Verdeans are of mixed Portuguese and African descent. The country's location and history gave rise to long-standing emigration to the U.S. and a large diaspora population in New England.

3. Cabo Verde became a multi-party democracy in 1991 after previously being a one-party state. Politics are dominated by two parties, the PAICV and MPD, although expatriate voters also elect representatives. The current MPD government, elected in 2016, has prioritized economic growth, poverty reduction, attracting investment, reducing crime, and countering drug trafficking.

4. Cabo Verde has a relatively high per capita income and positive social indicators compared to most African countries. It is classified as a lower-middle-income economy and ranks in the medium tier of the U.N. Human Development Index. Economic growth has recovered recently, driven by tourism and investment, although unemployment and poverty remain challenges, especially for women and youth.

1. The U.S. Constitution establishes two methods for the President to appoint officers: with Senate advice and consent, or unilaterally during a Senate recess. President Obama had difficulty obtaining Senate confirmation for his nominees to be Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

2. In 2011, the Senate rejected Obama's nomination of Richard Cordray as CFPB Director. The NLRB risked losing a quorum of members required to fully conduct business when the Senate did not confirm any of Obama's three nominees before a member's term expired.

3. In an effort to prevent recess appointments, the Senate held ""pro forma"" sessions every three to four days, where a single Senator would gavel in and out of session. On January 4, 2012, despite these pro forma sessions, Obama announced recess appointments of Cordray as CFPB Director and three NLRB members.

4. These recess appointments raise significant legal questions about the scope of the President's recess appointment power that may lead to litigation. Before reaching the merits, a court would need to determine if the plaintiff has standing and if the claims present a political question inappropriate for judicial review.

5. On the merits, key issues are whether pro forma sessions interrupt a recess and whether the Constitution requires a minimum recess length for appointments. If pro forma sessions are deemed sessions, the appointments occurred during a 3-day recess; if not, they occurred during a 20-day recess.

6. Historically, Presidents have not made recess appointments during intrasession recesses of less than 10 days. An argument exists that the Adjournment Clause, which says neither chamber can adjourn for more than 3 days without the other's consent, should be read in conjunction with the Recess Appointments Clause to require a recess of more than 3 days.

7. However, arguments can also be made that there is no constitutional basis for linking the Adjournment Clause and Recess Appointments Clause. A court may be hesitant to establish a minimum recess length in the absence of a clear constitutional standard.

1. Federal wildfire management costs have risen substantially since the 1990s, with appropriations averaging $3.4 billion annually from FY2004-FY2009 compared to $1.1 billion annually from FY1994-FY1999. The increased costs are attributed to more severe fire seasons, with the average acreage burned annually doubling from 3.32 million acres in the 1990s to 6.93 million acres in the 2000s. Wildfire management has also become a larger share of the Forest Service's discretionary appropriations, rising from 25% in the 1990s to 47% in the 2000s.

2. Borrowing funds from other agency accounts to cover excess wildfire suppression costs has become problematic. Historically, the Forest Service could borrow from well-funded mandatory spending accounts without significantly impacting other programs. However, declining timber sales have reduced those account balances, and rising fire costs have left fewer discretionary funds available to borrow, thus negatively affecting the agencies' non-fire programs.

3. The Federal Land Assistance, Management and Enhancement (FLAME) Act, enacted in 2009, established separate reserve accounts for wildfire suppression to be funded through annual appropriations. The FLAME funds can be used for large or costly fires when regular suppression appropriations are depleted. While this insulates other agency programs from fire borrowing, it does not provide incentives to reduce firefighting costs.

4. Fuel reduction treatments, such as prescribed burning and thinning, are proposed to reduce wildfire risks and costs by removing excess biomass. Fuel treatment acreage increased substantially from FY1995 to FY2004 but has since declined, with current treatment levels averaging less than 1% of federal lands annually. Limited empirical research has examined the effectiveness of fuel treatments in reducing wildfire severity and damages.

5. Using removed biomass for renewable energy production has been suggested to offset fuel reduction costs. Some limited Forest Service funds have been used for wood energy programs. However, the scattered and diverse nature of forest biomass makes collection and transport costs very high.

3. Mandatory coverage is projected to have a net positive effect on Social Security's long-term finances and could simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who switch between government and private sector jobs.
4. However, mandatory coverage could impose transition costs on state and local governments, and some argue that certain occupations like firefighters and police may be better served by tailored public pension plans outside of Social Security.
5. Mandatory coverage would eliminate the need for the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO), two unpopular and administratively complex provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for people who also receive non-covered government pensions.
6. State and local governments would need to decide how to modify their existing pension plans in response to mandatory Social Security coverage, which could involve benefit reductions or increased costs.

1. The United States has approximately 766 million acres of forestlands, with 58% privately owned. The federal government, primarily through the Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), has numerous programs to support forest management on private, state, and local forests. These programs support activities related to planning for and responding to wildfires, as well as supporting the development of new uses and markets for wood products. The FS has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance.

2. Congress authorized specific forestry assistance programs in the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924, which was revised in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees examine these programs in periodic farm bills. To be eligible for most programs, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, consisting of a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term statewide forest resource strategy, and publish an annual funding report.

3. The forestry programs may provide technical assistance, financial assistance, or both. Most FS assistance programs are available nationally, have permanently authorized funding without specified levels, and require discretionary appropriations. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, with the FY2018 appropriation of $355.1 million being 32% below FY2004 levels and 25% below FY2010 levels when adjusting for inflation.

4. The Administration requested $197.4 million for FY2019 and proposed to eliminate funding for seven programs. Some FS programs have been repealed by previous farm bills or have gone unfunded by Congress for several years, but activities may continue through other authorizations or funding sources. Other USDA agencies and the Department of the Interior also administer programs that may have forest conservation or protection benefits.

1. Burma is a hub for transnational organized crime, with groups trafficking drugs, humans, guns, wildlife, gems, and timber, generating billions of dollars annually. Corruption among Burma's ruling military junta facilitates this trafficking and provides criminal groups with immunity from law enforcement. Burma's long, remote borders and ongoing ethnic tensions in some regions create ""ungoverned spaces"" that are difficult for the government to control.

2. Congress has long been active in U.S. policy toward Burma, barring access to foreign assistance due to Burma's status as a major drug-producing state and authorizing sanctions for non-compliance with minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking. In 2008, Congress passed additional sanctions against Burmese officials in response to the regime's suppression of protests and inadequate response to cyclone Nargis. The 111th Congress may continue oversight of U.S. policy toward Burma, including a review of relations announced by Secretary of State Clinton in 2009.

3. Various armed ethnic groups and criminal organizations operate along Burma's borders, linked to past or ongoing insurgencies. The United Wa State Army (UWSA) is the largest group, with 16,000-20,000 members operating freely along the China and Thailand borders. Collusion between these groups and Burmese officials allows them to remain nearly immune from government interference.

4. Corruption is widespread in Burma's government, military, and business sectors, with the country ranked as the third-most corrupt in the world. Although there is little direct evidence, reports indicate military officials benefit financially from the drug trade and money laundering. The most frequent destinations for Burmese contraband are China and Thailand, but demand reaches as far as the United States.

5. Burma is one of the world's top producers of opium, heroin, and methamphetamine, generating an estimated $1-2 billion annually. The government's official strategy aims to end drug production and trafficking by 2014, but this goal is considered unlikely by many analysts. Tensions between the government, rebel groups, and neighboring countries could escalate if the regime combats the drug trade more vigorously.

2. The scientific community is divided on imposing stricter immigration limits on those with scientific and technical skills. Attempts to balance the needs for a skilled workforce and protecting job opportunities for U.S. workers continue to be debated.

3. After 9/11, the number of foreign students enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities slowed due to tightened visa policies and increased global competition. However, in 2008-2009, foreign student enrollment increased by 8%, with India, China, and South Korea as top countries of origin.

4. In 2006, foreign students earned approximately 36.2% of U.S. doctorate degrees in the sciences and 63.6% of doctorates in engineering. Temporary resident status students consistently earned the majority of these doctorate degrees from 1996-2005.

5. Foreign graduate students are prohibited from seeking employment due to visa restrictions but can be employed as research or teaching assistants on federally funded projects. Non-U.S. doctoral recipients receive more financial assistance from universities than U.S. doctoral recipients.

6. Some argue foreign student enrollment benefits universities and the nation's economy, while others contend there is unequal access for U.S. minorities to graduate education and research opportunities. Language barriers with foreign teaching assistants have also been a problem.

7. Immigrant scientists and engineers increased in the U.S. labor force during the 1990s, reaching a record in 2000. Some argue this has depressed job opportunities and wages for U.S. workers, while others maintain foreign workers are needed to fill key positions.

8. Concerns have been raised about foreign students receiving education in sensitive areas and increased scrutiny has been placed on students from countries sponsoring terrorism.

1. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows financially troubled businesses to reorganize and remain in operation rather than liquidate. The debtor generally remains in possession and can assume or reject executory contracts, but collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) are treated differently under section 1113. Recently introduced legislation, H.R. 3652 and S. 2092, would modify several sections of the Bankruptcy Code, including section 1113.

2. The bills assert that despite limits on executive compensation, executive pay flourishes in bankruptcies at the expense of workers and retirees. The bills call for comprehensive reform to remedy inequities and recognize employees' firm-specific investments. In 1984, the Bankruptcy Code was amended to add section 1113, outlining requirements that must be met before a court can approve rejection of a CBA.

3. H.R. 3652 proposes changes to existing subsections of section 1113 and adds six new subsections. The bill would replace the text of the first three subsections, with minimal change to the first. It removes ""assume or"" from subsection (a), clarifying that section 1113 does not apply to assumptions of CBAs.

4. The bill would limit modifications to CBAs that debtors can propose, requiring they last no more than two years, provide minimum savings needed to reorganize, and not overly burden the labor group compared to other groups like management. Current law has no time limit on modifications and considers fair treatment of all parties. The two-year limit could constrain negotiations and the debtor's ability to successfully reorganize.

5. The bill requires an impasse be reached before a court can approve rejection of a CBA. This is not in the current law, and courts have stated that rejection should not require an impasse. Including an impasse requirement may encourage negotiation, but strictly construing it could effectively eliminate most rejections and lead to more liquidations than reorganizations.

This could constrain labor representatives in negotiations.

1. Gross job loss, the total number of jobs eliminated by contracting firms, is a normal part of a functioning market economy and is typically offset by an even greater number of gross job gains. Even during expansions, the U.S. economy experiences significant gross job loss of 6.5 to 8.5 million jobs per quarter.

2. Net job loss, which occurs when gross job losses exceed gross job gains, is a more serious economic problem that usually happens during recessions. Fiscal and monetary policy can be used to mitigate net job loss.

3. Factors such as trade, trade deficits, offshore outsourcing, overseas investment, and economic restructuring cause gross job loss but do not typically lead to net job loss under normal economic conditions. Like technological advances, they result in a reallocation of labor to more efficient uses.

4. Policies that impede gross job loss can have high efficiency costs and potentially lead to lower gross job gains. Countries with high barriers to job loss, such as some Western European nations, have experienced higher unemployment compared to countries like the U.S. with lower barriers.

5. However, public policies that protect workers against risks posed by gross job loss can be justified on both social and economic grounds. If properly designed, they do not necessarily reduce gross job gains and can increase efficiency by addressing market failures.

6. For example, government-provided unemployment insurance helps overcome moral hazard and adverse selection problems that hamper the private unemployment insurance market. It strikes a balance between mitigating risk for workers and maintaining labor market dynamism.

7. Policymakers face the ongoing challenge of finding the right balance between protecting workers from the risks of job loss and maintaining an efficient, fluid labor market. This includes designing effective policies for unemployment insurance, job training, wage insurance, health care, and community assistance.

In the 19th century, Congress broadened the scope of commemoratives to include special observance days, monuments, federal holidays, commemorative coins, and anniversary celebrations. In the 20th century, Congress increasingly used commemorative legislation to name buildings, scholarships, endowments, fellowships, and historic sites. Commemorative options available to Congress are divided into those requiring legislation and those that do not.

Beginning in the 1960s, initiatives were undertaken to reduce the number of commemoratives proposed through legislation due to concern over excessive legislative time spent on such measures. Efforts included proposals to create an advisory commission to recommend appropriate commemorations and amending congressional rules on introduction and consideration of commemorative legislation.

1. This study compared a conventional 2D gelC-MS/MS method with repetitive injections to a 3D method using microscale solution isoelectric focusing (MicroSol IEF) prior to the SDS-PAGE step for analyzing a complex cancer cell lysate. Equal amounts of the same lysate were used and the total number of LC-MS/MS runs was kept constant between the methods. The 3D method identified 22% more proteins with two or more peptides compared to four repetitive runs of the 2D method.

2. Comparison of the proteins identified by the two methods showed over 90% overlap, with most of the apparent differences due to database redundancy and limitations in current analysis software. The 3D method provided greater depth of analysis for low-abundance proteins. In conclusion, the additional protein prefractionation by MicroSol IEF in the 3D method substantially increased proteome coverage compared to the 2D method with repetitive injections while using the same amount of instrument time.

1. This study compared the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (SMUPPP) procedures. The medical records of 404 patients who underwent these procedures at a single institution over a 10-year period were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: 198 patients who underwent tonsillectomy (group 1) and 206 patients who underwent SMUPPP (group 2). The incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was 5.05% (10 patients) in group 1 and 1.45% (3 patients) in group 2, showing a statistically significant difference (p = 0.05).

2. The difference in bleeding rates between the two groups could not be attributed to any factor other than the operative techniques used, as the tonsillectomy portion was performed identically in both groups. Suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP seemed to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence. The authors suggest routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.

1. This study investigated tissue transglutaminase (TGM2) expression in mononuclear leukocytes and kidney tissue in a rat model of chronic allograft injury (CAI). TGM2 mRNA and protein were found to be overexpressed by activated monocytes accumulating in the blood vessels of renal allografts on day 9 after transplantation. After resolution of acute rejection on day 42, TGM2 mRNA levels remained moderately increased in allografts compared to isografts, but protein levels were not significantly elevated. TGM2 mRNA expression was also induced in allograft tissue.

2. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that intravascular leukocytes, particularly monocytes, in renal allografts were strongly TGM2-immunoreactive. The increased TGM2 expression in allograft monocytes was not solely due to the higher proportion of monocytes in allografts compared to isografts. Interactions with graft endothelial cells and proinflammatory cytokines produced during acute rejection may induce TGM2 expression in monocytes. The discrepancy between TGM2 mRNA and protein levels in allograft tissue could be due to accelerated degradation or formation of insoluble cross-linked complexes.

3. TGM2 is a marker of M2 macrophages, but its expression by blood monocytes in vivo has not been previously described. The monocytes in this study did not express CD163, a typical M2 cell surface marker, suggesting that TGM2 can be expressed by activated monocytes, but it is unclear if its expression is confined to M2-like monocytes. The functional relevance of TGM2 expression in monocytes remains elusive.

4. Monocytes isolated from renal allografts during acute rejection showed increased levels of activated caspase-3, correlating with TGM2 expression. This suggests that TGM2 expression in blood mononuclear cells might be linked to apoptosis, which could be an anti-inflammatory stimulus capable of reverting rejection.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28}"

1. Residual and resistant microorganisms, including fungi like Candida albicans, are recognized as a basic reason for failures in root canal treatments. C. albicans has been found in 20% of endodontic treatment failures and is regarded as a dentinophilic microorganism with a tendency to invade dentin. Its presence in failed treatments may result from coronal leakage, contamination during treatment, or its ability to survive despite lack of nutrients and resist intracanalicular medications.

2. When repeated endodontic treatment fails or is not feasible, a root-end resection is the only alternative. The success of this procedure is influenced by apical sealing, avoiding contamination, and reducing microorganisms, so the antibacterial and antifungal properties of root-end filling materials are important. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was introduced in 1993 and approved by the FDA in 1998 as an endodontic biomaterial for various applications.

Stroke patients often exhibit motor and sensory deficits on the side contralateral to the damaged hemisphere, but there is increasing evidence of subtle motor deficits on the ipsilateral side as well. These ipsilateral motor deficits emerge during the acute phase and persist chronically. The reasons for ipsilateral motor deficits are still unclear, but they have been identified in laboratory testing of dexterous motor and coordination function.

2. Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, such as disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, or different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions. Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have focused on motor rather than sensory deficits. The current study aimed to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb and examine the correlation between the two variables in stroke patients using tracking and reposition sense tests.

Studies estimate the prevalence of RA in Italy to be around 0.5%, with higher rates in northern regions compared to southern regions. The incidence and prevalence of RA are expected to increase in Italy due to the growing proportion of elderly people in the population.

2. RA imposes a significant economic burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems in Italy. Before the introduction of biological agents, studies estimated the average annual cost per RA patient to range from €3,718 to €22,946 depending on disease severity, with indirect costs accounting for the largest portion. The availability of costly biological agents has led to a substantial increase in the direct costs of RA treatment in recent years.

3. The mean annual social cost of RA per adult patient in Italy was estimated to be €13,595 (2012 values), resulting in a total annual social cost of €3.5 billion. Direct medical costs accounted for only 21% of the total costs, while the remaining 79% were nonmedical costs, mainly sustained by households for informal care (40%) and by the economy due to work absenteeism (31%).

1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Risk factors include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C, alcohol use, and metabolic diseases. HCC is relatively resistant to chemotherapy, and the only approved systemic therapy is sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting RAF, VEGF, and PDGF signaling. The development of HCC involves multiple genetic and molecular alterations that drive tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis.

2. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor cellular MET (c-MET) promote cell survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. HGF is secreted by mesenchymal cells as an inactive precursor, which is activated by proteolytic cleavage. The c-MET receptor is expressed on epithelial cells and is also synthesized as an inactive precursor that undergoes cleavage into a heterodimer. HGF binding to c-MET triggers receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, and downstream signaling through multiple pathways including RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3.

3. The HGF-c-MET pathway is essential for normal embryonic development, organogenesis, and tissue repair. However, dysregulation of HGF-c-MET signaling occurs in many cancers, including HCC, and promotes tumor growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanisms of HGF-c-MET dysregulation in HCC include overexpression of HGF and c-MET, gene amplification, and crosstalk with other signaling pathways such as EGFR and VEGF.

The authors report 2 problematic cases from a diagnostic perspective, including one with inguinal lymph node metastasis initially misdiagnosed as a cutaneous adnexal carcinoma.

2. In the first case, a 29-year-old female presented with a large inguinal lymph node that was initially misdiagnosed as eccrine carcinoma. Further review and clinical history revealed it to be metastatic adamantinoma from a primary tumor in the left tibia that had been excised 3 years prior. Subsequent biopsies confirmed additional metastases to the left external iliac node and stable lung nodules.

3. The second case involved a 58-year-old female with a painful mid-shaft tibial lesion initially diagnosed as fibrous dysplasia in 1999. Nine years later, the lesion had grown and was widely excised, revealing occasional clusters of epithelioid cells amidst a fibrous dysplasia-like background, consistent with adamantinoma.

1. The ticks of the genus Amblyomma are large, ornate, longirostrate blood-feeding ectoparasites that bite a wide variety of vertebrates, including humans. Amblyomma testudinarium is frequently reported to bite humans in Asian countries, with cases of individuals being infested with over 100 larval ticks. In Malaysia, a patient was repeatedly infested with A. testudinarium. While A. testudinarium is known to be distributed in Korea, human infestation is rare, with only 2 previously reported cases in elderly Koreans.

2. This report describes a case of perianal infestation with A. testudinarium in a 73-year-old Korean man who presented with a solitary, non-painful nodule that developed 2 weeks after a trip to a rural area. The tick, which was 25 mm long and 18 mm wide, was surgically removed and identified as an adult female A. testudinarium based on its morphological characteristics, including its ornate scutum, comma-shaped spiracular plates, and the presence of a single spur on coxa IV that was longer than those on coxae II and III. Histopathologic examination revealed an intense skin reaction at the attachment site, with inflammatory changes observed through all skin layers.

3. The feeding lesion was composed of a superficial perirostral portion containing lamellate cement with projections into the adjacent tissue and a deep cavitary portion filled with purulent exudates. A dense, mixed cellular infiltrate surrounded the feeding lesion, extending into the neighboring dermis and subcutaneous tissues. Interestingly, there was a paucicellular zone immediately adjacent to the cement, possibly due to the anti-inflammatory effects of tick saliva. The patient had no evidence of infection or residual disease up to 1 month after surgical removal of the tick.

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by ventricular hypertrophy and is caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. Troponin T (TNNT2) mutations account for about 15% of familial HCM cases and are associated with a severe form of the disease with poor prognosis and high incidence of sudden death.

2. The authors identified three reported mutations and one new mutation of TNNT2 in 11 individuals from four Japanese families with HCM. The phenotypes varied between families, even those with the same mutation, ranging from mild hypertrophy to sudden cardiac death at a young age.

3. A 5-base-pair deletion/deletion polymorphism in intron 3 of TNNT2 was also found in one family, which may be associated with more severe left ventricular hypertrophy. However, more research is needed to confirm this finding.

4. The authors conclude that in Japanese familial HCM, the specific TNNT2 mutation alone does not reliably predict prognosis, though the presence of a mutation indicates risk of sudden death in youth. They suggest detailed monitoring of patients from birth in each family and development of individualized ""case-based"" approaches considering potential modifying factors.

1. Schistosomatidae includes several digenetic endoparasites with complex life cycles alternating between intermediate freshwater gastropod hosts and definitive bird, reptile, fish, and mammal hosts. Schistosoma is the best studied genus, with six species infecting humans and causing the debilitating disease schistosomiasis, which is considered a major public health issue in 77 countries. Comparative genomics of S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni has revealed conserved features like GC content, repetitive elements, and synteny. The genomes of these three species range from 363 to 397 MB in size with 10,852 to 13,469 protein-coding genes.

2. Mitochondrial genomes of six Schistosoma species have been sequenced, ranging from 13,503 to 16,901 bp and encoding 36 genes. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial genes suggest an Asian origin of the genus Schistosoma, with subsequent migration to Africa, diversification, and reinvasion of Asia. Molecular data has been used to reconstruct relationships among 23 Schistosoma species divided into 6 clades. Evolutionary frameworks have also been applied to improve functional annotation of schistosome genes and study protein family evolution.

3. Transcriptomic studies have elucidated differential gene expression between schistosome genders, life stages, and species using techniques like microarrays and RNA-seq. Laser microdissection microscopy has enabled tissue-specific expression profiling. Posttranscriptional regulation in schistosomes occurs through mechanisms like alternative splicing of microexon genes and trans-splicing of spliced leader RNAs. RNA interference has been used for functional genomic screening in schistosomes, although challenges remain in developing transgenesis tools.

1. For patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCLM), hepatic resection combined with resection of the primary colorectal tumor offers the best chance for long-term survival. However, the optimal surgical strategy remains controversial, with options including simultaneous resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases or staged resections with the primary tumor resected first followed by resection of liver metastases at a later time. Simultaneous resection offers advantages of earlier completion of surgery and initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy, decreased mental and physical stress for the patient, and lower total treatment costs.

2. This study evaluated morbidity and anastomotic leakage rates after simultaneous resection for SCLM and found higher rates compared to patients undergoing resection for metachronous liver metastases or primary colorectal cancer alone. Intraoperative blood loss and operation time greater than 8 hours were predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage, respectively. Based on these results, the authors recommend considering staged resections when the predicted simultaneous resection operation time would exceed 8 hours to minimize the risk of serious complications.

1. This study aimed to validate two scores for assessing patients' ability to use metered dose inhalers (MDIs) or dry powder inhalers (DPIs), identify the most common errors in their use, and determine which patients need an educational program for these devices. The study was conducted in three phases: validation of the reliability of the inhaler technique scores, validation of the content of the scores using a convenience sample, and testing for criterion and discriminant validity of the instruments in patients who met the study inclusion criteria. In the convenience sample of 16 patients, there was interobserver disagreement in 19% and 25% for the DPI and MDI scores, respectively. After analysis by subject matter experts, the scores were modified and applied to 72 patients.

2. The most relevant difficulty in the use of both devices was the lack of maintenance of total lung capacity after deep inhalation. The degree of correlation of the scores by observer was 0.97 (p < 0.0001). There was good interobserver agreement in classifying patients as able/unable to use DPIs (50%/50% and 52%/58%; p < 0.01) and MDIs (49%/51% and 54%/46%; p < 0.05).

3. The validated scores allow identification and correction of inhaler technique errors during consultations and, consequently, improvement in the management of inhalation devices. To our current knowledge, we found one study in the literature that validated MDI scores for asthma patients and only one study with COPD patients for DPI scores. Furthermore, according to Basheti et al., although the use of checklists for a specific inhaler is the most feasible evaluation method, there is little evidence to assess the relative importance of different criteria.

4. Divergences in scoring systems for the same inhalation device in different studies make direct comparison of results difficult. Considering that our study validated scores for both MDIs and DPIs for asthmatic patients, the results obtained allowed us to score errors in both and treat them in a personalized way, so that all patients could be instructed on the correct way to use these devices based on their technique execution errors.

1. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that have potential use as natural food preservatives and in human, veterinary, and animal production applications. Bacteriocins can have activity against closely related bacteria or across genera. The antimicrobial sensitivity of a target strain to a bacteriocin depends on various environmental factors.

2. Enterococcus faecalis S37, isolated from chicken feces, produces a bacteriocin named enterocin S37 that has activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Enterocin S37 was purified and characterized as a potential class IIa bacteriocin based on its properties. The activity of enterocin S37 increased during the purification process as inhibitory compounds were removed.

3. The effect of K+ channel modulators on the activity of enterocin S37 against sensitive and resistant L. monocytogenes strains was studied for the first time. The combination of enterocin S37 with K+ channel activators and inhibitors suggested that the bacteriocin causes depletion of intracellular K+ by acting on ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Enterocin S37 likely interacts with the cell membrane to form pores and cause loss of intracellular components leading to cell death.

1. The main concern in health care services is to ensure the highest possible standard and meet the needs of individual service users and communities. In 1997, the UK Department of Health introduced clinical governance (CG) as a strategy for improving quality of health care services. The classic definition of CG by Scally and Donaldson is ""a system through which [health] organizations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish"".

2. The Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) has applied CG as a framework for improving quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009. The CG model developed in Iran consists of seven interlocking components including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information. Systems awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication are considered as a foundation of this model.

3. A number of studies have assessed the implementation of CG in different health systems and health care settings. Insufficient knowledge and attitude toward CG, lack of resources, inadequate information technology systems, resistance to change, necessity of cultural change and professional boundaries were the main factors explored by previous studies. Lack of adequate senior management support as well as resources, structural and cultural issues were also considered as obstacles.

4. To obtain a comprehensive understanding about senior managers' viewpoint toward CG barriers and facilitators, a qualitative research was employed using face-to-face interviews and relevant document reviews. Deputies for curative affairs of all types of Iranian medical universities were purposefully selected to maximize the sample diversity and provide a comprehensive view toward CG implementation. The qualitative thematic framework analysis was used to analyze the data with the assistance of the Atlas-ti software.

1. Hydatid cyst disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus parasite. Canines such as dogs and wolves are the final host, while herbivores and humans are intermediate hosts. Humans can be infected by consuming contaminated water or vegetables, or through direct contact with infected dogs. The disease commonly affects the lungs and liver in humans.

2. Hydatid cyst disease is prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in countries with traditional animal husbandry practices. In endemic regions, the incidence rate can exceed 50 per 100,000 person-years, with a prevalence of 5-10% in humans. Iran is considered a hyper-endemic area by the WHO due to close human-animal relationships and traditional animal husbandry. The prevalence of human hydatid cysts in Iran ranges from 1.1% to 13.7%.

3. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Khorasan Razavi province, Iran, from 2011-2014 to determine the epidemiological and clinical status of human hydatidosis.

1. Friederich first described ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) in 1857, suggesting their congenital origin. Wheeler and Edmonson coined the term ""CHFC"" and identified their characteristic four-layered structure. CHFCs are thought to result from foregut evagination during embryonic development.

2. Approximately 103 cases of CHFC have been reported worldwide, with only four describing laparoscopic excision. This paper presents a case of a 32-year-old woman with right upper quadrant pain who underwent successful laparoscopic removal of a CHFC. The rationale for laparoscopic excision and a literature review are discussed.

3. Imaging studies revealed a 10 cm × 7.6 cm × 5.8 cm cyst in the right liver lobe, initially suspected to be a simple cyst. During laparoscopic surgery, the cyst was found to be adherent to the liver surface by a small pedicle. Complete excision was performed instead of de-roofing.

4. Pathologic review confirmed the diagnosis of CHFC, showing the characteristic four layers without evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. CHFCs are rare, with improved imaging techniques leading to increased reporting in the last 25 years. They are most commonly found in segment IV of the left lobe, with an average size of 4 cm and a slight female predominance.

5. CHFCs are typically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging, at autopsy, or during surgery. Their imaging appearances vary, and the main differential diagnosis is bronchogenic cyst due to their shared embryonic origin. Elevated CA19-9 levels can be confounding, and rare cases of malignant transformation have been reported.

6. Treatment recommendations for CHFCs range from observation to aspiration to surgical excision. Most authors agree that cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, and those with wall abnormalities or unexplained liver function tests should be surgically excised.

However, low bioavailability, longer onset of action, and difficulty swallowing tablets led to the development of orally dissolving strips as an alternative dosage form.

2. Orally dissolving strips dissolve within 60 seconds in the oral cavity without the need for water or chewing. They are useful for patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets and in conditions requiring rapid drug absorption.

3. Clobazam is an ideal drug candidate for orally dissolving strip formulation due to its use in epilepsy treatment, low dose requirement, and the need for rapid action to control seizures. A 32 factorial design was used to optimize the formulation using PVA as the film forming polymer and SSG as the disintegrant.

4. The prepared orally dissolving strips were evaluated for various physicochemical properties, mechanical strength, and in vitro drug release. FTIR and DSC studies confirmed the compatibility between clobazam and the excipients used.

The review aimed to inform researchers, healthcare professionals and policy-makers and make recommendations for the design of future outcome measures suitable for use in stroke self-management. To identify relevant outcome measures, the review first searched for studies of stroke SMIs, and then searched for evidence of the measurement properties of the outcome measures used in those studies.

2. 43 abstracts were identified as potentially relevant SMI studies and were screened, with 19 articles meeting inclusion criteria. The studies originated from various countries including the UK, Australia, Canada, USA, Sweden and Hong Kong. The interventions targeted different populations (community-dwelling, acute recovery phase, care home residents) and were delivered through various formats by different professionals.

3. Although all studies focused on stroke self-management, none actually measured self-management as a discrete concept. Instead, they measured a range of concepts presumably selected to reflect the expected outcomes or process of self-management, such as physical functioning, mood, quality of life, healthcare utilization, and medication compliance. However, the theoretical links between these concepts and self-management were often not made explicit by the study authors.

4. Several studies used unreported outcome measures developed by the authors or modified from existing measures without establishing their validity. This makes it difficult to determine if those measures actually reflect meaningful aspects of self-management for stroke survivors. Only about half the measures used had any evidence of their measurement properties in stroke populations.

5. When the measures were evaluated against the COSMIN criteria for methodological quality, most scored poorly. No measure had evidence for all the COSMIN measurement properties. Only three measures (SSEQ, SIPSO, SA-SIP30) scored 'excellent' for content validity, indicating they were developed with input from the target population to ensure they capture outcomes relevant to patients.

6. Physical functioning was the most commonly measured concept, with over half the measures relating to physical function. This suggests an assumption that improved physical function is a key outcome of self-management. However, physical function may not fully capture important aspects of self-management such as decision-making, confidence, and coping with the psychosocial impacts of stroke.",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30}"

Objective factors that may influence OA disease severity include age, height, weight, and BMI. Physiotherapists use both self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to monitor pain, symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL) in OA knee rehabilitation.

2. Self-reported questionnaires provide subjective information about the disease process without examiner bias, while performance-based tests objectively measure a patient's ability to perform ADL activities. Examples of self-reported questionnaires include WOMAC, SF-36, and KOOS, while examples of physical performance tests are the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Six-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT), and stair climbing test. There is no consensus on which tests to use, but ideally, both self-reported and functional tests should be used and correlated for more valid results.

The study aimed to characterize the immunophenotype of the gastric mucosa in pediatric patients with CD and HP infection, the two most prevalent causes of LG in children. The study included 40 patients divided into 4 groups: normal controls, CD without HP, HP positive without CD, and CD with HP.

2. The highest proportion of LG (50%) was found in CD patients without HP, followed by CD patients with HP (20%), HP positive patients without CD (8.3%), and none in the control group. Patients infected with HP had the highest number of lymphoid aggregates regardless of CD status. The mean number of CD3+ and CD8+ IELs was significantly increased in CD patients with or without HP compared to controls, while HP infection alone did not contribute to the number of CD8+ IELs.

3. The main finding was the highest prevalence of LG in pediatric CD+HP- patients, followed by CD+HP+. CD patients with associated HP infection showed a lower rate of LG, possibly due to HP converging the immune response towards Th2 and suppressing Th1.

1. The REVIVE survey was an online evaluation of postmenopausal women in the US, conducted in 2012. Of the 8,081 postmenopausal women who responded, 3,046 (38%) reported at least one symptom consistent with vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA).

2. Most women were unfamiliar with the terms VVA and vulvar and vaginal atrophy, and only about 25% identified menopause as the cause of their symptoms. Almost half had never discussed their VVA symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP).

3. The most commonly reported VVA symptoms were vaginal dryness (55%), dyspareunia (44%), and local irritation (37%). Over half of participants said VVA negatively impacted their enjoyment of sex.

4. 40% of participants reported using VVA-specific treatments (over-the-counter products or prescription therapies). Limitations of current treatments included inadequate symptom relief, inconvenience, and dislike of vaginal administration.

5. In an additional analysis of the REVIVE data, only 35% of women currently using any VVA treatment were satisfied with it. Major concerns with over-the-counter products included long-term safety and messiness, while those using prescription therapies felt they had no other options or were inconvenienced by the administration.

6. HCPs can help bridge communication gaps about VVA by normalizing the conversation and using broad statements to put patients at ease. Simple screening questions can be incorporated into routine visits for women in their mid-40s.

7. Patient education should explain that VVA is a common condition associated with reduced estrogen levels after menopause that will worsen if left untreated. Describing the physical changes in vaginal tissues can help patients understand their symptoms.

8. Over-the-counter products do not effectively treat the underlying causes of VVA. Prescription therapies (vaginal estrogens and the oral estrogen agonist/antagonist ospemifene) directly improve the physical changes.

1. In Denmark, women planning to conceive are advised to take a daily 400 μg folic acid (FA) supplement until the 12th week of gestation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. FA is primarily taken as single supplements or as a component of multivitamins (MVs). Despite campaigns promoting the FA recommendation, compliance remains low among Danish women. Previous studies have reported poor compliance in other countries as well, with young age, low education and income, smoking, overweight, and parity being predictors of noncompliance.

2. The present study was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an internet-based prospective cohort study of Danish pregnancy planners called ""Snart-Gravid"" (Soon Pregnant). Eligible women were Danish residents aged 18-40 years, living with a male partner, not using birth control, not receiving fertility treatment, and attempting to conceive for no more than 12 months. Data on preconceptional use of FA and MV supplements and sociodemographic, lifestyle, reproductive, and medical variables were assessed at baseline. Participants who reported using FA supplements, MV supplements, or both were defined as ""users"", while those using other single-vitamin/mineral supplements or no supplements were defined as ""nonusers"".

3. The study examined associations between FA/MV use and various factors, including age, education, income, intercourse frequency, months attempting pregnancy, Pap smear attendance, smoking history, alcohol intake, BMI, physical activity, previous spontaneous abortion, parity, and medical conditions. Prevalence proportions (PPs) of FA/MV users were estimated for each predictor level, and multivariate binomial regression was used to obtain prevalence proportion differences (PPDs) with 95% confidence intervals. Overall, 62.1% of the 5,383 participants were FA/MV users. Higher age, completing high school, having a long vocational training, higher income, frequent intercourse, regular Pap smears, and previous spontaneous abortion were associated with increased FA/MV use.

1. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition resulting from narrowing of arteries in the lower extremities due to atherosclerosis. PAD is an important predictor of substantial coronary and cerebral vascular risk, and its most common symptomatic manifestation is intermittent claudication.

2. Oxidative stress and high blood concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are involved in the development and progression of PAD. Statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs, have important pleiotropic effects including reducing oxidative stress and improving endothelial function.

3. This study evaluated lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of PAD patients before and after surgery, and compared these parameters with those in a group receiving simvastatin therapy. The study found that PAD patients before surgery had enhanced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), compared to those treated with simvastatin.

4. The total antioxidant capacity (expressed as FRAP) decreased after surgery in PAD patients. Thiol group concentrations also decreased 3-5 days postoperatively but increased 7-10 days after surgery.

5. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was higher in the simvastatin group and 7-10 days after surgery compared to before and 3-5 days after surgery. The studied parameters in PAD patients before surgery were significantly correlated with mean changes at 3-5 days and/or 7-10 days after surgery.

6. The findings suggest that lipid peroxidation may be a mechanism through which several risk factors promote PAD. The results provide strong support for the efficacy of statin therapy in PAD and show diverse oxidative state responses to surgical treatment.

1. The demand for herbal remedies in Nigeria has been rising, but there is little scientific data on their safety and medicinal claims. The study aimed to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to FIJK herbal mixture on rat biochemical indices and liver morphology.

2. Oral administration of FIJK to rats did not significantly change body weights or relative organ weights, but caused reduction in plasma protein at higher doses. Assessment of lipid profile showed FIJK exposure depleted HDL-C, increased LDL-C and triglycerides at the highest dose, and elevated the atherogenic index.

3. FIJK treatment lowered plasma ALP levels at the highest dose, but significantly increased ALT and AST levels at all doses, suggesting liver injury. Plasma MDA levels were elevated and GSH levels depleted, indicating lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress caused by FIJK.

4. Microscopic examination of rat liver sections revealed lesions from FIJK exposure, including hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, hyperemia and inflammation. The histopathological findings support the biochemical alterations and hepatic injury caused by repeated FIJK exposure.

5. The study showed that repeated oral exposure to FIJK herbal mixture in rats elevated the atherogenic index, suggesting increased risk of cardiovascular disorders. FIJK also caused lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and liver lesions in the rats.

6. In conclusion, the study revealed that oral and repeated exposure to the FIJK herbal mixture has toxic effects in rats, altering biochemical parameters and causing hepatic injury. This highlights the need for scientific validation of the safety and medicinal claims of herbal remedies being marketed in Nigeria.

1. Preconceptional carrier screening for autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders can identify carrier couples and inform them of reproductive risks and options before pregnancy. Carrier screening detects carrier status in those without an a priori increased risk, while carrier testing is for those with a higher risk based on personal or family history. Carrier screening can be offered individually or as an organized screening program, either before or during pregnancy. The primary goal of preconceptional carrier screening is to promote reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making.

2. Despite recommendations from professional organizations, preconceptional carrier screening is not widely offered, with testing usually restricted to those with a family history or partner of an affected individual. Concerns underlying this hesitation include psychological impacts, risk of stigmatization/discrimination, impairment of free choice, medicalization, difficulty reaching couples before conception, and lack of provider familiarity with genetics. Recently, some commercial companies have begun offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers (DTC). DTC genetic testing is often defined as tests marketed directly to the public without the involvement of a healthcare provider.

3. The current DTC offerings of preconceptional carrier tests from various companies differ in their specifics. Some offer testing for a single condition like cystic fibrosis, while others offer panels of dozens or over 100 conditions. These companies do not distinguish between screening those with low a priori risk versus testing those already at high risk. The inclusion of a large number of conditions, some of which may not be medically significant, contrasts with the more limited scope of traditional preconception screening programs.

4. Established criteria for genetic screening programs specify that the screened conditions should be an important health problem and that a suitable test with a known predictive value should be used. The large panels offered by some DTC companies may include conditions of questionable severity and tests of variable clinical validity and utility. Including a wide range of conditions in one panel also makes it difficult to ensure adequate informed consent and pre-test education. Although some companies provide information on their websites, research suggests many consumers would struggle to find and understand it sufficiently to make an informed decision.

1. Implant removal surgeries are commonly performed but there is a lack of clear guidelines on indications for removal. Pain and discomfort, infection, and implant failure are some of the main reasons for implant removal. Although there are presumed benefits like functional improvement and pain relief, the surgery can lead to complications such as neurovascular injury and refractures.

2. In this prospective study of 83 patients, the most common indications for implant removal were pain/discomfort/prominent hardware (39.75%), infected hardware (28.91%), and implant failure (9.52%). The implants most frequently removed were distal tibial/ankle plates, femoral intramedullary nails, olecranon wires and plates, and tibial nails and patellar tension band wires. Complications encountered included persistent pain, superficial wound infections, ulnar nerve neuropraxia, and refracture after sequestrectomy.

3. The study found a strong male preponderance in implant removal surgeries. The mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher compared to those with pain or implant failure. While routine removal in asymptomatic patients is not recommended, there is a need for concrete guidelines on indications for implant removal, considering the potential risks and complications associated with the procedure.

1. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve atrophy, with Müller cells playing important roles in retinal function and pathology.
2. The study aimed to determine if α-aminoadipic acid (AAA) treatment inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
3. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were used, and AOH was induced by increasing intraocular pressure to 110 mmHg for 60 minutes.
4. Immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, and Western blot were performed to assess RGC apoptosis, Müller cell gliosis, and TNF-α levels.
5. AOH induced apoptotic death of RGCs and decreased the number of Thy-1-positive RGCs, while AAA treatment significantly attenuated these effects.
6. AOH also induced Müller cell gliosis, as evidenced by increased GFAP immunoreactivity across the inner plexiform layer, which was markedly reduced by AAA treatment.
7. Retinal TNF-α protein levels were significantly upregulated in AOH, and AAA treatment attenuated this increase.
8. The study suggests that AAA promotes survival of RGCs in the rat model of AOH by inhibiting Müller cell gliosis and downregulating TNF-α production, making it a potential therapeutic target for glaucoma.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). In 21-OHD, precursors are shunted into the androgen synthesis pathway, causing signs of androgen excess like ambiguous genitalia in females and rapid growth in both sexes. Since the 1950s, CAH has been effectively managed with oral glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. The authors report four cases of CAH patients managed with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone who later developed adrenal masses found on abdominal CT scans.

2. The overall incidence of classical 21-OHD is 1:10,000-1:15,000. The 21-hydroxylase gene CYP21A2 is located on chromosome 6p21.3, with over 90% of mutations arising from recombination with the inactive pseudogene CYP21A1P. 21-OHD leads to hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, hyperandrogenism, and catecholamine deficiency. Classic CAH is classified as salt-losing or non-salt-losing (simple virilizing), while non-classic CAH may be asymptomatic or associated with signs of androgen excess later in life.

3. Classic CAH is characterized by decreased cortisol and aldosterone with increased androgen biosynthesis. Females have ambiguous genitalia at birth due to androgen exposure in utero, while males have no obvious signs except hyperpigmentation and possible penile enlargement. Salt-losing CAH presents with vomiting, dehydration, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in the first weeks of life. Non-classic CAH manifests with hyperandrogenism signs like premature pubarche, tall stature, advanced bone age, menstrual irregularities",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. Self-rated health (SRH) is a single survey question that has been validated as a tool to predict mortality and functional ability. SRH is associated with lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, which can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases. Following dietary recommendations (e.g. consuming more fruits and vegetables) and physical activity guidelines is associated with better health outcomes and SRH. This study examined the relationship between dietary and physical activity behaviors and SRH in a diverse sample of adults in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

2. The study analyzed data from the Living for Health Program which collected information on health behaviors from 1,701 adults. SRH was categorized as excellent/very good/good or fair/poor. Fruits and vegetables intake, fat intake, and physical activity were assessed through survey questions.

3. The results showed that participants who reported poor/fair SRH were more likely to be female, older, obese, non-Hispanic black, have comorbidities, consume fewer fruits and vegetables, have a higher fat intake, and be less physically active compared to those reporting excellent/very good/good SRH. Logistic regression models indicated that lower fruits and vegetables intake, higher fat intake, and less physical activity were associated with higher odds of reporting poor/fair SRH, with some gender differences observed. The association between low physical activity and poor/fair SRH was significant for females but not males after adjusting for covariates.

4. This study highlights the relationship between modifiable lifestyle behaviors and SRH in a diverse, primarily Hispanic and black population. The findings suggest that gender differences may need to be considered when designing lifestyle interventions to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Limitations of the study include the cross-sectional design, which prevents establishing causality, and the lack of data on other factors that may influence SRH, such as socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors.

1. Fetal MRI, first used in 1989, has become increasingly important for diagnosing prenatal anomalies, especially in the central nervous system. Ventriculomegaly, a condition where the cerebral ventricles are enlarged, can be classified as mild (10-12 mm), moderate (12-15 mm), or severe (> 15 mm). MRI provides excellent contrast resolution to differentiate brain structures and detect additional cerebral anomalies associated with ventriculomegaly, such as hemorrhages, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and cortical malformations.

2. The added value of MRI over ultrasound for ventriculomegaly is debated due to varying detection rates of additional anomalies, lack of postnatal correlates, and interobserver variability. However, MRI is particularly useful in the second trimester for detecting small hemorrhages and callosal anomalies, and later in pregnancy for assessing cortical development, posterior fossa anomalies, and white matter pathology. Most studies advocate the use of MRI for moderate and severe ventriculomegaly, and even for mild cases to detect subtle findings like leucomalacy and neuronal migration disorders.

The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2012, 226,160 patients will be diagnosed with lung cancer and 160,340 will die from the disease. Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, with 56% having distant metastasis at diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate is only 3.5% for distant stage at diagnosis compared to 52.9% for localized stage.

2. Bone is one of the most frequent sites of metastasis in lung cancer patients, placing them at increased risk for skeletal-related events (SREs) such as fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain. SREs result in impaired mobility and reduced quality of life, adding substantially to the disease burden. Limited data exist on the occurrence and outcomes of bone metastasis and SREs among elderly lung cancer patients.

3. This study used SEER cancer registry data linked with Medicare claims to identify a cohort of patients aged 65+ diagnosed with lung cancer between 1999-2005. Claims data were used to determine the occurrence of bone metastasis, SREs, and deaths through 2006. Bone metastasis with or without SREs was the main time-dependent exposure variable.

The Human Microbiome Project and MetaHIT consortium aim to correlate changes in the microbiome with disease prevalence. Studies have shown that the gut microbiota is first acquired during birth and changes with age and diet.

2. The human gut microbiome is dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with smaller representations of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Archaea, notably Methanobrevibacter smithii, are also present but less diverse than bacteria. The composition of the microbiota is influenced more by environmental factors and maternal input than host genetics.

3. Recent studies have revealed a minimal gut metagenome of around 300,000 bacterial genes shared by over 50% of individuals. Each person carries about 500,000 bacterial genes, with a large portion being rare genes. Carbohydrate metabolism genes are enriched in the gut microbiome and show similarity within families.

4. The human gut microbiota has been classified into three enterotypes characterized by the dominant bacterial genera: Bacteroides (enterotype 1), Prevotella (enterotype 2), and Ruminococcus (enterotype 3). These enterotypes are independent of geography, sex, age, or BMI, but are associated with long-term diet. The enterotypes may reflect different functional properties of the microbiome.

Food consumption was monitored and body weights of some NDGA groups were reduced compared to controls. Necropsies showed NDGA was associated with increased liver, lung, and thymus tumors and hemorrhagic diathesis.

2. In Drosophila, optimal NDGA treatment of 3.0 mg/ml increased median lifespan by 23%, suggesting conserved targets between mice and flies. However, NDGA did not affect food consumption, body weight, or locomotor activity in flies, unlike in mice. The study found no acute liver or kidney toxicity from NDGA in mice based on serum chemistries, though other studies have reported toxicity at high doses.

3. Potential mechanisms for NDGA's longevity effects include inhibition of mTORC1, IGF-1 receptor signaling, and tumor growth, as well as hormetic effects. NDGA reduced liver tumor mass by 24% but appeared to increase tumor numbers. Its effects differ from reduced IGF-1R signaling, which extends lifespan in female but not male mice.

4. Other proposed mechanisms like antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory action, and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation are not well-supported by evidence for extending lifespan. The dose-responsive weight loss in NDGA-treated mice is inconsistent with inhibited oxidative phosphorylation. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and evaluate if less toxic NDGA derivatives can also extend lifespan.

1. Biomarkers are characteristics that can be objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to therapeutic interventions. They are essential for personalized medicine applications such as identifying optimal drugs and dosages for patient subgroups, withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options. Biomarkers can be classified as DNA biomarkers (e.g. SNPs, STRs, deletions, insertions), DNA tumor biomarkers, and general biomarkers (e.g. RNA, protein, metabolite measurements). Important differences exist between these biomarker types in terms of stability, reproducibility, suitability for monitoring, and complexity of measurement.

2. Biomarkers are used for diagnosis (determining presence and severity of disease), prognosis (predicting likely disease course), and prediction (forecasting likely treatment response) in personalized medicine. Diagnostic biomarkers, especially screening biomarkers, aim to discriminate between healthy individuals and those in early disease stages. Prognostic biomarkers predict disease course in a defined clinical population under standard treatment conditions. Predictive biomarkers predict a patient's likely response to a specific treatment in terms of efficacy and/or safety.

3. The development of diagnostic tests follows a phased approach similar to drug development, with phases establishing safety, mode of application, reproducibility, ability to detect disease, and impact on clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. For diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, an extended phase approach includes discovery, assay development and validation, retrospective validation, prospective investigation, and health economics studies. Retrospective validation using biobanks is possible for DNA biomarkers under certain conditions, but challenging for other biomarker types due to potential changes over time and effects of sample handling and storage.

4. Predictive biomarkers, also known as companion diagnostics, are linked to specific therapies and can help identify patients most likely to benefit, those at increased risk of adverse reactions, and monitor treatment response. The FDA has issued guidance on companion diagnostics, suggesting they should be validated as part of evaluating the corresponding therapeutic product's efficacy.

2. Each MyoVa molecule consists of two motor domains (heads) connected to lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a globular cargo-binding domain.
3. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains by attaching a quantum dot (Qdot) to the motor and measuring its motion.
4. Various MyoVa constructs of different lengths were expressed to isolate the contributions of individual structural domains to the overall flexibility and flexural stiffness of MyoVa.
5. The flexural stiffness of the lever arm was estimated to be 0.0346 pN/nm, which decreased by 40% in the presence of calcium due to calmodulin dissociation.
6. The distal rod segment was found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm, suggesting it is composed of coiled-coil segments interspersed with highly compliant disordered segments.

1. Oral candidiasis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients, affecting 40-60% of healthy individuals and over 90% of HIV-positive patients. It is caused by Candida albicans and other Candida species. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) manifests as erythematous patches or white, scrapable lesions and is often one of the first clinical signs of HIV infection. OPC is more prevalent in patients with CD4+ counts below 200/mm or a high viral load (>10,000 copies/ml).

2. This cross-sectional study evaluated the forms of OPC and their correlation with CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients over a 2-year period. Medical history, physical examination, socio-demographic characteristics, socio-behavioral factors, experience with oral lesions, and laboratory tests were reviewed. One dental surgeon carried out all oral examinations, and diagnosis of oral lesions was implemented using European Community Clearinghouse guidelines.

3. Oral swabs were collected from each participant and Candida was identified by conventional tests and species identification. Recent CD4+ levels were analyzed by the flow cytometer method, and a history of intake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was noted.

1. Breathing, which begins in the upper airway and ends with gas exchange in the alveoli, is essential for human survival. When breathing through the nose, air is warmed, moistened, and filtered, activating immunological processes that protect the lower airway. However, when breathing through the mouth, no filtering or immunological activity occurs.

2. Mouth breathing in childhood can lead to pathological adaptations of the stomatognathic system structures, affecting harmonious morphological and functional growth. The main causes of mouth breathing in children include hypertrophy of the pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsils, nasal mucosa and turbinate edema, nasal septal deviation, and extended suction habits. Morphological adaptations in mouth-breathing children aim to facilitate the arrival of air to the alveoli.

3. Mouth breathing can result in maxillary hypoplasia, posterior mandibular demotion/rotation, dental occlusion alterations, higher mandibular inclination, vertical facial growth pattern, head anteriorization, and muscular deharmonization in the nasofacial region. These adaptations lead to functional changes in the stomatognathic system, such as alterations in speech, chewing, and deglutition.

Upregulation of angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in AMD development and progression. Intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment has significantly improved outcomes compared to previous therapies.

2. Ranibizumab and aflibercept are two approved anti-VEGF agents for neovascular AMD treatment. Aflibercept has a higher binding affinity to VEGF and longer duration of action compared to ranibizumab. Switching treatment-resistant AMD patients to aflibercept may improve visual and anatomic outcomes.

3. Visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) are two key measures of visual function. VA measures the ability to identify fine detail at high contrast, while CS measures the ability to detect low contrast images. CS can detect subtle vision changes that may be missed by VA testing alone.

3. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a quasi-3D mammography technique that obtains multiple low-dose images of the breast from different angles to reconstruct thin tissue slices. DBT improves the visualization of overlapping tissues and can reduce false positives and recall rates while increasing cancer detection compared to DM alone.

4. Adding DBT to DM increases radiation dose, but synthetic 2D images reconstructed from DBT data can eliminate the need for a separate DM exposure. Longer interpretation times for radiologists with DBT may be offset by decreased recall rates and need for additional views.

2. The lymph node ratio (LNR), the ratio of metastatic to removed lymph nodes, provides more useful prognostic information than just the number of metastatic nodes. Most studies have analyzed LNR in all node-positive patients without subdividing into N1, N2, and N3 disease groups.

3. This study evaluated the prognostic significance of the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR in breast carcinoma patients with 1-3 metastatic axillary lymph nodes. Disease-free survival (DFS) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were significantly worse in patients with 1-5 nodes removed compared to those with 6 or more nodes removed.

4. The most significant LNR threshold values separating patients into low and high-risk groups were 0.20 for DFS, 0.30 for LRFS, and 0.15 for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). LNR had independent prognostic significance and was superior to the number of nodes removed for DFS and LRFS.

5. Patients with 1 positive node had significantly better DFS and DMFS than those with 2-3 positive nodes. LNR could separate N1 patients into low and high-risk groups for distant metastasis, providing more detailed prognostic information than TNM classification.

6. In patients with at least 10 nodes removed, the number of removed and metastatic nodes and LNR did not have prognostic significance for LRFS, suggesting that removing at least 10 nodes may be sufficient for locoregional control in N1 disease. LNR is useful for separating patients with 1-3 metastatic nodes into low and high-risk prognostic groups,",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 14}"

1. Non-native invasive species have caused significant damage to ecosystems for centuries. In the mid-1980s, the SCOPE project engaged many scientists worldwide and triggered an explosion of research on invasions, recognizing them as a major global environmental change.

2. Research has revealed that invasive species can impact ecosystems at various levels, from populations and communities to ecosystem processes and physical structures. Molecular genetic techniques have uncovered widespread hybridization and introgression between native and introduced species, which can lead to the evolution of native species and the emergence of new invasive species.

3. Research has also identified phenomena such as ""invasional meltdown,"" where introduced species facilitate each other's establishment or impact, and ""lag effects,"" where the full impact of an invader is delayed. The numerous studies conclude that problems caused by invasions are ecologically and economically significant and growing with globalization.

4. Critics of invasion biology argue that the problems are exaggerated, introduced species can increase biodiversity, opposition to them is xenophobic, control efforts are futile, and methods used are inhumane. However, many species extinctions and population reductions have been caused by invasive species, and the majority of introduced species have not been studied for their potential impacts.

5. Efforts to prevent invasions or mitigate their impacts are not hopeless, as evidenced by successful biosecurity measures, early detection and rapid response, and improved eradication technologies. Various control methods, such as physical, mechanical, chemical, and biological control, have been successful in maintaining low invader populations, with ongoing improvements in techniques.

6. Calls to abandon traditional restoration ecology in favor of ""novel ecosystems"" have accompanied criticisms of invasion biology. However, the concept of ""novel ecosystems"" is undefined, and modern restoration ecology aims to re-establish the historical trajectory of an ecosystem rather than recreate the past.

7. The perception that much of the Earth is rapidly changing to a novel condition is based on coarse-scale maps. Restoration ecology has made considerable progress in achieving goals across various ecosystem types, with impediments being economic and political rather than scientific and technological.

1. Electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for obtaining photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering needed for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, allowing the use of conductive plastic substrates. Minor addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to the semiconductor surface significantly impacts crystal growth and crystallographic orientation of the film.

2. Coprecipitation of dye molecules does not necessarily deteriorate the crystallinity of the semiconductor. In the case of ZnO/eosin Y (EY) hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed with EY aggregates filling the space between them. The solid EY can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline solution, resulting in porous crystal ZnO thin films with large surface area for dye adsorption and high crystallinity for efficient electron transport.

3. Finding a compatible system for fabricating sensitized photocathodes would be highly interesting for DSSC applications. CuSCN, a p-type wide-bandgap semiconductor frequently used as a hole conductor in nanostructured solar cells and sensitized photocathodes, could serve as a counterpart to ZnO-based hybrid systems.

1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and foregut during embryonic development. It is a remnant of this communication that normally disappears in the second month of fetal development. If the remnant becomes obstructed, it forms a cystic type Tornwaldt's cyst, while if crusts adhere to the orifice without obstruction, it forms the crust type.

2. The crust type involves periodic shedding of the crust from the nasopharynx, causing an offensive smell and unpleasant taste. The cystic type is more common and can cause symptoms of a space-occupying lesion or rhinitis. Being located at the posterior nasopharyngeal wall, it can also cause occipital pain.

1. Melanoma is a dangerous skin cancer with increasing incidence, and early diagnosis is key for good prognosis. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that allows visualization of skin lesion features not visible to the naked eye, improving diagnostic accuracy compared to unaided eye examination.

2. Dermoscopy requires significant expertise to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. Several simplified diagnostic algorithms like the ABCD-E rule, 7-point checklist, and Menzies method have been developed to aid less experienced clinicians, but they still have limitations like low inter-observer concordance.

3. There is growing interest in computer-aided diagnosis using machine learning and image processing techniques to analyze dermoscopy images and assist in melanoma detection. A standard approach involves lesion segmentation, feature extraction and selection, and classification using machine learning algorithms.

4. Lesion segmentation aims to identify the lesion border and is a crucial first step that is challenging due to factors like hair, gel bubbles, and uneven illumination in the images. Various preprocessing methods like hair removal, color space transformation, and contrast enhancement are used, followed by segmentation algorithms like thresholding, edge-based and region-based techniques.

5. Feature extraction involves quantifying properties like asymmetry, border, color, dermoscopic structures, and texture from the segmented lesion. A variety of shape, color, and texture descriptors are used, ranging from simple statistical measures to more complex computer vision and image processing techniques.

1. Gallstones affect approximately 20 million people in the US, with 1 million new cases diagnosed annually. Treatment of cholelithiasis is the most costly digestive disease, estimated at over $5 billion per year. In 1992, the National Institute of Health held a consensus conference on the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The panel concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered substantial advantages over open cholecystectomy without increased morbidity or mortality, and would result in equal or lower costs due to reduced pain and disability.

2. The disability and lost income following open cholecystectomy further increase costs, which have been greatly reduced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often exceed those of open cholecystectomy, likely due to equipment and technical requirements, despite the shorter hospital stays and reduced nursing support needed. Surgeons at Maricopa Medical Center identified excessive length of stay and charges for cholecystectomy compared to other regional hospitals. Reducing conversion rates or costs for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were the only options to decrease charges.

3. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients, with 35 matched pairs of converted laparoscopic and open cholecystectomies, was conducted to estimate the charges attributed to laparoscopy. The average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922, significantly higher than $13,042 for open cholecystectomies, with the difference of $6,880 attributed to laparoscopy. Decision tree analysis showed open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective regardless of conversion rate, but reducing laparoscopic charges could make it cost-effective depending on the conversion rate.

Absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was associated with higher chances of PR, especially in boys. Lower A1c levels at diagnosis also correlated with higher chances and longer duration of PR.

2. C-peptide levels were higher in patients with PR compared to those without, and this difference persisted for 3 years after diagnosis. Older children (>10 years) had higher C-peptide levels at diagnosis. Patients with two positive anti-islet antibodies had shorter PR duration compared to those with only one. Early A1c levels at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after diagnosis strongly correlated with PR duration.

Recent evidence shows exercise alone, without dietary changes, reduces visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL), which are independently associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk. However, it's unclear if unstructured habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar benefits for reducing VAT and IHL. Understanding these associations is important for public health messages, as participation rates in structured exercise are low.

2. Cross-sectional and prospective studies using self-reported physical activity levels suggest an inverse relationship between central adiposity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, self-reported behavior is subject to bias and tends to overestimate activity levels, especially in overweight/obese individuals. Emerging evidence using objective accelerometry data supports these observations, but research using accurate assessments of VAT and IHL is limited. Confirming these associations with high-quality objective assessments could have important clinical implications for managing obesity.

3. This study aimed to evaluate if objectively quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity levels could predict VAT and IHL levels in overweight/obese adults. The authors hypothesized a negative relationship between moderate intensity activity and VAT/IHL, a positive relationship between sedentary behavior and VAT/IHL, and that sedentary behavior and moderate activity would explain significant variance in VAT/IHL when modeled with known obesity-related health risk factors. 82 participants were assessed for anthropometry, fasting blood markers, MRI/MRS for VAT/IHL, and 4-day accelerometry.

1. Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Antimicrobial drugs disrupt normal intestinal flora, allowing C. difficile to release toxins A and B that induce C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is widely used to diagnose CDAD by detecting glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B, but it has low sensitivity compared to PCR and cytotoxigenic culture.

2. If a stool specimen is GDH-positive but toxin-negative by EIA, follow-up PCR testing is recommended. PCR detects toxin genes but not toxin proteins, so positive results may include C. difficile carriers without CDAD. There is no definite method to determine if diarrhea in patients with toxin-negative stool is caused by low toxin concentrations or other factors.

3. This study investigated clinical characteristics and diarrhea duration in patients with toxin-positive stool, toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates, and toxin-negative stool and isolates. EIA was performed on stool specimens and isolates from 127 patients. Significant differences were found in diarrhea duration among the groups.

4. Patients with toxin-negative stool had significantly shorter diarrhea duration than those with toxin-positive stool, despite lack of CDAD treatment. The discrepant group with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates had shorter diarrhea than the toxin-positive stool group, despite fewer patients receiving treatment. This suggests patients with toxin-negative stool had milder symptoms, even with toxin-positive isolates.

1. The DREAM trial was a large, randomized controlled trial that investigated whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
2. The primary outcome variable was change in β-cell function over the course of follow-up, assessed using the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
3. Rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI/IR and reduced PI/C compared to placebo, indicating improved β-cell function, while ramipril did not have significant effects on these measures.
4. Rosiglitazone's effect on diabetes prevention persisted after adjustment for baseline β-cell function, suggesting that some but not all of its effect is mediated through improvements in β-cell function.
5. The findings demonstrate that rosiglitazone's diabetes preventive effect may in part be a consequence of improved β-cell function, while ramipril's glucose-lowering effects may operate through other metabolic mechanisms.

1. Microbial communities differ from monocultures in the toxins they degrade, natural products they produce, and their capacity to grow in certain environments. Understanding microbial metabolism requires extending from individual strains in pure culture to combinatorial interactions in complex communities. Strains may exhibit naturally complementary metabolism or be genetically engineered to interact by sharing metabolites like hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen or glucose. A general model of metabolic interaction would account for the variety of exchanged metabolites and genotypic diversity of strains without requiring detailed biochemical characterization of each participant.

2. Optimization-based flux balance analysis techniques have been successful in describing metabolic systems by drawing on the well-characterized biochemical reaction network of organisms like E. coli. Using a model set of E. coli auxotrophs, the authors extend these approaches to a higher-order system of two strains. They find certain auxotroph pairs complement each other's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites, a relationship termed synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT). SMIT interactions reflect and elucidate the genetic and metabolic network they derive from, similar to other synthetic genetic interactions.

3. The authors selected 46 conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli strains from the Keio collection, each with a deletion blocking biosynthesis of an essential metabolite. The selected mutations cover metabolic diversity, including genes for biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, cofactors, and genes in glycolysis and respiration. Each strain grows robustly in rich medium but not measurably in minimal medium. Strains were labeled with fluorescent proteins, co-cultured in minimal media in all pairwise combinations, and inoculated at intermediate cell densities to enhance metabolic cooperation.

4. A subset of mixed pairs showed improved growth relative to monocultures, with 17% of dissimilar pairings exhibiting >50-fold synergistic growth. Growth phenotypes varied, with one strain, both, or neither benefiting. Each strain had at least one synergistic growth partner, but no strain was universally cooperative.

Mechanical testing showed that both devices had significantly greater burst strength and relative stiffness compared to native abdominal wall at all time points. The mechanical properties remained stable from 6 to 52 weeks despite significant material resorption over time as measured by gel permeation chromatography.

2. Histological analysis revealed a mild inflammatory response and mild to moderate granulation tissue/vascularization for both Phasix mesh and P4HB plug at all time points. Fibrosis/encapsulation scores for Phasix mesh improved from marked at 6 weeks to mild at 12 and 52 weeks, while macrophage scores for P4HB plug decreased from moderate at 6 weeks to minimal at 52 weeks. No significant differences in histological response were observed between the mesh and plug designs.

3. The study demonstrated that P4HB material, whether in a mesh or plug configuration, provides a durable scaffold for soft tissue repair in a porcine model over 52 weeks. The repairs with Phasix mesh and P4HB plug maintained significant mechanical strength compared to native abdominal wall despite material resorption, with no herniation or diastasis.

1. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in many developed nations, and ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent early development of risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been demonstrated in several studies, including their lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects. Low-grade chronic inflammation is recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

2. PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response. The human body can produce most fatty acids except for the essential fatty acids linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA), which are precursors to the n-6 and n-3 series of fatty acids, respectively. Endogenous conversion of these precursors results in the synthesis of longer-chain counterparts such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the n-3 family, and dihomo-γ-linoleic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA) in the n-6 family.

1. Rudolf Virchow, a 19th century Prussian physician-scientist, proposed that cancer arises from normal cells in response to chronic inflammation. Pelayo Correa, a pathologist from Colombia, devoted his career to understanding gastric cancer etiology and in 1975 published a model hypothesizing that intestinal-type gastric cancer develops through a stepwise progression from chronic atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia to cancer over 30-50 years. Robin Warren, an Australian pathologist, together with Barry Marshall, discovered Helicobacter pylori bacteria in the stomach, showed they caused gastritis and ulcers, and speculated they may play a role in gastric cancer.

2. Initial studies in the 1980s and early 1990s provided only weak evidence linking H. pylori to gastric cancer. However, three large cohort studies with nested case-controls found that subjects with prior H. pylori infection were significantly more likely to develop gastric cancer, leading the World Health Organization to classify H. pylori as a definite carcinogen in 1994. Subsequent research confirmed H. pylori is a strong risk factor for both intestinal and diffuse subtypes of noncardia gastric cancer.

3. Measuring H. pylori exposure by ELISA underestimates the risk, while testing for CagA increases the observed odds ratio. CagA-positive H. pylori strains have a greater association with gastric cancer than CagA-negative strains. Meta-analyses show H. pylori eradication decreases gastric cancer risk by approximately 40% for primary prevention and 54% for tertiary prevention.

4. Despite the strong association between H. pylori and gastric cancer, there has been hesitation to adopt population-based H. pylori screening and eradication in developed countries due to an inverse association observed between H. pylori and esophageal adenocarcinoma.

1. The draft sequence of the human genome promises significant biomedical advances. Biologists must learn to navigate the vast expanses of genomic DNA data to uncover the rich knowledge hidden within.

2. Different communities of biologists have varying definitions of gene ""function"". Universal vocabularies for genome annotation are needed to make the information accessible to all scientific communities.

3. Genes can be annotated based on experimental data on individual human genes or based on predicted evolutionary relationships and homology to genes in other species. Homologous genes often have similar structures and functions, providing clues to annotate uncharacterized genes.

4. Evolution has constantly mixed and matched domains to create new genes. Domains are the ""vocabulary"" of protein evolution and several domain lexicon databases exist to annotate proteins by their domain architecture.

5. Only 40-60% of the predicted human proteome could be annotated using domain-based methods. Describing a protein's function as the sum of its component domains provides approximate predictions for uncharacterized human genes.

6. Automatic domain-based annotation allows proteome annotation to keep pace with genome sequencing projects. Most human genes lack orthologs in key model organisms, so domain-based predictions will remain important until high-throughput mouse studies are available.

7. Integrating diverse genome annotations into user-friendly web resources is essential. As biological knowledge grows, using defined vocabularies like the Gene Ontology will be critical to make genome data compatible with computational analyses.

1. This study aimed to develop a prototype to measure the in vivo orthodontic bracket debonding force and evaluate the in vitro bond strength obtained with the prototype. A plier was modified by adding a strain gauge directly connected to the plier claw. An electronic circuit read the strain gauge, and software recorded the bracket debonding force values in kgf.

2. Orthodontic brackets were bonded to 30 bovine incisor teeth using adhesive material. In group 1 (n=15), debonding was performed with the prototype, while in group 2 (n=15), a tensile bond strength test was conducted using a universal testing machine. According to Student's t-test (α=0.05), groups 1 (2.96 MPa) and 2 (3.08 MPa) were not statistically different.

3. The prototype was shown to be reliable for obtaining in vivo bond strength values of orthodontic brackets. A stable interface between the bonding material, bracket, and enamel is important to withstand the loads generated by an activated arch. Using universal testing machines, direct bracket bonding to dental enamel and the forces required to debond brackets have been studied in vitro through shear or tensile strength tests.

4. Despite the precision obtained in measuring debonding forces, universal testing machines are expensive, large, and complex to handle, making them impossible to use for in vivo studies. Furthermore, the complex interaction processes in the oral cavity cannot be completely reproduced by in vitro studies. The oral cavity is a challenging environment for dental materials, especially regarding the adhesion process.

5. Contact of adhesive systems and composite resins with the oral medium is associated with an aging pattern, which may alter the composition and mechanical properties of the polymers. Material biodegradation may interfere with the bonding between the bracket and enamel, causing lower bond strength values in vivo compared to in vitro values. Because in vitro bond strength cannot be correlated with clinical failure indexes, different devices have been developed to measure the in vivo bracket debonding force.

1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple seizure types, slow spike-wave discharges on EEG, and cognitive impairment. Over 75% of children with LGS have an identifiable cause such as brain malformation, perinatal injury, infection, or metabolic disorder. The prognosis is poor, with difficult to control seizures and worsening cognitive function over time.

2. LGS is challenging to diagnose and treat. Classic clinical and EEG features may not be present initially, and the multiple seizure types can be hard to differentiate. Trials are complicated by the nearly uncountable atypical absence seizures, inaccurate parental reporting, range of etiologies, and evolution of seizure types over time.

3. Valproic acid is considered the most effective initial medication for the multiple seizure types in LGS. Controlled studies have shown felbamate, lamotrigine, and topiramate can reduce atonic and tonic-clonic seizures as add-on therapy. Clobazam may be an effective adjunctive treatment with less sedative effects than other benzodiazepines.

4. Treatment recommendations include using as few anticonvulsants as possible to minimize side effects, avoiding excessive drowsiness which can worsen seizures, and addressing cognitive and psychological comorbidities. First-line therapy is valproic acid, followed by lamotrigine, rufinamide, topiramate, clobazam, felbamate, or levetiracetam. Other options include zonisamide, the ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, or corpus callosotomy.

5. Rufinamide is a novel triazole derivative anticonvulsant that gained FDA approval in 2008 for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS in children 4 years and older.

1. Interpopulational variation in sexual chemical signals may provide the basis for premating reproductive isolation and speciation in many animals. The Iberian wall lizard, Podarcis hispanica, is a small diurnal lizard that forms part of a ""species complex"" with genetic and morphological differences between populations. This study explored the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of P. hispanica in central Spain.

2. The researchers compared morphological characteristics of the populations and analyzed variation in the composition and proportions of chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions of males using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. They also conducted tongue-flick experiments to test if males and females discriminated by chemosensory cues alone between scents of lizards from different populations. They hypothesized that interpopulational differences in chemical signals and recognition abilities could suggest the existence of reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation between these populations.

3. The results showed significant differences between populations in morphological measurements, with lizards from northern populations being larger and having more femoral pores than southern populations. The chemical analyses revealed that femoral gland secretions varied in composition and proportions of compounds between populations, allowing characterization of males from each population. Chemosensory recognition experiments demonstrated that lizards could detect scents from any population, but showed different tongue-flick rates depending on the population of origin.

4. Both males and females varied in their responses to scents from different populations. Males from northern populations made more tongue-flicks in response to scents from northern males and females than to southern ones, and vice versa for southern males. Some males showed higher interest in scents of females from their own population against other populations.

5. Females also discriminated male scents between northern and southern areas, but not between populations within each area. Only females from one population (Pedrezuela) showed a clear preference for scents of males from their own population. These results suggest that there could be premating reproductive isolation between some, but not all, populations of P. hispanica.

1. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) using gene-specific RNA probes enables visualization of gene expression patterns during development. While this technique is widely used in several biological systems, current methods using chromogenic or fluorescent detection have limitations in resolution, ability to detect multiple transcripts simultaneously, and diffusion of signal. Direct labeling of probes is needed to achieve single cell and intracellular resolution, but has not been possible in embryos due to low fluorescent intensities of organic fluorophores.

2. Quantum dots (QDs) are a new type of inorganic fluorophore with ideal optical properties for biological imaging, including strong fluorescent emission, resistance to photobleaching, and ability to enable multiplexing. Previous attempts to use QDs for WISH faced issues with aggregation and time-consuming protocols. The authors aimed to develop a QD-based WISH method to overcome the limitations of current techniques.

3. The authors found that the major limitation preventing QD penetration into Xenopus embryos was their large size. However, proteinase K treatment rendered the embryos permeable to QDs, allowing penetration and staining of deep tissues. The use of near-infrared QDs significantly improved detection sensitivity by reducing tissue autofluorescence.

4. QD-based WISH using anti-digoxigenin, streptavidin, and anti-FITC conjugated QDs successfully detected RNA probes labeled with DIG, biotin, or FITC, respectively. The QD staining patterns matched those obtained with chromogenic methods, but with higher resolution, enabling visualization of intracellular mRNA localization. Optical sectioning of QD-stained embryos provided more accurate determination of expression domains compared to chromogenic methods.

5. Simultaneous detection of two transcripts was achieved using spectrally distinguishable QDs, demonstrating the potential for multiplexing. The lack of enzymatic amplification in the QD-based method resulted in substantially better resolution compared to amplified protocols. High-magnification imaging revealed distinct intracellular localization patterns of different mRNAs, with a resolution unattainable by existing methods in Xenopus.

The majority of cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential. Survival varies based on demographic and clinical factors, with surgical resection having the most dramatic influence. Cox proportional regression models have been used to estimate the relative impact of risk factors on PDAC survival.

2. Previous nomograms and calculators have been developed to predict PDAC survival, but have limitations in utility and reliability. The present work used SEER data on 18,352 pathologically confirmed PDAC cases diagnosed during 2004-2009 to develop Cox proportional hazards regression models. These models were adjusted for various demographic, clinical, and treatment covariates. A web-based prognostic tool was developed to estimate survival and conditional survival probabilities and standard errors for PDAC patients.

3. PDAC cases were extracted from the SEER database and exclusion criteria were applied, leaving 18,352 cases described by 13 categorical variables. Univariate models with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the prognostic effects of these variables. Proportional hazard assumptions were assessed and estimates of survival probability, standard error, and conditional survival were calculated.

Humans acquire infection by accidental ingestion of E. granulosus eggs from infected dog feces. CE usually presents with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other organs, diagnosed by radiology and serology. Postsurgical relapses or treatment failure can occur in 2-25% of cases due to nonradical procedures or spillage of parasite material.

2. Postsurgical follow-up of CE patients is necessary to detect newly growing or relapsing cysts. Serology has been used for post-operative monitoring, but the long persistence of antibodies makes relapse diagnosis difficult. Various serologic techniques have been evaluated, but there is still a need for improved immunodiagnostic tools. One approach is to identify new antigens that allow classification of patients into cured and noncured categories.

2. To reduce parasitic signals, the drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency, so the amplitude of motion was proportional to the square of the actuation voltage. A bias voltage through the gauges was used to down-mix their resistance change, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier.

3. Typical measurement values were 1.5 V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz. All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at 10 mbar pressure and room temperature.

4. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same set-up, with the drive electrode disconnected. The Allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration, and frequency stability was extracted from the resonator response actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.

5. The phase of the measured signal was monitored and transformed into frequency fluctuations using the resonator's phase response. Harmonics at multiples of 50 Hz were filtered out during post-processing.

The study focused on adults aged 40 and older, as the NHANES only asked this age group about aspirin use.

2. Individuals who had never been told by a physician that they had a stroke or heart attack were considered candidates for primary prevention, and their eligibility for guideline-recommended aspirin use was based on their 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) according to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Those who reported a previous diagnosis of stroke or heart attack were candidates for secondary prevention.

3. The study examined the relationship between various factors (such as risk status, age, gender, race, education level, obesity status, insurance status, and having a regular source of care) and the likelihood of patients being told to take aspirin by their physicians. Separate analyses were conducted for the primary prevention sample, high-risk individuals, and low-risk individuals.

4. The results showed that among the primary prevention sample, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and over three-fourths were classified as low risk. Less than half of the high-risk primary prevention patients received a recommendation to take aspirin, while more than one-fourth of low-risk patients were also recommended to take aspirin.

1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate cellular signaling through reversible oxidation of protein cysteine residues. The cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms.

2. Mitochondrial ROS generation is required for various cellular signaling pathways and increasing evidence suggests mitochondria and ROS play key roles in cellular differentiation. Increased mitochondrial and oxidant content correlates with stem cell differentiation while low levels correlate with stem cell maintenance.

3. Using the mammalian epidermis as a model system, it was shown that mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production promote signaling through pathways required for differentiation of mammalian stem cell populations in vivo. Mice conditionally lacking TFAM in epidermis, which is required for mitochondrial function and ROS production, displayed impaired epidermal differentiation and hair growth.

4. ROS act as pro-differentiation signals and are key upstream regulators of stem cell fate decisions, with nucleoredoxin identified as a putative target of ROS-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in keratinocytes. Further studies are needed to determine how ROS regulate Notch transcriptional activity during keratinocyte differentiation.

5. Cellular metabolism represents an intriguing ""rheostat"" to modulate stem cell renewal and differentiation, and understanding the mechanisms by which differentiation programs regulate and are regulated by metabolism will be useful for regenerative therapies. Proper regulation likely depends on cell type-specific factors and environmental influences like hypoxia and calcium gradients.

1. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. Diagnosis of HCV infection is made through branched chain DNA signal amplification assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pathologists require simple and reliable histochemical techniques to detect HCV in routinely prepared biopsy tissue samples.

2. The study established an in situ hybridization (ISH) technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAII) to detect HCV-RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues. Humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice and needle biopsy liver specimens of chronic hepatitis C were used. The activity of inflammation and degree of fibrosis were evaluated according to the new Inuyama classification.

3. The LNA-modified oligonucleotide probe was designed to target the highly conserved HCV 5'-untranslated region. Sections were digested with proteinase K, heat-treated, and hybridized with the probe overnight. Signal amplification was achieved using CSAII, and reaction products were visualized with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.

4. ISH demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic signals in human hepatocytes of HCV-infected chimeric mice livers but not in uninfected mice. Positive signals remained after DNase treatment but were abolished after RNase treatment. In human liver biopsies, LNA-based ISH detected HCV-RNA in 9 of 11 chronic hepatitis C lesions, while nested RT-PCR detected HCV-RNA in 8 of 11 lesions.

5. HCV-RNA was undetectable in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related lesions, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, and HCC lesions. Nonspecific binding of CSAII reagent to Kupffer cells or lymphoid cells was occasionally observed in both HCV-infected and HCV-unrelated lesions.

1. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can affect wild animals and humans, with the thyroid system being a key target in vertebrates. The OECD and EPA established guidelines for investigating effects on frog metamorphosis, as amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to contaminants. Frog metamorphosis, regulated by thyroid hormones (THs), involves dramatic structural and functional changes that can be used to assess endocrine disruption.

2. THs, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are produced by the thyroid gland and transported in the blood by binding proteins like transthyretin (TTR). Various processes influence TH balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation. Inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake, suppression of thyroidal peroxidase activity, inhibition of 5-deiodinase, induction of hepatic enzymes, and competitive binding to transport proteins can disrupt TH metabolism.

3. Amphibian TTR has a higher affinity for T3 than T4, and chemicals interfering with T3 binding to TTR can affect free T3 concentration and plasma clearance rate. Amphibian metamorphosis is divided into premetamorphosis (until hind limb appearance), prometamorphosis (until forelimb appearance), and climax (tail and gill resorption, lung development). TH sensitivity varies by developmental stage, with higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release in late prometamorphic and climactic tadpoles.

4. In amphibians, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) are considered candidates for TSH-releasing factors. Prolactin (PRL) may have inhibitory effects on metamorphosis, but this is controversial. Concomitant elevation of THs and corticoids occurs as metamorphosis progresses, and testosterone and estradiol can inhibit T3-induced metamorphosis.

1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are involved in critical physiological functions such as blood pressure regulation, but their therapeutic potential is limited by their susceptibility to oxidation and metabolism. To address these limitations, the authors prepared EET surrogates with improved stability that were evaluated for vasorelaxation of bovine coronary artery rings and inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). The surrogates modified the free carboxylic acid of previous EET mimics while retaining key structural features of the pharmacophore.

2. Various carboxylate bioisosteres were explored, including poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) esters, amino acid conjugates, sulfonamides, phosphonates, sulfonates, and heterocycles such as tetrazoles, oxadiazoles, and thiazolidinediones. The most promising analogue was urea 19, which showed submicromolar EC50 for vasorelaxation (12-fold better than 14,15-EET) and low nanomolar IC50 for sEH inhibition, making it a leading candidate for further development. There was no evident correlation between the pKa of the EET analogues and the ED50 for vasorelaxation.

3. The syntheses of key analogues such as tetrazole 19 and thioxo-1,2,4-oxadiazol 25 were described, involving semi-hydrogenation of an alkyne, azidation, Staudinger reduction, urea formation, and heterocycle formation. The influence of the EET analogues on coronary vascular tone was measured by changes in isometric tension of precontracted bovine coronary artery rings, and sEH inhibition was assessed using a fluorescent assay with recombinant human sEH.

1. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model was developed to improve healthcare in the US by providing coordinated, quality care. It is an extension of the chronic care model and aims to increase access to services, practice efficiency, and patient and provider satisfaction. Over 1,500 sites and 7,700 clinicians across the US have successfully transitioned to PCMHs.

2. Transitioning to a PCMH involves challenges such as promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocation, and leveraging electronic medical records (EMRs). Physicians may resist the change due to lack of PCMH-specific training, misaligned financial incentives, and time-consuming procedures. Practices must emphasize the benefits of reallocating responsibilities across the medical team.

3. Implementing the PCMH model requires significant changes in office culture, including new roles and training for nurses and staff. Patients' response to the new structure is important, and they should be educated about PCMH's goals. Care coordinators play a crucial role in patient follow-ups, education, and population management.

4. Small practices with resource constraints may face difficulties in transforming to high-functioning PCMHs. Practices need to address space issues for care coordinators to communicate with patients privately. EMRs can facilitate care coordination, but creating a suitable EMR for PCMH principles can be challenging.

However, erectile dysfunction remains a major long-term morbidity despite advances in surgical techniques. Studies by Walsh and Donker using male fetuses proposed that erectile dysfunction occurred secondary to injury of cavernosal nerves.

2. Nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, with 16-76% recovery of erectile function when bilateral neurovascular bundles are preserved and 0-56% with unilateral preservation. The variability is attributed to the lack of definite and exact anatomy of periprostatic nerve fibers, especially the cavernosal nerves. Recent papers on periprostatic nerve anatomy still have controversies about detailed descriptions of the exact distribution.

1. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein that increases dramatically during inflammation and is associated with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In RA patients, SAA levels strongly correlated with disease activity and were significantly higher in patients with high disease activity. However, high SAA concentrations were also observed in patients with low or moderate disease activity, despite clinical improvement.

2. SAA levels were higher in RA patients treated with glucocorticoids and lower in those treated with biological DMARDs. The mean SAA level was inversely associated with QTc duration and markedly higher in patients with atherosclerotic plaques, emphasizing increased cardiovascular risk resulting from chronic inflammation. Significantly higher SAA levels were also found in patients with increased cystatin C, a marker of chronic kidney disease.

3. This study suggests that SAA could be considered a biomarker associated with both current inflammatory disease activity and chronic complications in RA, such as cardiovascular and renal involvement. Prospectively, repeated assessment of SAA may help identify RA patients with persistent inflammation and increased risk of extra-articular complications and amyloidosis development.

1. Perforin-deficient mice have reduced bone marrow cellularity, eosinophils, and neutrophils compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice, even when matched for body weight and age. Peripheral blood neutrophil and eosinophil counts are also lower in perforin-deficient mice, although total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts are similar. These differences suggest that perforin deficiency results in reduced granulocyte production in the bone marrow and decreased granulocyte counts in peripheral blood.

2. In vitro studies show that bone marrow from perforin-deficient mice fails to respond to dexamethasone stimulation, unlike wild-type bone marrow, which exhibits increased eosinophil production and colony formation in response to dexamethasone. However, the thymus of perforin-deficient mice responds normally to dexamethasone injection by undergoing involution, indicating that the lack of bone marrow response is not due to a general defect in glucocorticoid signaling. These findings suggest that perforin is specifically required for the bone marrow granulopoietic response to glucocorticoids.

3. The defective granulopoietic response to dexamethasone in perforin-deficient mice can be corrected by transferring splenic lymphocytes from wild-type mice. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ cells from the transferred lymphocytes abolishes the ability to reconstitute the eosinophil response, while only CD8+ cell depletion prevents reconstitution of the neutrophil response. This indicates that different lymphocyte subsets may be involved in regulating the lineage-specific responses to dexamethasone.

4. The reduced granulocyte numbers in perforin-deficient mice are unlikely to be due to the murine equivalent of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, as the mice appear healthy and the defect can be rapidly corrected by lymphocyte transfer.

1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy have enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome, including topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions, and are stable across species, cell types, and cellular conditions.

2. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, contributes to TAD boundary strength by regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization. Loss or knockdown of BRG1 results in reduced nucleosome occupancy at CTCF sites, either through loss of its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity or by negatively impacting CTCF binding.

3. Topoisomerases also play a role in regulating TAD boundaries, with Topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B) binding overlapping with CTCF/cohesin binding sites and facilitating supercoiling in a transcription-dependent manner. BRG1 interacts with TOP2B and is required for the recruitment of Topoisomerase I (TOP1) to chromatin, suggesting a functional cooperativity between CTCF, BRG1, and topoisomerases in TAD organization.

4. The association between BRG1 knockdown and reduction in TAD boundary strength may be due to perturbations in the recruitment of CTCF and topoisomerases, affecting the integrity and ""stiffness"" of the chromatin at TAD boundaries. Continued examination of the factors found at TAD boundaries will yield important insights into the biophysical properties of TADs and their role in overall genome organization and biological control.

This study applied statistical modeling, particularly zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial regressions, to model the number of failed courses and semesters among students at Iran University of Medical Sciences. The models used various educational and demographic factors as predictor variables that affect students' academic performance.

2. The results showed that in both regression models, university average and quota system had an inverse relationship with the number of failed semesters, while an increase in failed courses led to an increase in failed semesters. For the number of failed courses, university average, bachelor and master education levels, gender, and marital status were significant factors in the Poisson regression, while university average, bachelor level, and faculties of management and rehabilitation were significant in the negative binomial regression.

3. The study concludes that increasing university average and selecting more bachelor and master students can reduce failed courses, while increasing university average and choosing the free quota system can decrease failed semesters. The number of failed semesters was also highly correlated with the number of failed courses in both models.

1. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new imaging method that visualizes the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) using static and dynamic magnetic fields. MPI relies on the superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and magnetic saturation ability of SPIOs to provide high temporal and spatial resolution images with high signal-to-noise ratios. Potential applications of MPI include cardiovascular imaging and guidance of cardiovascular interventions. However, suitable MPI scanners and tracers with ideal characteristics, such as a long circulation time in blood, are needed.

2. The blood half-life of SPIOs is mainly determined by their hydrodynamic diameter, with particles larger than 50 nm being rapidly cleared by the reticuloendothelial system. Resovist, an approved MRI contrast agent, is currently the best performing commercial SPIO for MPI, but has limitations due to its hydrodynamic diameter and limited in vivo distribution. This study evaluated the blood half-life of Resovist in MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and compared two different versions of Resovist distributed by Bayer Pharma AG and Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. The results showed a rapid decline of the MPI signal in blood, with the signal dropping below noise level within 15-30 minutes after injection.

3. The study found a significant difference in blood half-life between Resovist from Bayer Pharma AG and Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, despite similar hydrodynamic diameters and size distributions. This difference should be considered when evaluating experimental results, as most MPI-specific research has been conducted using Resovist from Bayer Pharma AG. The rapid decay of the MPI signal in blood suggests that Resovist is suitable only as a bolus tracer for vascular applications in MPI. The development of dedicated MPI tracers with ideal characteristics, such as a homogenous iron core diameter of about 30 nm and a small hydrodynamic diameter for long circulation times, is crucial for the future development of MPI.

1. The authors studied the transcriptomic response of liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) to Leishmania donovani infection in mice, comparing gene expression profiles of infected cells, uninfected cells exposed to inflammation, and control cells. They found that infected cells showed a distinct transcriptional response compared to previous in vitro studies, and uninfected cells also underwent significant changes associated with the inflammatory environment. Comparative analysis suggested that many genes thought to be associated with the presence of intracellular pathogens may actually represent a common response to inflammation.

2. A gene network centered around retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa) was identified that was associated with parasite survival in the liver. Pharmacological manipulation of RXR function, either through activation with an agonist (LG268) or suppression with an antagonist (HX531), reduced liver parasite burden in vivo. The mechanism by which this network controls parasite survival is under further investigation.

3. The approach of studying both infected and inflammation-exposed cells from an infected tissue revealed host response pathways that would be missed in typical in vitro studies of macrophage-pathogen interactions. Targeting such in vivo pathways, like the RXR network, could lead to new host-directed therapies for leishmaniasis, although more research is needed on the mechanisms of parasite growth arrest or killing. Nuclear receptors like RXR are an active area of drug development for other diseases.

4. Methodologically, the study involved surgical intravital microscopy to track Kupffer cell dynamics upon L. donovani infection, followed by liver digestion, cell sorting to isolate Kupffer cells, and microarray analysis of gene expression. Hits were validated by quantitative PCR and in vivo treatment experiments with RXR-targeting drugs. The data provide new insights into the host-pathogen interactions of visceral leishmaniasis and illustrate an approach to identify physiologically relevant host pathways that control infection.

1. The control of appetite involves coordination of inputs from physiological and environmental sources. Early theories focused on signals from glucose, amino acids, or adipose tissue, while more recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and sensory features of food.

2. An alternative approach to appetite control arises from studying the relationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI). While no correlation exists between EE and EI in a single day, resting metabolic rate (RMR) could provide a tonic signal of energy demand that drives daily EI.

3. Exercise has numerous physiological effects beyond just increasing EE. Acute bouts of exercise do not consistently increase food intake, but as exercise is repeated over days, a partial compensatory response in EI begins to appear.

4. Using a multi-level experimental platform to study overweight and obese people, unexpected associations between body composition and appetite have been disclosed. Fat-free mass (FFM), but not fat mass (FM) or BMI, is strongly correlated with meal size and daily EI, suggesting that FFM provides a signal to drive food intake.

5. RMR is the largest component of total daily EE, with FFM being the major contributor. RMR is positively associated with meal size, daily EE, and fasting hunger levels, implying that RMR reflects a physiological demand for energy that drives food intake.

6. Appetite regulation comprises three components: a tonic drive for food arising from the physiological demand for energy, a tonic inhibition from signals of energy storage (mainly adipose tissue), and episodic signals from the mouth and GI tract in response to food consumption. The drive to eat is periodically suppressed by episodic satiety signals but also stimulated by food palatability.

7. The energy required to maintain the body's lean tissue mass creates a physiological demand that determines a minimal level of EI at meals and over the day. This is consistent with the amino-static hypothesis and the protein-stat mechanism, and draws attention to body composition as a determinant of appetite.

Bacteria isolated from shallow freshwater reservoirs and a stream located in the foreland of Ecology Glacier near the Polish Antarctic Station were studied for their potential to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). A total of 50 bacterial isolates were characterized by sequencing a 1000 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. The isolates belonged mainly to the phylum Proteobacteria, representing the classes Betaproteobacteria (11 isolates), Gammaproteobacteria (7 isolates), Alphaproteobacteria (2 isolates), and only two isolates belonged to the Bacteroidetes phylum. The most frequently recovered group was members of the Pseudomonas genus (7 isolates), followed by the Janthinobacterium genus (5 isolates).

2. PCR was performed with two primer pairs to detect microorganisms possessing the potential ability to synthesize PHAs. The first primer pair recognized both short-chain-length (SCL) and medium-chain-length (MCL) PHA synthase genes, while the second pair was specific only for MCL-PHA synthase genes. Amplification with the first primer pair gave a positive signal in 12 isolates corresponding to six Pseudomonas strains, four Janthinobacterium strains, and two undefined Betaproteobacteria. Amplification with the second primer pair showed that six Pseudomonas strains and two Janthinobacterium strains possessed genes responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis.

Neuromodulation therapies (NTs) are increasingly being explored for managing TRD. NTs are designed to target specific brain circuits implicated in the pathogenesis of MD and have a different side effect profile compared to medications. Multiple computer searches were conducted to identify relevant clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses addressing TRD and NTs for inclusion in this qualitative review.

2. NTs for neuropsychiatric disorders are categorized into seizure therapies (modified electroconvulsive therapy [MECT] and magnetic seizure therapy [MST]), noninvasive therapies (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS], transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS], and cranial electric stimulation [CES]), neurosurgical approaches (vagus nerve stimulation [VNS], epidural cortical stimulation [ECS], and deep brain stimulation [DBS]), and new approaches on the horizon (focused ultrasound [FUS], near-infrared light therapy [NIR], low-field magnetic stimulation [LFMS], and optogenetic stimulation [OS]).

They hypothesized that these saRNAs could upregulate KLF4 and c-MYC expression in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by degrading antisense RNAs that normally suppress the genes.

2. Two saRNAs, KLF4-PR1 and MYC-PR2, were able to consistently upregulate mRNA and protein levels of KLF4 and c-MYC, respectively, in MSCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The saRNAs did not activate the interferon response and appeared to act through specific activation of transcription.

4. Pathway analysis revealed that discordantly regulated genes between saRNA and viral methods were involved in pathways related to cytoskeletal remodeling, macropinocytosis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This suggests the discordant gene expression patterns arise due to cellular responses to oligo transfection versus viral transduction.

1. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger innate immune responses after sensing microbial components and are necessary for host defense against infection. Aberrant activation of PRRs can lead to inflammatory diseases like autoimmune disorders and septic shock. Protein degradation, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, is critically involved in regulating innate immune responses. Autophagy is a bulk degradation process that delivers cytoplasmic contents to lysosomes and is important for cellular homeostasis, survival, and metabolism.

2. Autophagy plays a critical role in host defense by promoting pathogen elimination and inducing adaptive immunity. It is involved in the formation of bacteria-containing autophagosomes that kill invading bacteria in cells. Some bacteria like Shigella flexneri can escape autophagic elimination. Autophagy also enables antigen presentation to T cells, which is essential for adaptive immunity.

3. Loss of autophagy components like ATG16L1 leads to enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 in response to LPS stimulation of macrophages. This is mediated by TRIF-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activate caspase-1, which processes IL-1β. Mice lacking ATG16L1 in hematopoietic cells are more susceptible to intestinal inflammation, suggesting autophagy limits inflammatory responses.

They enter the developing brain at embryonic day 9.5 and are maintained through cellular division or expansion of progenitors that colonized the brain during CNS development. In the postnatal brain, microglia have multiple functions including immune surveillance, phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic neurons, and synaptic refinement. Microglia also play a role in angiogenesis by synthesizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

2. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slowly propagating wave of rapid, near-complete depolarization of neurons and astrocytes followed by a period of electrical suppression. CSD entails rapid changes in extracellular ion concentrations and can be elicited by various stimuli. Microglia express voltage-sensitive ion channels and are thought to sense electrical activity pertaining to CSD, with CSD stimulating microglial secretion of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNFα.

3. The number of CSD episodes influences microglial activation, with a single CSD causing subtle morphological changes while multiple CSDs lead to marked microglial enlargement. Multiple CSDs induce neuronal release of HMGB1, which binds to TLR2/4 receptors on microglia and initiates intracellular signaling cascades resulting in microglial activation. Activated microglia upregulate lysosomal enzymes like cathepsin D and may engage in synaptic repair through synaptic pruning after multiple CSD episodes.

5. Potential therapeutic strategies include using small molecules to inhibit aggregation or stimulate clearance of misfolded proteins, immunotherapy to remove aggregation-prone proteins, and neural stem cell-based treatments.
6. Specifically targeting the cell surface binding and seeding properties of alpha-synuclein aggregates using molecular chaperone or antibody-derived peptides represents a promising approach for interfering with the prion-like spread of pathology in Parkinson's disease.

1. Stroke is a leading cause of death globally, with most deaths occurring in low and middle income countries. Genetic factors play a role in the development of ischemic stroke. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors (β2AR) are G-protein coupled receptors that bind epinephrine and norepinephrine.

2. Several mechanisms contribute to loss of β2AR activity, including uncoupling from adenylyl cyclase, internalization, and phosphorylation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) modulated by β2AR plays a role in atherogenesis by affecting various cellular processes. Two major non-synonymous SNPs of β2AR, Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, have been identified and alter receptor function.

3. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association between β2AR polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk. They searched for relevant case-control studies and applied inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two investigators independently evaluated the studies and extracted data.

4. Three studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, with a total of 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls for allelic association and 518 cases and 510 controls for genotypic association. The studies were published between 2007 and 2014. The meta-analysis did not show a significant association between the Arg16Gly polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk under recessive or dominant models of inheritance.

1. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), the removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, is a cancer prevention strategy used by many women who carry germline mutations in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes (BRCA1/2). However, the magnitude of the risk reductions in women with BRCA1/2 mutations who have undergone RRSO compared to those who have not is unclear. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted, pooling results from 10 published reports of RRSO and the risks of breast and/or ovarian or fallopian tube cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. RRSO was found to be strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

2. The summary risk reduction estimates should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies. Data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO. To identify all reports of RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, the researchers searched the PubMed database using the search terms ""oophorectomy"" and ""BRCA1"" or ""BRCA2"". They evaluated the full text of the citations to identify articles presenting primary data that provided estimates of risk reduction due to RRSO.

3. No publications were excluded based on quality, sample size, language of publication, or other objective criteria related to study design and analysis. However, some publications that reported RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were not included because they did not estimate risk reduction. The researchers also undertook personal communications with researchers or consortia that have large series of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and were known to have data on this topic. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was undertaken using the hazard ratios (HRs) and/or odds ratios to estimate the pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

1. Isolation of pure cell populations is essential for clinical and basic research. Miniaturized cell separation devices offer advantages over conventional techniques, such as small sample volumes, portability, low cost, and potential for integration with analytical techniques. Most of these technologies are microfluidic and derived from the semiconductor industry or advances in synthetic chemistry.

2. Size-based separation approaches force a fluid containing a heterogeneous cell population through channels or obstacles of varied size, with fluid flow being laminar. These devices are compact, simple, do not require cell-specific markers, and have long shelf-life, but maintaining cell viability is a concern. Examples include deterministic lateral displacement, microfluidic filters, and biomimetic separation based on blood vessel geometry.

3. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) systems create a hydrodynamically focused stream of cell suspension that is interrogated by a laser and photodetectors. Fluorescent labels are attached to cells and they are sorted based on light scattering and emission. Microfluidic FACS systems have advantages of low cost, small size, and ability to integrate with other analysis techniques.

4. Magnetic separation uses magnetic beads attached to desired cells via antibody-antigen interaction in the presence of a magnetic field. It is easily miniaturized and useful for small sample volumes, but only applicable to cells with specific surface antigens. Examples include separation with magnetized obstacles, magnetophoresis, and precise cell manipulation with microelectromagnetic matrices.

5. Adhesion-based separation uses antibodies immobilized on surfaces to bind undesired cells from a mixture, similar to affinity chromatography. Microfluidic systems provide high surface area to volume ratio while keeping residence times short. Examples include separation of T and B lymphocytes in microfluidic chambers and isolation in antibody-coated microwells combined with laser capture microdissection.

1. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed definitively through liver biopsy, but many patients undergo imaging exams before this. Several morphological signs on imaging are associated with cirrhosis, resulting from fibrosis and decreased portal blood flow. Knowing the diagnostic performance of these signs can be useful clinically.

2. The caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL) is a quantitative measure that is highly specific and accurate for diagnosing cirrhosis. The caudate lobe size correlates with hepatic functional reserve, being larger in compensated vs decompensated cirrhosis. However, calculating C/RL is time-consuming and not widely used clinically.

3. The expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF) and right posterior notch (RPN) are simple qualitative signs of cirrhosis with high specificity and positive predictive value on MRI. Despite low sensitivity, they can be used routinely in practice. This study compared the diagnostic performance of C/RL, EGF and RPN for cirrhosis.

4. 95 cirrhotic patients and 57 controls underwent MRI. Two radiologists independently assessed for presence of RPN and EGF. C/RL was calculated using the right portal vein bifurcation as the caudate lobe landmark.

5. There was excellent interobserver agreement for RPN and EGF. C/RL, RPN and EGF were significantly different between cirrhotic and control groups. C/RL and RPN had similar diagnostic performance, both being significantly better than EGF.

Participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination including visual field testing with standard automated perimetry (SAP) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Glaucoma patients had a median of 8 visits over 3.6 years, while healthy subjects had a median of 7 visits over 3.8 years.

2. Progression was determined based on slopes of change faster than the 5th percentile cutoff from healthy eyes and statistical significance at p<0.05. From 1910 slopes, progression was detected solely by OCT in 19.0%, solely by SAP in 9.5%, by both in 4.1%, and not detected in 67.2%. Subsequent analyses focused on the 546 slopes showing progression exclusively by OCT or SAP.

3. A generalized estimating equation logistic model evaluated factors explaining the relative odds of progressing by OCT vs. SAP. Each 1 dB higher mean deviation (MD) at baseline was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of detecting progression by OCT vs. SAP (OR=1.05, p=0.005).

1. The healthcare industry faces challenges in improving access, cost, and quality of care, while research institutions are experiencing increased competition for less funding. To address this, it is important to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of translating research into products and services that improve health. Examples from other industries show the power of technology and innovation to enable disruptive changes in performance while reducing costs.

2. Successful healthcare innovation requires navigating the journey from basic research to commercialization, with the ""valley of death"" between academia and commercialization being a key obstacle. This valley often occurs when there are non-economic investments in early-stage research without attention to later-stage commercial viability. Technologies emerging from academia without a clear commercialization pathway and value proposition are not considered by financially-motivated investors and languish in the lab.

3. Many academic investigators are not prepared or motivated to think beyond their lab work to address commercial issues and market risk. They often expect that publishing high-impact results will make the commercial value self-evident and leave commercialization issues until after demonstrating proof-of-concept. This leaves technology transfer offices with the challenging task of seeking licensees for technologies that have been shown to work but lack clear commercial value or technical support.

4. Universities and academic medical centers need to do more to prepare and support investigators interested in translating research into practice.

1. Chronic pain and depression are common health problems in primary care patients. Diagnosing pain and its coexistence with depression can be challenging but has significant consequences for treatment outcomes. Numerous studies have found pain to be associated with limitations in daily activities, physical activities, and poor self-rated health. Pain is also associated with an increased prevalence of depressive disorders.

2. Studies have shown that 22-40% of primary care contacts are due to pain, and persistent pain is often comorbid with depression. Healthcare providers are advised to pay attention to pain symptoms in patients with depression, but studies have found that primary care physicians tend to underestimate the intensity and burden of pain compared to other somatic symptoms. Patients with depression often seek care for somatic symptoms rather than psychological ones, so healthcare providers must be aware of this coexistence. Optimizing antidepressant therapy and pain self-management can lead to improvements in both depression and pain.

3. The coexistence of depression and pain is a major risk factor for opioid misuse. It is important for healthcare providers and patients to have a shared understanding of the connection between depression and pain. Dolotest is a validated pain and health-related quality of life assessment tool that integrates the measurement of pain intensity with the impact of pain, including mood.

1. This study investigated potential disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) status, and nitric oxide production in elderly hospitalized patients with and without delirium. Plasma levels of amino acids, amino acid ratios, and the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured. Patients with delirium had significantly lower mean levels of arginine and higher phenylalanine/tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) ratios, suggesting decreased BH4 availability. They also had lower tryptophan/large neutral amino acids (Trp/LNAAs) ratios, indicating reduced serotonin production.

2. No significant differences were found in Phe/LNAAs ratios, tyrosine/LNAAs ratios, and HVA levels between the delirium and non-delirium groups, suggesting intact dopaminergic neurotransmission in delirium. The reduced arginine and borderline significantly lower citrulline levels in delirium patients could indicate a pre-existing arginine deficiency leading to decreased citrulline production by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), or partial BH4 deficiency causing NOS to generate superoxide instead of citrulline and nitric oxide from arginine. The latter scenario would suggest increased oxidative stress in delirium. However, a previous study found no differences in arginine, citrulline, and BH4 status in post-cardiac surgery delirium patients.

The study has some limitations, including a small sample size, potential confounding by cognitive functioning, possible fluctuations in biochemical marker levels during delirium, and potential selection bias. However, strengths include intensive monitoring of delirium symptoms, DSM-IV diagnosis by a geriatrician, and investigation of multiple pathophysiological pathways.

1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Diabetes impacts approximately 25% of individuals with SMI, 2 to 3 times the rate of the general population. Factors such as lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications are likely associated with the higher prevalence of diabetes in this population.

2. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) promotes new avenues of health care delivery, including health home programs designed to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions. Given the chronic impairments faced by those with SMI, it is hypothesized that health homes within mental health clinics where these individuals receive the majority of their care would be the ideal setting to maximize exposure to health home services. This case study presents preliminary results on a new ""behavioral health home"" (BHH) focused on using population-based care to identify abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and clarify the severity of findings to permit enhanced, individualized interventions for individuals with SMI.

3. The BHH was embedded in the Division of Community Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, consisting of 2 large outpatient mental health clinics, adult and child assertive community treatment (ACT) teams, and an adult psychiatric rehabilitation program (PRP), serving 2000 individuals annually. Funding approved in 2013 allowed for the creation of the BHH. BHH referrals were made to patients considered to require the most assistance, determined by selecting persons with SMI enrolled in the more intensive ACT or PRP services.

4. Once enrolled, the BHH provided a minimum of 2 BHH services per month, coordinated by a nurse case manager, with a wide variety of services qualifying as BHH services. One service per month was allowed to be delivered in a group format, leading to the creation of a population-based health management program targeting highly prevalent somatic conditions for individuals with SMI. It was determined that monitoring a specific health condition for several consecutive months provided a better understanding of the population's care needs and impact of interventions.

1. Valerie Oppenheimer emphasized the role of men's socioeconomic position in declining marriage rates, arguing that men's poor and uncertain economic prospects were an important factor in the postponement of marriage. She critiqued prevailing theories that focused on women's economic independence or ideological change as causing a decline in marriage.

2. Oppenheimer's theory implies that marriage could increase if men's economic position improved, and that cohabitation provides a way for couples to reduce uncertainty about future prospects. Empirical research in the US and Europe has generally supported her theory, showing that men's unemployment, low income, and temporary jobs are associated with delayed marriage and increased cohabitation.

3. The author conducts a new test of Oppenheimer's theory in 13 European countries using panel data, examining effects of men's employment and income on union formation and on choice between marriage and cohabitation. The results show that men's unemployment, low income, and temporary jobs reduce chances of union formation and promote cohabitation over marriage.

4. Income effects explain about half of the employment effects on union formation, supporting both the male breadwinner and career uncertainty hypotheses. The transition from cohabitation to marriage is less affected by men's economic position.

5. Interaction effects show that men's employment and income are more important for union formation in traditional than egalitarian countries. The author concludes that men's economic position remains important for union formation, but may be a weaker factor in gender-egalitarian societies.

It is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, with Anopheles darlingi being the most common vector in Brazil.

2. In Brazil, P. vivax malaria is treated with chloroquine and primaquine, which are provided free of charge by the Ministry of Health. Primaquine is the only drug effective against all Plasmodium gametocytes and hypnozoites but can cause hemolysis, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

The results showed a significant reduction in fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain after treatment, but an increase in nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste, weakness, hypochondrial pain, and choluria.

4. Although severe hemolysis after primaquine use is uncommon in Brazil, it can still occur, and healthcare personnel must be aware of this possibility to manage side effects properly.

1. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) are common in elderly men and share a strong correlation. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathophysiological mechanism linking LUTS and ED, including overactivation of the autonomic nervous system, endothelial dysfunction, hormonal imbalance, and lifestyle changes.

2. Treatment of LUTS with alpha-blockers like tamsulosin can improve urinary flow and voiding symptoms, while antimuscarinics like solifenacin are used to treat overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. In a study of 60 men with LUTS/BPH and ED, patients were divided into two groups: one receiving tamsulosin alone and the other receiving a combination of tamsulosin and solifenacin for 3 months.

3. Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in LUTS, but there was no significant improvement in sexual function (IIEF-5 scores) after treatment. The study suggests that while treating LUTS with alpha-blockers and antimuscarinics can improve urinary symptoms, it may not directly lead to improved sexual function in men with LUTS/BPH and ED.

1. The mir-200 family, particularly mir-200c, plays a crucial role in maintaining the epithelial phenotype of cells by targeting and repressing ZEB1 and ZEB2, which are transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin and other genes involved in cell polarity. In some cancer cells, there is a double-negative feedback loop between mir-200c and ZEB1, where ZEB1 can also repress mir-200c expression. Restoration of mir-200c in cancer cells that have undergone EMT leads to decreased migration, invasion, and adhesion to extracellular matrix components. These effects are independent of E-cadherin status, as mir-200c can decrease migration and invasion even in cells where E-cadherin is not re-expressed.

2. mir-200c also targets TUBB3, a gene normally expressed in cells of neuronal origin, and its repression by mir-200c leads to increased chemosensitivity to microtubule-targeting agents such as paclitaxel. Experiments with exogenous TUBB3 lacking the mir-200c binding site prove that mir-200c-mediated repression of TUBB3 is responsible for the enhanced chemosensitivity. Interestingly, the double-negative feedback loop between mir-200c and ZEB1 is not present in all cancer cells, providing an opportunity to study the distinct roles of mir-200c and ZEB1 in regulating the epithelial phenotype and chemosensitivity.

1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence using midurethral sling (MUS) placement was first described by Delorme to prevent complications associated with the retropubic MUS placement. A similar inside-out approach was later described by de Leval to further reduce potential injury to the urethra and bladder. Multiple studies have confirmed the anatomical safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective. Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow study of the MUS configuration in relation to the urethra without distorting the relevant anatomy.

2. This cadaveric study compared the relationship between the tape and urethra in the inside-out and outside-in approaches using CT-scan image analysis after implanting tantalum wire marked mesh slings. The surgical techniques were performed according to manufacturer instructions on 10 cadavers, alternating the procedure type and tape between right and left sides. A custom device was used with an inside-out MUS on one side and an outside-in MUS on the other, allowing for intra-cadaveric comparison of 10 independent trajectories of each approach. Post-capture image analysis was performed to measure the relative angulations between the urethral axis and each MUS tape's mean upward pathway.

3. The 3D CT images revealed that the MUS tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior. The outside-in MUS tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the inside-out tapes. The mean full inner angle formed by the inside-out MUS measured 122° versus 144° for the outside-in MUS (p=0.02). There was a trend between patient BMI and the inside-out MUS angle, but not for BMI and the outside-in MUS angle.

4. This is the first controlled anatomical study to compare the spatial relationships between the inside-out and outside-in MUS tapes and the female urethra. The inside-out approach angulated around the urethra more acutely than the outside-in approach, which followed a more horizontal trajectory.

The new legislation will introduce outcome agreements to align with national goals and the civic mission of universities. Collaboration and co-operation across the tertiary sector will be encouraged.

3. HEFCW's powers of intervention are seen by some as inflexible and hard to use. The new commission will have a range of regulatory powers, from soft measures like advice and guidance to more punitive actions if needed. A balance is needed between regulation and preserving institutional autonomy. Recent governance issues at universities highlight the importance of effective intervention powers.

4. There are concerns that fee and access plans in their current form are not effective. Minister Williams prefers moving to longer-term, outcome-focused agreements as part of the new legislation. Despite limitations, access to higher education is improving, with increases in postgraduates, part-time undergraduates, students from disadvantaged areas, disabled students and ethnic minority learners.

5. The Act has created a proportional regulatory system based on the amount and nature of public funding received by institutions. Private providers are regulated on a course-by-course basis and the scale of alternative providers is very small in Wales compared to England. The new legislation will ensure the commission can regulate any future changes in the provider landscape.

3. The Act aimed to regulate institutions, safeguard public good, focus on fair access, and protect institutional autonomy, but views differ on its effectiveness in achieving all aims.
4. Private providers are currently limited in Wales and must meet quality, financial viability and public good criteria to be designated for student support on a case-by-case basis.
5. Fee and access plans have limitations in their current annual format, so the new Bill may move to longer-term, more outcome-focused agreements.
6. Poor university governance is a concern and diversity on governing bodies is lacking, so the new Bill may introduce a regulatory condition for good governance.
7. A single quality assurance body for the whole tertiary sector has raised concerns, but the government aims to ensure the new framework is coherent, effective, comprehensive and compatible with UK and European standards.
8. Transnational education presents opportunities but also reputational risks if not properly managed and quality assured, which HEFCW and QAA currently oversee.
9. Recent data shows increases in postgraduate, part-time, disadvantaged, disabled and ethnic minority students accessing higher education in Wales following student finance reforms.

<summary>
1. The project manager recapped the previous meeting, where they decided on a snowman-shaped remote control with rubber buttons, a jog-dial, and the company slogan. The industrial designer presented the prototype, which had some changes including an LCD screen and a scroll wheel for accessing menus. They removed the ability to open up the remote for advanced functions to reduce costs.

2. The team discussed the dimensions and layout of the remote control prototype. They decided on a size of about 10 cm in height, 3.5 cm in width, and 2.5 cm in depth. The slogan would be printed on the side or bottom of the remote.

3. To get the cost within budget, the team made some cuts to the design, including changing to a single-curved case, removing the LCD display and advanced chip, and using normal colored buttons instead of special ones. This brought the cost down to the target of 12.50 Euros. The team felt there was limited room for creativity due to the tight budget constraints.

4. In evaluating the project, the team felt the room setup and technology were not very conducive to collaboration and teamwork. Having to wear microphones and work in isolation between meetings hindered creativity and the exchange of ideas. They suggested a more relaxed atmosphere, the ability to communicate outside formal meetings, and more use of the whiteboard would have helped.

5. The team found the digital pens clunky to use. They thought having individual computers was distracting and unnecessary since the files were shared. More time limits on meetings were good to prevent them from running too long, but an extra 15 minutes would have been helpful during the conceptual design phase.

6. In the end, the team met the budget target and completed the project evaluation. The industrial designer presented the final ""Ninja Homer"" prototype made out of Play-Doh. The team agreed that the Play-Doh was surprisingly helpful for the creative process, allowing them to explore the tangible, 3D aspects of the design.

<summary>
1. The project manager reviewed the new project requirements, which included the remote being only for TV, teletext being outdated, and incorporating the corporate image. The industrial designer presented research on the components and system design of a remote control, including a power supply, user interface buttons, internal chip, and infrared sender. The user interface designer showed examples of simple and complex remote designs, and the team agreed the remote should have a limited number of clearly labeled buttons.

2. The marketing expert presented survey results showing people find most remotes ugly, rarely use advanced settings, and get frustrated when the remote is lost or difficult to learn. Younger people were more receptive to speech recognition, but the team decided against it due to cost and complexity. They agreed to include a ""whistle-back"" or clap-activated feature to help locate a lost remote, which would be a unique selling point.

3. To keep the design simple and get it to market quickly, the team decided to put the essential buttons on the front (numbers, volume, mute, power, channel) and hide the advanced settings (brightness, contrast, tuner) under a sliding panel. They agreed to research whether additional audio settings were needed for younger buyers. The project manager said he would send out meeting minutes and they would reconvene in 40 minutes to review progress on their assigned tasks.

<summary>
1. The project manager opened the meeting by discussing the new project requirements for designing a TV remote control. Three key points were that the remote should be for TV only to avoid complexity, teletext is considered outdated, and the remote needs to incorporate the company's logo and color scheme. The project manager emphasized the importance of speed to market.

2. The industrial designer presented first, covering the basic components of a remote control based on his research. These include a power source (likely batteries), a user interface (the buttons), a chip inside to process commands, an infrared sender to transmit signals, and a receiver in the TV. He illustrated the system design on the whiteboard.

3. The user interface designer presented next, showing examples of simple and complex remote control designs. She recommended having a small number of clearly labeled buttons, around 14 total, and avoiding unnecessary functions. The team discussed challenges around choosing the right number of buttons for current and future TV channels.

4. The marketing expert presented results from consumer research on remote control preferences. Key findings were that most people find remotes ugly, would pay more for a nicer one, mainly use the core functions of channel, volume, and power, and get frustrated by difficulty of use and losing the remote. Younger consumers were more open to speech recognition.

5. In discussing the marketing results, the team felt speech recognition would be too complex and expensive to include. They liked the idea of a ""locator"" feature to find a misplaced remote by sound, possibly a clap-activated feature in the remote itself. They decided to keep the design simple and not include video/DVD functions.

6. For the remote's functions, the team decided on 16 buttons on the main interface: 10 number buttons, channel up/down, volume up/down, mute, and power/standby. Less-used functions like brightness, contrast, and tuning would be put on a hidden panel that slides out. They discussed the importance of clear labeling and simple instructions.

7. With limited time remaining, the team wrapped up by confirming the 16 main buttons and identifying the additional buttons to put on the hidden panel. They agreed to research a few final points, like audio mode buttons, before the next meeting. The project manager said he would send out meeting minutes",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28}"
814,"Here is a summary of the key points from Marketing's presentation in 6 numbered points, with 4 sentences each:

<summary>
1. Marketing tested 100 subjects in their lab, observing them and having them fill out a questionnaire. They found that users are generally unhappy with current remote controls, with 75% thinking they are ugly. 80% are willing to spend more for a fancier remote control. The key takeaways are that the new remote needs to be snazzy yet simple.

2. Current remote controls do not match well with user operating behavior, as people only use about 10% of the buttons. People also frequently lose their remotes, similar to other small devices like cell phones. 34% say it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote, so the new design should not vary too much from the standard while still being identifiable.

3. The most important and frequently used buttons are the channel, volume, and power buttons. More specific usage statistics for each button can be found on the company website. Marketing believes they need a modern, eye-catching design that is still simple and user-friendly.

4. The functionality and types of buttons included need to be carefully considered based on what devices most people will be using the remote with. The remote also needs to appeal to a wide range of consumers and age groups. A hip but not corny marketing scheme is needed to promote the product.

5. Speech recognition is an up-and-coming feature that consumers are very interested in according to their research. Since people are willing to pay more for a high-class remote, speech recognition is something they could consider including. Different types of speech recognition could be tried out within the remote program.

6. In summary, Marketing recommends focusing on a user-friendly design with a small number of buttons that still enables the remote to control the key devices and functions people need. Making the remote look high-tech and modern while keeping it simple is important. Including speech recognition is also something to strongly consider given the consumer interest if it fits within the budget and technical constraints.

1. The project manager, Danny Wolfs, welcomed the team and explained the meeting was being recorded. He had the team do an icebreaker exercise where each person drew their favorite animal on the smart board and explained why they chose it. Danny drew a red cat named Simba, Tim drew a turtle because he liked Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Jurgen drew a dog since his family used to have one, and Janus drew an abstract green rabbit.

2. Danny explained the project aim was to create a new, original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control. The target selling price was 25 euros with a maximum production cost of 12.50 euros, and the goal was to make a 50 million euro profit which would require selling 2 million units. The project would have three stages: functional design, conceptual design, and detailed technical design.

3. The team began discussing ideas and requirements for the remote. Jurgen felt it should be kept as basic as possible and just change channels. Tim from Marketing thought it should be multi-purpose to distinguish it in the market and have additional features like an LCD screen, using radio waves or Bluetooth instead of infrared, and being brand-independent.

4. Danny said while innovative features were good, they needed to keep the user-friendliness and price point in mind. He suggested each team member think about the most important aspects from their point of view for the next meeting. Jurgen said he needed to know if it would control multiple devices or not in order to determine the technical functions.

5. They agreed to each come up with some general ideas and requirements from their own perspective, and at the next meeting decide on the overall direction and features to pursue. The industrial designer and user interface designer would work on the design and technical aspects, while avoiding too many specifics at this early stage.

6. Danny wrapped up the meeting, informing the team they would receive further instructions from their coaches. The next meeting was scheduled to start in 30 minutes. The team thanked each other and left the room, with Danny reminding them to be careful with the equipment.

1. Janet Finch-Saunders asked what the Welsh Government is doing to address differences in early childhood education and care provision across Wales. Julie Morgan responded that there are historical reasons for the variation, with local authorities determining how much early education to provide beyond the minimum 10 hours of foundation phase.

2. The quality of early education is very good according to Estyn reports. Flying Start is geographically targeted based on income benefit data to reach areas with the highest proportion of children aged 0-3 living in low-income households.

3. The Welsh Government wants to see facilities developed in each local authority that meet the needs of local families and children. When asked if a more universal approach should be taken rather than the current demand-driven approach targeted at working parents, Julie Morgan said it would be great to offer childcare to everybody but the finances need to be considered.

1. In a discussion about early childhood education and care in Wales, Julie Morgan, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, said the Welsh Government wants to support both children's development and parents' ability to work, as these are both important. She acknowledged the current system is complex and needs simplifying, and they are looking at ways to do this through pilot projects in local authorities. An announcement on the direction they plan to take should be made soon, hopefully before Christmas.

2. The Welsh Government is developing a more integrated approach to early years services, with the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings. Estyn and CIW will continue inspecting and regulating the sector to ensure quality standards are maintained as this rolls out. When asked about addressing inconsistencies in Welsh language skills in the early years workforce, Morgan said they have established a program with the National Centre for Learning Welsh to develop workplace Welsh language skills and are working to make sure training programs are available in Welsh and bilingually.

3. On the childcare offer, an evaluation after the first year showed limited impact since it was not yet available Wales-wide, and the second year evaluation will likely still show limited impact. 94% of respondents were already using formal childcare before the offer, which was not surprising since it rolled out in limited areas first and childcare providers informed parents. The Welsh Government plans a publicity push this autumn now that the offer is available across Wales.

4. Regarding the decision to end work with HMRC on the childcare offer and continue it through local authorities instead, Morgan said this will allow more flexibility to potentially expand the offer to parents in education, training, or on the cusp of work. While HMRC said they could handle the Welsh language aspect, there were some issues with Welsh language standards requirements that factored into the decision. The Welsh Government is starting work on a new digital system for the childcare offer and estimates it will cost less than the proposed HMRC option.

3. 29% of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, which is seen as positive. The government is working to develop Welsh language skills in the early years workforce.

4. An evaluation of the childcare offer's impact is limited so far as it only became fully available across Wales in April 2019. The government plans to extend the offer to parents in education and training and those ""on the cusp"" of returning to work, with a review due to report in early 2020.

5. The government has ended work with HMRC on administering the childcare offer and will instead have local authorities handle it, saying this will allow more flexibility to expand the offer. This reverses the previous position and the committee expressed frustration at the change.

6. Flying Start currently reaches about 36,000 children, an estimated 45% of children in poverty in the targeted areas. The government wants to extend elements of the Flying Start approach more widely.

7. Only 18% of Flying Start parents attend parenting courses, but officials say parenting support is also provided through enhanced health visitor services and advice from childcare workers. Formal courses can be off-putting for some parents compared to more informal guidance.

8. The Parent, Childcare and Employment program supporting parents into work has been extended to June 2022 with additional EU funding. Its future beyond that is uncertain due to Brexit.

9. The committee raised concerns that assurances previously given about the ability to deliver the childcare offer bilingually were now in doubt. Officials said meeting the detailed Welsh language standards had proved more challenging for HMRC's systems than anticipated.

1. The Industrial Designer presented the working design, which includes an energy source of 2 batteries, an electronic chip controlled by the user interface, and an infra-red sender to transmit signals to the TV. The team discussed whether to use alternative energy sources like solar power or Bluetooth instead of infra-red. They decided to keep the design simple with batteries and infra-red to avoid overcomplicating things.

2. The User Interface Designer researched existing remote controls, looking at both engineer-centered and user-centered designs for inspiration on retaining basic functionality while improving the interface. Must-have features included volume and channel controls, a numerical keypad, and a mute button. The team also discussed potentially adding a novel ""lock"" feature and focusing on an ergonomic design as a market niche.

3. The Marketing Expert conducted research with 100 users and found that most find current remote controls ugly, would pay more for a cool-looking remote, and only use 10% of the buttons. Many users ""zap"" through channels quickly, and the remotes often get lost. The team discussed the importance of making the remote easy to use, especially for older users, while still looking stylish.

4. Voice activation was popular with younger users (under 35) but not with older users who tend to have more buying power, so the team decided against including that feature due to cost. They also discussed the potential for repetitive strain injury from button pressing and the need to consult with the legal department on that issue. Ergonomic design improvements could help address this concern.

5. In summary, the team decided on a basic, safe, cool-looking, and cheap TV remote design, using infra-red and batteries for simplicity. They agreed to incorporate the company's color scheme and logo to maintain brand recognition.

1. The group discussed the working design of the remote control, including the energy source (likely 2 batteries), an infra-red signal sender controlled by an electronic chip, and the user interface. They considered using Bluetooth instead of infra-red to allow controlling the TV from another room, but decided it would overcomplicate the design and increase cost. The goal is to keep the remote simple, as it will primarily be used in the same room as the TV. They agreed to stick with the basic, proven design that has worked for the past 50 years.

2. The user interface designer presented his research on existing remotes, which fall into two categories: engineer-centered (with many buttons and functions) and user-centered (simpler and easier to use at a glance). He recommended focusing on ease of use and incorporating essential functions like volume control, channel up/down buttons, a number keypad for direct channel access, and a mute button. They also discussed possibly including a channel lock function, taking inspiration from mobile phone keypads. The corporate office wants the remote to align with their brand image and ""put the fashion in electronics.""

3. The marketing expert presented findings from a usability study with 100 participants. Key insights were: 75% find current remotes ugly, 80% would pay more for a cool-looking remote, existing remotes don't match user behavior well, most people only use 10% of the buttons, and 75% of users frequently ""zap"" between channels. The study also found remotes often get lost and take too long to learn, especially for older users. Younger users were very interested in voice activation, but the team decided against it due to high cost per unit.

4. The team discussed designing the remote to minimize the risk of repetitive strain injury (RSI) from prolonged use. They considered using flat or low-profile buttons to reduce strain. The project manager suggested consulting with the company's legal department to ensure they aren't liable for potential RSI issues in the future. Ergonomic design was identified as an area where they could make significant improvements over current remotes on the market.

Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, and Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, were present along with their officials Huw Morris and Marie Knox. The committee began by asking about preparedness for Brexit in the higher education (HE) and further education (FE) sectors.

2. The Welsh Government has been working closely with HE and FE institutions since September 2016 to understand the potential impact of Brexit. Each institution has been looking at their own exposure and challenges, which vary considerably. In a ""no deal"" scenario, much of the current EU funding is secured until December 2020 according to a letter from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

3. Huw Morris clarified that the Welsh Government has been doing its own research on the impact of Brexit on HE, FE and apprenticeship providers, separate from research by Cardiff University on the broader Welsh economy. Risk assessments have been done and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) has been doing specific work, but it's unclear how widely this can be shared. The Welsh Government is testing the preparedness of each institution and pushing issues they can help with, like Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 arrangements.

4. In the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit, the underwrite guarantee means it would be business as usual for European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund programmes in HE until the end of 2020. However, it would mean limited access to Horizon 2020 with Wales likely losing about 50% of that work. The Welsh Government has guaranteed EU student support for the next academic year but cannot commit further without UK government assurances.

5. The Welsh Government is working with Universities Wales to boost international marketing of the HE sector using European Transition Fund resources under the Global Wales programme. For FE, engagement has been happening with all colleges who are more anchored in their local communities. The main concerns are around European Social Fund money for apprenticeships and the potential economic impact on companies offering apprenticeships.

1. The Industrial Designer did not initially agree with Marketing and User Interface because he was concerned about the technical feasibility and cost of some of their proposed features, such as an LCD screen and speech recognition. He emphasized that the internal technical components are already quite complex, so they need to be careful about adding too many features that would be difficult to implement. The Industrial Designer said he needs more information on the costs and what materials they can afford to determine what features are possible to include. He also suggested that if they make the remote control smaller in size, it will need to be a bit thicker to fit all the electronic components inside.

2. Marketing presented the results of a survey of 100 men and women on their preferences for a remote control. The findings showed that 75% find most remote controls ugly, and they are willing to spend more money for a better designed one. The most frequently used and important buttons are power, channel selection, and volume, while less important buttons are for teletext, audio settings and display settings.

3. New feature preferences from the survey included a ""beep"" to help locate a lost remote, speech recognition, and an LCD screen to see what is playing on each channel. Marketing's personal preference was a button that would automatically go to the user's favorite channel based on their viewing habits. The Industrial Designer pointed out that speech recognition and an LCD screen would add a lot of technical complexity and cost, so they need to carefully consider the trade-offs of those features.

4. The User Interface designer focused on technical functions related to the user experience with the remote. Key issues he highlighted were making the remote easy to find when misplaced, using clear and durable button labels, and having larger buttons that are easy to press without accidentally hitting the wrong one. He suggested they need to limit the number of buttons and focus on the core functions that are most important to users.

5. In terms of the target market, the Project Manager said the company wants to target users under age 40 with this new remote control product. Marketing's survey showed that younger people aged 16-45 are interested in more advanced features and are willing to pay more for them, such as an LCD screen and speech recognition. However, the Industrial Designer again raised concerns about the added cost of those features and whether they could include them while still meeting the ",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28}"

1. The project manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting and asked each team member to present their work. The marketing expert had some technical difficulties with his computer but was able to share some key findings, including that 75% of users find most remote controls ugly and are willing to spend money for a better system. The most important buttons for users are power, channel selection, and volume, while less important functions are teletext, audio settings, and display settings. Users also expressed interest in features like a ""find remote"" beep, speech recognition, and an LCD screen.

2. The user interface designer focused on the user experience aspects of the remote. Key issues include locating the remote, faded button symbols, and accidentally pressing the wrong buttons due to small size. Possible solutions are a ""find remote"" sound, fade-proof symbols, and larger buttons for the most important functions. The industrial designer discussed the technical challenges, including deciding which buttons are needed, whether it will be a universal remote, the size of the remote to fit all components, and the complexity of making it programmable.

3. The project manager shared updated project requirements from the project board. The remote should appeal to users under 40 years old, the corporate color scheme of black and yellow should be used, and teletext is no longer a priority function. To appeal to a wide audience, the project manager suggested using changeable covers, similar to mobile phone covers. The marketing expert shared additional user research showing interest in an LCD screen and speech recognition.

4. The team discussed various features and design elements. They debated the pros and cons of an LCD screen, agreeing it would be a desirable feature if cost allows. Speech recognition was deemed too complex and expensive for now. A rechargeable battery option was considered. For button layout, the power button should be prominent at the top, with channel and volume buttons in the center. Less used buttons can be smaller or accessed through a menu.

5. As the meeting wrapped up, the team reviewed key action items. The industrial designer needs to research component costs and technical feasibility of the proposed features. The user interface designer will mock up some design options and button layouts. The marketing expert will conduct further user research on price sensitivity and feature preferences.

1. The team discussed the prototype remote control, which has a simple design based on a mango shape with the company logo, an infrared LED, and an on/off button. The buttons are arranged in a circular layout and are all accessible using the thumb without moving your hand.

2. The remote uses a ""plus"" button system to access channels greater than 9, though the exact operation of this needs to be finalized. The case is made of a spongy rubber material for comfort and preventing repetitive strain injury, and will come in interchangeable colors and fruit themes.

3. In evaluating the prototype, the team felt it mostly met the original goals and requirements, scoring an average of 1.9 on a scale of 1-7 where 1 is best. Key positives were its simplicity, ease of use, ergonomic design, and ability to locate it if lost by an alarm.

4. The main area for improvement was better incorporating the company colors and logo, as the current color scheme was limited by available materials. When tallying the component costs, the kinetic power source and curved case were the biggest expenses, but the total cost of €12.20 came in just under budget.

5. For the project evaluation, the team felt there was good leadership and teamwork that enabled them to complete the project on time and on budget. More time and materials, especially different colored modeling clay, would have allowed for more design creativity and iterations.

1. The attainment gap between children on free school meals and their peers widened in 2017 despite the Pupil Development Grant (PDG). Cabinet Secretary Kirsty Williams acknowledged the results were extremely disappointing and concerning. She said there was no single reason, but factors like the move from BTECs to science GCSEs and changes to English/Welsh literature may have contributed.

2. Some schools whose free school meal pupils performed better in 2017 than 2016 were able to support those children to do well. However, the overall trend was concerning and officials are working to understand why free school meal children were less resilient in the exam system last year. The Cabinet Secretary has asked for a deep dive into the issue at her next policy board meeting in May.

3. Over the longer period the PDG has been in place, the attainment gap has narrowed, with the proportion of free school meal pupils achieving key benchmarks increasing from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3 by 2016. However, the Cabinet Secretary acknowledged there is still a long way to go. She said the PDG alone is not sufficient and a cross-government approach is needed to really make a difference for disadvantaged pupils.

4. The Cabinet Secretary was asked if budget pressures were leading schools to use the PDG to plug gaps in core funding. She said the grant's use is evolving over time as schools gain a better understanding of how to deploy it most effectively. However, she maintained there are checks in place to ensure it is spent on eligible interventions to benefit free school meal pupils.

5. On the PDG for looked after and adopted children, the Cabinet Secretary acknowledged the latest attainment figures are disappointing. An independent review has been commissioned to evaluate the impact of the looked-after PDG since it was regionalised in 2015. The aim is to identify if the funding is being used strategically and effectively.

6. Discussions are ongoing about creating a dataset to track adopted pupils'progress, but this is sensitive as parents cannot be forced to disclose their child's adoptive status.

When asked about this approach, the Cabinet Secretary said that if they can get it right for the most vulnerable learners, they'll be getting it right for all learners, and gave an example of how training teachers on attachment disorder, which disproportionately affects looked-after children, can benefit vulnerable learners more widely.

2. The Cabinet Secretary was asked about tracking adopted children, and said they are actively looking at creating a dataset where adoptive parents can voluntarily disclose this information so the children can be tracked, but they can't force parents to divulge this if they don't want to. She said there could be more done to make adoptive parents aware that disclosing their child's adopted status confidentially could result in more funding for the school through the PDG.

3. Regarding the disappointing attainment data for looked-after children, the Cabinet Secretary said there's no getting away from the fact that the results are not good enough and it's a huge concern.

1. The PDA microphones have a large amount of energy at 5 Hz, which is mostly from the air conditioner noise rather than reverberation. This can be filtered out digitally before processing the data. It's unclear if people are using the high-pass filter option in Feacalc when processing the data.

2. Stephane's team tried integrating clean low-pass downsampling/upsampling, a new filter replacing the LDA filters, and considering delay for online normalization. The results did not show real improvement over the submitted system and hurt performance slightly on the well-matched case. There are questions about whether small changes in parameters could lead to large differences in error rates that make comparisons difficult.

3. Spectral subtraction experiments have given poor preliminary results. Variance normalization after spectral subtraction completely distorts the signal. The French VAD seems to perform significantly better than the OGI one on the reference features, which could account for a fair amount of the performance difference between sites.

Suggestions were made to number the bullets, provide a better introduction for the wizard, and switch the order of tasks between subjects. The group agreed to hire Fey as the wizard and have her organize the subjects.

2. Johno presented a pedagogical belief-net to conceptualize nodes related to trajector, source, path, goal, context, discourse, prosody, parse, and world knowledge. The belief-net is not functional but serves as a visual aid for thinking about the problem. The group discussed the challenge of avoiding a huge combinatorial explosion when specifying the relationships between nodes. Professor B suggested focusing on the most relevant factors for the bottom-line decision and keeping each node sufficiently narrow.

3. The group discussed how to use the belief-net to make decisions in the dialogue system. Grad D showed an example of integrating simple deterministic rules into the existing SmartKom system based on object types, such as entering public places, approaching statues, and taking pictures of landmarks. However, this approach would not make use of discourse, context, or other factors. Professor B emphasized the need to determine what information is crucial for making decisions.

4. Grad A and Professor B discussed the immediate problem of deciding which aspects of the X-schema to add to the content and how to put that into the system once the decision is made. They acknowledged that getting the necessary information is the hardest part, which may involve querying the ontology, the real world, the GRS, and the dialogue history. Grad D suggested a process of several steps to gather information and feed it into the belief-net as a vector.

5. Professor B expressed the desire to achieve powerful generalizations using deep cognitive linguistics, so that the system can reuse knowledge across different tasks. He envisioned having an intermediate representation that looks the same over various inputs and outputs, allowing the system to pull out fundamental semantic information independent of the specific task or way of expressing it. This would involve using a more sophisticated parser that can extract deep semantic information from constructions.

1. The basic components needed for the TV remote include a power source, user interface, programmable digital signal processor, infra-red LED, and on-off switch. Additional components may be needed for a universal remote to support multiple TV makes, which would require extra memory. A basic layout was presented showing how the components would be connected and work together. The most costly components are expected to be the chip, user interface, and casing.

2. There was debate about whether to include teletext functionality, as management suggested it may become outdated. However, the team generally felt teletext should still be included if it doesn't significantly increase cost, as many users are accustomed to having it. The remote will only control the TV and not other devices like DVD players, so the team needs to determine how to best market it as a TV-only remote.

3. From a marketing perspective, the lack of teletext and focus on TV-only functionality presents challenges in identifying the unique selling points and market niche for the product at the target price point. Ideas were discussed to make the product more attractive, such as an innovative design, environmentally-friendly features, or a charging cradle to eliminate the need for replacing batteries. The team debated whether to position it as a low-cost or high-end, exclusive product.

4. There were concerns about the marketability of a TV-only remote at the proposed price point, as it lacks the multi-device functionality of similarly priced competitors. The team felt they needed to either lower the cost significantly to make it a compelling low-cost option, or add high-end design and features to position it as an exclusive product. Simply targeting the middle price range was seen as a difficult market niche.

5. The industrial designer advocated focusing on making the remote look very good cosmetically, since the casing costs would be similar regardless. He proposed a simple, sleek, small design with basic functionality, as many users stick to core functions anyway. The user interface designer suggested adding a charging cradle to eliminate the need for replacing batteries, provide a way to locate the remote, and allow for an innovative design.

1. The Industrial Designer started by making an overview for himself of what he needed to do in each of the three design steps, where he had a specific task to perform in each step. He had to let the tasks work in to get ideas about how to fill the requirements. For the first phase, the functional design, he focused on the working design and how the remote control apparatus would work.

2. The Industrial Designer noted that according to the coffee machine example, the remote would have batteries to supply energy and use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the TV. He agreed when others mentioned it would use infrared light to wirelessly communicate the signal to the TV or stereo. He kept the functionality description global at first, before considering specific functions like changing channels or using teletext.

3. The Industrial Designer wondered what they would do in the next session and if they were only focusing on phase one, the functional design, before moving to the conceptual design. He said it was important for him to know what kind of components to put in the design, such as if it would be a multimedia control center or control a video recorder. He emphasized needing good communication about the requirements so he would know what components to include in the design.

4. In response to a suggestion to just focus on TV and video functionality first before adding other features, the Industrial Designer agreed but noted that several additional buttons would be needed for a video player or for teletext. He said he would put his ideas in the project folder so they could discuss them at the next meeting. He understood they should start with a basic design that could be extended later.

5. Overall, the Industrial Designer took an organized approach to the individual task, making an overview of his responsibilities for each design phase. He focused on the functional working design first but raised important questions about what specific components and functionality to include.

1. The professor discusses the recent Amsterdam meeting for the Aurora project, where it became clear that the French Telecom Alcatel and the professor's team were competitors rather than friends. Both teams had voice activity detectors, which surprised the other participants who felt it was unfair since they were unaware of this.

2. The professor's team agreed to redo the evaluation without voice activity detectors or allow modifying the recognizer to account for long silences. However, the French Telecom team objected, worried that others would copy their code and techniques.

3. The new plan is to do the evaluation on well-endpointed data based on clean speech, and require 50% improvement for well-matched conditions and 25% for mismatched conditions. Nokia and Qualcomm object to lowering the 50% criterion and want to try one more round before changing it.

4. The professor's team at OGI is now working on improving noise robustness, such as using the LPC spectrum instead of the Fourier spectrum, or adding moderate noise to all data to make any additive noise less effective. They are also working on a new recognition approach called TRAP that uses temporal energy trajectories in critical bands.

5. The TRAP approach represents a very different way of extracting features, and they are studying the properties of these vectors, such as correlations between elements, and how to best combine the phoneme decisions from each frequency band. Using two adjacent critical bands seems to yield advantages.

6. Experiments suggest that humans can process signals independently in critical bands for masking, but use information from neighboring bands when making phonetic decisions. The TRAP work aims to eventually apply these ideas in a real recognizer, but may not be ready in time for the next Aurora evaluation due to latency constraints.

They noted that Brexit has created uncertainty for the sector, with signs of reduced applications from EU and international students to Welsh institutions compared to increases in England. The sector is exposed to PS129 million in EU-sourced income for 2017-18, about 8% of total income. Universities are scenario planning for Brexit but face challenges replacing programs like Erasmus+ if access is lost.

2. The implementation of the Diamond review recommendations is crucial for providing funding to maintain quality and competitiveness of Welsh universities, but there is uncertainty over the timeline and amount of this ""Diamond dividend"". Universities are currently running managed deficits in anticipation of the funding, but cannot sustain this indefinitely without more certainty. Brexit also poses risks to the richness of the student experience if EU student numbers decline, and to quality if financial pressures increase, but baseline quality requirements will still be met.

3. To increase research capacity and funding, Welsh universities need to invest in more researchers, especially in STEM, and cover more of the overhead costs that UK and charitable research grants do not fully fund. Continued access to EU research collaborations and funds is important, as is having a voice in UK research council decisions.

Applications from EU students to Welsh universities have decreased by 8% compared to a 2% increase for English institutions. Non-EU international student applications have also decreased by 9% to Welsh institutions, contrasting with a 7% increase in England.

2. The main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector include the funding position, with universities trying to minimize cost reductions until funding from the Diamond report recommendations is implemented. Other pressures relate to student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and uncertainty about potential consequences from the review of fees and funding in England. The sector made an operating deficit of £17 million in 2016-17 and expects a similar or slightly higher deficit for the current financial year.

3. Universities are planning for various Brexit scenarios, but there is uncertainty about which scenario will ultimately play out. They are focusing on promoting Wales and looking for additional sources of funding. Working with UK universities, they are making arguments to the UK government to maintain access to the successor to the Horizon 2020 research funding program.

4. HEFCW monitors the financial sustainability of universities but does not direct them, as they are autonomous institutions. HEFCW can advise based on data and judgment, but the uncertainty surrounding Brexit makes it difficult to speculate on the best course of action. Universities are being challenged to explain their planning assumptions if they appear to be ignoring potential risks.

5. Brexit's impact on student mobility programs like Erasmus+ is a concern. While the sector is committed to promoting student mobility, losing access to the well-established Erasmus infrastructure would be a significant challenge to overcome. Universities are beginning to allocate some of their own funds to support mobility in their latest fee and access plans.

6. The quality of the student experience could be negatively impacted if there are fewer EU students to provide diversity. However, the baseline quality standards for degrees should not be affected by Brexit. Financial pressures on universities resulting from Brexit could potentially impact the learning and teaching experience if not managed carefully.

1. The group discussed how to handle pragmatic implications of constructions like ""where is X?"", debating whether to encode them directly in the construction or handle them via construal. They agreed it's important to be clear on how each approach would be implemented technically before deciding.

2. For the short-term, the group plans to make explicit in the formalism where constructions end and construal begins. This will help determine what needs to be handled by each component.

3. Robert will be working on formalizing how discourse context dynamically influences the interpretation of constructions, such as how mentioning ""admission fee"" increases the probability that the user wants to enter a location. He will explore using an ontology to make relevant inferences based on the dialogue history.

4. The group discussed scheduling and decided to meet on Monday at 2pm to accommodate people's constraints. They will aim to have an intermediate version of the construction formalism ready to discuss and merge with Robert's ideas on construal.

5. Nancy and Keith will meet Monday morning to consolidate their work on the construction formalism so far. They will email each other in the meantime to continue making progress.

6. The term ""simspec"" (simulation specification) may need to be renamed to something more general like ""semspec"" (semantic specification). This would only require a small change.

7. The formalism needs to handle things like emphasis and question marking that are currently missing. Keith will look at more of the data to help inform this.

8. Keith explained the idea of treating WH-questions similarly to indefinite pronouns from a simulation perspective, which is motivated by languages that use the same forms for both. This seems like a promising approach to explore.

They rated whether the remote was designed for people under 40, its appearance, button layout, ease of use, colors, and other features.

2. The remote scored well on being designed for people under 40, having a beautiful and fancy appearance, and having fresh fruity colors. However, it did not have big clear teletext buttons, as those were put in a menu to keep the design simple. The group felt it would be moderately easy to find due to its shape and colors.

3. In terms of ease of use, the group rated it a 2, feeling it was easy to use but could be easier if functionality was reduced. They rated it very innovative and felt the exchangeable covers were a good feature. It did not have speech recognition but did have built-in games.

4. When calculating production costs, the group had to make some adjustments to stay within the €12.50 per unit budget. They removed the kinetic power feature and changed the case from double-curved to single-curved. This brought the cost down to €12.50 exactly.

5. In evaluating the project process, the industrial designer and user interface designer felt they had the most room for creativity, while the project manager and marketing expert had more constrained roles. The project manager admitted the first meeting was poorly structured but felt the leadership and teamwork improved over the subsequent meetings.

It included a power button, 9 channel buttons, volume and program buttons on the sides, menu and teletext buttons in the middle, and a mute button. They discussed button placement and labeling, as well as possibly adding a zero button. There was debate over whether separate buttons are needed for entering double-digit channels.

2. The team evaluated the prototype design according to several criteria. They rated it a 3 out of 5 for not being ugly, a 1 for making zapping easy, a 1 for having prominently visible relevant buttons, a 2 for not having too many redundant buttons, and a 2 for likely being bought by people under 40. The remote scored a 3 for having a recognizable corporate image/logo, a 2 for having a basic design for novice users, a 6 for having innovative technology, and a 2 for being easy to use. The overall average score was 2.6 out of 5.

3. The project manager opened a spreadsheet to determine the cost of producing the remote control. They went through each component, deciding what to include. There was confusion over the meaning of some items like ""sample sensor/sample speaker."" 

4. A major issue was the cost of the push buttons, which seemed very high at 50 cents per button. This would make it impossible to include all the necessary buttons while staying under budget. They considered reducing the number of buttons but felt that would make the remote too basic to be usable.

5. Another problem was that the spreadsheet did not include the cost of the proposed docking station. The team estimated it would be impossible to make the docking station for the 30 cents remaining in the budget. They debated selling the docking station separately to solve this issue.

6. The team looked at the designer's original component information to determine what kind of chip was needed. A simple chip was required for the push buttons, while a regular chip would be needed for a scroll wheel and an advanced chip for a display. Since their design used only push buttons and lights, a simple chip would suffice.

1. The project manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting, including the marketing research report, working design, and new requirements for the TV remote control. The marketing expert presented research showing that fruit and vegetable themes are trendy, and suggested making interchangeable spongy fruit-shaped sleeves for the remote. The industrial designer outlined the possibilities for the energy source, case materials, interface, and electronics, noting that a cheap model would need a flat plastic case with simple push buttons while a fancier model could have an LCD screen and scroll buttons. The user interface designer showed different remote control designs and suggested a simple interface with a few buttons that would control menus appearing on the TV screen.

2. The team discussed the various options and reached a consensus to use kinetic energy if feasible, have a plastic inner case with a spongy rubber outer case, and a simple push-button interface with up/down/left/right buttons and an enter button in the middle. They agreed this would keep costs down while still being user-friendly and marketable. The project manager noted the next meeting would start in 30 minutes and assigned individual actions to each team member, including look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation, and creating a prototype model out of clay. The meeting was then concluded.

1. The project manager opened the meeting by stating the goal is to design a new television remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The project manager asked who would be responsible for the functional design. There was some initial confusion about roles, but it was clarified that the industrial designer would handle the industrial design and the user interface designer would work on the user interface.

2. The marketing representative's role is trend watching, even though they initially thought their role was limited in the design process. The industrial designer suggested they should discuss ideas for the remote control development and how to make it work. The project manager emphasized the remote should have the key characteristics they discussed and not be too costly.

3. The user interface designer suggested the most important aspect is what functions are most critical in a remote control and proposed ideas like speech recognition to choose channels by voice. They also suggested having a way to choose programs by content type (movies, documentaries, etc.) rather than just channel surfing. The industrial designer noted that while good ideas, implementing them could be technically tricky.

4. The marketing representative raised concerns about the size of the remote if adding speech recognition, suggesting perhaps the TV itself should handle that. The project manager countered that this could be an issue if the user is far from the TV. The user interface designer clarified their main idea was to have a way to select by content type in addition to channel.

5. The industrial designer suggested this content selection could be done via navigation buttons and an on-screen user interface on the TV. The user interface designer agreed this was a good idea and would be revolutionary compared to remotes today that have many confusing buttons. The industrial designer noted they would need to investigate how to gather the needed program data.

6. The marketing representative suggested another idea of having the remote control the room lighting based on the TV picture brightness. The user interface designer asked if this should be a separate conceptual remote design or just another feature. The project manager suggested the user interface designer first summarize what was discussed so far before working on conceptual designs.

1. The project manager reviewed the decisions from the last meeting, including no LCD screen or speech recognition, a banana look and feel, and the use of wheels, buttons, and a base station for charging and locating the remote. The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the final prototype design, which has an attractive banana leaf base station and an ergonomic banana-shaped remote with scroll wheels, a turbo button, and a teletext button. The remote sits in the weighted base station and has colored plastic casing so it's not mistaken for a real banana. The remote is powered by rechargeable batteries and the base station recharges it.

2. The marketing expert constructed a list of criteria to evaluate the prototype, with each criteria rated on a 1-7 scale. The criteria included: fancy, handy, functional, cool, easy to use, and whether the user would buy it for 25 euros or change their existing remote for it. The group rated the prototype highly on most criteria, with some disagreement on whether they would personally buy or use the banana-shaped remote. Overall, the ratings suggested there is a market for the product, especially among trendsetters and young people, even if the meeting participants wouldn't all personally use it.

3. The project manager prepared a spreadsheet to estimate the production cost and ensure it remains under the 12.5 euro target. The group reviewed each component and made some adjustments, such as removing the unnecessary solar cells and sample speaker, and changing from a rubber case to a cheaper plastic case. With these changes, the estimated production cost came in at 11.10 euros, leaving some room for the costs of the base station components. The group agreed they had achieved an optimal cost for the features included.

4. In evaluating the project process, the group felt they had a creative process but could have used more input from the target market of young trendsetters. They suggested doing focus groups and street interviews with young people to get feedback on the banana design. They also discussed potential future versions that could control other devices beyond just the TV, such as DVD players, mood lighting and the whole room environment.

They emphasized that the Bill aims to accelerate the existing culture change in Wales regarding physical punishment of children, not to criminalize parents.

2. The representatives stated that while the reasonable punishment defense is rarely used currently, the Bill would remove ambiguity and represent a positive shift in how children are cared for. They noted that most parents no longer view physical punishment as acceptable and its use has steadily declined. The Bill aligns legislation with this societal change and the commitment to children's rights and well-being.

The current legislation has been criticized by the UN for still allowing the defence of reasonable punishment. ADEW advocates for the rights of the child to be a fundamental priority in this process.

2. Sally Jenkins from the Association of Directors of Social Services welcomed the Bill for the clarity it would bring for children, parents and professionals. She noted it is rarely used legislation currently, so it won't cause great change, but will represent a shift in how children are cared for in Wales. Jenkins said this continues the progression of change in nurturing children and provides needed clarity from the perspective of children's services.

3. In response to whether there is clear evidence that physical punishment is harmful to children, Jenkins said children themselves find it demeaning, harmful and emotionally damaging. She noted that in the continuum of violence against children that social services deals with, allowing physical punishment makes it more acceptable and can perpetuate more extreme abuse. Changing the law helps shift the culture to recognizing children must be cared for in a physically safe way.

4. Regarding encouraging the public to report instances of children being smacked if the law changes, Jenkins said they already encourage reporting to social services or police. She acknowledged the challenge is that minor incidents are often witnessed in public but not reported, though a child being assaulted in any circumstance shouldn't be ignored. David added that vulnerable children being seriously abused at home don't know where the line is of what's acceptable, so this law would provide that clarity.

5. On the practical ways social services interactions with parents would change, Jenkins said each referral will be assessed proportionately to determine what action is needed. She noted countless referrals are made currently that result in no action after an initial paper assessment. During the implementation phase, decisions will be made on which referrals are automatically sent to social services for assessment.

Professor A mentioned an NSF ITR proposal that made it through the pre-proposal phase and will require more work on the full proposal due in about a month. Grad B discussed naming conventions for sound files and transcripts, suggesting using fixed-length identifiers for meetings, speakers, microphones, and channels to make sorting and extraction easier.

2. PhD C provided an update on his work with harmonicity detection algorithms. He tried two methods - one based on FFT to study harmonics from the spectrum directly and look at energy multiples of frequency, and another using instantaneous frequency based on FFT to calculate the phase derivative in time. While the instantaneous frequency approach showed interesting behavior of the spectrum concentrating around harmonics, applying the rules from the reference paper did not work well and he was unsure why.

3. The discussion turned to how to handle breaths in the audio and transcripts. Postdoc F noted that precisely annotating breaths is very time-consuming for transcribers. She asked if breaths could be detected and annotated automatically to save time, or if it would be sufficient to just mark word vs. non-word segments without detailed breath boundaries.  

4. Professor A suggested that even if breaths are not annotated in detail, the approximate regions where they occur should be indicated, as the acoustic models can learn to recognize them. He noted the tradeoff between marking everything in detail vs. relying more on statistical methods, favoring more detailed annotation in general, but acknowledged this may be a case where the transcription effort is high for diminishing returns. He wanted to get input from other researchers Liz and Andreas who have dealt with breaths in their transcripts.

5. PhD G proposed that within segments being transcribed because they contain words, any breaths should be transcribed as well. However, for long segments where a speaker is not talking, such as on their individual mic channel, breaths do not need to be transcribed. This would mean for the chunks transcribed, everything including breaths is captured, but outside those chunks some non-speech may not be transcribed.

<summary>
1. The group discussed the prototype remote control design, which included an on-off button, mute button, volume and channel selectors, help button, number buttons, and buttons for teletext and subtitles. There were questions about the functionality of the teletext buttons. The project manager thought there were too many buttons and the design should be kept simple with a few large buttons. The industrial designer argued that most remote controls have even more buttons and that the current design was already quite basic.

2. To reduce costs, the group discussed ways to eliminate some buttons, such as replacing the mute button with a double press of the volume down button, and possibly removing the help button. They also considered combining the teletext and subtitle buttons. However, they realized that removing too many buttons could negatively impact the usability for their target demographic of elderly users. They decided to keep the single curved design to make the LCD screen more prominent.

3. The finance and budget were a major constraint, as the remote control needed to be produced for under 12.5 euros per unit. The group went through the bill of materials, identifying the major cost drivers as the LCD screen, advanced chip, and number of buttons. They brainstormed ways to reduce costs, such as using a scroll wheel instead of number buttons, but acknowledged this could significantly impact usability for elderly users. They ultimately decided to remove the mute and help buttons but keep the other core functions.

4. In evaluating the final design, the group rated it highly on style and innovation but lower on ease of use and suitability for the target demographic. They acknowledged that the scroll wheel design, while cost-effective, may be confusing for elderly users expecting traditional number buttons. The lack of buttons could require more extensive marketing and user education. However, the design met the core functional requirements and budget constraints.

5. For the project evaluation, the group identified some areas for improvement, such as needing the financial information earlier in the design process and facing limitations on creativity due to cost constraints.

1. The team discussed the prototype remote control design, which included an on-off button, mute button, volume and channel selectors, help button, number buttons, and buttons for teletext and subtitles. Marketing questioned the functionality of the teletext buttons and the project manager thought there were too many buttons overall.

2. To reduce costs, the team considered removing the mute button, integrating the help function into holding down other buttons, and combining the teletext and subtitle buttons. However, they realized it would be difficult to get the price down to the target of 12.50 Euros per unit.

3. The team explored further cost-cutting measures like using a flat case design, removing the LCD screen, and replacing the number buttons with a scroll wheel. Marketing expressed concern that these changes would greatly reduce the usability for their target demographic of older users.

4. After more discussion, the team settled on a revised design with a prominent scroll wheel, five main buttons, a teletext button, and single-curved case to highlight the LCD screen. They acknowledged it was a big departure from the original concept but necessary to meet the budget.

5. Marketing presented evaluation criteria for the remote control, including how fancy and innovative it is, ease of use, functionality, cost, suitability for the target group, and brand recognizability. The team rated the design on a scale of 1-7 for each criteria.

6. The design received an overall score of 41 out of 49, or about 84%. The team was generally satisfied with this, though they rated it lower on ease of use and suitability for the older target demographic.

7. In evaluating the project process, the team felt they should have received the financial information earlier in the design phase to avoid late changes. They also wanted more room for creativity and to potentially target a younger demographic as well.

8. The team found the digital tools somewhat useful for collaboration, but preferred a regular flip chart to the smart board. They suggested allowing each member to input their own ratings in the evaluation criteria and having the computer calculate the average.

1. During the process evaluation, Marketing did not agree that the meeting process was moving along the right phases because the finance information about component costs was not provided earlier in the design phase. This caused the team to have to make significant changes to their remote control design late in the process in order to meet the cost target of 12.50 euros per unit. Marketing felt the resulting design with a scroll wheel and minimal buttons would be too unfamiliar and difficult to use for their target demographic of older users.

2. Despite the challenges, the team was able to adapt the design to meet the cost requirements while still including innovative features like the LCD screen and docking station. The project manager suggested they could market the remote to a wider audience beyond older users by offering interchangeable face plates to appeal to younger people as well. In the end, the team gave their design a score of 41 out of 49 points (84%) based on the evaluation criteria of visual appeal, innovation, ease of use, functionality, cost, suitability for the target users, and brand recognizability.

1. The project manager opened the meeting, the last one for the project, noting they would discuss the final design, do project evaluation, and close out the project. He presented the agenda: prototype presentation, setting evaluation criteria, looking at finances, project evaluation, and closing. The goal was to keep the remote control cost under 12.5 euros per unit. The project manager then asked the industrial designer to present the prototype.

2. The industrial designer presented a simple prototype with an on/off button, mute button, volume and channel selectors, number buttons, and buttons for help, teletext and subtitles. Marketing asked about teletext functionality and the user interface designer explained how it would work using the number buttons and channel buttons. The project manager questioned if all the buttons were really needed to keep it simple for the elderly target users. The industrial designer felt the current design was already quite basic.

3. The team discussed each button, agreeing the on/off, volume, channel, and number buttons were essential. They debated whether the mute and help buttons could be eliminated by using long presses of other buttons instead. Teletext and subtitle buttons were deemed important features to keep. Marketing pointed out that by focusing the remote only on TV functions, there wasn't much room to reduce buttons further.

4. The industrial designer described the physical design, with equal-sized, round rubber buttons in a different color from the case. LEDs were eliminated in favor of the LCD screen. The project manager liked the design but wanted to move on to discussing the finances, noting it would be difficult to meet the 12.5 euro per unit cost target. He reviewed the component costs, identifying the chip, case materials, and large number of buttons as the major cost drivers.

5. To reduce costs, the team brainstormed eliminating the mute and help buttons, using a flat case design instead of curved, and combining the teletext and subtitle functions into one button. However, this would impact the usability for the elderly target market. Marketing suggested they could simply increase the price slightly given their unique features, but the project manager said they had to stay within the 12.5 euro budget.

<summary>
1. The Project Manager reviewed the agenda, which included going over the last meeting, hearing presentations from each team member, discussing new requirements for the TV remote, and deciding on next steps. The team previously decided they wanted to create a modern, fun, and easy-to-find universal remote. The Project Manager noted that people want remotes that look good and are simple to use.

2. The Marketing Expert, Corinne, presented survey results showing 75% of users find their current remotes ugly and 80% would pay more for a fancy-looking remote. The results also indicated that remotes don't match user behavior well, with 75% of users ""zapping"" a lot but only using 10% of buttons. The biggest user frustrations are losing the remote and difficulty learning to use a new one.

3. The User Interface Designer, Ryan, recommended focusing on a user-centered design with fewer buttons, rather than an engineer-centered design. He suggested hiding less-used buttons and concentrating on making an innovative, trendy design for a TV remote specifically, as a universal remote would be too complex. He concluded that they should focus on improving the appearance, as the survey indicated this is what users dislike about current remotes.

4. The Industrial Designer, Manuel, explained how a remote control works, with a user interface controlling a chip that sends infrared signals to the TV. He noted that while they can't change the chip or infrared lamp, they can explore options for the user interface (buttons, speech recognition, etc.) and power source (batteries, solar, etc.). However, more complex technologies like speech recognition would increase the cost.

5. The Project Manager shared updated requirements that the remote will only control the TV (not be a universal remote), will not have teletext, and must incorporate the company's colors (yellow and grey) and slogan. The team decided to not pursue speech recognition, agreeing it wouldn't be worth the added cost and complexity. They brainstormed ideas for the remote's shape, considering forms like a square or curved shape that would fit comfortably in the user's hand.

4. The team agreed that the remote should be multifunctional, compatible with various devices like sound systems, TVs, DVD players, VHS players (although they may be phased out soon), and TiVo. They emphasized the importance of a comprehensive instruction booklet, as universal remotes often fail to be truly universal. The design should be ergonomic, visually appealing, and user-friendly, catering to both tech-savvy and less technologically inclined users.

1. The group discussed results from Stephane and compared them to other systems, noting that their methods reduced error rates by 25-50% depending on the case. Out of 6 matching conditions, 3 got better, 2 stayed the same, and 1 got worse. There are still some issues to resolve with the Danish results before the final evaluation set results are due.

2. The best performing systems so far are from a combination of French Telecom and Alcatel, which used spectral subtraction and cepstral parameter modification. The group's system is competitive but used some different techniques. Combining the best ideas from different systems while keeping resource usage reasonable could lead to an even better standard.

3. The group needs to trace down some bugs in the next day or so before results are finalized. Running the two test sets takes about a day of computer time. The main reason for the week and a half timeline is to allow time to fix issues like the features behaving differently in California vs Oregon.

4. Hynek will attend the standards meeting and may push for trying to combine different techniques. On the terminal side, the group's filtering approach could be added to what Alcatel did to reduce the data rate. On the server side, elements from the group's system could probably be combined with Alcatel's as well.

5. Moving forward, the group wants to take a closer look at the speech data from these databases to better understand the noise characteristics and what is causing the degradation. One idea is to see if noise changes the confusion matrices, causing more errors between phoneme classes rather than within classes. Improving recognition of phoneme classes could lead to gains for noisy speech.

6. Even in the best matched cases, the digit error rates of 8-9% are still too high to be usable in a real application with 10-digit phone numbers. The Aurora data provides a realistic acoustic environment in terms of noise and room acoustics. Despite the 30-60% error rate reductions achieved, the performance is still poor for a practical system, indicating more work is needed.

1. The project manager opened the meeting by mentioning some changes from management, including that the remote control is for a specific television and the all-in-one idea is no longer viable. The marketing expert, Raj, presented findings from a consumer survey showing 75% of users find current remote controls ugly, but 80% are willing to pay more for better-looking remotes. He also noted that while some companies add many functions, 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons, so they should focus on what consumers actually use. Raj suggested emphasizing speech recognition to appeal to the 15-35 age group who are the main buyers.

2. The marketing expert also presented data on problems consumers face with current remotes, with 34% finding them too difficult to operate. He recommended making the remote easy to learn and providing proper manuals. The project manager thanked Raj for the informative presentation.

3. The user interface designer, Helen, discussed the basic functions the remote needs to send messages to the TV. She showed some leading remote control designs, noting they look boring and have too many buttons. Helen suggested a more organic, hand-held shape with a simple design and minimal buttons, since extra buttons can be cut in favor of better design. She proposed some novel features like glow-in-the-dark material, an easy-finder whistle function, or a rechargeable station.

4. The industrial designer questioned if research was done on how many people can whistle, and if that feature is desirable in the remote. The team discussed alternatives like using any loud noise such as clapping or shouting. They considered having the remote beep in response to help locate it.

5. The industrial designer presented, mentioning the remote needs a low-cost outer casing and regular batteries as a power source, though a rechargeable option was discussed. He suggested programmable options requiring minimal memory to store user's favorite channels and volume settings. Speech recognition and noise detection were proposed as differentiating features, with a small microphone to pick up sounds above a certain threshold and have the remote beep in response to help find it when lost.

It was also noted that many buttons on remotes go unused, so they should focus on including only the most important functions.

2. The industrial designer presented an exaggerated concept involving a remote control that combines features of a space shuttle, coffee maker, and bullet train. While amusing, the team agreed this was not practical. They discussed including speech recognition, a ""find me"" feature to locate the remote by making a noise, and using a rubber material for durability.

3. In the end, the team decided on a remote with speech recognition, a limited number of buttons, an organic shape, and some programmable options.

2. They discuss how schools needing support are identified through the school categorization system, Estyn inspection reports, and local intelligence.
3. The Minister believes the categorization system has evolved over time to be a triage system for identifying where resources should be spent, rather than an accountability measure.
4. There is concern that schools causing significant concern, especially secondary schools, are not being identified early enough according to the Estyn chief inspector.
5. The Minister agrees with this assessment and outlines a new multi-agency approach being piloted to provide more support to schools causing concern.
6. This approach involves the school, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn and Welsh Government working together as a panel to drive sustainable improvement.
7. The initial feedback on this trial has been very positive, with local authorities wanting to include more of their schools.
8. The Minister emphasizes the need to develop robust self-evaluation skills within the school system, aided by a new national evaluation and improvement resource.
9. She believes if they had continued with the previous approach, the same schools would have continued to struggle without making sufficient progress.

The OECD has been involved in reviewing the Welsh education system and will publish their latest report in March 2020. The OECD talks to practitioners, the middle tier, and Welsh Government as part of their evaluation. Their reports have informed the Welsh Government's education strategy.

2. Local authorities have powers to intervene in schools causing concern, but there is variation in how these powers are used. The Welsh Government encourages local authorities to be proactive in intervening when needed. A new national evaluation and improvement resource is being developed and tested to promote more robust self-evaluation across the school system. This resource has been co-constructed with the OECD, middle tier, practitioners and Estyn.

3. 11% of secondary schools inspected in the last two years were judged as unsatisfactory and needing urgent improvement. The chief inspector says these schools are not being identified early enough. The Welsh Government is looking at using additional data like staff sickness to provide earlier warning signs. A new multi-agency approach is being piloted with the two most concerning high schools in each local authority to promote faster improvement.

1. The Minister was asked about actions taken in 2015 towards the ""National model for regional working"" document. She said the current model is from 2015, and some work was done in 2017-2018 to update it with additional services like specialist HR and governor support being delivered regionally. However, this revised model was rejected by local government.

2. Despite the national model not being updated, the Minister noted that some local authorities have pooled resources to deliver HR and governor support services regionally anyway. The EAS and Central South consortia are providing these services, even though there wasn't national agreement to include them in the model. The other two regions are expected to see the benefits and follow suit over time.

3. The Minister was asked if it's time to review the 2015 document given the discussion and the line that ""implementation of this model will change over time."" The response was that a complete review is not currently planned, as the focus is on getting consistency across the current regions, particularly in relation to ERW. Ongoing discussions are happening with the WLGA on intervention in schools and which areas could be further developed.

4. Professor Dylan Jones's strategic delivery group was discussed, which seems to have been well-received in the sector. The Minister said the group is working to get clarity and consistency on the roles and responsibilities of partners in the middle tier, to support successful curriculum implementation. The group is arm's length from government and feeds back to the Minister, but has no formal reporting mechanism.

5. It was suggested that developments seem to be heading towards a national school improvement service, with local delivery. The Minister said that is not the intention of the strategic group. She receives advice from Professor Jones on the middle tier and what Welsh Government needs to do, but has not had a conversation about moving to a national service.

6. The scope of Professor Jones's group was discussed, as it seems to have evolved from looking at duplication in the middle tier to a broader focus on curriculum and the education system. The Minister feels the group remains clear on establishing roles and responsibilities in the middle tier, ensuring there isn't duplication, and that partners can rely on each other to fulfill their responsibilities.
