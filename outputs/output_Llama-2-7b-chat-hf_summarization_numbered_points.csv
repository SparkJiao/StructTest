1. The study examines the eccentricity of exoplanets in multiple-planet systems, using observations from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and other telescopes.
2. The authors analyze the observations of six highly eccentric planetary systems, including HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B.
3. The study uses test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in each of the six systems.
4. The authors find that nearly all of the test-particle removals occur within the first 100 years of the simulations, indicating that the systems have stabilized to their final configurations.
5. The study concludes that the observations do not provide evidence for additional objects in any of the six systems, supporting the hypothesis that very eccentric single-planet systems originate by interactions within a wide binary system.

1. The paper discusses the non-local properties of quantum states, specifically the three notions of non-locality: Bell non-locality, EPR non-locality, and separability.
2. Bell non-locality refers to the violation of the Bell inequality, which is a statistical test for locality.
3. EPR non-locality is a phenomenon where two parties, Alice and Bob, can demonstrate the existence of entanglement by performing local measurements.
4. Separability refers to the ability of a state to be described by a product of local states.
5. The paper focuses on EPR non-locality and its relationship to the quantum steering ellipsoid.
6. The quantum steering ellipsoid is a geometric representation of the non-locality of a quantum state, which can be used to determine the state's EPR non-locality.
7. The paper gives a necessary condition for a two-qubit state to be EPR non-steerable, which is based on the construction of a suitable local hidden variable (LHV) model.

1. The visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information has never been identified conclusively.
2. Folklore has it that Feynman mentioned this notion in casual conversations around 1985, but there was no concrete scheme for implementing spintronic logic gates till the mid-1990s.
3. Encoding information in spin may have certain advantages, such as lower power dissipation in switching logic gates.
4. Spin does not couple easily to stray electric fields, so spin is likely to be relatively immune to noise.
5. It is possible that spin devices may be faster than charge-based devices, as spin flip time is smaller than charge transfer time.
6. The anti-ferromagnetic ordering is preferred over the ferromagnetic ordering in the presence of exchange interaction between two electrons confined to two separate potentials.
7. The ground state of the array has the spin configuration where the upspin state is aligned parallel to the magnetic field, and the downspin state is aligned anti-parallel to the magnetic field.
8. The truth table of a spintronic NAND gate is shown in Table 1, which reveals that the device can realize any arbitrary Boolean logic circuit.
9. The problem with the proposed spintronic logic gates is that exchange interaction is bidirectional, which prevents the unidirectional flow of logic signal from the input to the output of the logic device, violating the necessary attribute of any classical logic device.

1. The text discusses the evolution of close binary systems (CVs) with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main-sequence secondary.
2. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point, leading to a period gap in the CV period distribution.
3. The minimum period of CVs is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the thermal relaxation time of the white dwarf.
4. The orbital angular momentum loss rate of a CV can be written as the sum of two terms: the systemic am loss rate and the caml (consequential am loss) mechanism.
5. The caml mechanism causes a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the system with some fraction of the angular momentum it had on leaving the secondary.
6. The author investigates ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introduces a form of consequential am loss (caml) to explain the observed short-period CV period distribution.</summary>",1

1. The Stephan's Quintet is a strongly interacting compact group of galaxies that has produced a highly disturbed intragroup medium (IGM) through a complex sequence of interactions and harassment.
2. The group contains a large-scale intergalactic shock wave that was first observed as a narrow filament in the radio continuum and subsequently detected in the X-ray band.
3. The shock wave is believed to be responsible for the X-ray heating of the gas in the group, and optical emission line ratios and observed broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is powered by strong shocks rather than star formation.
4. The main elements of Stephan's Quintet are shown in Figure 1, including the primary shock defined by the 20 cm radio continuum emission, and the intruder galaxy, ngc 7318b, which lies to the west of the shock.

The unexpected discovery of extremely powerful, pure-rotational H@xmath9 line emission from the center of the shock using the Spitzer Space Telescope has sparked intense interest in the Quintet, and a large subset of the local 3CR radio galaxies have been found to have dominantly H@xmath9 line emission, often seen against a very weak thermal continuum.</summary>",1

3. The authors identify two populations of quasars based on the widths of their BELs: population A has narrow BELs (FWHM = 1000-4000) and population B has broader BELs (FWHM = 4000-12000).

2. Recent experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson, which strengthens the validity of the Standard Model.

1. The theoretical description of hadron production at high transverse momentum in either hadronic or nuclear collisions is traditionally framed in two-step process involving first hard scattering of partons and then fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.
2. The first step is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second step makes use of fragmentation functions that are determined phenomenologically.
3. Recently, it has been found that the traditional two-step process is inadequate for intermediate @math2 transverse momentum, and instead, recombination of shower partons is the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.
4. Although the fragmentation process is still dominant at extremely high @math2 transverse momentum, it is desirable to have a universal description that can be applied to any @math2 transverse momentum, based on the same hadronization scheme.
5. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to treat the shower partons as a distinct entity and determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
6. The concept of shower partons has been discussed in the past, but the approach presented here is different in that it focuses on the recombination model for fragmentation and uses the notion of shower partons to describe the momentum distributions of the partons initiated by hard partons.
7. The spd (shower parton distribution) is defined in the context of the recombination model, which relates the shower partons to the observed hadrons.
8. The equation for the hadronization process is given by @math6, where @math7 is the joint distribution of a quark and an antiquark at momentum fraction @math8, and @math9 is the recombination function (rf) for the formation of a meson at @math10.

1. The experimental evidence of the theoretically predicted skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric compounds with dzyaloshinskii-moriya interaction has intrigued many scientists over the last years.
2. Recently, the preparation of thin films of B20 type MnSi on silicon substrates has offered promising prospects for future spintronic devices.
3. The benefit of thin films is that they exhibit an extended magnetic phase diagram due to uniaxial anisotropy, which allows for the possibility of finding compounds with similar spin orders at higher temperatures.
4. A suitable candidate is the B20 compound MnGe with a magnetic ordering temperature of 170 K, which was attributed to a skyrmion phase in analogy to MnSi.
5. The synthesis of MnGe is challenging, as it forms only under high pressure and temperatures between 600 and 1000°C.
6. To overcome this difficulty, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) was used to grow thin film structures under strong non-equilibrium conditions.
7. However, the synthesis of MnGe on Ge@Mn substrates does not produce B20 MnGe films but results in a Mn@Ge layer.
8. In conclusion, the structure and morphology of MnGe thin films were investigated using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

2. The so-called fireball model is thus strongly favored, but we are still far from resolving the puzzle of GRBs (Piran 1999; Van Paradijs et al. 2000).
3. A major problem is that we do not know whether GRBs are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs, so that the energetics involved cannot be determined definitively (e.g., Piran 1999; Van Paradijs et al. 2000).

1. The study observed massive star formation in three hot molecular cores using mid-infrared (MIR) observations.
2. The observations revealed multiple, MIR sources in each of the cores, which were separated into three morphological types: unresolved point sources (P), unresolved point sources with weak surrounding extended emission (PE), and extended sources (E).
3. The point sources were found to be at close angular separations, and future high spatial and spectral resolution observations may be able to determine whether they are physically bound.
4. The methanol masers were found closest to the brightest MIR point source (within the assumed 1 arcsecond pointing accuracy) and dominated the luminosity.
5. The time scale for a source at the core edge to migrate to the center is comparable to the hot molecular core lifetime, so it is not possible to rule out large protostellar motions within the core.
6. From the derived gas mass of the core and mass estimates for the sources, Monte Carlo simulations showed that it is difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the core using a standard form of the initial mass function (IMF).
7. This conclusion would not hold if most of the original gas has already formed stars or has been dispersed such that the original core mass is much greater than now observed.
8. The study suggests that the observed massive stars in the cores are likely to be the result of a combination of in situ formation and migration from the edge of the core.

7. The steepening in the outburst decay of Aql X-1 has no clear parallel in low mass X-ray transients (LXRTs) containing black hole candidates (BHCs).
8. The mass donor stars and binary parameters of Aql X-1 and LXRTs are similar, suggesting that the differences in outburst evolution are due to the different nature of the underlying object.
9. Accretion onto the neutron star surface in SXRTS, such as Aql X-1, can continue even in the quiescent state, as long as the centrifugal drag exerted by the corotating magnetosphere on the accreting material is weaker than gravity.
10. The possibility that accretion onto the neutron star surface takes place even in the quiescent state of Aql X-1 faces serious difficulties, as a quiescent luminosity of order 0.42-4.4 x 10^36 erg/s would require a magnetic field of only 0.5-1.4 x 10^9 G, which is much lower than the magnetic field expected for a neutron star.

2. To clarify the origin of dark energy, one has tried to understand the connection between dark energy and particle physics, including the possibility of a scalar field called ""acceleron"" that modulates the neutrino density through changes in the universe's energy density.
3. In the ""mavans"" scenario, the dark energy is assumed to be the sum of the neutrino energy density and the scalar potential for the acceleron, with the neutrino mass varying with the evolution of the universe.
4. The scalar potential for the acceleron is not discussed in many literature, but it is assumed to be a singlet under the gauge group of the standard model and to couple to both the left-handed lepton doublet and the right-handed neutrino superfields.
5. The neutrino mass is given by the acceleron, with the mass of a sterile neutrino being variable on cosmological time scales due to the second term in the neutrino mass matrix.
6. The dark energy density should be stationary with respect to the variation of the neutrino mass, which is equivalent to the usual stationary condition stabilized by an ordinary scalar field.
7. The small present value of the acceleron is needed to satisfy the constraints on the scalar potential, and the hydrodynamic stability of the dark energy is ensured by the speed of sound squared in the neutrino-acceleron fluid, which becomes negative in the ""mavans"" scenario when neutrinos are non-relativistic, avoiding the instability.",1

1. The light emitted during arc welding contains intense ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that can be harmful to workers.
2. The UVR emitted during arc welding is primarily absorbed by oxygen molecules, making it difficult to measure the radiation at welding distances.
3. The available data on the UVR emitted during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is unreliable and insufficient, particularly for the type of shielding gas and welding current used.
4. The effective irradiance of UVR emitted during GMAW was measured using an X13 hazard lightmeter and an XD-45-HUV UV-hazard detector head, and the results showed that the effective irradiance increased with increasing welding current and shielding gas composition.
5. The allowable daily exposure times corresponding to the measured effective irradiance values were calculated using the ACGiH guidelines, and the results showed that the allowable exposure times were less than 1 minute for the highest welding current and shielding gas composition used in the study.

1. The study compared the spatial relationships between the in-out and out-in midurethral tapes and the female urethra using a cadaveric study design.
2. The study used a double tantalum wire-threaded design to allow for intra-cadaveric comparison between 10 independent in-out transobturator mus trajectories and 10 out-in transobturator mus trajectories.
3. The study found that the in-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the out-in approach.
4. The study demonstrated that the tape is not positioned caudally but lies as a band behind the urethra, suggesting its passive (non-obstructive) role in achieving continence.
5. The study showed that the out-in approach had a more horizontal positioning of the tape's trajectory, taking the mesh closer to the vaginal wall.
6. The study found that the slightly more lateral in-out trajectory causes the tape to be seated in more muscular tissue, which might explain the trend to a slightly higher risk of transient thigh pain.
7. The study emphasized the importance of careful dissection of the peri-urethral tunnel for the out-in passage to provide a full-thickness vaginal epithelial layer.
8. The study suggested that ultrasound will not be able to provide the same holistic visualization within the bony pelvis, but mesh-tape beyond the obturator membrane probably does not contribute to the mus functional effect or possible adverse events at the level of the vagina.
9. The study concluded that the advent of three-dimensional ultrasonography will allow for similar measurements of the different tapes' trajectories in vivo in a dynamic setting, possibly allowing correlation of these findings to nuances in clinical outcomes.
