1. The transport properties of nonlinear, non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport, inspired by the extraction of useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations in biological systems. Recent focus has been on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.
2. Chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions, and their behavior is dependent on system parameters. As parameters change, stability islands can merge, break apart, or change symmetry, and the chaotic sea can be pinched off or altered, leading to significant changes in transport properties.
3. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the average velocity could change direction based on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. He conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations in trajectory dynamics. However, Barbi and Salerno argued against this connection, suggesting that current reversals could occur without bifurcations.
4. The behavior of chaotic systems is not necessarily ergodic, meaning that the dynamics of a single particle may not represent the ensemble behavior. Understanding transport properties requires considering the specifics of the ensemble, including its location, width, and the number of trajectories.
5. The current depends significantly on the initial ensemble and transient behavior. Broad heuristics are rare in chaotic systems, and understanding ensemble-dependence is critical for studying transport properties in chaotic ratchets.
6. Bifurcations in trajectory dynamics are associated with abrupt changes in the current, but not all bifurcations lead to current direction reversals. The net drift of an ensemble can be closer to the expected current than the behavior of an individual trajectory.
7. The current depends on the location and width of the initial ensemble, particularly for small ensembles. Gaussian ensembles can show illusory current reversals, especially near bifurcation points where symmetry-breaking occurs.
8. Incorporating ensemble characteristics into current calculations is essential, particularly in the chaotic regime where the ensemble needs to be larger than a certain threshold to ensure convergence. The definition of the current should be modified to include an empirically obtained cut-off for convergence.

1. The discovery of over 200 extrasolar planets has revealed a wide range of eccentricities, with many having moderate to high eccentricities.
2. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets, including planet-planet scattering and stellar companion interactions.
3. Planet-planet scattering occurs when multiple jovian planets interact, leaving one in an eccentric orbit and often ejecting the other.
4. The kozai mechanism, induced by interactions with stellar companions, can cause large-amplitude oscillations in a planet's eccentricity.
5. Of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity, six also have stellar-mass companions in wide binary orbits.
6. Test particle simulations have been used to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six eccentric planetary systems.
7. The simulations revealed regions in each system where additional planets could remain in stable orbits.
8. The radial-velocity measurements from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) were used to determine companion limits and search for additional low-mass objects in the six systems.
9. No evidence was found for additional planets in any of the six systems, and tight limits were obtained for close-orbiting planets in the hd 45350 and 16 Cyg b systems.

1. The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z-boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z-decay into fermion pairs with high precision. The agreement between LEP data and SM predictions has constrained new physics at the Z-pole. A future high-luminosity Z-factory could further probe Z-boson properties, especially exotic or rare decays, which are believed to be sensitive to new physics.
2. Among the rare Z-decays, flavor-changing (FC) processes have been extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics. Although these processes are severely suppressed in the SM, their branching ratios in new physics models can be greatly enhanced for lepton and quark flavor violation decays.
3. Another type of rare process is the Z-decay into light Higgs bosons. For example, the decay Z → h(A)h(A), where h(A) denotes a light Higgs boson, has been studied in various models, including the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). These studies indicate that, in contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decays in the SM, the rates of these decays can be as large as the SM prediction in new physics models.
4. Recent studies have focused on singlet extensions of the MSSM, such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and the Nearly Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), where a light CP-odd Higgs boson with a singlet-dominant component may naturally arise from the spontaneous breaking of some approximate global symmetry. These non-minimal supersymmetric models can avoid the μ-problem and alleviate the little hierarchy by having such a light Higgs boson.
5. With the latest experiments, the properties of the light Higgs boson are more stringently constrained than before. In the SM, there is no model-independent lower bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass, but extensions of the SM can significantly relax this lower bound. For example, in the NMSSM, the lower bound for the CP-odd Higgs boson is 27 GeV, while",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 18}"
3," 1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles, with their masses expected to be below the TeV range. Mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector are crucial problems in SUSY phenomenology.
2. The no-scale type Kähler potential is a popular choice in SUSY models, where the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated. In this potential, all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant approaches zero, leaving only gaugino masses as the source of SUSY breaking. This scenario is highly predictive and suppresses contributions to FCNC, making it interesting from the viewpoint of the SUSY flavor problem.
3. The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and the sequestered sector scenario in a five-dimensional setting. In the sequestered sector scenario, the hidden sector fields live on one brane, and the visible sector fields live on the other, leading to the desired form of the Kähler potential.
4. The no-scale boundary condition limits the degrees of freedom of SUSY particle mass spectrum, with only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses being gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given. Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, with direct search bounds and cosmological constraints considered to identify the allowed parameter space.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

2. A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) has a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity [2], which led to studies on the stability of horizons [3, 4].
3. The EM field itself can weaken singularity strength in CPW collisions, with pure EM wave collisions having special significance [5].
4. The BS solution describes two linearly polarized step EM waves, with a removable CH singularity in the interaction region but essential curvature singularities on null boundaries [5].
5. A cross-polarized version of the BS solution (CPBS) has regular Weyl scalars in the interaction region but maintains singularities on null boundaries [6, 7].
6. The CPBS solution is used to test a stability conjecture (HK) for CHs, which is more economical than traditional perturbation analysis [8, 9].
7. The HK conjecture predicts that certain scalars' divergence in an exact back-reaction solution would indicate CH instability and conversion to scalar singularities [8, 9].
8. The HK conjecture is applied to the cross-polarized version of the BS spacetime, predicting unstable qr singularities that convert to scalar curvature singularities with generic wave additions [8, 9].
9. The HK conjecture was not compared with an exact back-reaction solution for the BS spacetime, so a new solution representing cross-polarized EM field coupled with scalar field is presented [8, 9].",1,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 9}"

1. X-ray studies of normal galaxies have been extended to cosmologically interesting distances through deep field surveys, such as CDF-N, CDF-S, and HDF-N. These surveys have detected significant numbers of normal galaxies contributing to the X-ray background (XRB) in the 0.52 keV band. The bulk of the XRB's energy density is explained by active galactic nuclei (AGN), but understanding the typical galaxy's X-ray emission is equally important.

a. Deep X-ray surveys are expected to detect numerous normal galaxies, which will dominate the number counts at 0.52 keV fluxes of 10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2.

1. Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with different degrees of non-classicality. Bipartite correlations, involving two spatially separated parties named Alice and Bob, can be classified based on these degrees of non-classicality.
2. At the weaker end of the spectrum, there are non-separable or entangled states, which cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents. These states violate classical descriptions but do not necessarily demonstrate Bell-nonlocality.
3. At the stronger end, quantum systems can exhibit Bell-nonlocality, where measurement correlations violate Bell inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality. This phenomenon is the only way for two spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement if either party or their detectors cannot be trusted.
4. Between these two types of non-classical correlations lies EPR-steering, a concept inspired by the EPR paradox and formalized eight years ago. EPR-steering is the only way to verify entanglement if one of the parties or their detectors cannot be trusted.
5. A bipartite state is Bell-local if and only if there is a local hidden variable (LHV) model for any measurements Alice and Bob perform. The distinction between non-separability and Bell-nonlocality lies in the fact that the 'variables' in an LHV model are not restricted to be quantum states.
6. The logical hierarchy of non-locality concepts leads to a hierarchy for bipartite states: separable states form a strict subset of non-EPR-steerable states, which in turn form a strict subset of Bell-local states.
7. Although the EPR-steerable set has been determined for certain classes of highly symmetric states, little was known about what types of states are steerable for the simplest case of two qubits. The phenomenon of steering has been studied extensively using the steering ellipsoid formalism.
8. In this manuscript, the authors investigate EPR-steerability of the class of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, the so-called T-states. They use the steering ellipsoid formalism to develop a deterministic LHS model for projective measurements on these states.

3. In 1994, a specific spintronic NAND gate design was proposed using three spins in a weak magnetic field, with the spin orientations of confined electrons in semiconductor quantum dots representing binary data.
4. The ground state of the array has an anti-ferromagnetic ordering, with spins aligned opposite to the magnetic field, and the two edge dots serve as input ports, while the middle dot functions as the output port.
5. A problem with spintronic devices is that changing the state of one spin can create a metastable state, where the system is stuck in a state that does not allow the logic signal to propagate, rendering the circuit inoperable.
6. A proposed solution to this issue is to use clocking, similar to charge-coupled device arrays, to impose unidirectionality in time and propagate the input state through a linear array.
7. However, implementing this solution requires lowering two adjacent barriers at the same time, which necessitates a three-phase clock, and poses challenges in fabrication, lithography, and energy dissipation, making these devices unattractive for practical applications.",1,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 7}"

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary star fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off around 77 minutes. However, theoretical models have struggled to accurately reproduce the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
2. The orbital period evolution of CVs reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer expands the star, while thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius. The minimum period occurs when the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time are approximately equal. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the rate of orbital angular momentum losses. Researchers investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of minimum orbital period values in the CV population.
3. The orbital angular momentum loss rate in CVs can be written as the sum of systemic and mass transfer-dependent terms. Researchers consider the general case where the angular momentum loss mechanism, along with nova mass ejections, causes a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the system. Possible angular momentum loss mechanisms include magnetic propellers and accretion disc winds. The authors' caml prescription largely follows the notation of King & Kolb (1995) and assumes axis-symmetrical mass loss with respect to an axis fixed at the white dwarf center but perpendicular to the orbital plane.

2. The high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318b, with the IGM is believed to be responsible for the shock-heating of the X-ray emitting gas.
3. The SQ system has been extensively studied using the Spitzer Space Telescope, which revealed the unexpected discovery of extremely powerful pure rotational H$_2$ line emission from the center of the shock.
4. The H$_2$-emitting clouds carry a large bulk-kinetic energy, tapping a large percentage of the energy available in the shock.
5. A recent model suggests that H$_2$ formation occurs out of the multiphase, shocked gas, and an efficient cooling channel for high-speed shocks is an alternative to X-ray emission.
6. Similar strong H$_2$ emission has been discovered in several other systems, and a large subset of local 3CR radio galaxies exhibit extremely dominant MIR rotational H$_2$ lines.
7. The study of nearby prototypes, like SQ, may provide valuable insights into the nature of these more distant systems, as the large scale of the SQ shock is well-suited for such a study.

1. Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) show a variety of broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized gas near the central supermassive black hole. Broad emission lines, like Hβ, are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk. Two populations of Type 1 AGN have been identified based on the widths of their broad Hβ lines: Population A has narrower lines (FWHM Hβ = 1000-4000 km/s) and includes Narrow Line Seyfert 1 sources, while Population B has broader lines (FWHM Hβ = 4000-12000 km/s) and includes both radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars.
2. Narrow emission lines, such as [OIII]5007, are generally considered a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame, except in the case of ""blue outliers"" found in certain sources with FWHM Hβ = 1500-3500 km/s and weak [OIII] emission. Blue outliers show [OIII] blueshifts as large as 10,000 km/s. Population B sources with blueshifted [OIII] are known at low redshift (or luminosity), but careful use of [OIII] and Hβ narrow lines as rest frame measures suggests that broad Hβ in Population A sources rarely shows a systematic red or blue shift above the FWHM profile level.
3. Broad FeII emission has been found in Type 1 quasars since the 1960s and is almost ubiquitous in bright SDSS quasars. Circumstantial evidence supports the assumption that FeII emission arises in or near the emitting clouds that produce other low-ionization lines like Hβ. FWHM FeII appears to correlate with FWHM Hβ over the full range where FeII can be detected.

1. Nuclear multifragmentation is a field of intense theoretical and experimental study, with research focusing on the possibility of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter due to the similarity between nucleon-nucleon interaction and van der Waals forces.
2. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the ALADIN group, which identified a wide plateau around 5 MeV temperature, lasting from 3 to 10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy. This observation suggested the possible existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter.
3. Subsequent experiments by EOS and INDRA, however, produced slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region being absent in most cases. These discrepancies can be attributed to factors such as the precision of experimental measurements and finite-size effects of the caloric curve, which depend on the reaction type.
4. Recent reevaluations by the ALADIN group have shown that corrections of about 10% are needed for kinetic energies of emitted neutrons, and the energies of spectator parts grow by approximately 30% in the bombarding energy interval of 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon.

5. Theoretical calculations suggest that the universality of a specific quantity, subject to bombarding energy variation, indicates statistical equilibrium. However, there is a significant nonequilibrium part included in the measured source excitation energies, which may belong to pre-equilibrium or pre-break-up stages.
6. The SMM calculations suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even in the case of the 600 MeV/nucleon bombarding energy reaction. Accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and sequential secondary particle emission are essential to distinguish between equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies.
7. The improved version of the microcanonical multifragmentation model is presented in the paper, along with new evaluations of temperature curves and the first evaluations of heat capacities at constant volume represented as a function of system excitation energy and temperature.

2. The primary energy source for this heating must lie in the convection zone below the solar photosphere, where there is 100 times as much energy available than that required to heat the corona.
3. The debate over the source of energy for heating the corona centers on whether the energy derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events giving rise to nanoflares.
4. MHD waves can be generated by the buffeting of magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere by granulation and can propagate into magnetic flux tubes, dissipating their energy in the chromosphere or corona.
5. In coronal loops, random motions of magnetic loop foot-points can produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines, generating field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively.

The ISO satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared, but the poor angular resolution prevents any detailed study of the spatial structure and physical conditions of the H@xmath3o emitting regions.

1. Variable selection methods based on penalty theory have gained significant attention in high-dimensional data analysis, with the Lasso method being a prominent approach due to its principled use of the L1-norm penalty.
2. The Lasso estimate can be viewed as the mode of the posterior distribution, and its penalty can be transformed into a Laplace prior, which can be expressed as a Gaussian scale mixture.
3. This has led to Bayesian developments of the Lasso and its variants, as well as work on nonconvex penalization under a parametric Bayesian framework.
4. The paper discusses the use of subordinators, one-dimensional Lévy processes that are almost surely non-decreasing, in Bayesian nonconvex penalization problems under supervised learning scenarios.
5. The authors model latent shrinkage parameters using subordinators, which are defined as stochastic processes of regularization parameters, and show that both gamma and Poisson subordinators are limiting cases of two families of compound Poisson subordinators.
6. The paper also establishes a connection between two nonconvex penalty functions, log and exp, with the Laplace transforms of gamma and Poisson subordinators.
7. The authors propose a nonparametric approach for normal variance mixtures and show that it is closely related to Lévy processes.

1. The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and the possibility of exotic gap symmetry with nodal behavior have led to a renewed effort to find experimental probes of order parameter symmetry. One proposal by Sauls and co-workers is to examine the nonlinear current response of d-wave superconductors, which introduces a nonanalyticity in the current-velocity relation at a specific temperature due to the presence of nodes in the order parameter. Early experimental work did not verify these predictions, but a more recent reanalysis has claimed confirmation. An alternative proposal by Dahm and Scalapino examined the quadratic term in the magnetic response of the penetration depth, which shows a specific temperature dependence at low temperatures, providing a clear and unique signature of nodes in the d-wave gap. Experimental verification of this has been obtained, confirming that nonlinear microwave current response can be used as a sensitive probe of order parameter symmetry issues.
2. The focus then shifts to the two-band superconductor MgB2, which is already under scrutiny for possible applications, including passive microwave filter technology. MgB2 was discovered in 2001, and since then, an enormous scientific effort has focused on this material. It is now thought to be the best candidate for a classic two-band electron-phonon superconductor, with s-wave pairing in each channel. A heightened interest in two-band superconductivity has led to claims of possible two-band effects in many other materials, both old and new. The goal is to compare in detail the differences between one-band and two-band s-wave superconductors in terms of their nonlinear response, as measured in the coefficients defined by Xu et al. and Dahm and Scalapino.

The authors reexamine the one-band s-wave case, studying issues of dimensionality, impurities, and strong electron-phonon coupling, and find new effects due to strong coupling at both high and low temperatures. They then examine the situation for two-band superconductors, starting from a case of highly decoupled bands, looking for signatures of the low energy scale due to the smaller gap, the effect of integration of the bands, and the response to inter- and intraband impurities.

1. Time series data mining involves various tasks, with classification being one of the most important. A well-known 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is one of the best classifiers for time series data.
2. The 1-NN classification depends crucially on the choice of distance measure. While the Euclidean distance is commonly used, the DTW distance has been shown to be more appropriate and accurate for time series data.
3. The Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band) was introduced to speed up DTW calculation and later used as a global constraint. The size of the global constraint, initially fixed at 10% of the time series length, has been found to significantly impact classification accuracy.
4. The Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band) generalizes the global constraint model by representing it as a multi-dimensional array, where each band corresponds to a data class. This allows for more precise adjustments based on the class warping path.
5. Learning algorithms are necessary to discover the best multi R-K bands, but existing methods, such as hill climbing search, may suffer from overfitting due to the use of accuracy metrics as heuristic functions.
6. To address overfitting, two new learning algorithms have been proposed: band boundary extraction and iterative learning. The former obtains the maximum, mean, and mode of path positions on the DTW distance matrix, while the latter adjusts band structures in each iteration based on a silhouette index.
7. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is a well-known similarity measure based on shape, using dynamic programming to find the minimum distance between two time series.
8. DTW may not always provide the best mapping, as it tries to find the minimum distance, potentially generating unwanted paths. Global constraints, such as S-C band, Itakura parallelogram, and R-K band, can limit permissible warping paths to address this issue.

2. The dynamical behavior of entanglement under decoherence has been studied extensively due to its significance in quantum computing and communication.
3. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) is a phenomenon where qubit entanglement is lost in a finite time under Markovian decoherence.
4. Experimental observations of ESD have been made, and it is detrimental to the practical realization of quantum information processing using entanglement.
5. Further studies revealed that revived entanglement and finite residual entanglement can also occur after ESD, which play constructive roles in quantum information protocols.
6. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.
7. A similar situation happens for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.
8. The entanglement dynamics in a double Jaynes-Cummings model shows that entanglement is transferred periodically among all bipartite partitions, and an identity is satisfied at any time.
9. A non-Markovian effect is observed in the time-nonlocal kernel function, which displays the memory effect of the reservoir and causes non-Markovian dynamics of the qubit.

2. The leading candidates for GRB sources are the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) and the coalescence of a compact binary system, both of which are expected to emit gravitational waves (GWs).
3. The duration of GW bursts is predicted to be a few milliseconds, and their amplitude at GRB source distances is expected to be of the order of 10^-21, but current GW antenna sensitivity is insufficient for detecting a single GRB-associated GW signal.
4. A program has been launched to study correlations between GRB events detected with BeppoSAX and output signals from gravitational antennas Nautilus and Explorer, using an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors.
5. The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, with different resonant frequencies and bandwidths, and has determined new experimental upper limits for the burst intensity causing correlations of GWs with GRBs.
6. The cross-correlation method used in the analysis provides a more complete and unbiased way of providing experimental information compared to previous methods, and can be applied for any expected delay between GRB and GW with appropriate time shifting of the integration window.

1. The process of discovering high-quality scientific publications is often facilitated through citation mechanisms, with the number of citations serving as an estimate of scientific credibility. However, this method is not foolproof, as some publications may be overlooked or forgotten over time. The statistical analysis of citation data is increasingly in demand, as it provides valuable feedback for authors.
2. A notable study on the citation distribution of scientific publications revealed a power-law form with an exponent of approximately 1. Research on this topic has led to the development of network models that mimic the complex structure and empirical results of citation distribution. However, these models primarily focus on the total number of citations and lack information about the issuing publications.
3. Scientific publications often form bridges between research areas by referencing findings in other fields. This process can be modeled using a simple approach that considers two research areas and referencing within and across each other. This model can also be applied to the web of human sexual contacts, where interactions between males and females can be thought of as two coupled growing networks.
4. The proposed model is built by introducing two new nodes simultaneously at each time step, one for each network, with a fraction of the new node's links attaching to pre-existing nodes in both networks. The attachments are preferential, and the rate of acquiring a link depends on the number of connections and the initial attractiveness of the pre-existing nodes.
5. The time evolution of the proposed model can be described by a rate equation, and the power-law distribution of the model can be visualized using a figure that illustrates the growth mechanism. The model's flexibility allows it to represent a variety of complex systems, including citation networks and the web of human sexual contacts.

25," 1. The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum in high-energy collisions is traditionally described in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron. The first part is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second part uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
2. However, this production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for particle production at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions. Instead, recombination of partons has been shown to be a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved. Although fragmentation is still dominant at extremely high transverse momentum, a universal description applicable to any transverse momentum is desirable.
3. The purpose of the paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The subject matter is primarily of interest in high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes always occurs in the environment of soft partons.
4. Semi-hard shower partons initiated by a hard parton can either recombine among themselves or recombine with soft partons in the environment. In the former case, the fragmentation function is reproduced, while in the latter case, a new hadronization process emerges, which has escaped theoretical attention thus far.
5. The main objective of the paper is to quantify the properties of shower partons and illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons. The actual application of the shower parton distributions developed in the paper to heavy-ion collisions will be considered elsewhere.
6. The concept of shower partons is not new, as attempts have been made to generate such partons in pQCD processes. However, since pQCD cannot be used down to the hadronization scale, the branching or cascading processes terminate at the formation of color-singlet pre-hadronic clusters, which cannot be easily related to shower partons and their hadronization.

To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, and several proposals have been made with varying success.
2. Becher and Joos used a lattice to define operators with desirable properties but found non-locality, which they resolved by introducing translation operators. Kanamori and Kawamoto also used a lattice and introduced non-commutativity between fields and discrete forms, while Balachandran et al. used a quantized phase space to regularize their system.

In lattice quantum chromodynamics (lattice QCD) calculations, the staggered fermion formulation is commonly used to describe fermions, and a discrete Dirac-Khler formulation with continuum properties can offer insight into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice.

In this paper, the authors show how the two lattices of Adams' proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Khler formulation and how the idea of using more than one lattice can be extended to describe exact flavor projection.

1. Cognitive radio networks, which allow secondary users to transmit on the same frequency band as primary users under certain interference limits, can be susceptible to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions. Information-theoretic security has been studied in the context of wiretap channel models, with the secrecy capacity defined as the maximum achievable rate between the transmitter and legitimate receiver while keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the transmitted messages. This concept has been extended to Gaussian channels and more complex scenarios, such as fading multi-antenna and multiuser channels.

In the context of cognitive radio networks, secure communication over multiple-input, single-output (MISO) channels has been studied, with the optimization problem formulated as a quasiconvex optimization problem. Collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints has also been investigated, with the optimization problem characterized as quasiconvex and solvable through convex semidefinite programming. Two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. However, there has been limited research on the combination of cognitive radio channels and information-theoretic security.

1. The paper discusses the benefits of maintaining conformal invariance when quantizing the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFSs). A classical conformal-invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFSs, and maintaining this symmetry during quantization allows for a more straightforward analysis. The authors demonstrate this in the case of the Maxwell field in de Sitter space, where they find a new and simple two-point Wightman function with the same physical content as the function of Allen and Jacobson.
2. The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism to realize all CFSs as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. They introduce auxiliary fields and use the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field. The use of a well-suited coordinate system allows for a more straightforward analysis of the CFSs.
3. The paper provides the infinitesimal conformal action on the fields and their conformal-invariant scalar product in the appendix. They also define a second coordinate system, where the four components are the so-called polyspherical coordinate system, and the fifth component carries the homogeneity of the fields. The intersection of the null cone and a given surface in this coordinate system results in a four-dimensional space, which is a CFS. A smooth move of the surface corresponds to performing a Weyl rescaling, which locally relates all CFSs and permits going from one to another.

Kominers and Kominers (2008) proved that the period of any position on a tree graph is 1 or 2, and all connected graphs satisfying certain conditions have period 1 with a polynomial bound for the transient length. They also showed that the set of all ""abundant"" vertices stabilizes, which simplifies the game.

Global fits to precision measurements can provide information about the parameters of new models.

2. In models with Higgs particles in representations other than doublets and singlets, there are more parameters in the gauge/Higgs sector than in the SM. When the theory is renormalized at one loop, these models will require extra input parameters. Models with new physics are often written in terms of the SM Lagrangian plus an extra contribution from new physics beyond the SM.
3. The text also discusses the possibility of a heavy Higgs boson that is consistent with precision electroweak data in terms of the S, T, and U parameters. A large contribution to isospin violation from a heavy Higgs boson can offset its contribution to electroweak observables such as the W boson mass.

This approach is expected to provide a numerically stable algorithm for solving the impurity problem in DMFT simulations.

1. The text discusses the use of flavor symmetry to generate the mass and mixing patterns of fermions in particle physics. Continuous symmetries like gauge symmetries and discrete symmetries like exchange symmetry have been used to describe these patterns in the leptonic sector. To avoid mass degeneracy, the concept of flavor symmetry has been introduced.
2. The paper by Ma and Rajasekaran introduced the concept of flavor symmetry to describe mass and mixing patterns in the leptonic sector. Their work has led to a lot of subsequent research in this area. The tri-bi maximal mixing pattern has been found to be a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model, which comes out naturally in the work of Altarelli and Feruglio.
3. In the Altarelli-Feruglio model, the leptonic mixing arises solely from the neutrino sector, while the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal. The model also admits hierarchical masses of the three charged leptons and quasi-degenerate or hierarchical neutrino masses. However, the model predicts non-zero and complex values of theta (xmath0), which could lead to the possibility of CP violation in the leptonic sector.
4. Non-zero theta (xmath0) can be generated in the Altarelli-Feruglio model through radiative correction or the introduction of higher-dimensional mass terms. The generation of non-zero complex theta (xmath0) and the possibility of non-zero CP violation have been extensively studied in the proposed model of Altarelli-Feruglio with explicit soft breaking of flavor symmetry.
5. The authors of the paper also showed that the tri-bi maximal mixing pattern is generated naturally in the framework of the see-saw mechanism with flavor symmetry. However, the exact tri-bi maximal pattern forbids CP violation in the leptonic sector at low energy. The textures of mass matrices in the proposed model could not generate lepton asymmetry.
6. The present work investigates the generation of non-zero theta (xmath0) through the see-saw mechanism by considering a small perturbation in the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, keeping the same texture of the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix as proposed in ref.[xcite].

1. Organic molecular crystals, composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces, are promising materials for fabricating nanoscale devices for electronics and optoelectronics applications. These devices typically consist of both organic and inorganic components, with the organic part being the active component and the inorganic part providing electrical contact to external circuitry. The interface between these two components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance.

2. The electronic structure of the interface is particularly important for understanding charge transfer between the organic and inorganic components and the energies at which the transfer takes place. This is a challenging task, especially in the single-molecule limit. Upon adsorption on a substrate, the electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change from their gas phase counterparts due to the formation of an image charge.

3. A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle (qp) description, which ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons. Within the qp picture, the electron affinity and ionization potential are associated with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a molecule, respectively. The adequacy of the qp description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO.

4. If density functional theory (DFT) is used, it is important to note that except for the energy of the HOMO, which can be rigorously interpreted as the negative of the ionization potential, the Kohn-Sham orbitals cannot be associated with qp energies. However, the Kohn-Sham qp levels often provide a good approximation to the true removal energies, particularly for metals. For molecules, the local and semi-local approximations of the exchange and correlation functional perform poorly, but hybrid functionals or functionals explicitly including self-interaction corrections can improve the results.

5. The calculation of the energy levels alignment of a molecule in the proximity of a metal presents additional problems due to the non-local nature of the image charge formation. Unless a given functional is explicitly non-local, it will fail to capture this effect, resulting in little change in the position of the HOMO and LUMO when",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40}"

1. The MOPPED algorithm is a patented method for data compression and accelerating likelihood function evaluations in astronomical data analysis, useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on model parameters. However, it has limitations, particularly with multimodal and degenerate distributions. When MOPPED accurately represents the likelihood function, it provides significant runtime improvement.
2. MOPPED works by compressing data points into values, one for each model parameter, making the likelihood calculation simpler and faster. The compression is based on weighting vectors generated at a fiducial set of parameter values, which may not always be the true parameters.
3. In the context of gravitational wave data analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the authors explore cases where MOPPED fails to accurately portray the likelihood function. They consider a sine-gaussian burst signal present in the LISA detector, with a waveform modulated by sky position, burst source polarization, and time of arrival.
4. In the one-dimensional case, with the central frequency of the oscillation as the only unknown parameter, MOPPED produces a second peak of equal height at an incorrect frequency. This issue arises due to a many-to-one mapping from the original parameter space to the compressed parameter space.
5. Adding a second parameter, such as the width of the burst, can rectify the problem in some cases. However, when both the central frequency and the width of the burst are variable parameters, MOPPED may still create unphysical degeneracies that could lead to secondary modes in the likelihood function.
6. When more parameters are added, the situation does not always improve. For example, allowing the polarization of the burst to vary can result in a second mode of equal likelihood to the true peak, which is not present in the original likelihood function.
7. In an extreme scenario, allowing the time of arrival of the burst to vary creates many alternative modes of likelihood equal to that of the original peak, making parameter estimation challenging.
8. A general rule for when MOPDE will generate additional peaks in the likelihood function is that any point where the hyper-surfaces of the compressed values intersect will yield a set of parameter values with likelihood equal to that at the peak near the true values.

1. The measurement of rotation curves (RCs) in disk galaxies is a powerful tool to study the nature of dark matter (DM) and its distribution relative to baryonic components. Dwarf galaxies are ideal candidates for this purpose due to their kinematics being dominated by DM even at small galactocentric radii.
2. A dwarf galaxy like the Orion dwarf can be used to test the compatibility of DM density profiles from cold dark matter (CDM) numerical simulations with those detected in actual DM halos around galaxies. The NFW profile, which arises from pure N-body DM simulations, is well-known to be affected by shallower profiles due to baryonic infall and stellar disk formation.
3. Recent studies show that kinematic data of dwarf galaxies are better fitted by a DM halo with a constant density core than by one that is centrally peaked. For example, DDO 47's velocity field is best fitted with a cored DM halo, and its small detected non-circular motions cannot account for the discrepancy between data and NFW predictions.
4. The Orion dwarf galaxy, a nearby system with an extended disk, is one of the few known galaxies whose kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored profile, making it critical for investigating the nature of DM particles and the evolution of DM halos.
5. The MOND scenario accounts for the inconsistency between RCs of spiral galaxies and the corresponding distribution of luminous matter without requiring the existence of a dark halo made by massive collisionless elementary particles.

For the Orion dwarf, 21-cm surface brightness and kinematics have been published, providing a high-quality, high-resolution RC that can be easily corrected for asymmetric drift and tested for non-circular motions.

1. Transverse spin fluctuations are important low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, and they play a crucial role in various macroscopic properties such as long-range order, order parameter magnitude, Néel temperature, and spin correlations. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are significant in both two and three dimensions, where they reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter and the Néel temperature in the strong-coupling limit.
2. Recently, there has been interest in spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in quantum antiferromagnets. In the random-tuned model, where the interaction is set to zero on a fraction of sites, the lattice-averaged AF order parameter is enhanced for small fractions due to the overall suppression of quantum spin fluctuations. However, strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies enhances spin fluctuations, leading to the formation of essentially empty and doubly-occupied sites that act like spin vacancies.
3. The problem of spin vacancies in quantum antiferromagnets is relevant to electron-doped materials, where spin-dilution behavior is observed. While the magnon energy renormalization due to spin vacancies has been addressed, the methods are limited to the low-concentration limit, and the vacancy-induced enhancement in transverse spin fluctuations has not been studied in the whole range of vacancy concentration.
4. A new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections has been developed, based on magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA). This method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: the pure model in different dimensions and spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit.

The RPA approach has been shown to properly interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity and to yield identical results as the spin-wave theory approach in the strong coupling limit for the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

3. Neutrino oscillation measurements have confirmed that neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses, potentially indicating Majorana-type masses. Many models have been proposed to explain tiny neutrino masses, with the seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) being two simple options.
4. However, these scenarios do not contain a DM candidate. In some models with higher-order perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained. In models referenced, the Yukawa couplings of neutrinos with the SM Higgs boson are forbidden at the tree level by imposing a Z2 parity.

2. Accurate and precise planetary radii are crucial for comprehending the distribution of planetary structures, especially when comparing planetary radii within a system or understanding the occurrence rates of ""rocky"" and ""non-rocky"" planets.
3. The Kepler pipeline and statistical studies assume that all host stars are single, but recent work suggests that a non-negligible fraction of Kepler host stars may be multiple stars, which can affect planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions.
4. Undetected stellar companions can lead to systematic uncertainties in planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions. For example, it was found that 30% of hot Jupiters were classified as smaller planets due to unaccounted effects of transit dilution from stellar companions.
5. The paper explores the effects of undetected stellar gravitationally bound companions on the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample, focusing on potential bound companions within a certain distance.
6. The study presents probabilistic uncertainties of planetary radii based on expected stellar multiplicity rates and companion sizes, showing that observed planetary radii will be systematically too small without spectroscopic or high-resolution imaging observations to vet companions.

1. The range of Hi column densities in 21-cm emission line observations of nearby galaxies is similar to those in damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs). Mapping the Hi gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission would provide a direct observational link between DLAs and local galaxies, but it is currently impossible due to the weak 21-cm line caused by the small transition probability.
2. The identification of DLAs as absorbers in background QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, and the lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground because the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to UV wavelengths. The redshift number density of DLAs decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts, making it difficult to find DLAs with 21-cm emission within the reach of present-day radio telescopes.
3. There are several hundreds of DLA absorption profiles at intermediate and high redshift, but little possibility to bridge these two sets of information with local galaxies. Most observers resort to optical wavelengths to study DLAs, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been mostly unsuccessful.
4. A few positive identifications of DLA host galaxies exist, mostly the result of HST imaging. The success rate for finding low-redshift DLA host galaxies is better because the host galaxies are expected to be brighter and the separation on the sky between the bright QSO and the DLA galaxy is likely larger.
5. Early surveys for low-redshift DLA host galaxies consisted of broadband imaging and lacked spectroscopic follow-up. Later studies aimed at measuring redshifts to determine the association of optically identified galaxies with DLAs, either spectroscopically or using photometric redshifts.

Not just luminous, high surface brightness spiral galaxies contribute to the Hi cross-section above the DLA threshold.

1. Stars are predominantly formed in star clusters, during the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds. Only a small fraction of the gas in these clouds is turned into stars, leaving a combination of gas and stars in the initial stages of a star cluster's life.
2. After the onset of stellar winds and supernova explosions, the gas within the embedded cluster is removed, causing a rapid change in the gravitational potential energy due to the loss of a significant fraction of the mass. This process, while well-understood theoretically, has received little attention in observational studies of young massive star clusters.
3. Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters. However, these studies have reported inconsistent results, with some finding non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs.
4. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, suggesting that the youngest clusters (tens of Myr) may not be in virial equilibrium, which undercuts the assumption of virial equilibrium needed for such studies.
5. The paper examines the detailed luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters, m82-f, ngc 1569-a, and ngc 1705-1, all in nearby starburst galaxies.

NGC 1569-a, however, appears to have a standard IMF based on dynamical measurements, but the study shows that this cluster is likely also out of equilibrium.

1. Quantum fluctuations can both suppress and enhance chaotic motion in wave packets in phase space, depending on the system. In kicked rotor systems, quantum fluctuations suppress chaotic motion due to quantum interference, while in kicked double-well models, they can enhance chaotic motion due to tunneling effects.
2. The relation between chaotic behavior and tunneling phenomena in classically chaotic systems is an important subject in quantum physics. Semiclassical descriptions for tunneling phenomena in classically chaotic systems have been developed by several groups.
3. Lin and Ballentine studied the interplay between tunneling and classical chaos for a particle in a double-well potential with an oscillatory driving force. They found that coherent tunneling takes place between small isolated classical stable regions of phase space, bounded by Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) surfaces.
4. Hänggi and coworkers studied chaos-suppressed tunneling in the driven double-well model in terms of the Floquet formalism. They found a one-dimensional manifold in the parameter space where tunneling is completely suppressed by the coherent driving.
5. The mutual influence of quantum coherence and classical chaos has been studied for many years, but the additional effects caused by coupling the chaotic system to other degrees of freedom (DOF) or an environment, namely decoherence and dissipation, have been studied less frequently.
6. Environment-induced quantum decoherence by coupling the quantum system to a reservoir has been studied since the mid-eighties. Recently, quantum dissipation due to the interaction with chaotic DOF has also been studied.
7. The paper investigates the relation between quantum fluctuation, tunneling, and decoherence combined with delocalization in wave packet dynamics in a one-dimensional double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field.

However, it also highlights the limitations of these models and suggests that other bath models, such as fermionic baths, may be essential for accurately describing certain physical and chemical processes.
2. The authors propose a stochastic formulation of quantum dissipation that incorporates bosonic, fermionic, and spin bath models. They introduce the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), which prescribes a simple yet general form of quantum dissipative dynamics when bath effects are modeled as colored noises. Different bath models and properties are distinguished by assigning distinct noise variables and associated statistics.
3. The text acknowledges the challenges of achieving stable convergences in stochastic simulations and notes that even for well-studied bosonic bath models, developing efficient stochastic simulation schemes remains an active research topic. The authors also mention their successful application of stochastic path integral simulations to calculate thermal distributions, absorption/emission spectra, and energy transfer.
4. The text concludes by discussing the potential of the stochastic formalism for developing numerical schemes that would be difficult to obtain within a strictly deterministic framework of open quantum theory. It also highlights the usefulness of the stochastic framework for computing dynamical quantities, such as system-bath joint observables, and deriving numerical schemes to deterministically simulate quantum dynamics for all three fundamental bath models.

1. Quantum fluctuations in electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that never vanishes, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources. In 1948, Casimir predicted that electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other due to a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation.
2. The force between the plates arises from the difference in zero-point energy when the plates are kept at close distance compared to when they are at infinite separation. Lifshitz, Dzyaloshinskii, and Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics, deriving an analytical formula for the force between uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions.
3. At very short distances, Lifshitz's theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force, while at larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction. The force between two plates made out of the same material is always attractive, but for slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the intervening medium.
4. Parsegian and Weiss derived an equation for the non-retarded van der Waals interaction energy between two dielectrically anisotropic plates immersed in a third anisotropic material. Barash analyzed a similar problem and found an equation for the Helmholtz free energy (per unit area) of the electromagnetic field in which retardation effects are included.
5. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been verified in several high-precision experiments, mainly focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum. However, less precise measurements in liquids and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids have also been reported.

2. Theories of quantum gravity, such as string theory, predict the existence of a minimum measurable length, also known as the Planck length, due to the breakdown of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle at high energies.
3. The generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is a proposed modification to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that takes into account the effects of quantum gravity.
4. The GUP can be formulated as a commutator relationship between position and momentum, which leads to a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum.
5. The GUP can be used to derive a modified energy-time uncertainty principle, which has implications for the behavior of particles at very high energies.
6. In a cosmological context, the GUP can affect the properties of the universe at very early times, such as the Planck time, by modifying the uncertainty principle for energy and time.

2. At weak coupling, these couplings can be evaluated order by order in perturbation theory by computing Feynman diagrams. However, this approach is unpractical for exact results of general operators. Integrability has shown promise in finding the spectrum of this theory, but its application to coupling computations remains unclear.
3. A strategy to compute couplings in a CFT is to deform the theory from its fixed point with a marginal or irrelevant operator. This deformation introduces new divergences, which can be used to determine the action of a matrix on operators diagonalized by the Bethe ansatz.

The duality relates the string partition function, computed with suitable boundary conditions, to the generating functional for correlation functions of the gauge theory.

1. Open dielectric resonators have received significant attention due to their applications as microlasers, sensors, and paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths. Semiclassical methods have been successful in treating wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength, providing approximate solutions in terms of the properties of the corresponding classical system. In the case of dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard where rays travel freely and are partially reflected and refracted when impinging on the boundary.
2. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture, such as the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries, are being investigated for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
3. One important tool in semiclassical physics is trace formulas, which relate the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system. A trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators has been developed and successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and polymer microlasers of various shapes.

However, typical microlasers are three-dimensional (3D) systems, and while trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators. The main difficulty lies in the numerical solution of the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities. In the case of flat microlasers, they are treated as 2D systems by introducing an effective index of refraction, an approximation that has been used in previous studies with good overall agreement between experiments and theory.

1. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is a well-studied phenomenon, but some issues like the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock remain subjects of debate. This backreaction occurs when the acceleration process becomes efficient enough to generate pressures comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure. This nonlinear phenomenon changes the spectrum of particles and the structure of the shock.
2. There are three main approaches to account for the backreaction: numerical simulations, fluid approach, and analytical methods. Numerical simulations allow self-consistent treatment of several effects, while the fluid approach treats cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, providing thermodynamics of modified shocks but not information about the spectrum of accelerated particles. Analytical methods, like the perturbative approach, can help understand nonlinear effects' physics.
3. The backreaction effects on the maximum achievable energy and geometry have been investigated, and a practical solution for the acceleration problem in the nonlinear regime was proposed. Recently, promising analytical solutions of nonlinear shock acceleration have appeared in the literature.
4. Numerical simulations have shown that even a small fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas can significantly affect the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid, making the test particle approach unsuitable. The most visible effects of backreaction appear in the spectrum of accelerated particles, which shows a peculiar flattening at the highest energies.
5. While several calculations exist for nonlinear effects in shock acceleration of quasi-monochromatic particles, there is no description of how these effects appear when the shock propagates in a medium with preaccelerated particles. The backreaction can severely affect the process of re-energization of preaccelerated particles.

2. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB accurately provides the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality. These quantities are robustly measured in the CMB, and only their ratio matters for the calculation, not the actual densities of matter and radiation.
3. If the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, the inferences for dark energy from the combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets remain unchanged. Knowledge of actual densities translates into improved constraints on the Hubble constant.
4. The acoustic peak method measures the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination. Nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination.
5. The sound horizon integral depends on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma. If we assume dark energy is sub-dominant, the sound horizon can be calculated using the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
6. The sound horizon depends on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, with only a prefactor determined by atomic physics, which is insensitive to cosmology. The baryon-to-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum.

1. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in neutrino masses due to experiments testing neutrino oscillations, such as Super Kamiokande's positive indications of atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Other experiments also show similar signs, while solar neutrino experiments have provided independent evidence for neutrino oscillations. Accelerator and reactor experiments have provided strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters.
2. The LSND experiment at Los Alamos reported evidence for oscillation, which, if confirmed, would imply the existence of light sterile neutrinos. New experimental results are expected to help determine neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles, which may shed light on the neutrino mass matrix and potentially lead to a more fundamental theory beyond the Standard Model.
3. Investigating plausible ansatze for the neutrino mass matrix is a useful approach to making progress in this highly speculative area. The authors propose an ansatz for the 3-generation neutrino mass matrix and explore its consequences. They consider neutrinos to be represented by 2-component spinors, making the mass matrix an arbitrary symmetric complex matrix.
4. This proposed equation can be motivated from an SO(10) grand unified model, where it may be derived with certain assumptions. Physically, it corresponds to the well-known approximate signature of grand unification. The authors show how this equation can be combined with experimental information to estimate neutrino masses and the ""texture"" of the mass matrix.
5. In the SO(10) grand unification model, each generation contains one light massive two-component neutrino and a very heavy one that is ""integrated out"" according to the ""seesaw mechanism."" The effective neutrino mass matrix takes the form of the sum of three matrices, with the second term typically considered to dominate. However, the authors assume the first term to be dominant, which is necessary for their derivation.
6. In SO(10), higgs mesons belonging to the 10, 120, and 126 representations can contribute to fermion masses at tree level. With the assumption that the first term in the mass matrix dominates, the authors derive a relationship between quark and lepton masses at a low energy scale.
7. To proceed, the authors make the further assumption that the matrices are hermitian, allowing them to bring the matrices to",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40}"

3. Epidemic models, such as SI and SIS, have been used to study the transmission dynamics of sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases.

7. The prevalence of diseases tends to stabilize at approximately the same level despite the addition of vertices, but increasing the number of edges of each vertex leads to an increase in the prevalence of the infection.
8. The networks generated using the MB algorithm presented the lowest values of prevalence in the spreading simulations for undirected networks, while the networks generated using the BA algorithm presented the lowest values of prevalence in the spreading simulations for directed networks.

1. The Levi-Civita (LC) spacetime, which describes the gravitational field of an infinite line mass, remains a challenge to interpret despite many works dedicated to its discussion.
2. The LC spacetime has two essential constants, one of which is related to the topology of spacetime and may be associated with the gravitational analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
3. The other constant, usually denoted as @xmath0, presents serious obstacles to interpretation, particularly for values outside the range (0, @xmath10).
4. It was suggested that LC describes the field of a cylinder only if @xmath0 ranges within the (0, @xmath10) interval, but interior solutions with @xmath16 exist, leading to a different interpretation.
5. Bonnor proposes to interpret LC as the spacetime generated by a cylinder whose radius increases with @xmath0 and tends to infinity as @xmath0 approaches @xmath11.
6. The anisotropic fluid matched to LC produces an effective mass per unit length with a maximum at @xmath20, which might explain the inexistence of horizons and support the acceleration representation of the field intensity.
7. The interpretation of the @xmath1 case as the field produced by an infinite plane with positive or negative mass density leads to an asymmetry: negative mass planes curve spacetime, while positive mass planes do not.

1. The hadronic final state of collisions at 200 GeV can serve as a reference for other high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC. However, current theoretical and experimental descriptions of these collisions are incomplete, with several unresolved aspects.
2. The role of collision centrality in relation to the low-x gluon transverse structure of the proton, the nature and systematics of the underlying event (UE), the systematics of minimum-bias dijet (minijet) production, and the existence and phenomenology of a nonjet azimuth quadrupole component in 2D angular correlations are notable unresolved aspects.
3. A more complete mathematical model for phenomenology based on the pT dependence of single-particle (SP) spectra and -integral densities and -integral 2D angular correlations has been established.
4. The study investigates the connection between pT and centrality, the relevance of centrality as a concept, and the presence of a nonjet (nj) quadrupole component in collisions.
5. The phenomenological model should provide a conceptual context as both a mathematical framework to represent data systematics efficiently and a theoretical framework to offer physical interpretation of model elements via comparisons between data structures and QCD theory.

1. The principle of quantum superposition is crucial in quantum mechanics, with the preservation and destruction of these superpositions being central to issues like the quantum-to-classical transition and potential applications in quantum information, computation, and cryptography.
2. The loss of coherence in quantum systems is due to environmental action, which has been mathematically treated using tracing-out methods and axiomatic approaches to derive master equations.
3. Most master equations satisfy the Markov approximation and can be put into the Lindblad form, which includes the system's Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators that represent the environment's effect.
4. The paper introduces a novel attempt to derive master equations in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes using stochastic methods and operator techniques.
5. The main idea is to build random evolution operators with stochastic parameters, take the stochastic expectation value, and show that any Lindblad-type master equation with self-adjoint Lindblad operators can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution.
6. This approach has consequences for solving master equations, attaining both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes under the same mathematical formalism, and generalizing intrinsic decoherence models.

1. Left-handed metamaterials (LH) are a new class of artificial materials with negative indices of refraction for certain wavelengths, offering various applications in modern optics and microelectronics. They can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, or yield slow light propagation.
2. In disordered systems, the presence of negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) disordered metamaterials suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths. This has been observed by Et al., who reported a sixth power dependence of the localization length with wavelength under refractive-index disorder.
3. Mogilevtsev et al. and Torres-Herra et al. have also found a suppression of Anderson localization of light in 1D disordered metamaterials, combining oblique incidence and dispersion, and developed a fourth-order perturbation theory for non-conventional Anderson localization in bilayered periodic-on-average structures.
4. The effects of polarization and oblique incidence on light propagation in disordered metamaterials have been studied, and the localization length of light has been calculated numerically for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with varying refractive indices and thicknesses, introducing disorder by changing the position of the layer boundaries.

1. The concordance cosmological model, which is consistent with various observational data, suggests that only 4% of the total mass-energy is ordinary matter, which includes stars, gas, galaxies, etc. This is derived from primordial nucleosynthesis of light elements and measurements of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.
2. There is 23% of non-baryonic dark matter, of an unknown nature, and the remaining 73% is in the form of a mysterious dark energy. Dark energy is revealed by the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae and is thought to be a constant cosmological constant.
3. Dark matter is crucial in explaining the difference between the dynamic mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of visible matter. It also plays a significant role in the formation of large structures by gravitationally attracting ordinary matter.
4. For this to be possible, dark matter must be non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation, known as cold dark matter (CDM). The associated particle is called a WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle).
5. There is no explanation for dark matter or dark energy in the context of the Standard Model of particle physics. However, extensions to the Standard Model propose plausible candidates for dark matter particles.
6. Dark energy appears as a constant energy density throughout expansion, implying a violation of ""energy conditions"" with negative pressure. It could be the famous cosmological constant that Einstein introduced in the equations of general relativity to obtain a static universe.
7. Despite the unknown origin of its constituents, the CDM model is successful in precisely fitting CMB fluctuations and reproducing large-scale structures. This suggests that dark matter manifests as particles, possibly WIMPs, on a large scale.
8. Dark matter significantly influences galaxy dynamics, as seen in the flat rotation curves of galaxies. This requires a massive, invisible halo of dark matter surrounding galaxies.
9. Simulations of CDM on a galactic scale predict a universal halo profile for dark matter. However, there are issues with the formation of a large number of satellite galaxies and the Tully-Fisher law, which is not naturally explained.

1. Long chain macromolecules, or polymers, have been extensively studied due to their ubiquity in nature and significance in biological systems. While the physical properties of homopolymers are well understood, less is known about heteropolymers, which are of greater interest to biologists because they exhibit specific properties determined by their unique sequences. These sequences code for the genetic information that is translated into amino acid chains, and the resulting protein's shape and activity are determined by the interactions between these amino acids.
2. The energy of a polymer is influenced by various interactions, including van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, and Coulomb interactions. The protein folds into a specific shape based on these interactions, which is crucial for its function. However, determining the configuration of a particular molecule is a challenging task due to the large number of monomers and the complexity of their interactions.
3. Physicists and biologists approach the study of polymers differently. Physicists often simplify models to understand general principles, while biologists focus on the specific properties of individual molecules. Statistical descriptions of ensembles of molecules with random linear sequences and various interactions can provide valuable insights into the behavior of heteropolymers.
4. The overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups are primarily controlled by Coulomb interactions, which are the strongest and longest-range interactions. A polyampholyte (PA) is a flexible chain in which each monomer has a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches. The long-range nature of the Coulomb interactions, combined with the randomness of the charge sequence, produces effects distinct from systems with short-range interactions.
5. Previous studies have shown that PAs undergo a transition from a dense (``globular'') to a strongly stretched configuration as the charge excess exceeds a critical value. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been performed to study this transition, but they could not provide information on the energy spectrum of PAs and their very low-temperature properties. In this work, a complete enumeration study of PAs for all possible quenches up to a certain length is conducted, providing detailed results on energetics and spatial conformations of short PAs.

A closed graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow, and these conditions are independent of each other. A labeling on a graph is closed if and only if all shortest paths from a vertex to another are directed. The neighborhood of a vertex in a labeled graph is a disjoint union of complete graphs, and a labeling is closed if and only if the intersection of two neighborhoods is complete.
2. A longest shortest path in a connected graph is a shortest path between two vertices that are farthest apart. A connected graph is narrow if every vertex is distance at most one from every longest shortest path. Closed graphs are narrow, and a graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow.
3. The labeling algorithm assigns a label to the endpoint of a longest shortest path with minimal degree and then labels the remaining vertices in order of increasing number of edges connected to unlabeled vertices. Each layer of the graph, consisting of vertices at the same distance from the vertex 1, is complete. If two vertices are in the same layer and are connected by a path in a later layer, then they are adjacent.

If two vertices are in the same layer and are connected by a path in a later layer, then they are adjacent. The diameter of a graph with a closed labeling is the largest integer such that there is a vertex at distance from the vertex 1.

1. The concept of parity time symmetric systems was introduced as an alternative to standard quantum theory, with the potential to give real spectra using non-hermitian Hamiltonians. This idea has been experimentally realized in optical waveguiding arrays, where gain and loss can be balanced to create complex potentials. These systems can exhibit stable solitons, including exact solutions, and have been implemented in both optical and electronic settings.

2. The stability of solitons in 2D periodic potentials has been studied, and the possibility of creating 2D arrays of optical waveguides with 2D plaquettes has been proposed. These plaquettes would be inspired by earlier works on 2D Hamiltonian lattices and would be accessible with current experimental techniques. The plaquettes would be analyzed for stationary states supported by the system, with a focus on those modes that can be found in an analytical form.

3. The paper also discusses the interplay of linear systems with nonlinear effects, as well as the existence, stability, and dynamical fate of nonlinear states in the presence of parity time symmetric perturbations. The symmetry properties of the system are analyzed using techniques from nonlinear dynamical systems with symmetry preservation. The time reversal operation is defined as the combined action of scalar-type complex conjugation and the sign change of time, and plaquette-dependent parity operators are conjectured to render the Hamiltonians symmetric.

1. Hu Aqr is a cataclysmic variable (CV) consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence companion star, with two planets orbiting the binary system. The two planets were discovered through irregularities in the observed-calculated variations of the CV, and were found to have masses of 5.7 and 7.6, and eccentric orbits with semi-major axes of 2.8 x 10^(-2) AU and 5.6 x 10^(-2) AU, respectively. However, numerical simulations have shown that this two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year timescale.
2. The presence of planets around a CV is peculiar, but they may be a natural consequence of binary formation or common in CV systems. The discovery of planets in CV systems can provide valuable insights into CV evolution and history.
3. The inner planet in the Hu Aqr system allows for the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and core mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) to be broken, enabling the calculation of the rate of mass loss during the common-envelope phase. The outer planet validates this calculation and provides information on the conditions under which the CV was born.
4. The common-envelope phase causes the reduction of the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude and the ejection of the hydrogen envelope of the primary star. The mass and composition of the white dwarf limit the mass and evolutionary phase of its progenitor star at the moment of RLOF.
5. The presence of a planet in a CV system offers unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and evolution of the system. The planet's survival in the turbulent past of the CV provides information on the mass loss and orbital separation during the common-envelope phase.

1. The No-Core Shell Model with Resonating Group Method (NCSM/RGM) is a microscopic cluster approach that has been successful in treating structures and reactions in light nuclear systems using realistic interactions and a consistent description of nucleon clusters. However, the current two-body cluster approach cannot properly describe three-body cluster states, which are essential for studying nuclear systems with such configurations.
2. Three-body cluster configurations have been introduced into the NCSM/RGM method, and preliminary results for the ground state and continuum states of 1he within a 2he+n+n basis have been presented. The extension of the NCSM/RGM approach to properly describe three-cluster configurations involves expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states built from the NCSM wave function of each of the three clusters.
3. The microscopic Schrödinger equation is projected onto the basis states, mapping the many-body problem onto a system of coupled-channel integral-differential equations in the hyper-radial coordinate. These equations are then solved using the microscopic R-matrix method on a Lagrange mesh.
4. The NCSM/RGM method has been applied to study the three-cluster systems formed by two separate nucleons in relative motion with respect to a nucleus of mass number A. The lightest borromean nucleus, 3he, is an ideal candidate for this approach, as it is formed by an 2he core and two halo neutrons.
5. The 2he core is described only by its ground state wave function, and similarity-renormalization-group evolved potentials obtained from the chiral NNLO nn interaction with λ=1.5 fm−1 are used. The set of equations is solved for different channels using both bound and continuum asymptotic conditions.
6. The NCSM/RGM method provides wave functions with appropriate asymptotic behavior, which is essential for describing the continuum states of 1he. The method has been successful in obtaining the experimentally well-known 43 resonance and a second low-lying 44 resonance recently measured at GANIL.

1. Ai3, a layered organic material, has recently regained interest due to the discovery of low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure. It differs from graphene and three-dimensional topological insulators in several ways, including the tilt of Dirac cones, anisotropy in the Fermi surface, smaller average Fermi velocity, and the presence of additional massive carriers near the Fermi level.
2. The effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions is expected to be ten times larger in ai3 than in graphene, indicating the relevance of electronic correlations. This makes ai3 an exciting prospect for studying strongly-correlated Dirac fermions that are beyond the scope of graphene electrons.
3. Recent band-structure calculations suggest the interplay between massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers, but this has not been proven experimentally yet. Magneto-transport measurements under hydrostatic pressure larger than 3 GPa reveal the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes, with scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.
4. The analysis of data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity, which is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor. In a single carrier system, its analytical expression reads where q is the electron charge, μ is the mobility, and n is the carrier density.
5. In a two-carrier system, the contributions of each carrier type can be added to obtain the total magneto-conductivity. The two ""plateaus"" in the magneto-conductivity curve indicate the existence of two different carrier types with significantly different mobilities. From this curve, the mobilities, zero-field conductivities, and carrier densities for each carrier type can be extracted.
6. The strong temperature dependence of the carrier density suggests that temperature is higher than the Fermi temperature for both a and b carriers even at the lowest measured temperature. This low Fermi temperature hints at the absence of charge inhomogeneities that prevent the approach of the Dirac point in graphene on SiO2 substrates.

3. The Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the Γ point and two electron sheets around the M and X points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
4. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure. The RPA-SF approach gives an extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets as the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations.
5. Orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have sign-preserving s-wave symmetry. Probing the gap structure can help elucidate the underlying mechanism.

1. The presence of impurities can significantly alter the spectrum and coherence of a quantum system, which in turn affects its transport properties. In the absence of interactions, if the impurity distribution is completely random, all states of the system are exponentially localized in 1D and 2D, while a mobility edge exists in 3D.
2. If the impurity positions are correlated, some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum. This has been demonstrated in 1D using the random dimer model (RDM) and the dual random dimer model (DRDM). The effects of correlated disorder have been studied in various physical contexts in 1D. However, the effect of correlations in 2D is not well-explored, except for the case of a speckle potential and for the case of pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions.
3. Correlations in speckle potentials can mimic the presence of a mobility edge, but in the thermodynamic limit, all states are localized. Random dimers introduce a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2D lattices, as in 1D. From a statistical point of view, the main difference between these two models is the decay of the correlation function, which is algebraic for the first and exponential for the second.
4. In interacting systems, the presence of disordered impurities gives rise to a remarkable richness of phenomena. For instance, the condensate and the superfluid fraction are modified by the presence of disorder, which can shift the onset of superfluidity and induce exotic phases such as the Bose glass.
5. In this work, the authors study the effect of a short-range correlated disorder on a Bose gas confined on a 2D square lattice. They introduce a 2D generalization of the DRDM (2D-DRDM), where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites.
6. Using a decimation and renormalization procedure, they show that, in the non-interacting regime, there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized.

1. The discovery of the accelerating expanding universe has led to increased attention on modified theories of gravity, which aim to explain the role of dark energy. Lovelock gravity is a direct generalization of General Relativity in higher dimensions and is a promising scenario for exploring dark energy. The Gauss-Bonnet invariant, a quadratic curvature invariant, is a topological term in 4-dimensions but can be used to discuss the dynamics of the Lovelock gravity in 4-dimensions by coupling it with a scalar field or adding a generic function in the Einstein-Hilbert action.
2. The curvature-matter coupling in modified theories of gravity yields a non-zero covariant divergence of the energy-momentum tensor and causes massive test particles to follow non-geodesic trajectories. The reconstruction and stability of cosmic evolutionary models in modified theories of gravity are important issues in cosmology, with the reconstruction technique used to find the corresponding function that reproduces a given evolutionary cosmic history, and stability analysis examining the background stability as time evolves.

The paper reconstructs various cosmological models, including de Sitter universe, power-law solutions, phantom or non-phantom eras, and ΛCDM model, in a specific modified theory of gravity (denoted as 𝒢_𝑚𝑚 gravity) and analyzes the stability against linear homogeneous perturbations for de Sitter and power-law solutions. The action for 𝒢_𝑚𝑚 gravity is defined in terms of a coupling constant, the determinant of the metric tensor, and the Lagrangian associated with matter distribution, and the field equations are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric tensor.

1. Majorana fermions (MFs) are particles that are their own antiparticles and can occur as quasiparticle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems. They obey non-Abelian statistics, making them promising for decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.
2. MFs have been proposed to be hosted in various solid-state systems, including topological superconductors, topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains. These systems are based on the superconducting proximity effect, which allows MFs to exist at the ends of these materials.
3. Experimentally observing MFs is challenging due to the similarity of their signatures with other mechanisms, such as the Kondo resonance and disorder in semiconductor nanowires. Additionally, Andreev bound states in a magnetic field can also exhibit similar conductance features.
4. Most experimental evidence for MFs relies on tunneling conductance measurements, which can be problematic due to the other mechanisms that can produce similar signatures. Therefore, alternative detection methods are necessary to confirm the existence of MFs.
5. Here, an all-optical scheme to detect MFs is proposed, which utilizes quantum dots (QDs) and nanomechanical resonators (NRS) to enhance the coherent optical properties of the system. The QD is modeled as a two-level system, and the NRS is characterized by a quantum harmonic oscillator.

The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from a companion star, increasing its mass until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes. Recent progress in the accreting WD model includes the introduction of stellar wind from the WD, which helps sustain stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
3. There are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. These paths predict which companion stars lead to SNe Ia. However, this evolutionary scenario has not been confirmed by observations, which would require the identification of the companion star remaining near the explosion site.
4. A group claimed to have identified a G2IV star as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) by measuring the velocities and distances of stars near the SNR's center. They argued that this G2IV star was moving much faster than neighboring stars and that its distance seemed consistent with the distance to Tycho's SNR. However, this identification is contested, as the observed velocity of the star could correspond to the velocity of thick disk stars in the vicinity, and the likelihood of such a star being present is low.

1. Quantum entanglement is a feature of quantum mechanics that has captured recent interest due to its essential role in quantum information processing. It can be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization and obeys a set of conservation laws, making it useful for quantitative predictions. When one has complete information about a bipartite system, the state of the system is pure and there exists a well-established measure of entanglement, the entropy of entanglement. However, when quantum systems interact with their environment, states become mixed and the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear.
2. Given an ensemble of pure states with probabilities, a natural generalization of the entropy of entanglement is its weighted average. However, a difficulty arises when considering that a given density operator may be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for this average entanglement. Various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem, such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation, which satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure.
3. The entanglement of formation is defined as the minimal amount of entanglement required to form the density operator, while the entanglement of distillation is the guaranteed amount of entanglement that can be extracted from the density operator. These measures give the value zero for certain states, which might be counterintuitive, but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state. An interacting system and environment inevitably become entangled, making the problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment.
4. To characterize the entanglement in an unambiguous fashion, quantum trajectory theory can be used to describe the system by a pure state dependent on the counting histories of detectors. Within quantum trajectory theory, the evolution of the system is described by a pure state that evolves under a non-hermitian effective hamiltonian, interrupted at random times by quantum jumps. The jump operators account for the reduction of the state of the system, given a photon count is recorded by a detector. Thus, given the history of detector clicks, one has complete information about the system state, allowing for the characterization of the entanglement in an unambiguous manner.

1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are classified as Type 1 or Type 2 based on the presence or absence of broad emission lines, which is attributed to orientation-dependent circumnuclear obscuration by a dust torus. This torus absorbs UV/optical radiation and re-emits it in the infrared. Type 1 AGN show stronger near-IR emission than Type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity due to the face-on view of the torus exposing the innermost hot dust.
2. Forming isotropic AGN samples based on IR fluxes may result in a significant bias towards Type 1 AGN due to the anisotropy in IR emission. The wavelength dependence of this anisotropy can help distinguish between smooth and cloud-based torus models. High-spatial resolution observations or using high-luminosity objects can mitigate host galaxy contributions to the IR.
3. The paper uses a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared. Host-galaxy subtraction and clumpy torus models are employed for improved analysis.
4. The paper finds that the radio galaxies have systematically lower infrared emission than quasars, and this difference is most significant in the near-IR, reflecting a difference in line-of-sight extinction or anisotropy in re-emission of AGN-heated dust. A single extinction law does not fully explain the observed anisotropy, suggesting the need for a more complex model, such as radiative transfer within the torus.
5. The authors argue that the observed IR anisotropy is likely caused by the dust torus, and isotropic and complete sample selection helps minimize biasing effects on the anisotropy. However, optically- and X-ray-selected samples often miss highly obscured objects, and flux-limited mid-IR selected samples may still suffer from biases towards Type 1 AGN.

Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has seen advancements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, with practical systems like fiber-based Gaussian-modulated and discrete-modulated coherent-state protocols demonstrated over tens of kilometers. The unconditional security of these systems has been confirmed through the security analysis of equivalent entanglement-based schemes. However, the traditional security analysis of the entanglement-based scheme in CVQKD only considers the signal beam, leaving security loopholes as the local oscillator (LO), an auxiliary light beam, is also within the eavesdropper's (Eve's) manipulation domain.
2. The fluctuations of LO intensity can affect the secret key rate in CVQKD systems. In practical implementations, shot noise scaling with LO power is assumed to remain constant, even when fluctuations are small. This assumption can give Eve an advantage in exploiting LO intensity fluctuations. By monitoring LO intensity and scaling measurements with instantaneous LO intensity values, the secret key rate compromise caused by LO intensity fluctuations can be avoided.
3. In CVQKD systems, eavesdropping attacks such as the LO intensity attack (LOIA) can be employed by Eve to intercept and replace the quantum channel between Alice and Bob, reducing the intensity of LO with a variable attenuator. This attack can partially hide Eve's presence and allow her to get partial secret keys that Alice and Bob hold without being detected.
4. To ensure the security of CVQKD systems, it is crucial to monitor LO intensity fluctuations accurately and scale measurements with instantaneous intensity values. Using the average intensity value of LO to normalize measurements can overestimate the secret key rate, while very small fluctuations in LO intensity might compromise the secret key rate completely for reverse reconciliation communication over long distances.

These are interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like or circular appearance and persistence over a wide velocity range.
3. The two main classes of explanations for supershells propose their kinetic energy source to be internal (starbursts, stellar winds, and supernova explosions) or external (infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane).
4. The internal source model, such as the chimney model, attributes disk-halo features and other halo gas to underlying star formation processes. Extraplanar Hα filaments and star-forming regions in NGC 891 support such models.
5. The main difficulty with the starburst model for Hi supershells lies in the required input energies for the largest shells, which often need staggering numbers of supernova events. Evidence against star formation processes creating Hi shells includes the absence of optical evidence, X-ray and FUV emission, and the lack of relation between Hi shells and star formation.

The principal eigenpair (λ, u) of the Dirichlet problem for the operator L = Δ + X is also discussed.
2. The main theorem asserts that λ remains bounded as t → ∞ if and only if there exists a first integral v of X (a solution to a certain equation) such that v and X.v are both in L^2(Ω). This result can be interpreted as functions constant along the flow of X having non-trivial first integrals, allowing for flow lines contained in Ω, while the absence of such first integrals results in the flow leaving Ω with speed proportional to X.
3. The addition of the Laplacian to X results in a stochastic process with gradually departing trajectories from the integral curves of X. If non-trivial first integrals exist, the trajectories may remain in Ω with positive probability during a finite time interval, leading to a non-trivial limiting transition mechanism between flow lines.

1. Inferring macroscopic properties of physical systems from their microscopic description is an active area of research in various fields of physics, including condensed matter, ultra-cold atoms, and quantum chromodynamics.
2. Phase transitions, often involving symmetry-breaking processes, result in significant changes in the macroscopic properties of physical systems.
3. Landau formulated the theory of phase transitions using a phenomenological model, which was later derived from microscopic principles using the renormalization group.
4. Order parameters, which are zero in the disordered phase and nonzero in the ordered phase, are used to identify phases in many known models.
5. However, there are states of matter, such as topological states, where order parameters can only be defined in a complex, non-local way.
6. Machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, have shown promise in identifying parameters capable of describing phase transitions in these complex systems.
7. Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as principal component analysis and variational autoencoders, have been used to reproduce Monte Carlo-sampled states of the Ising model and identify phase transitions.
8. The authors propose using unsupervised learning to determine phase transitions without any information about the microscopic theory or the order parameter, and demonstrate this approach using the Ising model and the xy model.

Colloidal crystals have the potential to create novel materials through self-assembly, with unique optical properties that can generate iridescent colors and serve as a means to produce photonic crystals. They have a wide range of applications, including lasers and display devices, and recent advances have demonstrated tunable colors through control of lattice spacing with an external field. Additionally, colloidal crystals can serve as mesoscopic ""model atoms"" for studying condensed matter due to their well-defined thermodynamic temperature. The ability to tune colloid-colloid interactions has led to the observation of a variety of structures, including exotic crystal structures not observed in atomic and molecular systems, and direct observation of phase transitions.
2. A rotating AC field can induce dipolar interactions between colloidal particles, leading to anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures. Studies with a rotating magnetic field on granular matter have produced disc-like patterns, and similar structures may be obtained in colloidal dispersions, which exhibit Brownian motion and can form thermodynamic equilibrium structures (i.e., crystals) in situ. The interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field may be treated to first order as a circularly symmetric attraction, and a one-component picture can be used to describe the equilibrium behavior of the colloids in the original multi-component system. However, the asymmetry between the colloids and smaller molecular and ionic species must be addressed, which can be done through coarse-graining schemes that integrate out the smaller components and reduce the complexity of the description.

The attractive potential between the colloids resulting from the rotating AC electric field is treated to first order as a dipolar interaction, and the electrostatic repulsions may be expressed as a hard core Yukawa or screened Coulomb interaction.

However, a potential of the Yukawa form is recovered at larger separations if a smaller, renormalized charge is considered.

The large variations in accretion rate in SXRTs allow for the study of regimes inaccessible to LMXRBs. While SXRTs are powered by accretion during outbursts, the origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in the quiescent state remains unclear. A possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) turns on during the quiescent state of SXRTs, providing a link between LMXRBs and recycled MSps.

Example: The most active SXRT known, Aql X-1, has experienced more than 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts. Its companion star is the K1V variable star V1333 Aql with an orbital period of 19 hours.

2. Aql X-1 outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with type I X-ray bursts discovered during the declining phase, indicating the presence of a neutron star. The X-ray spectrum is soft near the outburst maximum, transitioning to a power law with a harder photon index during the decay phase. In quiescence, the spectrum is softer and consistent with a blackbody temperature.

Example: BEPPOSAX narrow field instrument observations during the outburst decay revealed a sharp decrease in luminosity, which was well-described by an exponential decay with a folding time of ~2.7 days.

Models of low-mass X-ray transient outbursts hosting an old neutron star or black hole are built in analogy with dwarf novae outbursts, but important differences exist, particularly in the steepening of the X-ray flux decrease.

The supernova was detected after its peak, but an upper limit of its magnitude was obtained 208 days before discovery. An optical transient was also reported in 2004, close to the position of SN 2006jc, with a bright blue continuum observed in its optical spectrum at early epochs.
2. The red wing brightened as the blue continuum declined, resulting in ""U""-like shapes in the optical spectra, which is a distinguishing feature of SN 2006jc compared to usual supernovae. Photometric observations in optical and infrared (IR) bands were performed continuously, showing a rapid decline in the optical light curve (LC) and a brightening in the near-IR (NIR) emissions.
3. The NIR brightening, as well as the fact that the redder side of the He emission profile declined faster than the bluer side, has been interpreted as evidence of ongoing dust formation. The Akari satellite and the Magnum telescope reported the formation of amorphous carbon dust, providing further evidence of dust formation.
4. X-ray and UV emissions were observed by the Swift and Chandra satellites, while radio emission was not detected by the Very Large Array (VLA). A SN explosion model of a Wolf-Rayet star was presented, explaining the bolometric and X-ray LCs.

This law allows for the determination of extinction in one spectral region based on the extinction in another, given the knowledge of R(V).

Grover's algorithm can search an unsorted database with a quadratic advantage over classical methods. It has been realized in various physical systems, including superconducting qubits and cavity QED systems.

Superconducting qubit-cavity QED systems are attractive for quantum information processing due to strong coupling limits. SQUIDs, a type of superconducting qubit, have shown promise in implementing Grover's algorithm. Researchers have demonstrated two-qubit Grover and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms, as well as three-qubit entanglement, using superconducting qubits.

2. The goal of the research described is to implement a three-qubit Grover search algorithm using four-level SQUIDs in a cavity-QED system. The team considers a three-qubit phase gate, which reduces the number of quantum gates required for Grover's algorithm implementation. The three-qubit Grover search is probabilistic, requiring multiple iterations to achieve high success probability.

The proposed scheme uses resonant and off-resonant interactions between the cavity field and SQUID transitions, along with resonant microwave pulses. This approach eliminates the need for level spacing adjustments, reducing decoherence. The scheme also relaxes requirements for identical coupling constants and direct coupling between specific levels.

3. Grover's iterations are made faster through resonant and off-resonant interactions, and the implementation is simplified using a three-qubit quantum phase gate. This method reduces the possibility of error compared to using a series of two-qubit gates. The team also considers the effects of spontaneous decay and cavity field decay during the implementation of Grover's iterations.

1. In the 1970s, many-body theory flourished, with many researchers focusing on many-body effects on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra from deep core levels in metals.
2. Related effects included singularities near edges in absorption and emission spectra, caused by conduction-band (CB) electrons having various effects on the XPS peak from the core level.
3. If the excitation is adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by CB electrons leads to a shift in the peak to higher kinetic energy (lower binding energy of the core level).
4. However, if the excitation is swift and non-adiabatic, the CB electrons are left in a non-equilibrium state, leading to shake-up effects that show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum.
5. In a metal, the shake-up effects result in plasmon replicas at shifted positions to lower kinetic energy, where the shift is equal to the plasma frequency.
6. Single-particle excitations can also take place, leading to a deformation and low-energy tail of both the main peak and the plasmon replicas.

1. The phase-field method is a popular tool for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity, which avoids tracking moving interfaces or grain boundaries by describing geometry in terms of phase fields. These phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded using standard numerical methods.
2. Despite the widespread use of phase-field modeling, there are still open fundamental questions and challenges that need to be addressed. This paper discusses three such topics: the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification, and the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in phase-field equations for nucleation processes.
3. In the thin-interface limit, currently available approaches cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness. This limitation poses challenges for straightforward computations, as the detailed properties of phase-field equations may not be immediately apparent and require mathematical analysis.
4. Orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification often use a standard equation of motion that is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter. This inconsistency can lead to inaccurate simulations, particularly when considering the alloy version of the model.
5. Including microscopic fluctuations in phase-field equations is essential for investigating nucleation processes. However, the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way, as it may not accurately capture the nuances of nucleation.
6. The characteristic feature of the phase-field method is that its equations can often be written down intuitively, but their detailed properties may not be immediately apparent. This makes it challenging to perceive the limits of applicability of the method.
7. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been significantly enhanced in the last decade, but controlling physical effects due to diffuse interfaces remains crucial. The thin-interface limit procedure is used to analyze the equations of the phase-field model under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale.

1. The fundamental atmospheric and physical parameters of stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and age, are crucial for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group. With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys like SEGUE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO, and HERMES, these parameters are used to infer the characteristics of different populations of stars in the Milky Way. Stellar parameters determined by spectroscopic methods are of key importance, as they provide a more accurate measurement of metallicity compared to photometric calibrations and are not affected by reddening.

2. A common method for deriving spectroscopic atmospheric parameters is by using the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and local thermodynamic equilibrium. However, both observational and theoretical evidence suggest that systematic biases are present in such analyses due to the breakdown of the assumption of LTE. Recent studies have quantified the effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) on the determination of surface gravity and metallicity, revealing substantial systematic biases at low metallicity and/or surface gravity. Developing sophisticated methods to reconcile these effects is essential for deriving accurate spectroscopic parameters, which is the focus of a series of papers, including the one in question.

Weak gravitational lensing, a phenomenon caused by the bending of light around massive structures, has been detected in various samples of high-redshift quasars (QSOs), intermediate-redshift galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It can manifest as angular correlations between these sources and foreground mass inhomogeneities or as a coherent shear effect in the case of galaxies.

2. Another way to detect weak lensing is through the use of fluxes of standard candles, such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). If the observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen as brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess and fainter ones having mass deficits in their foregrounds.

DNA loop formation is crucial for genetic expression, replication, and recombination. For example, in E. coli, the Lac repressor-mediated loop is important for the repressive regulation of Lac genes. Hairpin loop formation is the elementary step in protein folding and structure formation in RNA folding. A cell is crowded with various subcellular structures, and DNA is constantly interacting with them. DNA fragment looping is subject to temporally fluctuating forces due to its dynamic environment.
2. Recent experiments have shown that the power spectrum of the fluctuating force exerted on the cytoskeleton is an order of magnitude larger than expected from thermal equilibrium conditions, indicating that the cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium. Single molecule experiment techniques have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation. For instance, Finzi and Gelles observed Lac repressor-mediated DNA loop formation and dissociation by monitoring nanoscale Brownian motion of a micron-sized particle attached to one end of the DNA.
3. Theoretically, Yan et al. developed a transfer matrix method to calculate the semiflexible polymer end-to-end distance distribution function and loop formation probability. They studied various effects of nonlinear elasticity arising from DNA bending protein-induced kinks or thermal fluctuation-induced bubbles on the loop formation probability. Their study provides valuable insights into DNA bending on short length scales.
4. Blumberg et al. studied the effects of static tension on protein-mediated DNA loop formation by modeling the DNA conformation to be in either looped or unlooped states. They found that for loop sizes larger than 100 base pair distances, a tension of 0.5 pN can increase the looping time by more than two orders of magnitude. However, there is room for improvement in their approach, such as evaluating the free energy for short end-to-end distances and describing detailed kinetic processes using the mean first-passage time approach.

1. The cell is often characterized as a viscoelastic body in studies of cell mechanics and dynamics. Researchers have sought to understand the mechanical behavior of cells in terms of simple polymer physics models, such as pure actin solutions or crosslinked actin networks. The glassy wormlike chain (GWC) model, which is a phenomenological extension of the standard model of semiflexible polymers, has been successful in describing a wide range of rheological data for polymer solutions and living cells over many decades with a minimum of parameters. However, recent investigations have highlighted the glassy, fragile, and inelastic character of the mechanical response of living cells.
2. Researchers have developed various phenomenological mathematical descriptions to understand the mechanical behavior of cells, including approaches related to the tube model, tensegrity-based approaches, effective-medium models, and others. These models have been primarily concerned with viscoelastic behavior, but recent studies have shown that living cells exhibit more complex mechanical responses, such as glassy, fragile, and inelastic behavior. Experiments operating in the nonlinear regime have had to use special protocols to minimize plastic flow and make contact with dedicated theoretical models.
3. The present contribution aims to extend the GWC model to situations involving inelastic deformations. The authors focus on reversible inelastic behavior, where the deformation does not alter the microscopic ground state. They propose a theoretical framework for a polymer-based description of the inelastic nonlinear mechanical behavior of sticky biopolymer networks. The framework represents the polymer network on a mean-field level by a test polymer described by the GWC model and allows for a dynamically evolving thermodynamic state variable characterizing the network of thermo-reversible sticky bonds. The theory predicts a pronounced fluidization response that develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers.

1. Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with non-trivial topological invariants and robust surface metallic states, typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction. However, all known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements, which poses constraints on the search for topological materials. A proposed solution is to generate effective spin-orbit couplings from ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons.
2. An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been proposed to generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI). However, realizing this proposed topological phase in real materials or simple theoretical models has been challenging due to competing orders and quantum fluctuations.
3. A study found that reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones tends to stabilize the TMI in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. By suppressing the Fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the TMI emerges in an extended parameter region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking even when many-body and quantum fluctuations are taken into account.

1. Graphene has attracted interest from various communities, including those working on atomic scale circuit devices and those searching for new topological phases. Both communities have sought to gap the massless Dirac spectrum in graphene. The realization of a gate-induced band gap in Bernal stacked bi-layer graphene has brought the holy grail of graphene-based transistors one step closer to reality. However, the sub-gap conductance measured in this gapped bilayer, which has weak temperature dependence and is large compared to the optically measured gap, has introduced a new puzzle and obstacle.
2. The gapped bilayer is not as insulating as it should be, and dominant transport along the physical edge of the samples proposed earlier has been ruled out by Corbino geometry measurements. These measurements observed two-dimensional variable range hopping type temperature dependence, independent of geometry. A new paper proposes the existence of a topological gapless channel of transport along a recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary network.
3. This predicted topological edge state holds the promise of the first realization of a topological surface(edge) state hosted by a structural topological defect. Although there has been much theoretical interest in topological gapless modes hosted by structural topological defects, no such topological gapless mode has been observed so far. Lattice dislocations in three-dimensional crystals, which occur deep in the sample and are not directly accessible, have been previously discussed.
4. However, the tilt boundary of interest has recently been observed. This structural topological line defect along which each neighboring layer is displaced by one inter-atomic spacing can form due to the third dimension added by the stacking of the graphene layers. The paper shows that the tilt boundaries host gapless modes of topological origin and form the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states.

1. Ionizable groups in macromolecules dissociate into charged macromolecules and counterions when dissolved in a polar solvent like water. Polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes are two classes of ionizable polymers, differing in the sign of their charged monomers.
2. Polyelectrolytes have a single sign of charged monomers, while polyampholytes bear charged monomers of both signs. These charged polymers have numerous industrial and medical applications and are often water-soluble. Many biological macromolecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are charged polymers.
3. Intrachain electrostatic interactions in polyelectrolytes are repulsive, causing the chain to swell. In contrast, polyampholyte chains have attractive interactions between charged monomers of opposite sign, which decrease the chain size.
4. The behavior of polyampholytes depends on the sequence of charged monomers on the chains, even when the ratio of positively and negatively charged monomers is the same. This sequence-dependent behavior is observed in the aggregation of ionically complementary peptides and the adsorption properties of charge-symmetric polyampholytes to a charged surface.
5. Polymers anchored on a surface can form polymer brushes when the repulsion between polymers is sufficiently strong. Planar and curved brushes formed by grafted homopolymers have been extensively studied. Anchored polymers in a brush may consist of charged monomers, forming polyelectrolyte or polyampholyte brushes.
6. Electrostatic interactions in polyelectrolyte brushes introduce additional length scales, such as the Bjerrum length and Debye screening length. At high grafting densities and charge fractions, most counterions are trapped inside the polyelectrolyte brush, and the competition between osmotic pressure and elasticity determines the brush thickness.
7. In the osmotic regime, some theoretical scaling methods predict no dependence of brush thickness on grafting density. However, other scaling methods that consider excluded volume effects and nonlinear elasticity predict a linear dependence, which agrees with experiments and simulations.

The $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$, and $a_0(980)$ are good candidates for molecular states, but their ""cousins"" lie too high above the corresponding thresholds to be identified as molecular states. There may be different dynamics dominating the mesons below and above 1 GeV, resulting in two scalar nonets below 1.2 GeV.

1. The study of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2d) has gained significant interest due to the potential for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases. Recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps has made realizing these phenomena possible. The research history of 2d quantum effects in condensed matter physics includes superfluid films, high-temperature superconductivity, 2d materials like graphene, and topological quantum computation.
2. Unique opportunities for modeling these 2d effects in a highly controlled environment have arisen with the development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2d Bose and Fermi ultracold gases. The interest in 2d processes and effects has stimulated the theory of elementary quantum two-body systems and processes in the plane, especially considering the anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction.
3. Usual partial-wave analysis becomes inefficient for describing the dipole-dipole scattering due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial waves in the asymptotic region. Recent progress has been made in the analysis of 2d and quasi-2d scattering of dipoles, including the threshold and semiclassical regimes with the dipole polarization directed orthogonally to the scattering plane.
4. The document discusses a method for quantitative analysis of the 2d quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer, which permits the description of 2d collisions of unpolarized dipoles. The method is based on the few-dimensional scattering approach, applied to the dipole-dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in the 3d free space.

156," 1. G65.2+05.7, also known as G65.3+5.7, was identified as a supernova remnant (SNR) and quickly became the subject of several observational papers. However, after its radio and optical images and spectra were recorded, it was largely ignored for a quarter of a century. Now, it has regained interest due to its potential in explaining an unusual class of SNRs called thermal composite SNRs (or mixed morphology SNRs). These remnants have a combination of a shell-like radio continuum morphology and a centrally bright X-ray morphology, with X-ray emission caused by thermal, rather than synchrotron, processes.

2. Thermal composite SNRs have more mysterious origins than other SNRs. Some researchers suggest that they lack X-ray shells because they have evolved into the radiative phase, resulting in cool, X-ray dim shells. Others propose that the centers of these remnants are X-ray bright due to thermal conduction, entropy mixing, or cloudlet evaporation, which enhances central densities. Ejecta enrichment or dust destruction could also increase metallicities in the centers, further enhancing X-ray emission. Collisions with molecular clouds might also contribute to the thermal composite morphology.

3. G65.2+05.7 has been identified as a thermal composite SNR through various observations and analyses. Optical emission line surveys revealed filaments circumscribing a 4.5 x 3.3 ellipse, while radio frequency data suggested a similarly sized shell-type remnant. Optical emission line measurements indicate that the remnant has large [O/H] ratios, which point to thick postshock cooling regions behind moderate velocity shocks. The remnant's shell temperature is approximately 38,000 K, and its shock velocities range from 90 to 140 km/s.

1. Permutations are a fundamental building block in the succinct encoding of various data structures like integer functions, strings, and binary relations. A permutation can be trivially represented in roughly its information-theory lower bound of bits.
2. Efficient computation of both the permutation and its inverse is often required in applications. The lower bound for sorting a permutation in the comparison model is approximately 8log(n) comparisons.
3. Research has focused on finding better sorting algorithms that can take advantage of specific permutation properties, such as sorted blocks or subsequences, to achieve better-than-average-case performance.
4. Compression schemes for permutations can be derived from adaptive sorting algorithms, which can lead to efficient encoding and decoding of permutations. However, these schemes may not support inverse permutation computation or simple application in reasonable time.
5. The entropy of a sequence of positive integers is a measure of its randomness. Succinct encodings of sequences, such as bitmaps, can be represented using techniques that support constant-time operations.
6. Raman et al. and Grossi et al. have developed bitmap representations for succinct encodings, using zero-order entropy and wavelet trees to achieve optimal space usage and constant-time operations.
7. Various measures of disorder have been considered in the context of sorting, such as the number of pairs in the wrong order, the number of ascending substrings, and the number of elements needed to be removed for a sorted list.
8. A compression method based on ascending runs in a permutation can be used to achieve sublinear representation size when those runs arise. This can be further refined to consider non-contiguous runs for additional compression.
9. Merge sort, a well-known sorting algorithm, can be adapted to take advantage of down-step positions in an array, which can speed up the algorithm when the array is partially sorted. This observation can be used to encode permutations efficiently.

In the next paper, they describe how the relevant elements are subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules.

Each element is controlled by a number of other elements, and its state is determined by their states and a response function. The control elements and response functions are chosen at random. The dynamics of the system obey a deterministic but disordered evolution law. The authors are interested in the probability distributions of the number, length, and size of the attraction basins of the periodic orbits, as well as in the distribution of transient times.

1. Turbulence in quantum fluids (quantum turbulence, QT) exhibits distinct behavior compared to classical turbulence (CT) due to the presence of quantized vortices and quantized circulation. This has led to the study of turbulence in multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), where both velocity and spin fields exist, and various topological excitations can be generated.
2. In a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, the spin field is disturbed, leading to spin turbulence (ST). Recent research has found that the superflow kinetic energy spectrum in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC shows a Kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields, which is considered to be related to the vortex dynamics.
3. The derivation of the Kolmogorov spectrum in QT and ST relies on several assumptions, including the macroscopic wave functions being expressed by the fully magnetized state, the total density being almost uniform, the magnitude of velocity being much smaller than the density sound velocity, the spin and velocity fields being scale invariant, and the energy flux being independent of the wave number.
4. In the numerical simulation of sst, a phenomenological small-scale energy dissipation term is introduced to prevent energy accumulation in the high-wave-number region. The time development of the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction and the superflow kinetic energy shows the emergence of the Kolmogorov spectrum after sufficient time has passed.

1. Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) are thought to have low luminosities due to very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes, often explained by the Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) model.
2. The ADAF model predicts a ""submillimeter bump"" in the spectral energy distribution and a high brightness temperature in radio bands, making future VLBI instruments promising for imaging accretion discs.
3. However, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands, indicating the existence of additional unknown emission.
4. About half of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and LINERs, as well as at least 25% of transition objects, hold a compact radio core, which mostly show nearly flat spectra in 0.5-arcsec resolution, indicating jet domination.
5. In the present paper, the authors report millimeter survey and submillimeter data analyses for many LLAGNs, aiming to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF.
6. High-frequency observations are promising for detecting the ADAF's inverted spectrum due to reduced non-thermal jet contamination and larger flux densities at higher frequencies.
7. The authors derived total errors in flux measurements from root sum square of the errors in the Gaussian fitting and the flux scaling, attempting to measure flux densities at submillimeter band from the nuclear regions.

The shape of the reddening law, which describes the dependence of absorption and scattering on the wavelength of incident radiation, is often characterized by the ratio of total to selective extinction, @xmath21. Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (1989) found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and @xmath0.
3. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with average @xmath22 values varying depending on the environment. Significant deviations from the canonical @xmath22 value are known to exist for various interstellar dust clouds.
4. The variations in @xmath0 appear to be generally correlated with environment, with denser molecular clouds exhibiting larger @xmath0 values and more diffuse, high-latitude cirrus clouds having smaller @xmath0 values.
5. Studies have suggested that @xmath0 variations are tied to variations in the size distribution of dust grains from one line of sight to another. A relative abundance of small grains in diffuse cirrus clouds might explain the steep rise of the extinction curve into the ultraviolet.

1. Heavy fermion systems are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, with the Kondo scale marking the screening of local magnetic moments by conduction electrons' spins. Below the coherence temperature, a paramagnetic heavy-fermion liquid emerges, characterized by a large fermi surface including both magnetic moments and conduction electrons.
2. The Kondo screening competes with the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which couples local moments indirectly via the magnetic polarization of conduction electrons. The competition between Kondo screening, favoring paramagnetic ground states, and the RKKY interaction, favoring magnetically ordered states, is central to quantum phase transitions.
3. Two scenarios describe this quantum phase transition: the Herzt-Millis picture, where quasi-particles of the heavy-fermion liquid remain intact and undergo a spin-density wave transition, and alternative scenarios linking the quantum critical point to the breakdown of the quasi-particle state and a topological reorganization of the fermi surface.
4. Recent experiments show that a change in fermi surface topology may not necessarily occur only at the magnetic order-disorder quantum critical point, but can also be shifted via application of chemical pressure.

1. The discovery of a 125 GeV resonance at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), compatible with the Higgs particle, is a major step towards understanding the origin of mass for fundamental particles. This discovery may also affect the subfield of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
2. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature could make the Higgs responsible for inflation and serve as a suppression mechanism for dark energy contribution from quantum fields. Recent LHC experiments have discussed upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons, while bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity can be obtained from strong-gravity astrophysical objects.
3. The presence of strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, affecting the mass of fundamental particles like the electron. Nucleons, however, are minimally affected due to their mass arising mainly from gluonic fields. This curvature may lead to peculiar wavelength shifts in electronic transitions but not in molecular transitions.
4. To study these shifts, researchers have considered couplings to the only non-null curvature invariant, the Kretschmann invariant, which plays an important role in quadratic theories of gravity and modified theories of gravity. White dwarfs, known since the 19th century, have played a prominent role in fundamental physics and can be used to study the coupling of the Higgs field to the Kretschmann invariant.

Star formation is restricted to cold dense gas and is strongly correlated with the molecular gas content. However, the presence of molecules may not be the cause of star formation, but rather a marker of the cold and dense regions where gravitational collapse can occur. Understanding the links between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution is crucial, and identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas is able to develop is a key challenge. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores, and accurately representing small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations requires tracking molecular chemistry.

This correlation has been confirmed in many studies using optical and UV data to trace star formation in massive galaxy clusters and field environments. Mid-infrared data has also revealed the presence of highly obscured, dusty star-forming galaxies. However, there are still uncertainties in the relationship between star formation and global cluster properties.
2. The text describes a study that uses data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to investigate obscured star formation and its relationship to cluster mass and radius in a sample of 69 clusters at low redshift. The study uses the cluster infall regions (CIRS) sample, which provides high-fidelity mass estimates and extensive spectroscopy for membership determination. The CIRS sample consists of 72 low-redshift X-ray galaxy clusters identified from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey that are within the spectroscopic footprint of SDSS Data Release 4.
3. The study uses photometric data from SDSS DR7 to estimate stellar masses for cluster members and spectroscopic redshifts from SDSS DR7 to determine membership for each of the clusters. The caustics infall method is used to determine cluster membership, which involves plotting the difference in radial velocity of galaxies in the cluster field with respect to the cluster systemic velocity as a function of projected distance from the cluster center. Galaxies that are dynamically bound to the cluster form a well-defined region that decreases in velocity offset as a function of projected radius.
4. The study defines cluster galaxies as those within the edge of this envelope and within a projected radius of 3, and restricts the cluster galaxy sample to within 3. Only galaxies with SDSS spectroscopic redshifts are considered in the following analyses. Star formation rates and total infrared luminosities are determined from the WISE 22  photometry using relations presented in previous studies. The total error attributed to the star formation rate is 0.2 dex, which is dominated by scatter in the flux-SFR relation and does not include uncertainties inherent in the assumed stellar initial mass function.

4. The Kim-Lee theorem has been extended to other pairs of Banach spaces with additional hypotheses, but finding concrete pairs of Banach spaces that satisfy the Kim-Lee theorem for bounded linear operators is a challenging problem. The weak Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property (WBBP) has been defined for ideals of multilinear mappings, and it has been shown that if $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are uniformly convex Banach spaces, then the ideal of multilinear mappings from $X_{1}$ to $X_{2}$ has the WBBP for all Banach spaces $X_{3}$.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"

1. The importance of multi-nucleon events has been suggested in charge-changing quasielastic cross-section calculations for neutrino-nucleus scattering at typical neutrino energies of a few GeV. Two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations are now considered essential for a proper description of data. A growing interest has arisen in including 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations. The only 2p-2h model implemented to date is the IFIC Valencia model in GENIE, with plans to incorporate the Lyon model in GENIE and phenomenological approaches like the Effective Transverse Enhancement Model in nuWro.
2. Implementing 2p-2h models faces challenges due to high computational time, caused by nested integrals in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over final 2p-2h states. Approximations such as using an average momentum for nucleons in the local Fermi gas, neglecting exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations can speed up calculations. The Frozen Nucleon Approximation, presented in this work, reduces the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1, making it well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross-sections folded with the neutrino flux.

1. The accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the nucleus of galaxies is believed to be the source of activity in quasars and Seyfert galaxies, collectively known as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Several studies have suggested a correlation between the mass of the SMBH and the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the host galaxy. This correlation may imply an evolutionary relation between the growth of the SMBH and the host galaxy. To study the dependence of various observed phenomena of AGNs on the black hole mass and cosmic evolution of black holes, independent and reliable estimates of the mass of the black holes are required. One independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole is using the reverberation mapping technique.

2. The reverberation mapping technique has been used to make estimates of SMBH masses over a large range of redshift. However, the technique is observationally taxing, as it demands an enormous amount of telescope time. To date, the broad line region (BLR) radius of only about three dozen AGNs (Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars) have been determined. Using these estimates, a correlation was found between the BLR radius and the optical continuum luminosity at 5100 Å. This relation can be considered well constrained between the luminosities 10^44 and 10^46 erg sec^-1. The correlation is useful for estimating the SMBH masses from single-epoch spectra and calibrating other surrogate relations used for black hole mass estimates. Estimates of the BLR radius for a larger number of sources are required, especially for low luminosity sources, where the time lag between the variations of the broad line and that of the continuum will be of the order of hours to days.

1. Broad emission iron lines are common features in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating near the black hole due to radiation reflection on the accretion disc. The black hole's spin influences the line shape, determining the position of the marginally stable orbit.
2. The LAOR model, which assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used to describe relativistic disc spectral lines, but alternative models with adjustable spin values have also been developed.
3. The LAOR model can still be used to estimate spin by identifying the inner edge of the disc with the marginally stable orbit, but discrepancies between LAOR and other models may appear, especially for higher quality data.
4. The LAOR model tends to overestimate spin values and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the determination of the broad line's high-energy edge.
5. Researchers have analyzed the iron line band for two sources, the active galaxy MCG-6-30-15 and the X-ray binary GX 339-4, using the XMM-Newton satellite and the SAS software.
6. The LAOR and alternative models have been compared, with the alternative model providing a smoother adjustment between different points in the parameter space, allowing for more reliable constraints on spin determination.

1. The ""displace, cut and reflect"" method is used to generate static disks made of perfect fluid, i.e., with radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, and disks of perfect fluid surrounded by an halo made of perfect fluid matter. This method is applied to spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates. The generated disks have well-behaved density and pressure, and the article provides examples of disks with halos generated from known exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates.
2. The article discusses the properties of the disks, such as the surface energy density, pressures, and sound velocity, and how they decrease monotonically with the radius of the disk. The matching conditions at the boundary of the fluid sphere involve four continuity conditions, and the einstein equations for a static spherically symmetric space time in isotropic coordinates for a perfect fluid source are used to relate the density and pressure to the metric functions.
3. The article also discusses the stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane using an extension of Rayleigh's criteria of stability of a fluid at rest in a gravitational field. The specific angular momentum of a particle on the disk's plane is obtained, and the stability criterion is always satisfied for certain functions.
4. The article provides examples of disks with halos constructed from several exact solutions of the Einstein equations for static spheres of perfect fluid. The first situation studied is similar to the one depicted in fig . [fig\_schem2], where a sphere of perfect fluid is displaced and cut by a distance less than its radius. The generated disk is completely immersed in the fluid, and the properties of the inner part of the disk depend on the internal fluid solution. The article also discusses the generation of a disk solution with an halo exactly as the one depicted in fig .

2. Two species of atoms have been condensed simultaneously, but they do not completely interpenetrate, and their relative phase can be measured.
3. Theoretical investigation of two-component Bose systems has been ongoing for decades, with recent experiments reviving interest.
4. Two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) have more complex symmetry and symmetry-breaking patterns than single-component BECs.
5. In two-component systems, condensation corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of two global U(1) symmetries, resulting in two phases for the quantum state.
6. For atoms of the same isotope in different spin states, a driving electromagnetic field can couple the condensates, allowing for atom interconversion and breaking one U(1) symmetry.
7. A sufficiently small violation of the U(1) symmetry related to the relative phase can lead to the existence of a nontrivial static configuration, a domain wall, which is a local minimum of the energy.
8. The domain wall is not topologically stable and can decay, but the rate is exponentially suppressed due to an energy barrier.
9. The domain wall can be shown to exist in binary BECs with a coupling drive, and its relative phase changes by π as one travels through the wall.
10. The experimental realization of the domain wall depends on creating a system where two BECs truly interpenetrate, which remains an open challenge.

1. Pulsed high-frequency (HF) electromagnetic (EM) waves are used to sound the density profile and drift velocity of the overhead ionosphere. In 1971, it was theorized that strong enough injected HF radio beams could excite weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionospheric plasma.
2. Ionospheric modification experiments in Platteville, Colorado, and Arecibo, Puerto Rico, demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation in ionosonde records, and the excitation of spread F after the HF transmitter was turned on. The triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionosphere was first observed in 1970 at Arecibo.
3. A decade later, strong, systematic, structured, wide-band secondary HF radiation was found to escape from the interaction region under similar experimental conditions in Tromsø, Norway. Complex interactions, including weak and strong EM turbulence and harmonic generation, are excited in these experiments.
4. Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence. A full-scale simulation study of the propagation of an HF EM wave into the ionosphere was conducted, considering ionospheric parameters typical for the high-latitude EISCAT heating facility in Tromsø, Norway.
5. The results suggest that such simulations will become a powerful tool to study HF-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level for direct comparison with experimental data.
6. The simulation study revealed the reflection of the LO and R-X modes at different altitudes, mode conversion of the LO mode into electrostatic Langmuir/upper hybrid waves, and nonlinear harmonic generation of high-frequency waves. Second harmonic generation has been observed in ionospheric heating experiments and may be partially explained by the cold plasma model presented in the study.

1. The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid-Mott insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays, granular superconductors, and cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices. The recent experimental observation of the Mott-insulator transition in cold atoms has triggered significant theoretical and experimental interest. The possibility of manipulating and testing the many-body behavior of trapped bosonic atoms in optical lattices has attracted attention due to potential applications, such as creating controlled multiparticle entanglement for quantum computation.
2. The Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition is driven by the interplay of repulsive interactions and kinetic energy, with the ratio of on-site energy and bandwidth being the key parameter. In optical lattices, this parameter can be easily controlled and varied, enabling detailed studies of the quantum phase transition. Probing the system by taking absorption pictures to image expansion patterns after a reasonable expansion time provides information about the momentum distribution of the state, which was used to experimentally confirm the Mott transition in an optical lattice.
3. The essential physics of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic Mott-Hubbard model describing the competition between hopping and on-site interaction. Various approximation schemes, such as the Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz, density-matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo, have been used to study this model analytically and numerically. In this article, the authors study short-range correlations not included by the Gutzwiller ansatz using perturbation theory to find corrections to the short-range behavior of the one-particle density matrix, which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns.
4. The authors re-express the Mott-Hubbard Hamiltonian by adding an appropriate perturbation to the mean-field hamiltonian and perform Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory to improve the Gutzwiller approximation by perturbatively including short-range correlations between lattice sites. This approach is used to calculate perturbative corrections to observables, including single-site observables and the density matrix, and to discuss implications for expansion patterns both for bulk systems and a harmonic confining potential.

179," 1. Scalar fields arise naturally in higher-dimensional theories and can lead to accelerating cosmologies. Compactification on a compact hyperbolic manifold with a time-dependent volume modulus results in a flat, expanding universe that undergoes transient acceleration. This behavior is common to compactifications involving compact hyperbolic spaces or non-vanishing flux. The positive scalar field potential produced by hyperbolic and flux compactifications explains this transient acceleration.

2. The authors develop a geometrical method for classifying and visualizing homogeneous isotropic cosmologies in multi-scalar models with an arbitrary scalar potential. The method involves augmenting the target space to a larger, lorentzian-signature space and conformally rescaling the metric. For flat cosmologies, all trajectories are geodesics with respect to the rescaled metric. The authors also discuss the case of flat cosmologies with positive potentials, which approach a null trajectory at late times, leading to deceleration.

Its phase transition structure is a central aim of theoretical and experimental research in hot and/or dense QCD. Experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have tried to create the QGP, with tentative confirmation in 2005 at the latter. The consensus was in favor of a quark-gluon liquid at very low viscosity.
2. The one gluon exchange scheme is used to generalize calculations for the region with finite temperature and baryon density, considering weakly interacting quarks.

In this framework, the energy density of weakly interacting quarks in QGP can be evaluated using formulas involving the degeneracy of quarks, kinetic and potential energies, and fermi-dirac liquid distributions.
4. The thermodynamic quantities, such as energy density and entropy, are calculated as a function of chemical potential and temperature. By rewriting these quantities as a function of temperature and baryon density, the chemical potential can be found, allowing for the evaluation of various thermodynamic quantities.

1. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have been found to have mainly d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature. This symmetry has been confirmed through try-crystal phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements. However, above a certain temperature (k), there is no direct evidence for this type of symmetry from thermal conductivity measurements. Deviations from the expected angular pattern have been attributed to the effect of pinning of vortices.
2. The variation of the thermal conductivity as a function of angle depends mainly on the heat transport by quasiparticles, their interaction with supercurrents (vortices), and the symmetry of the order parameter. The nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity at low temperatures, where the quasiparticle momentum is close to the nodal directions of the gap. Thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature can explain the experimental results in the whole temperature range, including the change of symmetry of the gap function as a function of temperature.
3. The thermal conductivity at different angles and temperatures at a fixed magnetic field has been calculated numerically using an Andreev reflection model for the scattering of quasiparticles by supercurrents. The results agree with experimental data and confirm the predominance of the d-wave gap up to the critical temperature. The measurements also provide new results that improve our knowledge of the thermal transport at temperatures where the nodal properties of the gap are not directly observable.
4. The effect of pinning of vortices plays an important role in determining the correct angle pattern in this kind of measurement. A non-uniform vortex distribution due to pinning forces may appear when the angle of the magnetic field is changed. The pinning of Josephson-like vortices parallel to the planes is strongly affected by vortices perpendicular to the planes, which may appear due to the misalignment of the crystal axes with respect to the applied magnetic field. This can result in hysteresis in the angular patterns of the thermal conductivity. Pinning of vortices is influenced by the distribution of oxygen vacancies in the sample, as well as by defects and impurity centers. Therefore, a field-cooled procedure must be used to rule out the influence of this effect in the measurements.

2. The cosmetic surgery conjecture claims that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic. In this paper, the authors study purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere.
3. They show that for most knots in the three-sphere, distinct Dehn surgeries yield non-homeomorphic oriented manifolds. Furthermore, they provide a sufficient condition for a knot to admit no purely cosmetic surgery using its Jones polynomial.
4. If a knot has a trivial Jones polynomial or its first and second derivatives vanish at a specific point, then it admits no purely cosmetic surgery for any two distinct slopes.
5. The authors also discuss the relationship between their result and a similar one by Boyer and Lines, showing that their result can be viewed as an improvement.
6. Previously, genus one knots and knots with certain concordance invariants were known to not admit purely cosmetic surgeries. The new criterion, combined with the concordance invariant condition, provides an effective obstruction to the existence of purely cosmetic surgery.
7. The authors use this criterion to show that the cosmetic surgery conjecture holds for all knots with no more than 13 crossings, except possibly for one specific knot.
8. They also provide an explicit closed formula for the canonically normalized finite type knot invariant of order 3 for two-bridge knots in Conway forms, which could be of independent interest.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attracted attention for their attractive properties, such as calculable soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking terms and real, flavor-invariant soft terms that solve SUSY flavor problems. However, AMSB models have a well-known issue where slepton mass-squared parameters are negative, leading to tachyonic states.
2. The original solution to this problem is to add a universal scalar mass to the AMSB soft SUSY breaking (SSB) terms, creating the ""minimal"" AMSB model (mAMSB) with a parameter space of m0, m3/2, and sign(μ). An alternative setup, hypercharged anomaly mediation (hAMSB), has been proposed, which uses a similar setup but with SUSY breaking localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, geometrically separated from the visible region.
3. In hAMSB, the warping suppresses tree-level gravity mediation, allowing anomaly mediation to dominate the visible sector. The bino gaugino mass can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation, leading to a small or large perturbation in the spectrum depending on its size.
4. The minimal AMSB model predicts a negative mass squared for sleptons and heavy squarks, while pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a wide range of relative contributions.
5. The hAMSB SSB contribution is parametrized using a dimensionless quantity, @xmath2, which governs the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms relative to the AMSB contribution. The hAMSB model assumes electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively, with ssb terms and the superpotential term given by the scalar potential minimization conditions.

1. The zero range potential (ZRP) approach, also known as the generalized zero range potential (GZRP), is a theoretical framework used to describe the behavior of particles in scattering problems. It can be represented as a boundary condition on the wavefunction or as a pseudopotential. The Darboux transformation (DT) technique can be used to construct exactly solvable potentials and modify the GZRP boundary condition, creating a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.
2. The DT technique can also be used to dress the ZRP model, which involves modifying the boundary conditions on the wavefunctions to introduce short-range cores of centrifugal type in the potential. This can lead to the generation of complex poles of the S-matrix, which correspond to quasi-stationary states (resonances). The DT can be used to add or remove poles of the S-matrix, allowing for the construction of a zero-range potential eigenfunction in the multi-center problem.
3. The ZRP model has been used to study the scattering of particles by structures containing identical scatterers, such as polyatomic molecules. The partial waves and phases can be classified with respect to the symmetry group representation, and the structures can belong to different point groups. The phases and cross sections can be expressed in terms of the inverse scattering lengths of the scatterers and the solutions of algebraic equations. The ZRP model can be used to study slow electron scattering by polyatomic molecules, and the induced polarization potentials can be included to account for polarization effects at low impact energies.

190," 1. Surveys using bolometer arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have discovered dusty objects at extreme redshifts, which are not detected in surveys at shorter and longer wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavorable k-corrections. The first cosmological surveys using SCUBA and MAMBO quickly changed the accepted picture of galaxy formation and evolution, revealing the existence of ""SCUBA galaxies"" with surprising source density at the flux levels accessible to the first generation of bolometer arrays. However, the initial excitement was replaced by pessimism when early efforts to study SCUBA galaxies at optical and infrared wavelengths suggested that the majority of the submm population had no plausible optical counterparts.

2. Recent progress has been made through radio imaging of submm survey fields, which has allowed for the detection of roughly half of the submm sources observed and the estimation of their redshifts. Radio data has also enabled the refinement of submm samples, increasing the detection fraction to two-thirds of SMGs at 0.85-mm flux density levels in excess of 3.5 mJy. These bright SMGs have been found to be a diverse population, including quasar-like galaxies, morphologically complex galaxies, extremely red galaxies, and galaxies with obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds. Spectroscopic redshifts have been difficult to determine, but accurate redshifts reported by Chapman et al. (2003, 2005) have facilitated the first systematic measurements of molecular gas mass for SMGs and constraints on gas reservoir size and dynamical mass. These data suggest that SMGs are massive systems and provide some of the strongest tests of galaxy-formation models to date. However, a detailed understanding of SMGs remains a distant goal, and confusion currently limits investigations to the brightest SMGs. Selection biases may also have skewed our understanding of the SMG population, as around half of all known SMGs remain undetected in the radio and the radio-undetected fraction remains largely untargeted by existing spectroscopic campaigns.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event, i.e., without soft interactions between other partons in the scattering hadrons. Multiple interactions would fill the rapidity gap produced in the hard scattering process.
3. Bjorken estimated the color-singlet fraction for elastic scattering using the imaginary part of the two-gluon color-singlet exchange amplitude, which dominates the forward scattering amplitude for color-singlet exchange. In impact parameter space, the color-singlet fraction is 0.15 for small impact parameters. This model, with the two-gluon exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part, is called the two-gluon exchange model.
4. The color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons. For quark-antiquark elastic scattering, the color factor can be written in terms of Gell-Mann matrices as ( f\_c)\_i\_2j\_2,i\_1j\_1 = ( ^a2 ) \_ i\_2i\_1 ( ^a2 ) \_ j\_1j\_2 = 49\_{j\_1}i\_1\_{i\_2}j\_2- 13(^a2 ) \_ j\_1i\_1 ( ^a2 ) \_ i\_2j\_2 = 43p\_1 - 16 p\_8.
5. The two-gluon exchange model predicts a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon-initiated processes, leading to a gap fraction decrease with increasing transverse energy or pseudorapidity separation of the jets. However, statistical models of color rearrangement suggest the opposite behavior due to the eight color degrees of freedom for gluons.

2. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z-sources and Atoll sources, differing in accretion rates and neutron star magnetic field strengths.
3. LMCX-2, a persistent LMXB in the Large Magellanic Cloud, exhibits Z-source properties, suggesting a high accretion rate around the Eddington limit.
4. Despite its X-ray luminosity and known optical counterpart, little is known about LMCX-2's system parameters, with varying estimates for its orbital period.
5. Recent studies have detected narrow emission lines in other LMXBs, attributed to the irradiated side of the donor star, leading researchers to apply this technique to LMCX-2.
6. The team detected a periodic signal in LMCX-2's spectroscopic dataset, identified as the orbital period, and narrow emission lines consistent with the irradiated side of the companion.
7. These findings provide the first constraints on LMCX-2's system parameters, contributing to our understanding of its previously reported orbital periods.

Dolgov and Zakharov have shown an alternative approach, interpreting the anomaly as an infrared phenomenon caused by a singularity in the chiral limit of the triangular diagram.
2. This infrared interpretation complements the more familiar ultraviolet interpretation from the renormalization procedure. The approach allows for a better understanding of the physical meaning of anomalous chiral symmetry breaking, which is connected to non-conservation of helicity.
3. The connection between the anomaly and symmetry breaking has received significant attention in the literature. Gribov described the source of anomalies as a collective motion of particles with large momenta in the vacuum, while Mueller discussed the manifestation of the axial anomaly as a flow of Landau levels.

The Dolgov and Zakharov approach has been related to specific effects in the dynamics of physical reactions, such as radiative decays of particles, demonstrating that the axial anomaly can be connected to polarized radiative decays.

1. The text discusses the concept of salient object detection in computer vision, which involves identifying the most important object in a scene. This is a challenging problem, as it requires a vision system to select the most significant object from a complex scene with multiple objects.
2. Salient object detection has numerous applications in fields such as recognition, image and video compression, video summarization, media re-targeting and photo collage, image quality assessment, image segmentation, content-based image retrieval and image collection browsing, image editing and manipulating, visual tracking, object discovery, and human-robot interaction.
3. Over the past seven years, a large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed, which typically involve two steps: selecting objects to process (determining the saliency order of objects) and segmenting the object area (isolating the object and its boundary).
4. Current models for salient object detection have bypassed the challenge of selecting objects to process by focusing on scenes with single objects. They perform well on the second step, as evidenced by high performance on existing biased datasets.
5. However, it is unclear how current models perform on complex, cluttered scenes with multiple objects. This is due to the lack of suitable benchmark datasets for scaling up models and a widely agreed-upon objective definition of the most salient object.
6. The text aims to provide solutions for these problems and to discover which component might be the weakest link in the possible failure of models when migrating to complex scenes.

1. Heegaard Floer theory is a 4-dimensional TQFT constructed by Ozsváth and Szabó, which associates a vector space to a 3-manifold and a map to a 4-manifold cobordism.
2. This theory can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary.
3. For example, two 4-manifolds with boundary the Brieskorn sphere can be shown to be homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic by comparing their Heegaard Floer invariants.
4. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces.
5. However, Sarkar and the third author showed that every 3-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that can be used to combinatorially count holomorphic disks.
6. The goal of the paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps induced by cobordisms with surjective induced maps.
7. This is done by decomposing the cobordism into a sequence of one-handle, two-handle, and three-handle additions, and then counting holomorphic triangles in a special form of multi-pointed triple Heegaard diagram.
8. The authors note that while their procedure gives an algorithmic way to compute the rank of a map, the map itself is only determined up to automorphisms of the image and target.

2. Cardiovascular stents often lead to inflammatory restenosis due to damage from implantation. Current surface modifications, like polymer film coatings with medically active agents, can help reduce immune response but have limitations.
3. Biodegradable polymers in polymer coatings can still cause inflammatory responses and may be quickly depleted, leading to exposure of bare metal surfaces and potential adverse tissue reactions.
4. There is a need for entirely biocompatible coatings that can deliver pharmaceutically active agents to targeted sites. Porous coatings can accept drug loads and release them in a controlled manner, depending on surface properties and drug characteristics.
5. Calcium phosphate materials, such as hydroxyapatite, are mineral components of hard tissue and offer new perspectives for coating-based drug encapsulation and delivery systems.
6. Hydroxyapatite ceramics have high biocompatibility and can be used for drug release control. They can be thermally deposited, but their brittle behavior limits their use to applications with solid support structures.
7. Biomimetic deposition of hydroxyapatite films at room temperature (BM-HA) can incorporate biologically active species during formation, and electro-chemical deposition (ECD) can enhance deposition rates.
8. Bonding strength of BM-HA and ECD-HA to metallic surfaces is generally lower than that of sol-gel HA, but building additional films on top of existing, well-bonded SG-HA films provides high bonding strength, controlled porosity, and drug encapsulation capability.

1. The present disclosure describes a person support apparatus, such as a hospital or long-term care bed, with a patient support deck and a mechanism for adjusting the deck's height and orientation. The deck is supported on a deck support frame, which is adjustable in height through leg assemblies pivotally connected at their upper end to the deck support frame and having linear actuators for pivoting the leg assemblies relative to the deck support frame.
2. Known arrangements for pivoting leg assemblies include a guide element moving along the outside of longitudinal elements or channels with follower or guide elements extending into the interior of the channels. These arrangements have issues like finger trapping risks, frictional forces, and dust accumulation.
3. The present disclosure proposes an alternative arrangement where at least one side of the person support frame comprises an inverted substantially U-shaped channel element having a substantially continuous upper surface, two substantially continuous side surfaces, and a downward facing opening. The first upper end portion of the leg assembly includes a guide or follower element arranged to contact and run along an inner surface of the channel element.
4. This arrangement results in a deck support frame that is robust, stable, and can accommodate changes in geometry necessary for movement or adjustment between the horizontal, Trendelenburg, and reverse Trendelenburg positions. The channel and roller mechanism change the height of the patient support deck by pivoting one or more leg assemblies relative to the under surface of the patient support frame.

1. The invention describes a skin reflectance measuring apparatus, which measures skin reflectance and can be used in pathology, cosmetology, and dermatology. It can determine sebum secretion rate, study skin diseases, measure the effect of anti-reflectance products, and grade different types of skin.
2. Known methods and devices used in industries for surface reflectance measurement are not applicable for skin reflectance measurement due to the influence of color and the need for accurate positioning and large measuring areas. The invention aims to solve these problems by proposing a reflectance measurement apparatus specifically adapted for measuring the reflectance of the skin.
3. The apparatus comprises a probe, a flexible connection in fiber optics, a measuring device, and a display device. The probe has an aperture, and the fiber optics connection has three optical conductors. The measuring device has light emitting means, light receiving means, and processing means with correcting means to compensate for variations in the emitted light and the influence of ambient light.
4. The structure of the measuring apparatus, with a probe connected to a measuring device via a flexible connection in fiber optics, offers several advantages. It allows miniaturization of the probe, enabling measurements on reduced surfaces, and is easy to handle with no need for accurate positioning. The correction of variations in light intensity and ambient light ensures accurate measurement.
5. The probe is designed to be small, with a measuring area that is small enough to allow significant measurements over a surface with as little rigidity and uniformity as the skin. The flexible connection allows ready handling for taking measurements over different areas of the skin surface.
6. The emitter of the light emitting device comprises a lamp with a tungsten filament, a lens to focus the beam, an infrared filter, and photodiodes to supply signals representing the light intensity. The regulation circuit compares the real intensity of the light beam to a reference voltage and adjusts the voltage in the lamp to return the difference towards zero.
7. The receiving device comprises two photodiodes, a voltage divider, an analog switch, and a logarithmic amplifier. The photodiodes produce a voltage proportional to the intensity of the picked up light beams, and the amplifier produces an analog signal representative of the specular or diffuse reflection.

1. The invention describes a pallet system that includes a pallet base and a pallet cap, which can be used to ship trays of items such as eggs. The pallet cap has pockets that fit within the pockets of a conventional plastic pallet, called the pallet base, and guide rails that help to position and interlock the trays when they are loaded onto the pallet.

2. Each tray has side supports that closely straddle a pair of guide rails when the tray is loaded onto the pallet, constraining its lateral movement. The guide rails are raised above the level of the weight bearing surface of the pallet cap and are sized and spaced to allow for open spaces between them that can be used for packing items.

3. The pallet system also includes end stops that limit the longitudinal movement of the trays parallel to the guide rails, and end plates that can be vertically positioned at the front and back ends of the pallet to provide greater stability to a stack of trays. The end plates are shaped to complement the shapes of the trays loaded onto the pallet and can be used with pallets and loads of different widths.

4. The components of the pallet system can be made of various materials, such as plastic, and can be manufactured by methods such as thermo forming, rotomolding, and injection molding. The pallet system can be customized for its intended load, with features such as the width and height of the guide rails, the positions of the end stops, and the shape of the end plates being tailored to suit the needs of the load.

These muteins have improved binding affinity for peptide ligands and are used for the isolation, purification, and determination of biological substances, particularly other recombinant proteins.
2. The biotin/streptavidin system is a widely used binding system in molecular biology, known for its high affinity and stability. However, biotinylation of certain recombinant proteins is not always possible or straightforward. The invention aims to extend the application of the biotin/streptavidin system by producing peptide ligands that can be fused to desired proteins during co-expression.
3. The small size and flexible attachment sites of peptide ligands allow for efficient purification and detection of recombinant proteins without the need for additional cleavage steps, resulting in a more economical process. The peptide ligand system also enables the purification of recombinant proteins under mild elution conditions and facilitates their detection using streptavidin conjugates.
4. Although the initial peptide ligand system had a relatively low affinity, the invention successfully optimized it by introducing mutations in the streptavidin region of amino acid positions 44 to 53. This resulted in a higher binding affinity for peptide ligands, making the system more effective for various applications.
5. The optimized streptavidin muteins can be derived from streptavidin variants shortened at the N- or C-terminus, with a minimal streptavidin sequence preferred for its high affinity for peptide ligands. Specific examples of streptavidin muteins with high affinity for the strep-tag II peptide ligand are provided.

1. The invention relates to downhole vibratory tools that can selectively allow passage of other tools, specifically designed to dislodge stuck objects (fish) from a downhole location or transmit pulling forces in deviated wellbores.
2. Earlier vibratory tools operate by applying overpull and pressure within the string, causing a piston to stretch the string and open a valve, releasing pressure and causing the piston to snap back, repeating the cycle.
3. Limitations of previous designs include the inability to run wirelines through the tool for determining conditions near the fish, as the dump valve is located in the center, and the use of smaller components in more recent dart-based designs, which limits power delivery and increases fatigue.
4. The new design features an annularly disposed dump valve, allowing a central passage for wireline operations, and a removable plug to initiate vibratory mode, while the remaining components are made stronger for improved reliability.
5. Additional power is delivered through modular stacked piston units, and the tool can apply high amplitude low-frequency oscillating forces without impacts on the housing.
6. The tool consists of an outer body attached to a stuck object, with a mandrel connected to the surface through a string, having a passage for pressure delivery and lateral ports.
7. Pressure in the passage pushes down the piston, displacing fluid and creating an opposite reaction force, with stacked pistons increasing the delivered power of the tool.
8. A drop-in plug closes off the passage, and a nearby shoulder features openings leading into a chamber, with a cylindrically shaped valve closing off the chamber to build pressure.
9. The valve moves against the bias of a spring, opening to relieve pressure and allowing the mandrel to continue moving downhole, while the string goes into a contraction cycle.
10. The tool can be operated with or without jarring blows, and the design allows for wireline access, increased power, and fewer moving parts, with a modular design for matching tool power to specific work strings and downhole conditions.

1. The invention describes a precast concrete retaining wall system with two main parts: a face panel with an integral counterfort and a base. The face panel has at least two counterforts extending perpendicularly from the rear side, which provide support and help limit pressure to the wall's design value. Drainage openings are provided in the counterfort and face panel to improve stability by reducing hydrostatic pressure.
2. Reinforcing bars (rebar) are cast within the counterfort, with more longitudinal steel reinforcements in the lower part to secure the wall where overturning forces are greatest. The rebars act as tensioning devices and can terminate in various configurations, such as an ""L"" or ""backwards L"" or with a forged foot at the free end.
3. The base is a rectangular or trapezoidal platform, generally solid, and set on grade. A shear key can be made between the face or counterforts and the base to solidify the connection upon filling the voids with grout. The base can also have openings to accept downward-extending rebar ends from the counterfort, and the connection point between the counterfort and base can be filled with grout.
4. To connect the first module (face panel with counterfort) and second module (base), an installer aligns the exposed ends of the rebars of the first module with the openings on the second module and then lowers the first module onto the second module, placing the rebars within the openings. High-strength grout is pumped into the opening to create a shear cone in the base, connecting the two precast modular pieces.
5. In typical installations, multiple retaining walls are placed adjacent to one another to form a continuous wall. Measures such as texturing or roughening the base, using shims and flow-able grout, or driving H-piles into the ground can be taken to ensure stability and prevent sliding, depending on soil conditions and surcharge loads. A vehicle impact barrier can also be formed and cast-in-place on top of or behind the wall.

1. The invention describes an air intake device for internal combustion engines, comprising a tank, two pipes (5, 6) with different cross-sectional areas, and a control valve (7) with an actuator (8). The pipes (5, 6) interconnect the tank and the intake passage at different locations, and the cross-sectional area of pipe (6) is smaller than pipe (5). The control valve (7) is disposed in the first passage and is actuated by an actuator (8) responsive to engine operating conditions.

2. The invention aims to improve engine performance by utilizing dynamic effects and reducing air intake noise. The two pipes (5, 6) define air passages between the tank and intake pipe, with the narrow passage of pipe (6) serving as a resonator to absorb noise. The volume of the tank and the narrow passage of pipe (6) constitute a resonator, and their relationship is given by the equation f=c*sqrt((s*l)/V).

3. The control valve (7) is controlled to create a new compound curve with each peak portion of curves A and B, thereby improving engine performance. The valve (7) is turned to open or close at engine speeds NX and NY, where curves A and B intersect. The valve (7) is preferably closed when the load is below a specific line n and operated when the load is above the line n and the speed is above NY.

The valve operating conditions are stored as a map in the control circuit, which produces a control signal for the solenoid valve and the control valve based on the engine speed sensor and the throttle position sensor.

1. The invention describes a method for minimizing flow disturbance caused by the closing and reopening of turbine control valves during periodic operational testing. It uses control valve positions as feedback to maintain constant total mass flow through several parallel turbine inlet flow control valves, which in turn maintains constant steam generator pressure and minimizes turbine power changes. This method does not require the monitoring of additional process parameters.
2. The flow difference between the N and N-1 condition is determined during the turbine design process for any given valve not under test. This difference is applied to the total flow demand to each of the N-1 valves on the basis of the total N valve demand derived from the position of the valve under test. A graph in Figure 1 shows the total flow characteristic for a system when controlling with N valves and when controlling with N-1 valves for various valve lift values.
3. The control circuit for controlling the flow through the input control valves of a turbine interfaces with the flow control circuit for one valve of a total of N valves present in the turbine. A block diagram of this circuit is shown in Figure 2. An exemplary flow control circuit with control valve test compensation for one valve of a total of N valves present in a turbine is shown in Figure 3.
4. The test compensation circuit uses control valve positions as feedback and compensates by adjusting the flow through parallel control valves to minimize flow disturbance caused by the closure and reopening of turbine control valves during testing. This compensation circuit would be reproduced along with the test control circuit and valve servo position loop for each valve of several parallel turbine inlet control valves used to control the mass flow through the turbine.

The control system contained the algorithms for compensation of flow during valve testing as described above. The use of the control valve test compensating control of the present invention resulted in a significant reduction in pressure excursion compared to the control system without flow compensation.

321," 1. The invention relates to a fabrication method for steel plates or blanks that are coated, welded, and heat-treated to produce parts with good mechanical strength, high impact resistance, and corrosion resistance. This method is particularly useful in the automotive industry for manufacturing anti-intrusion, structural, or safety components.

2. The fabrication process involves starting with steel plates, possibly of different compositions or thicknesses, and having a metal pre-coating. The plates are then butt-welded together, and the welded blanks undergo heat treatment to form a surface alloy. This alloy prevents decarburization and oxidation during heat treatment, eliminating the need for special atmosphere furnaces and certain surface operations. The heat treatment also confers a tensile strength greater than 1500 MPa on the parts.

3. However, welding coated steel blanks can result in the transfer of initial surface pre-coating into the molten area, leading to the formation of intermetallic areas during subsequent alloying and austenizing. These intermetallic areas reduce the overall deformability of the welded joints and can become the site of rupture under static or dynamic conditions. To address this issue, the invention proposes eliminating the source of these intermetallic areas, namely the initial surface metal coating.

4. Eliminating the pre-coated area, however, creates a new problem: the precoated area on either side of the future welded joint can corrode due to scale formation and decarburizing during further alloying and austenizing heat treatment. The invention aims to prevent the formation of intermetallic areas within welded assemblies while ensuring good corrosion resistance for the welded and heat-treated parts. The proposed solution is an economic fabrication process that can be easily integrated into existing welding lines and is compatible with subsequent pressing or heat treatment phases.

The invention is related to the use of waveguide holograms for controlled illumination of objects with specific illumination requirements, such as display holograms or spatial light modulators.
2. Thin substrate waveguides are used in the invention, which are characterized by the relationship between the width of an incident laser beam (w), the thickness of the waveguide (t), and the wavelength of the incident lightwave (λ). These waveguides are thin (t>>λ) to allow for easy coupling of the optical source and uniform illumination (t<w).
3. The inventors have discovered that these waveguides are particularly useful for controlled illumination of demanding objects, such as holograms and spatial light modulators. The illumination system comprises a thin substrate waveguide optically coupled to a coherent light source, such as a laser, and provides high diffraction efficiencies.
4. Non-uniformity of the diffracted wavefront can be compensated for by exposing a photographic emulsion to the beam without compensation, or by recording the hologram of the waveguide hologram illuminator non-uniformly. Both corrections can be employed to ensure a uniform wavefront.
5. WGH illuminators have several advantages over conventional lens illumination systems, including smaller size, lower cost, and higher diffraction efficiency. However, there are also some penalties, such as the need for critical alignment of the laser beam and the time delay across the hologram.

This problem can be compensated for a priori or a posteriori by exposing a photographic emulsion to the uncompensated beam or by recording the hologram nonuniformly. The problem of two-sidedness can be solved by absorbing the light emerging from one side or placing a mirror on one side to reflect all of the light into the same direction.",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. The present invention relates to face age-estimation and methods, systems, and software therefor. The invention is motivated by the need for accurate, efficient, uncooperative, and cost-effective age-estimation solutions in various real-world operating scenarios, such as automated control and surveillance systems. Accurate age-estimation can benefit businesses, homeland security technologies, e-documents and electronic customer relationships, and can help prevent underage access to age-restricted products or services.
2. Human face aging is influenced by various factors, including gender, ethnicity, heredity, and environmental factors. Controllable factors can be exploited to recognize trends in the aging of human faces, while uncontrollable factors can be challenging to deal with. Correctly estimating an age from a face is difficult for humans and even more so for computing devices.
3. From the viewpoint of computer science, face aging technologies generally address two areas: face age-estimation and face age-progression. Face age-estimation involves recognizing the ages of individuals in a given photo, while face age-progression predicts the future faces of an individual in a given photo.
4. To achieve an accurate, efficient, uncooperative, and cost-effective solution to face age-estimation, it is necessary to extract as much unique information as possible from each image and use such information in an exhaustive comparison. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and may require special tweaking to generate meaningful results.
5. The present disclosure describes a method of generating a face age-estimation for a face represented by first image data as a function of faces represented by second image data and having assigned landmark points and known ages. The method involves receiving first image data, applying a contourlet appearance model (CAM) algorithm to generate a first feature vector, executing an age classifier on the first feature vector to identify an estimated age group, and applying an aging function to generate the face age-estimation.
6. Another method described in the disclosure involves extracting facial features from an image of a test subject and mapping the facial features to one of at least two differing age groups having corresponding differently calibrated mapping functions.

Each arrangement has a first plurality of pixels dedicated to the first image and other pixels dedicated to the second image. The controller produces the merged display of the two images, which may be redimensioned by scaling means.
2. Each arrangement can be formed by a square of four pixels, with three pixels associated with the first image and the remaining pixel associated with the second image. The pixels dedicated to the first image can emit a single color, while the pixels dedicated to the second image can emit a different single color. Alternatively, the remaining pixels can be configured to display two colors that restore the color associated with the first pixel.
3. The controller can apply an attenuation function to the light intensity signals of the pixels associated with the second image when the light intensity signal value of the remaining pixels exceeds a predetermined threshold. The attenuation function can be defined by a relationship that takes into account the quantified values of the light intensity signals of the corresponding pixels of the first image.
4. The matrix display device can include a first controller that interfaces with the first pixels of each arrangement and corresponds to the first image, and a second controller that interfaces with the other pixels of each arrangement and corresponds to the second image. The device can display a first image produced by a night vision sensor, infrared sensor, or X-ray imaging sensor, merged with the display of a second image produced by an infrared sensor, echography sensor, or a monochrome or two-color symbology image.

The merged image can be formed via appropriate light intensity signals, and the light intensity signals that make it possible to form the pixels of an arrangement of pixels of the merged image can be respectively denoted S1, S2, S3, and S4.

1. The invention describes a helmet liner that is custom-fitted to an individual's head through the use of a plurality of layers of elastic thermoplastic sheets with pockets arranged in superposed contacting relationship with one another. The pockets are left open and unfilled to allow deformation in response to compressive contact with an adjacent layer.
2. The liner is fitted to an individual's head by heating the sheets to a plastic state, placing the liner between an outer fixture and the wearer's head to deform the sheets to the proper extent, and then removing the liner from the wearer's head when the liner has cooled to a rigid, nonplastic state.
3. This design allows for a helmet liner that is sufficiently rigid to provide the necessary spacing between the outer shell and the wearer's head while also being compliant enough to smooth out the effects of relative layer alignment. This eliminates the need for maintaining the spheres of one layer in register with the spaces between the spheres of an adjacent layer, simplifying the manufacturing process.
4. The liner conforms more readily to the contours of the wearer's head, minimizing the tendency for the outer helmet to shift in position. Additionally, the open and unfilled pockets eliminate the need for drawstrings to maintain the liner in tension during size adjustment.
5. The helmet comprises an outer shell made of a rigid outer layer formed of a suitable reinforced plastic material and an energy-absorbing polystyrene foam liner carried inside the outer layer.
6. The inner liner, which is releasably secured to the shell by any suitable means, comprises four sheet layers formed of a suitable elastic thermoplastic material. Each of the layers is vacuum-formed over a hemispherical dome with bumps or protuberances formed at regular intervals across the surface.
7. The liner is custom-fitted to the head of the wearer by heating the liner in an oven, placing it inside the shell or a fitting fixture, and then pressing it firmly downward for a few minutes until the liner has cooled to a temperature at which it has sufficiently solidified. </summary>",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21}"

1. The invention is a multiorifice wafer structure (10) made of alternating concentric layers of solid rods (12) and cylindrical members (14) fused or sintered into an integral assembly. Each layer of rods (12) comprises a plurality of individual rods (16) angularly disposed with respect to the axis of the concentric cylindrical members. The angular displacement of the rods increases with each sequential layer, which enhances the dispersion capabilities of the structure.
2. The interstices or interstitial spaces (20) between the individual rods (16) and the cylindrical members (14) form a plurality of generally triangularly shaped passageways through the structure, which constitute the orifices through which the fluid to be dispersed or atomized flows. The thickness of the structure is selected such that the fluid passing therethrough will, upon exiting the structure, have a directional component parallel to the axis of the interstices.
3. The invention also describes a simple and economical method for fabricating the disclosed multiorifice structure. A central or core rod (18) is circumscribed by six or more rods or wires (16′). The first layer of rods (16′) are twisted about the core and rod (18), so that their axis are disposed at a predetermined angle with respect to the axis of core rod (18). Core rod (18) and twisted rods (16′) are then sheathed in a cylindrical member (14′). The external diameter of cylindrical member (14′) is selected so that an integral number of rods of the same diameter as rods (16′) completely surround member (14′) with their external surfaces in contact with each other. A second layer of rods or wires (16″) are also twisted about the external surface of the cylindrical member (14′) and sheathed in a second cylindrical member (14″). The twisted rods on the second layer are angularly disposed with regard to the core rod (18) at an angle (β) which may be the same as (α) or may be different.

1. The invention concerns devices for generating power from surface waves using submerged containers relying on hydrostatic pressure differences and enhanced surge or pitch.
2. Wave energy commercialization lags behind wind energy due to high cost and low efficiency of current OWEC designs, which are mostly heavy steel and near-shore deployed.
3. Subsurface OWECs can reduce severe sea-state problems and capture both hydrostatic and hydrokinetic wave energy, but only a few are deployed subsurface and most are near-shore.
4. Prior art subsurface devices use gas-filled containers like the present invention, but none capture both hydrostatic and hydrokinetic wave energy or enhance energy capture with overhead floating bodies.
5. Gardner's AWS design evolved from twin vessels to a single vessel and then to an enclosed gas-filled vessel under partial vacuum, while Burns' design uses a submerged sea bed mounted gas-filled container with a small diaphragm seal.
6. Meyerand's design uses a pressurized gas filled device that expands and contracts a bladder within a fixed volume sea bed deployed rigid container.
7. The present invention involves submerged gas tight containers with a fixed depth rigid end and a movable rigid end connected by a flexible, gas tight bellows.
8. Overhead waves and troughs produce hydrostatic pressure variations that compress and expand the container, and the relative linear motion is connected to a hydraulic or pneumatic pumping means.
9. The device can enhance efficiency by adjusting the submerged depth for tides and maintaining a relatively shallow submerged depth.

1. The invention describes a blade for scraped surface heat exchangers, having L-shaped locking tracks on both sides that work with mounting pins to facilitate installation (Point 1: Sentences 1-3). These tracks, with entry and intermediate sections, ensure the blade stays in place during installation and operation (Point 2: Sentences 4-6). The pin includes an inner and outer finger, with the inner finger designed to fit into the mounting hole of the blade (Point 3: Sentences 7-9).
2. The installation process begins by positioning the blade at an angle relative to the pin, allowing the outer finger to slide into the entry track (Point 4: Sentences 10-12). Next, the inner finger slides into the entry track, holding the blade at a specific angle (Point 5: Sentences 13-15).
3. The blade is then moved longitudinally so that the inner fingers align with the mounting holes, with the intermediate slot accommodating the width of the outer finger (Point 6: Sentences 16-18). In this position, the blade cannot slide back due to the intermediate track not extending past the hole (Point 7: Sentences 19-21).
4. Finally, the blade is rotated downward into an installation position, fitting within the outer tube of the heat exchanger (Point 8: Sentences 22-24). This design ensures the blades remain securely in place, preventing them from falling off the pins during installation or operation.

1. The invention describes a fixing mechanism for a tool used in machining materials, such as wood, plastics, or metal. The mechanism includes a tool, a frame, and a tool holder in the frame of a machine tool. The curved surface design of the connecting surfaces in the tool frame and tool holder allows for easy placement and secure fixing of the tool in the tool holder.
2. The tool holder is designed with a curvilinear connecting surface, specifically a spherical surface, that extends from the second contact surface in a direction perpendicular to the mounting direction. The tool frame surrounds the second connecting surface, and the first and second contact surfaces are placed against each other to transmit machining force.
3. The formula for the radius of curvature of the curvilinear surface is defined as r^2 = D^2 + d^2, where r is the radius of curvature, D is the radius of the second contact surface perpendicular to the mounting direction, and d is the distance between the center of the radius of curvature and the second contact surface in the mounting direction.
4. The fixing mechanism can be used in various applications, including cutting, punching, molding, and forming work, particularly in machining of metal sheets in sheet machining centers. The mechanism is an improvement over prior art conic fit fixing mechanisms, which have the disadvantage of easily clamping connecting surfaces too much against each other under axial forces.

1. Vehicle battery rebalancing is a process that corrects cell voltage imbalance conditions by measuring the voltage of each cell, identifying the cell with the minimum voltage, and bleeding down other cells via resistive circuitry until their voltages are approximately equal. This process continues until all cell voltage readings are approximately equal, after which the battery is charged.
2. A power system may include a battery with multiple cells and a controller that causes the cells to acquire charge for a period of time, resulting in approximately equal voltages at the expiration of that period. The rate of charge acquisition may differ among some cells for a determined portion of the period.
3. Rebalancing a battery can take up to 50% of the total time spent recharging and rebalancing a battery, and certain embodiments provide systems and techniques to reduce this time. The maximum capacity of a battery cell can be found using the relationship between the change in capacity and the change in state of charge, while the energy content of a cell can be approximated using the power applied to the cell over time.

1. Before September 2001, significant vulnerabilities in aviation security were identified, including weaknesses in passenger and baggage screening, access control, and air traffic control systems. These vulnerabilities were due to high turnover and insufficient training of screeners, inadequate access controls, and lack of protection for air traffic control systems and facilities.
2. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was enacted in response to these vulnerabilities, establishing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and setting security requirements for the agency. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had not fully implemented recommendations to improve screeners' performance, airport access controls, and air traffic control system security before ATSA's enactment.
3. Since ATSA's enactment, TSA has taken major steps to increase aviation security, including implementing congressional mandates, exploring technology options, and hiring over 65,000 employees. TSA has also met several deadlines, such as deploying federal screeners and using explosives detection systems for checked baggage.
4. Despite these efforts, vulnerabilities remain, particularly in air cargo, general aviation, and airport perimeter security. Legislative proposals have been made to address these potential vulnerabilities and other aviation security issues.

The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995, Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 4911, and IRC section 162(e) have different definitions of lobbying that cover various types of activities, contacts, and expenses. LDA covers federal lobbying only, while IRC sections 4911 and 162(e) cover federal, state, and local lobbying. Grassroots lobbying is covered under IRC sections 4911 and 162(e) but not under LDA. The definitions of covered officials also differ among the three, with LDA covering a broader range of officials for nonlegislative matters compared to IRC section 4911. IRC section 162(e) has a narrower definition of covered executive branch officials, which can result in organizations not including certain expenses or information related to contacts with high-ranking officials in their lobbying reports.
2. LDA covers any contacts with federal government officials on any legislative or nonlegislative matters covered by the act, while the IRC definitions require that the contact be on legislative or nonlegislative matters to determine which officials are covered. For contacts to influence legislation, both IRC definitions cover more levels of executive branch officials than LDA. However, for nonlegislative matters, IRC section 4911 covers no executive branch officials, and IRC section 162(e) covers very few.

1. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been assessing strategic sourcing in federal acquisitions for over a decade, finding that leading companies use a strategic approach to services acquisition that includes developing knowledge of spending, taking an enterprise-wide approach, and leveraging buying power.
2. Strategic sourcing can encompass various tactics such as leveraged buying, managing demand, standardizing acquisition processes, evaluating total cost of ownership, and managing supplier relationships.
3. Comprehensive spend analysis is crucial for efficient procurement, providing knowledge about spending patterns, buyers, suppliers, and opportunities for savings.
4. The federal government, due to its decentralized procurement process, often fails to fully leverage its buying power, acting more like unrelated businesses and relying on numerous contracts with varying prices.
5. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implemented strategic sourcing practices in 2005, directing agencies to develop and implement strategic sourcing efforts based on spend analysis results.
6. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) was established in 2005 to address government-wide opportunities for strategic sourcing and eliminate duplication of efforts across agencies.
7. In 2012, most agencies leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing, with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and Department of Veterans Affairs accounting for 80% of federal procurement spending but managing only 5% strategically.
8. Agencies that used strategically sourced contracts generally reported savings, with DHS achieving savings of 20% of spending and the FSSI program reporting almost 18% savings on procurement spending managed through government-wide initiatives.
9. Realizing cost savings and benefits from strategic sourcing depends on the utilization of these contracts, but only 15% of government-wide spending for covered products and services went through FSSI contracts in fiscal year 2011.

2. The military services collectively had approximately 226,000 SRC I missiles and rockets in the continental United States as of April 30, 2015. USTRANSCOM is designated as the DOD’s single manager for transportation, including the transportation of SRC I ammunition, while the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command tracks the movement of SRC I ammunition and coordinates responses to transportation issues. DODM 5100.76 sets forth DOD policy on the physical security of sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives, requiring continuous program and policy oversight and tracking of SRC I ammunition by serial number.

3. The military services maintain accountability of SRC I ammunition at various locations, but there are gaps in service-level guidance and procedures for tracking and recording accountability across locations. The Air Force does not track SRC I ammunition by serial number and has plans to revise its guidance, while the Navy and Marine Corps track SRC I ammunition by serial number.

1. Before 1996, Medicare program integrity activities were subsumed under Medicare's general administrative budget and performed by insurance companies under contract with CMS. However, this led to problems such as reduced ability to conduct audits and review medical claims due to funding constraints. In 1997, HIPAA established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) and provided CMS with dedicated funding for program integrity activities, with a range of funds available each year for these activities. As a result, total MIP expenditures increased from about $438 million in 1997 to $714 million in 2005.

2. CMS allocates MIP funds primarily to support contractors' program integrity efforts for the traditional Medicare program, known as fee-for-service Medicare. These contractors include fiscal intermediaries, carriers, Program Safeguard Contractors (PSCs), and Medicare administrative contractors (MAC). From 2006 to 2011, CMS is replacing all intermediaries and carriers with MACs through contracting reform. MIP funds are used to enter into contracts to promote the integrity of the Medicare program and are allocated to support various program integrity activities, such as audits, medical review, secondary payer activity, benefit integrity, and provider education.

3. From fiscal years 1997 through 2005, CMS generally increased the amount of funding for each of its five program integrity activities, but the amount of funding provided and the percentage increase varied among the activities. Provider education received the largest percentage increase in funds, while audit and medical review received the largest amount of funds overall. CMS increased its allocation for provider education by about 590 percent from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2005, due in part to the agency's decision in fiscal year 2002 to use MIP funds for outreach activities to groups of like providers.

CMS officials have allocated MIP funds to the five activities based predominantly on historical funding, but this approach does not take into account data or information on the effectiveness of one activity over the other in ensuring the integrity of Medicare.

Ginnie Mae also offers a Multiclass Securities Program, which includes Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMIC) and Ginnie Mae Platinum Securities, designed to tailor prepayment and interest rate risks to investors with varying investment goals.
3. Ginnie Mae's market share of new issuances and volume outstanding has declined over the last 20 years, both in terms of new issuances and volume outstanding, largely because FHA and VA loan origination has not kept pace with growth in the overall mortgage market and because securitization of conventional mortgages has become far more prevalent.

4. A broader, more integrated vision for transforming the electricity grid, known as the smart grid, would increase the use of IT systems and networks and two-way communication to automate actions.
5. Smart grid systems may have benefits, including improved reliability, downward pressure on electricity rates, an improved ability to use alternative sources of energy, and an improved ability to detect and respond to potential attacks.
6. Both the federal government and state governments have authority for overseeing the electricity industry, including regulating rates for wholesale electricity sales and transmission.
7. State and federal authorities also oversee the reliability of the electric grid, with state regulators generally having authority over the local distribution system and NERC responsible for conducting reliability assessments.
8. Threats to the electricity industry and its transmission and distribution systems are evolving and growing, including unintentional threats caused by natural disasters or careless employees and intentional threats from criminal groups or foreign nations.
9. These threats can adversely affect federal information, computers, software, networks, and operations, and expose the electric grid to potential and known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
10. Multiple entities, including NERC, NIST, FERC, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Energy, have taken steps to help secure the electricity grid, but challenges remain in monitoring implementation of cybersecurity standards and clarifying regulatory responsibilities. </summary>",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30}"

1. The federal workforce faces mission-critical skills gaps, which hinder the government's ability to efficiently serve the public. These gaps may be due to insufficient staffing or lack of appropriate skills.
2. Budget constraints, changing work nature, and a potential wave of retirements could exacerbate existing skills gaps, risking further impediments in institutional knowledge and leadership.
3. Over one-third of the federal workforce will be eligible to retire by 2020, with some agencies facing particularly high retirement rates.
4. Retirements can create opportunities for fresh skills and organizational restructuring but must be strategically managed to prevent knowledge and leadership gaps.
5. Existing tools can help address talent needs, but past work has identified issues in classification, recruiting, pay, performance management, and employee engagement.
6. Federal pay should be aligned with private sector pay, but the current system has not been reexamined since 2012, leading to potential inaccuracies in pay comparisons.
7. The federal workforce requires more advanced skills at higher grade levels than in the past, with a greater focus on professional, administrative, and technical roles.
8. Balancing workforce size and composition is a challenge, as the federal government's pay system does not align well with modern compensation principles.
9. Implementing a market-based and performance-oriented pay system is difficult but desirable, requiring effective performance management systems and a shift in compensation culture.

2. Estimating GWOT costs is difficult due to changing operational requirements, and any cost overruns can be covered by transferring and reprogramming funds, reducing peacetime operations spending, or using transfer authority to shift funds between appropriation accounts.
3. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received about $52.4 billion and $62.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses.
4. However, DOD and the military services have lost visibility over GWOT funds provided through annual appropriations, making it unclear how much, if any, was used to support GWOT in those years.
5. Program Budget Decision 736, approved in 2002, increased DOD's annual budget request by more than $10 billion per year until 2007 to enhance efforts against terrorism.
6. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the Army, Air Force, and Navy received additional funds in their annual appropriations, totaling about $7.9 billion, for GWOT support.
7. Some of these funds were intended for Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom, but DOD and the military services cannot identify which programs or activities received the funds or how they were eventually expended.
8. In fiscal year 2005, the military services had about $62.1 billion available to pay for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance costs.

1. The baby boomer generation, those born between 1946 and 1964, will start turning 65 in 2011, leading to significant changes in the working to retirement-age ratio. This shift is due not only to the increasing numbers of older individuals but also to the slowing growth of the younger labor force.
2. The aged dependency ratio, which measures the number of working-age individuals to each retiree, will rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% in 2030, meaning fewer working-age individuals for every retiree. This change is partly due to recent modifications in Social Security retirement policy, such as the elimination of benefit reductions for working retirees and the increase in delayed retirement credits.
3. Federal laws like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) aim to protect older workers from discrimination and encourage their employment based on ability. However, these laws only apply to firms with 20 or more employees, leaving smaller businesses unregulated.
4. Pension benefits play a crucial role in retirement income, and the federal government provides tax incentives for employers to establish pension plans that meet certain requirements. However, many pension plans have features that encourage early retirement, which can discourage employment among older individuals.
5. The number of older workers will grow substantially over the next two decades, with the largest increase expected between 2000 and 2015. Older workers are employed in a diverse range of occupations, and their labor force participation rates have been increasing, especially among women. Employers and workers will need to address flexible employment programs in the collective bargaining context to prepare for this demographic shift.

2. The program aims to boost international business and tourism, increase airline revenues, and create economic benefits for the United States while allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to allocate more resources to visa-issuing posts in countries with higher risk applicant pools.
3. In 2002, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibility for managing the VWP from the Department of Justice to DHS, which created the Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit in 2004 to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating countries' adherence to program requirements.
4. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 and the 9/11 Act added security requirements and mandated assessments of each country's continued participation in the VWP every 2 years.
5. To qualify for the VWP, a country must offer reciprocal visa-free travel privileges to U.S. citizens, have a low refusal rate for business and tourism visas, issue machine-readable passports, share information on lost or stolen passports, accept repatriation of removed citizens, and not compromise U.S. law enforcement or security interests.
6. E-passports with digital photographs and biometric identifiers are required for all VWP travelers since 2006, and nationals from countries that joined the VWP since 2008 must use e-passports for travel.

2. To find permanent placements for foster children, states must develop case plans, review them every 6 months, and hold a permanency hearing within 18 months, with additional hearings required if a final decision is not made.
3. Placement options include reuniting the child with their family, adoption, or long-term foster care due to special needs or circumstances. Some states have shortened the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing to less than 18 months.
4. Earlier permanency hearings may expedite the permanent placement process, but could also increase the number of children in long-term foster care if other placement options cannot be developed.
5. States have implemented various operational and procedural changes to improve the permanency process, including low-cost, creative methods for addressing specific barriers to reuniting families.

2. The agreement between ARC and OSC is a mechanism for interagency contracting, which involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services. OSC officials failed to follow required competition procedures when contracting with MPRI for an organizational assessment.

3. GSA's Schedule program is considered a competitive procedure, but ordering offices are required to prepare a request for quotes, evaluate contractor catalogs and price lists, and place the order with the Schedule contractor that represents the best value. OSC officials did not follow these procedures when ordering services from GSA's MOBIS schedule.

4. Instead, ARC approved a written sole-source justification prepared by OSC, which did not contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify a sole-source order. The justification merely asserted that MPRI was uniquely qualified for the task, but the cited market survey did not provide a credible foundation for this conclusion.

5. OSC officials could not recall how three vendors, including MPRI, were selected, and no documentation was available setting forth the requirement to which the vendors were responding.

TODs can vary in size and scope, with some in major urban centers and others in suburban neighborhoods. TODs can increase access to opportunities, promote transportation options, and reduce road congestion.
2. A range of stakeholders plays a crucial role in TOD planning and implementation. Local transit agencies are responsible for building, maintaining, and operating transit systems. State and local departments of transportation, metropolitan-planning organizations, and local governments are involved in transportation planning and land use control. Private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts also contribute to TOD projects.
3. FTA provides funds for transit projects but does not have a specific TOD program. However, FTA has expanded its role in TOD by funding research, coordinating with other agencies, and implementing a transit-oriented development planning pilot program. The Capital Investment Grant program, which has funded a large share of the nation's transit capital investment since the 1970s, also supports TOD through eligible projects.
4. FTA evaluates proposed projects for New Starts funding using criteria such as mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, cost-effectiveness, economic development, and land use. Two of these criteria, economic development effects and land use, require documentation related to whether current and future land use is supportive of transit. FTA evaluates many factors that support transit-oriented development, such as development character, pedestrian facilities, parking supply, and affordable housing.

Federal efforts to promote the employment of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce include special hiring authorities, such as the Schedule A excepted service hiring authority and appointments for veterans with disabilities. To qualify for a Schedule A appointment, an applicant must provide proof of disability and a certification of job readiness.

2. Executive Order 13548 requires federal agencies to develop plans for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities, designate a senior-level official to oversee these efforts, and improve return-to-work outcomes for employees who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses. The executive order also mandates that OPM and Labor have oversight responsibilities to ensure successful implementation. The federal government tracks the number of individuals with disabilities in the workforce through OPM’s Standard Form 256, Self-Disclosure of Disability (SF-256).

The federal government, in cooperation with state, local governments, and private organizations, is responsible for the admission and resettlement process.
2. Refugees are placed in communities where national voluntary agency affiliates have been successful in resettling refugees, and this can lead to the same communities being asked to absorb refugees year after year. There are limited guidelines for voluntary agencies when consulting with state and local stakeholders, and PRM has directed local voluntary agencies to document these consultations.
3. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) approves refugees for admission to the United States, and State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) is responsible for processing refugees overseas. PRM partially funds services to meet refugees' immediate needs upon arrival, and national voluntary agencies provide funding and help refugees settle into their respective communities during their initial 30 to 90 days.
4. Many refugees are then eligible to receive temporary resettlement assistance from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), located within HHS. In most states, ORR funds cash and medical assistance as well as social services to help refugees become economically self-sufficient. ORR provides these funds through grants to state refugee coordinators, who may be employed by a state agency or by a nonprofit organization.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is an independent federal corporation established by the TVA Act to improve the quality of life in the Tennessee River Valley through navigation improvement, agricultural and economic development, and floodwater control. TVA built dams and hydropower facilities on the Tennessee River and its tributaries.

2. The TVA Act of 1933 initially provided TVA with annual appropriations to finance its cash and capital requirements. However, in 1959, Congress amended the act, giving TVA the authority to finance its power program through revenue from electricity sales and borrowing while requiring it to repay a substantial portion of the annual appropriations.

3. TVA must design its rates to cover all costs but keep rates as low as feasible, charging rates for power that will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for its costs, including operating, administrative, and maintenance costs. TVA can borrow by issuing bonds and notes, with a Congressionally set limit of $30 billion outstanding at any given time.

4. Legislation also limits competition between TVA and other utilities, with TVA prohibited from entering into contracts to sell power outside its primary source of power supply area as of July 1, 1957, except for some exceptions. This ""fence"" restricts TVA's ability to expand substantially outside its service area.

2. By 1986, First City was reporting operating losses, and its regulators, along with the FDIC, recognized that many of its subsidiary banks could not survive without major infusions of capital. Due to the weak economy and banking industry in the Southwest, it was agreed that the capital needed for long-term viability could not come solely from the private sector.
3. In 1988, FDIC and First City entered into a recapitalization agreement, also known as open bank assistance, which included a $970 million capital infusion from FDIC and $500 million of private capital raised by the new bank management. As part of the agreement, FDIC received $970 million in preferred stock of a collecting bank and a guarantee for $100 million payable in 1998 toward the retirement of the collecting bank's preferred stock.

1. In the 1980s, there were concerns about the lack of oversight and accountability for federal assistance provided to state and local governments, leading to the passage of the Single Audit Act in 1984. This act required state and local governments receiving at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance to have a single audit conducted annually.
2. The objectives of the Single Audit Act are to promote sound financial management, establish uniform requirements for audits, reduce burdens on state and local governments, and ensure that federal departments and agencies rely on audit work done pursuant to the act. The single audit is an organization-wide financial statement audit focusing on internal control and compliance with laws and regulations.
3. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the act, establishing uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients, ensuring a more cost-beneficial threshold for requiring single audits, and focusing audit work on programs that present the greatest financial risk to the federal government.
4. The Single Audit Act has been essential in providing accountability for billions of dollars in federal funds provided to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations, but the quality of single audits has been a longstanding concern.

A civilian advisory board, the Defense Science Board (DSB), was tasked with identifying DOD activities that could be done more efficiently by the private sector and estimating the expected savings from outsourcing.
2. The DSB's first report, released in 1996, focused on outsourcing and privatization issues, concluding that DOD could save 30-40% of logistics costs by outsourcing support services. A second report, also from 1996, expanded the scope to include other methods for reducing infrastructure costs.
3. The DSB's vision involved DOD focusing on warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy-making, and oversight, while the private sector would handle all other activities. This aggressive initiative could generate $7-12 billion in annual savings by 2002, with $6 billion from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities.

1. The Military Health System (MHSS) is responsible for medical readiness, providing medical support during combat and maintaining the health of active-duty military personnel during peacetime. The MHSS has an annual budget of over $15 billion and maintains uniformed health care providers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The MHSS may also support nonactive-duty beneficiaries if resources are available, with excess care purchased from the civilian sector. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists play a crucial role in the MHSS's medical readiness mission by providing mental health care to active-duty personnel. Both professionals can diagnose mental conditions and provide psychotherapy, but only psychiatrists can prescribe medication due to their medical training.

2. Psychiatrists undergo 4 years of medical school, a year-long clinical internship, and a 3-year psychiatric residency, allowing them to evaluate and treat organic and mental conditions. This extensive medical training enables psychiatrists to diagnose organic mental disorders, which can have symptoms similar to mental disorders, and distinguish them from conditions like diabetes and thyroid disease. Clinical psychologists, on the other hand, complete 6 to 8 years of graduate school and postdoctoral clinical experience, focusing on theories of human development and behavior. Their general approach to mental health care is psychosocial, relying on observing behavior to diagnose and treat mental conditions.

3. In response to the 1989 DOD Appropriations Act, the MHSS created the Prescribing Psychologist Demonstration Project (PPDP) to increase the scope of practice for clinical psychologists, allowing them to prescribe psychotropic medication when needed. The PDP was established by the Army's Office of the Surgeon General, with a blue-ribbon panel determining the best method for implementation. The project began in 1991, with a 2-year training model consisting of coursework at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences (USUHS) and clinical experience at Walter Reed Army Medical Center or Malcolm Grow Medical Center. PDP participants receive a certificate of ""Fellowship in Psychopharmacology for Psychologists"" upon completion and are known as ""prescribing psychologists.""

It consists of three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. The observatory segment includes elements such as the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft, as well as major subsystems like the sunshield and cryocooler.

2. JWST's development has faced numerous technical challenges, resulting in significant cost increases and schedule delays. To accommodate these risks, the project has allocated schedule reserve to specific activities, elements, and major subsystems. However, if an element or major subsystem exhausts its schedule reserve, it may impact the critical path and overall project schedule. Cost reserves are also held by the project manager and contractors to mitigate unanticipated issues.

3. The OTE, ISIM, and sunshield are designed to fold and stow for launch, while the sunshield protects the mirrors and instruments from heat. The MIRI instrument requires a two-stage cooler subsystem to cool the infrared light detector to about 6.7 Kelvin. Northrop Grumman, Harris, and the Space Telescope Science Institute are the primary contractors responsible for developing various components of JWST.

4. JWST's integration and testing activities are divided into five separate periods, with three contractors playing major roles. The project is currently on schedule, but all elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the critical path, potentially reducing schedule reserve. Testing can uncover problems that may require additional schedule reserve, and the unusual complexity of JWST further heightens these risks.

5. To ensure mission success, the project must address over 100 technical risks and fully test and understand potential areas for mission failure before launch. Overall project schedule reserve remains above Goddard requirements, but the use of schedule reserve on any element or major subsystem may reduce the overall project schedule reserve. Proactive steps are being taken to reduce risk before testing needs to commence.",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 15}"

2. The program includes Old Age Insurance, Survivors' Insurance, and Disability Insurance, which all share a common formula for calculating benefit levels.
3. Disability Insurance (DI) pays monthly cash benefits to nearly 7 million workers who can no longer remain in the workforce due to a severe long-term disability.
4. Social Security also provides benefits to over 11 million dependents, including payments to widows and widowers, surviving parents, and children under Survivors' Insurance.
5. Beneficiaries may face considerable hardships, as a disabling condition can make work and daily living more difficult, potentially causing financial difficulties in planning for death or disability.
6. Social Security was designed to serve as an income base on which to build, balancing the goals of income adequacy and individual equity.
7. The program has expanded over time to include dependents and disabled workers, with the first new type of benefits introduced in 1939 for elderly dependent wives and widows.

2. Once a person dies, farm program payments may continue to their estate under certain conditions, and an estate can receive payments for the first 2 years if it meets eligibility requirements for active engagement in farming. After 2 years, the estate can continue to receive program payments if it meets the active engagement requirement and is not kept open primarily to continue receiving payments.
3. Estates are commonly kept open for longer than 2 years due to various reasons, including asset distribution, probate complications, and tax and debt obligations. However, FSA must annually determine that the estate is still active and that obtaining farm program payments is not the primary reason it remains open.
4. A review of FSA case file documents found that FSA did not consistently make the required annual determinations, and the longer an estate was kept open, the less likely it was to receive all required determinations.

1. Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting entities that provide common administrative services, such as payroll processing and contracting, to federal agencies. DOD primarily uses two franchise funds, GovWorks and FedSource, for contracting services. These funds are required to recover their full costs and are allowed to retain up to 4% of their total annual income.

2. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to regulatory requirements. In obtaining contracting services through a franchise fund, three main parties share responsibilities: the government customer, the franchise fund, and the contractor. DOD program officials are most familiar with the technical requirements for the goods and services they need.

3. The franchise funds can either make use of their own or other agencies’ contracts, or they can develop new, customized contracts to satisfy a DOD customer’s needs. GovWorks generally uses other agencies’ contracts, and FedSource generally uses its own contracts. The franchise funds charge fees for services to cover their costs.

4. While use of other agencies’ contracting services may offer convenience and efficiency, prior work and agency inspectors general have identified problems, including lack of compliance with federal requirements for competition and lack of contractor oversight. The fee-for-service arrangement can also create an incentive to increase sales volume at the expense of complying with contracting policy and required procedures.

5. GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain the full benefits of competitive procedures, did not ensure fair and reasonable prices, and may have missed opportunities to achieve savings on behalf of DOD customers for millions of dollars worth of goods and services. Ensuring the proper execution of the contracting process is a shared responsibility of all parties involved in the acquisition process.

6. DOD customers told us they were under the impression that franchise funds ensure competition and analyze prices. However, we found numerous cases in which these practices did not occur. The FAR states that contracting officers must purchase goods and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices, and price competition is the preferred method to ensure that prices are fair and reasonable.

This has resulted in abnormally dense, continuous accumulations of vegetation that can fuel large or severe wildland fires and threaten lives, health, property, and infrastructure. Changing climate conditions, including drier conditions in certain parts of the country, have also increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons.
2. Federal and nonfederal entities collaborate in various ways to reduce the risk of wildland fire before a potential wildland fire incident occurs, through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. However, certain factors can affect federal-nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities. These factors include federal authorities, agency initiatives, joint community-level planning, leadership, community engagement, and agency resources for collaboration. Federal officials and stakeholders have also identified indirect factors that affect collaboration, such as community education, fire prevention messaging, and state and local requirements for private property owners to reduce risk.
3. Federal and nonfederal entities have identified actions that could help improve their ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. These actions include improving implementation of the Cohesive Strategy, increasing collaborative planning, expanding education, increasing prevention efforts, improving timber-processing capability, adopting state and local ordinances, and providing insurance incentives. For example, improving implementation of the Cohesive Strategy could involve developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results, while increasing collaborative planning could occur by developing or improving Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs) and increasing the frequency of collaborative in-person meetings ahead of fire seasons.
4. Certain laws and policies can affect collaboration efforts aimed at reducing risk to communities. For example, federal policies and authorities that require or enable collaboration are considered direct factors affecting collaboration, while community education can affect communities’ ability to take risk reduction actions that may or may not include collaboration with others. Federal authorities, such as the Good Neighbor Authority and the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004, can facilitate federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk. However, some federal and nonfederal entities are reluctant to use these authorities due to unclear guidance or lack of awareness.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) establishes an annual standard price for fuel, which is based on three components: crude oil, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs. Crude oil prices are forecasted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and adjusted for refinement and nonproduct costs. The standard price is intended to remain unchanged until the next budget year to shield military services from market price volatility.
2. DOD's actual costs for bulk fuel have differed considerably from its budget estimates in recent years, primarily due to fluctuations in fuel price and differences between the services' estimated and actual fuel consumption. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DOD underestimated or overestimated bulk fuel costs by approximately $3 billion in each of those years.
3. The differences between the price DOD paid for fuel and the price it charged its fuel customers—the standard price—accounted for, on average, 74 percent of the difference between estimated and actual costs. Crude oil prices and refinement markup costs accounted for most of the difference between the estimated standard price and actual fuel costs during fiscal years 2009 through 2013.
4. Differences in the price of crude oil accounted for most of the difference between the estimated and actual prices in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, while the refinement markup became the main driver of the difference in fiscal years 2011 through 2013. DOD increased the markup for refinement costs from 30 percent to 50 percent of the WTI price in fiscal year 2013 to account for these differences.
5. Differences between the services' estimated and actual fuel consumption levels also contributed to the overall difference between estimated and actual fuel costs. In fiscal year 2013, DOD underestimated the cost of fuel but overestimated its consumption by approximately 19 million barrels, or 17 percent.
6. DOD has taken actions to manage fluctuations in the cash balance of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund caused by differences between its estimated and actual fuel costs. These actions included transferring funds into the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund from other accounts and adjusting the standard price DOD charged to its fuel customers.

The audit involved reviewing refunds, analyzing IRS data, visiting walk-in sites, testing telephone systems, and interviewing IRS officials.

(a) The audit found that the IRS exceeded its accuracy and timeliness goals for processing refunds and returns, and more taxpayers used alternative filing methods like electronic filing.
(b) However, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) continued to be a significant source of errors, contributing to the IRS' error resolution workload.

1. Medicaid was established in 1965 as a joint federal-state program providing medical assistance to low-income individuals, with each state designing and administering its own program under federal requirements.
2. In recent years, Medicaid costs have escalated, leading some states to seek capitated managed care systems, but certain provisions of the Medicaid law inhibit states' use of managed care.
3. States can obtain waivers of these provisions from HCFA under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, allowing HCFA to waive a broad range of Medicaid requirements for state demonstration projects.
4. HCFA requires budget neutrality in granting waivers, meaning federal expenditures for the entire demonstration project should not exceed costs projected for the existing Medicaid program.
5. As of June 1995, 10 states had HHS-approved statewide waivers, 8 had applications pending, and 5 had inquired about submitting waiver applications.
6. Tennessee was the first state to move its Medicaid program enrollees to a statewide demonstration project in January 1994, using a capitated managed care system to expand coverage to the uninsured population and control total program and state costs.
7. TennCare's ceilings on total allowable federal funding are intended to be budget neutral, with state-federal sharing arrangements favoring the state due to several waiver provisions.
8. TennCare includes provisions to monitor and ensure enrollee access to quality care, with enrollees who are not eligible for Medicaid and have incomes above the poverty level required to pay monthly premiums.
9. To finance expanded coverage while keeping Medicaid expenditures within the budget limits set by the waiver agreement, Tennessee set capitation rates substantially below historical Medicaid costs and discontinued its DSH program.
10. The TennCare waiver agreement includes an overall available federal funding limit for the 5-year waiver period and sets interim limits on the availability of federal funding, with the federal spending limits applying to the total TennCare program expenditures, including Medicaid expenditures for services not covered under capitated payments.

NIDA, a federal research agency, was able to detect this change through surveys and a work group of epidemiologists, but it could not collect national prevalence data on crack use in the general household population until the late 1980s due to limitations in its drug detection mechanisms.
2. NIDA sponsored several drug detection mechanisms in the 1970s and 1980s, including the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), Monitoring the Future (MTF), the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), and the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG). These mechanisms targeted different populations and covered different geographic locations and time periods, and NIDA used them to track changes in cocaine use.
3. In the 1980s, NIDA was aware of the rapid spread of crack use in major metropolitan areas, but it could not measure the national prevalence of crack use in the general household population until the late 1980s.

1. In the mid-1970s, major structural changes in the American economy led to the dislocation of thousands of workers, resulting in the need for job training and reemployment services. Demonstration projects in several states in the 1980s and 1990s showed the effectiveness of using statistical methods and administrative data to identify those likely to experience long-term joblessness. The Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993 required states to establish a system of profiling all new claimants for UI regular compensation, identifying those likely to exhaust regular compensation and refer them to reemployment services.

2. Under the law, states must require claimants who have been referred to reemployment services to participate in those services as a condition of eligibility for receiving compensation. Labor issued guidance to help states establish profiling tools and provide necessary reemployment services, considering factors such as whether the claimant has a date for being recalled to work, union status, first unemployment benefit payment, and previous industry or occupation of employment. States are required to collect information on the type of services claimants receive, their participation, and their subsequent employment outcomes.

In FY 1999, DOD's annual appropriations included about $16 billion for healthcare, with over $1 billion funding senior care. The TRICARE framework, implemented in the mid-1990s, aimed to improve access, quality, and cost containment through three options: Prime, Extra, and Standard. TRICARE covers inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing, and prescription drug services through MTFs and a network of civilian providers.

2. Medicare is a federally financed health insurance program for the elderly, some disabled individuals, and people with end-stage kidney disease. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees. Medicare enrollees receive part A benefits and are eligible for optional part B benefits by paying a monthly premium. Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries choose their own providers, and Medicare reimburses them on a fee-for-service basis. Beneficiaries are responsible for paying a share of the costs for services.

3. In 2001, significant changes in retiree benefits and military healthcare occurred due to the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. This legislation granted older retirees two major benefits: a pharmacy benefit and TRICARE eligibility (TRICARE For Life).

1. The distribution of prescription drugs in the United States involves multiple entities, including wholesalers, independent pharmacies, Pharmacy Services Administrative Organizations (PSAOs), and third-party payers with their Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). These entities facilitate the flow of drugs from manufacturers to consumers.
2. Wholesalers, such as AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation, and Cardinal Health Inc., purchase drugs in bulk from manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies. Independent pharmacies, which accounted for 34% of retail pharmacies in 2010, acquire drugs primarily from wholesalers and dispense them to consumers.
3. Third-party payers, which accounted for 80% of drug expenditures in 2010, often use PBMs to manage their prescription drug benefits. PBMs assemble networks of retail pharmacies, including independent pharmacies, where enrollees can fill prescriptions.
4. Pharmacies, especially independent ones, rely on PSAOs to negotiate contracts with third-party payers or PBMs, as these contracts significantly affect their financial viability. PSAOs represent over 75% of total independent pharmacies in the United States.
5. PSAOs offer key services, such as contract negotiation, communication, and help-desk services, which distinguish them from other entities in the pharmaceutical industry. They may also provide additional services, like inventory management or front store layout assistance.
6. PSAOs negotiate various contract provisions, including reimbursement rates, payment terms, and audits, with third-party payers or PBMs on behalf of member pharmacies. However, many PBM contracts contain standard terms and conditions that are largely nonnegotiable.
7. PSAOs vary in their requirements for member pharmacies, with some requiring participation in all contracts and others allowing pharmacies to choose specific contracts. PSAOs also serve as a communication link between member pharmacies and third-party payers or PBMs.

530," 1. East Asian nations, including China, Japan, and South Korea, have had exchange rate policies that have caused tension with the United States due to allegations of currency manipulation to gain an unfair competitive advantage. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the Department of the Treasury to analyze the exchange rate policies of major trading partners. In its 2017 report, Treasury found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for being labeled a currency manipulator, but it did identify six countries for its ""Monitoring List,"" including four East Asian economies.

2. Different exchange rate policies have various advantages and disadvantages. A ""free float"" policy allows a nation more autonomy with its domestic monetary policy but comes with greater exchange-rate risk, potentially destabilizing balance sheet effects, and possible rapid shifts in capital flows. A ""pegged"" exchange rate policy, on the other hand, eliminates exchange-rate risk but results in the loss of autonomy in domestic monetary policy and potential rapid changes in domestic prices.

3. East Asian governments generally prefer a ""managed float"" exchange rate policy, which allows the value of their domestic currency to fluctuate in international forex markets until certain designated economic indicators reach critical levels. This approach provides them with greater control over their currencies and allows for intervention in international forex markets to maintain stability.

4. The International Monetary Fund classifies East Asian nations' exchange rate policies into three categories: floating, managed, and pegged. Japan is the only country that allows its currency to float freely, while five nations, including India and Vietnam, float their currencies but reserve the right to intervene in forex markets. Seven countries, including South Korea and the Philippines, manage their exchange rates according to certain economic objectives. Brunei and Hong Kong operate a currency board system that effectively pegs their exchange rates.

5. Classifying a government's exchange rate policy can be complicated, especially during periods of financial turbulence. For example, South Korea's official exchange rate policy has been a free floating system since December 1997, but there have been instances where the South Korean government intervened in forex markets to maintain stability. Similar allegations have been made about China's exchange rate policy, with some analysts asserting that China abandoned its ""crawling peg"" policy in favor of a peg",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24}"

1. China's economy is heavily dependent on global trade and investment, with exports and FDI playing significant roles in its growth. In 2007, China became the world's second-largest merchandise exporter, and its net exports contributed to one-third of its GDP growth. Exports of goods and services as a share of GDP rose from 9.1% in 1985 to 37.8% in 2008.
2. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a major factor in China's productivity gains and rapid economic growth. FDI flows to China in 2007 totaled $75 billion, making it the largest FDI recipient among developing countries. The current global economic slowdown, however, has negatively impacted China's export sector and industries that depend on FDI flows.
3. China's exposure to the global financial crisis, particularly from the fallout of the U.S. sub-prime mortgage problem, is unclear. While restrictions on capital flows limit the exposure of Chinese private sector firms and individual investors, Chinese government entities may have been more exposed to troubled U.S. mortgage securities.
4. China's economy has not been immune to the effects of the global financial crisis. The real estate market, stock market, trade, and FDI have all experienced significant declines. In response, the Chinese government has implemented a two-year, 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package to rebalance the economy and promote long-term competitiveness.

2. The MLLA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas deposits on public domain lands, including National Forest System (NFS) lands and most reserved subsurface mineral estates, with exceptions for certain categories of lands.
3. The Secretary of the Interior cannot issue leases for NFS lands reserved from the public domain if the Secretary of Agriculture objects, and the U.S. Forest Service has issued separate regulations governing certain aspects of leasing and permitting for oil and gas development on lands within its jurisdiction.
4. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop and revise land use plans (RMPs) for public lands managed by BLM, which serve as the initial determinant of which lands may be subject to leasing, and the Secretary must generally apply multiple use and sustained yield principles when developing RMPs.
5. The Forest Service also manages its lands under multiple use and sustained yield policies, develops land management plans for NFS lands, and classifies lands into three categories for potential leasing, while complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) when analyzing NFS lands for potential leasing.
6. The MLLA authorizes both competitive and noncompetitive leasing procedures, with public lands offered for competitive leasing through an oral auction and noncompetitive leasing available for two years after the competitive bidding auction for the first qualified person who applies.

In contrast, 77% of filers with AGI between $100,000 and $200,000, and 5% of filers with AGI less than $20,000 itemized, claiming an average of $25,598 and $15,857, respectively.
2. The distribution of itemized deductions is concentrated among higher-income filers, with 63.6% of total deduction claims (amounts, in dollars) made by filers with AGI greater than $100,000. Although filers with an AGI more than $1 million comprised 0.8% of itemizers, they claimed 13.1% of all itemized tax deductions in 2014.
3. Specific deductions benefit different income groups, with charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes claimed more frequently by higher-income filers. The mortgage interest deduction is the largest single deduction for filers with an AGI less than $500,000, while the deduction for state and local income taxes is the largest for filers with an AGI greater than $500,000.

However, there are concerns about undesirable economic consequences and the potential opposition from higher-income taxpayers. Proposed reforms include flat, dollar-value or percentage-of-income caps, limiting the tax rate at which deductions can be valued, converting deductions into credits, and other options.

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a federal law that aims to protect and recover species facing extinction. It requires federal agencies to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to ensure their actions do not jeopardize listed species or destroy critical habitats.
2. The ESA has an exemption process that allows federal agencies, state governors, or permit/license applicants to seek relief from jeopardy findings if they believe the required reasonable and prudent alternatives would significantly hinder their projects. This process considers extraordinary economic circumstances and allows economic factors to potentially override jeopardy to the species.
3. The exemption process is rarely used, with only six instances since the ESA's enactment in 1973, and two grants. The process involves the Endangered Species Committee (ESC), which evaluates applications and grants exemptions if certain criteria are met, including the absence of reasonable and prudent alternatives and the project's regional or national significance.
4. Exemptions do not apply to the species as a whole but to specific federal agency actions. Even with an exemption, the FWS or NMFS must continue to recover the species, and the burden of conservation may fall more heavily on other areas the species inhabits or on other resources the species requires.
5. The exemption process is complex and time-consuming, taking up to 280 days. Applicants must fund any required mitigation measures, which could be considerable, and face potential controversy and legal challenges even if an exemption is granted. Other laws may still be in play, and conflicts may remain, as the ESA's strong legal protections for listed species often force decisions on issues that have long been in conflict.

537," 1. The net capital loss limitation was enacted to prevent taxpayers from manipulating the timing of their capital gains and losses realizations to minimize their income tax liabilities. The limitation does not apply to unlimited carry forwards of excess losses, but it reduces the taxpayer's present value of tax savings. The current system, even without indexing the $3,000 loss for inflation, is more generous than the system that existed in 1978. Capital gains are concentrated at the higher end of the income range, while lower and middle income taxpayers are unlikely to be much affected by the expansion of capital losses due to their limited direct holdings of stock and the increasing proportion of their assets held in tax-favored forms.

2. Most capital losses are realized on assets predominantly owned by higher income taxpayers, and only a small fraction of taxpayers experience a net capital loss. Taxpayers with net capital losses can deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income, but about 60% are subject to the loss limit and have to carryover the excess losses to subsequent years. Raising the capital loss limit would benefit a relatively small proportion of high income individuals. The primary objective of recent economic proposals is to stimulate the economy, and direct government spending on goods and services or transfers and tax cuts for lower income individuals would tend to be more effective than a capital gains tax cut. The link between capital gains tax relief and increased stock market values is uncertain, and an expanded capital loss deduction could easily depress stock prices further due to increased sales of depressed stocks.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) guarantees the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of their choosing, with the goal of mitigating and eliminating labor-related obstructions to the free flow of commerce. The NLRA applies to ""employees,"" excluding those with supervisory authority.
2. The NLRA defines a ""supervisor"" as an individual who, in the interest of the employer, has authority to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action. The term ""independent judgment"" is key to determining supervisory status.
3. In the case of Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that ""independent judgment"" does not exclude judgment informed by professional or technical training or experience. The Court maintained that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) erred in characterizing such judgment as not being independent.
4. The NLRB, in Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., later defined the terms ""assign,"" ""responsibly to direct,"" and ""independent judgment"" as used in the NLRA. These definitions aim to provide guidance on supervisory status determinations.
5. The NLRB concluded that the term ""assign"" refers to designating an employee to a place, appointing an employee to a time, or giving significant overall duties or tasks to an employee. ""Responsibly to direct"" applies to individuals overseeing work and being held accountable for its outcome.
6. The NLRB interpreted ""independent judgment"" as requiring an individual to act or effectively recommend action that is free of the control of others and formed by discerning and comparing data. A judgment is not independent if dictated by detailed instructions or company policies.

The AMT base does not include benefits from lower capital gains tax rates and tax-exempt bonds, and the exemptions are not indexed to inflation.
2. The number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has significantly increased since 1987, from 140,000 to an estimated 9 million in 2009, primarily due to the exemptions not being indexed to inflation. This growth will affect a larger portion of joint returns and returns with tax liability.
3. The AMT will gradually reach further down into the income distribution, affecting more middle and upper-middle income taxpayers over time, even without the tax cuts in H.R. 1836. The shift in exposure to the AMT is dramatic, with a decrease in high-income taxpayers and an increase in middle and upper-middle income taxpayers.
4. Correcting the AMT by indexing AMT exemptions and eliminating the credit limit provision would cost billions of dollars. The AMT tax liability is projected to rise from $6.4 billion in 2001 to $38.2 billion in 2010, and any tax cut that reduces regular tax liabilities without altering the AMT will interact with the AMT, causing some families not to receive the full tax cut.

MPCs are derived from raw milk and are used in various food products, animal feed, and industrial products. Currently, U.S. imports of MPCs have limited or no trade restrictions while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas.

2. Advocates for stricter import controls on MPCs argue that it would prevent the unlimited importation of milk protein and encourage the use of domestically produced protein, raising milk prices for dairy farmers. However, opponents argue that it would increase their costs and result in higher retail food prices. Additionally, major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 4}"

2. The bill requires individuals to maintain health insurance and imposes a tax on certain employers with more than 50 employees who do not provide insurance, with exceptions for hardship cases.
3. Market reforms include modified community rating, guaranteed issue and renewal, and a requirement for essential health benefits coverage.
4. Qualifying coverage includes QHBPs offered in or out of an exchange, new group or individual coverage that meets or exceeds minimum health benefits, grandfathered employment-based plans, and other coverage such as Medicare and Medicaid.

553," 1. High risk health insurance pools (HRPs) are established by 35 states to provide health insurance options for individuals who cannot obtain or afford coverage in the private market due to preexisting health conditions. These pools generally cover people who have been denied coverage or received high quotes from insurers in the individual market. HRPs also help states comply with HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions.

Enrollment in HRPs is limited, with approximately 200,000 individuals enrolled in 2008, while an estimated 4 million additional persons were potentially eligible. This limited enrollment is due to the narrow focus on individuals with preexisting health conditions who are not eligible for public or group health insurance and seek coverage in the private, non-group market.

1. The private health insurance market primarily serves individuals through the group market, where insurers provide health benefits to groups drawn together by an employer or organization. In contrast, the nongroup market requires applicants to undergo rigorous medical underwriting, which can lead to rejection, riders excluding coverage for specific health conditions, or higher premiums compared to group market coverage.

HRPs were designed to assist individuals with moderate to severe health conditions who have limited options for private health coverage. Supporters of HRPs argue that they efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals, stabilize the market, promote competition, and retain insurance carriers. However, critics contend that HRPs are generally too small and underfunded to meet the needs of the majority of uninsured individuals with serious medical conditions.

1. Federal and state laws restrict insurers' ability to reject applications or design coverage based on health factors in the nongroup market. Nonetheless, some applicants are rejected, receive offers with health condition exclusions, or face higher premiums compared to group market coverage.

State high risk pools usually operate at a loss, requiring states to tap other sources of funding to cover operating expenses. These sources include assessments on insurers, general revenue, and other state sources. Almost all states with HRPs assess a fee on insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations, while some also place assessments on hospitals. Many state HRPs also receive grants from the federal government.

1. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a program established in 1951, allowing the Department of Defense (DOD) to use commercial aircraft to meet national airlift needs during emergencies. The CRAF consists of three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. Currently, 35 carriers with 1,262 aircraft are enrolled in the CRAF, with 1,172 aircraft in the international segment.

2. CRAF provides significant cost advantages compared to procuring and maintaining a larger organic fleet, as noted in a 1996 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. However, commercial aircraft have operational limitations, such as the inability to carry outsized cargo or conduct special missions. The RAND Corporation also highlighted the cost-effectiveness of CRAF, stating that replacing its Stage II capability with military-style transports would have cost the DOD about $1 billion annually.

3. DOD has been examining its air mobility fleet and quantifying future airlift requirements to determine if current force structure is sufficient. The Mobility Capability Study (MCS) completed in December 2005 called for the same level of CRAF contribution to total airlift capabilities as required in the prior study. However, DOD's projected use of CRAF to fulfill total airlift needs has increased from roughly 12 MTM/D in the late 1980s to roughly 20 MTM/D in 2005. Some favor acquisition of additional C-17s to meet potential current and future strategic airlift requirement shortfalls.

1. The Robinson-Patman Act (R-P) of 1936 was enacted to enable small businesses to compete with larger companies in purchasing commodities, particularly in the grocery store industry where smaller operators were suffering due to chain grocery stores and the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P). The act prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality."" It applies only to the sale of goods and only where each sale is of goods purchased for resale within the United States.

2. The R-P Act was the first federal antitrust law to address injury to competitors rather than generalized injury to competition itself. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been entrusted with the enforcement of the act, although it has acted inconsistently in this regard. The act permits price differentials for commodities not of ""like grade and quality"" and for sales for export.

3. An affirmative defense to refute the Robinson-Patman illegality of differential pricing is the ""meeting competition"" defense, which allows a defendant to assert that the lower price charged to a favored buyer was selected to meet the competition of a competing seller or to enable the buyer to meet the competition of one of its competitors. A seller may not, however, knowingly ""beat"" the prices of a competitor.

4. Another defense to an allegation of unlawful price differentials under the Robinson-Patman Act is the 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act, which expressly permits price breaks on purchases of supplies for their own use by schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions not operated for profit. The Supreme Court has interpreted this exemption strictly, limiting its application to purchases made in order to enable the institution to meet its needs and those of its staff.

5. In the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the Supreme Court provided significant interpretations of the scope of the nonprofit exemption from the Robinson-Patman prohibition, holding that not all purchases made by a nonprofit hospital are necessarily exempt from price discrimination prohibitions and that government purchases for use in retail competition with private enterprise are fully subject to the strictures of the act.

Damage or destruction could disrupt vital human services, threaten public health and the environment, or cause loss of life. Most water infrastructure is government-owned, making it a possible symbolic and political target.
2. Water infrastructure systems are interconnected with other infrastructure systems, such as electric power and transportation, as well as the chemical industry. These interconnections were evident during the 2003 electricity blackout and natural disasters like the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and 2007 Mississippi River floods. Water infrastructure includes sources of untreated water, dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, pipes, treatment facilities, finished water reservoirs, distribution systems, and wastewater collection and treatment facilities.

1. The past decade has seen significant debate and proposals related to fire protection programs and funding, with substantial increases in funding for wildfire protection on federal, state, and private lands. The National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act were enacted in 2000 and 2003, respectively, to increase funding for fire protection and expedite fuel reduction on federal lands. The FLAME Act was enacted in 2009 to insulate other agency programs from high wildfire suppression costs.
2. Federal wildfire funding has remained at relatively high levels since 2000, and now constitutes a substantial portion of land management agency budgets. Severe fire seasons have become more common since 2000, with total wildfire funding for FY2008 reaching a record high of $4.46 billion.
3. Federal programs for wildfire protection can be categorized into three groups: protection of federal lands managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (FS) and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI); protection of non-federal lands through programs to assist state and local governments and communities; and fire research, fire facilities, and improvements in forest health.
4. The FS, created in 1905, initially focused on halting wildfires in the national forests following several large fires in 1910. The agency's aggressive fire control policies, aimed at keeping wildfires small, began to be questioned in the 1970s due to research showing the ecological benefits of wildfires.
5. In the 1990s, concerns were raised about unnaturally high fuel loads leading to catastrophic fires and spiraling suppression costs. Following the 1988 fires in Yellowstone, Congress established the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters, whose 1994 report described a situation of dangerously high fuel accumulations.
6. In response to the 1994 report, the Clinton Administration directed a review of federal fire policy, and the agencies released the new Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy & Program Review: Final Report in December 1995. The report recommended altering federal fire policy from priority for private property to equal priority for private property and federal resources, based on values at risk",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21}"

However, internal party rules, such as the Senate Republican Conference Rules, may require an indicted member to temporarily step down from leadership or committee positions.
2. Senators do not automatically forfeit their offices upon conviction of a felony, and there is no constitutional disability or disqualification for a conviction other than for certain treasonous conduct committed after taking an oath of office. Conviction of certain crimes may lead to internal legislative disciplinary proceedings, including censure or expulsion.
3. Expulsion from Congress does not result in the forfeiture of one's federal pension, but a Member's conviction of certain crimes may lead to the forfeiture of retirement annuities or the loss of creditable service towards a federal pension.
4. Indictment and/or conviction of a felony does not constitutionally disqualify one from being a Member of Congress, unless a Member's conviction is for certain treasonous conduct committed after taking an oath of office. The three qualifications for congressional office are age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state when elected.
5. No specific Rule of the Senate exists concerning the status of a Senator who has been indicted with respect to chairmanships or ranking Member status on committees of the Senate. Political parties in the Senate may adopt internal conference and caucus rules that affect a Senator's leadership and committee positions and assignments.
6. The Senate has discretion to discipline misconduct that the membership finds to be worthy of censure, reprimand, or expulsion from Congress. The most severe sanction of expulsion has historically involved either disloyalty to the United States or the violation of a criminal law involving the abuse of one's official position.

d. Most forestry assistance programs are administered by the FS but implemented by state partners, with the FS providing technical and financial aid, while direct federal financial assistance to private forest landowners may also be feasible through conservation programs.

2. To be eligible for most programs, states must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, consisting of a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions, threats, and strategies, as well as a long-term statewide forest resource strategy.

The country's extra-legal economy is so large that an accurate assessment of its size and structure is unavailable.
2. Corruption among Burmese officials, particularly in the military junta, facilitates trafficking and provides criminal groups with immunity from law enforcement. The same routes are used for various forms of trafficking, taking advantage of physical terrain that is difficult to control and ethnic tensions that hamper government control.
3. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma due to its role in transnational crime, including the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, which prohibits the indirect import of Burmese gems and imposes further sanctions on SPDC officials. The 111th Congress may continue to oversee U.S. policy toward Burma, including its role in criminal activity.
4. The UWSA, Shan State Army-South, Shan State Army-North, Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, ethnic Chinese criminal groups, and other armed groups have criminal networks that stretch from India to Malaysia and up into China. These groups, often linked to past or ongoing ethnic insurgencies, remain a transnational security threat for Burma and the region.
5. Corruption is widespread in Burma, with officials, especially in the border areas, believed to be involved in smuggling, money laundering, and other illicit activities. The SPDC has not indicted any military official above the rank of colonel for drug-related corruption, and Burmese military officers reportedly benefit financially from the earnings of transnational crime organizations.

The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) was established in 2004 with the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-199) to provide development assistance to low and lower-middle income countries based on their performance in three areas: ruling justly, investing in people, and pursuing sound economic policies. The MCA is managed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), headed by a CEO and overseen by a Board of Directors, including the Secretaries of State, Treasury, USAID Administrator, U.S. Trade Representative, and four others.

2. The MCA legislation resolved differences between the House and Senate on several key issues, such as the income eligibility of countries, the methodology for identifying best performers, and the selection process. The MCA programs are country-driven, with national development strategies and a U.S. role limited to technical assistance. The MCA is intended to focus exclusively on development goals without being influenced by other U.S. foreign policy and geo-strategic objectives.

The House Agriculture Committee completed markup of its version (H.R. 6083) in July 2012, and both bills aim to establish the direction of agricultural policy for the next several years.
2. The Senate bill would reduce spending by $23.1 billion over 10 years compared to the current ""baseline,"" while the House bill would reduce it by $35.1 billion. Both bills restructure farm commodity support, expand crop insurance coverage, consolidate conservation programs, revise the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and extend authority for USDA discretionary programs.
3. The bills differ in their approach to farm commodity programs, with the Senate bill providing only a revised revenue program (ARC) and the House bill offering a choice between a counter-cyclical price program (PLC) and a revenue program (RLC). Both bills also change farm commodity payment limits and adjusted gross income requirements.
4. The conservation titles of both bills reduce and consolidate the number of conservation programs, reauthorize larger existing programs with smaller enrollment caps, and create new conservation programs. The Senate bill adds conservation compliance requirements for crop insurance, while the House bill does not.

1. Protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry have improved, enabling comprehensive proteome comparisons. However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present. To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at the protein or peptide level, followed by analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS. Undersampling can occur if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer.

2. Repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses, longer HPLC gradients, or additional fractionation can increase analysis depth, but time- and resource-effective strategies are crucial. A study comparing gelc-ms/ms with repetitive LC-ms/ms analysis and additional protein prefractionation found that both strategies increased depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates. The 3-d method, which included microsol ief prior to SDS-PAGE separation, substantially improved proteome coverage compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as playing oncogene or anti-oncogene roles in breast cancer. Specifically, mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 function similarly to anti-oncogenes, while mir-21 and mir-10b behave like oncogenes.
2. In a study of 35 breast cancer patients, the relative quantity of mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 was lower in breast cancer tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues. Low expression of mir-125a was unrelated to patient age, menstruation, negative ER, and PR expression, but was correlated with negative ER, negative HER-2, and negative Top 2a.
3. Mir-206 was highly expressed in patients with small tumors, negative ER, negative PR, and negative HER-2, and was irrelevant to patient age, menstruation, metastatic lymph node, and Top 2a expression. Mir-145 was negatively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis and was correlated with negative ER, negative HER-2, and negative Top 2a.
4. The expression of mir-21 and mir-10b in breast cancer tissues was higher than that in para-carcinoma tissues. Mir-21 exhibited high expression in older, postmenopausal patients with various symptoms, such as lymph node metastasis and positive HER-2, but was not related to tumor size and expression levels of Top 2a, ER, and PR.

1. Chronic allograft injury (CAI) is a major limitation in transplantation, with chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV), glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) being the primary histopathological findings. The pathogenesis of CAI is not well understood, but acute rejection episodes are a significant risk factor. A rat model of CAI has been established by transplanting kidneys from Fischer-344 (F344) rats to Lewis rats without immunosuppression. This model allows for the investigation of severe but reversible acute rejection episodes, which precede the development of CAI.

2. During acute rejection, there is a strong mononuclear infiltration of the allograft interstitium and an increase in intravascular leukocytes. After resolution of acute rejection, the number of intravascular leukocytes decreases but remains chronically elevated compared to healthy kidneys. A majority of these blood leukocytes are monocytes displaying a unique state of partial activation. These activated monocytes interact with graft endothelial cells and may trigger CAV, which is characterized by intimal hyperplasia.

3. A gene array experiment identified tissue transglutaminase (TGase2, TGM2) as one of the genes upregulated by mononuclear leukocytes accumulating in the lumina of allograft blood vessels. TGase2 is a multifunctional protein with various cellular localizations and interactions with numerous other proteins. It is involved in several cellular processes, including antigen presentation, T cell activation, apoptosis, phagocytosis, cell adhesion and migration, and cell signaling.

The prevalence of RA in Northern Europe and North America is estimated to be 0.5-1%, while in Southern Europe, it is lower, at around 0.45-0.66%. The incidence of RA is also lower in Southern European countries.
2. The economic burden of RA is significant, with higher costs associated with more severe disease and older age. In Italy, the healthcare costs related to RA are expected to increase due to the aging population and the introduction of newer, costlier therapies. A review of the literature found that the mean annual social cost of RA in Italy is around 13,595 euros per adult patient, with nonmedical and indirect costs accounting for the majority of the total costs.
3. The progression of RA is associated with increasing functional impairment, reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and higher indirect costs. The use of biologics in the early stages of RA may reduce other healthcare costs by slowing the evolution of the disease. However, the high direct costs of biologics must be balanced against potential cost offsets due to reduced surgery or other interventions in the long term.
4. Pharmacoeconomic analyses are important for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of RA treatments and helping healthcare providers and budget holders choose the most effective strategies. These analyses should consider not only the effects of a therapy on disease onset and progression but also its adverse event profile, efficacy, and safety over the long term. The diagnosis and management of comorbidities in RA patients are also critical, as they are highly prevalent and associated with significant risk factors.

It disproportionately affects developing countries and males, with 85% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia as of 2008. The male to female sex ratio was 2.4.
2. Risk factors for HCC development include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens like aflatoxin B, and genetic metabolic diseases such as hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Prognosis and treatment options depend on the severity of underlying liver disease, with a median overall survival of 58 months for metastatic or locally advanced disease.
3. HCC is relatively resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products, and p53 mutations. Systemic therapeutic options for locally advanced or metastatic HCC are limited to sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting raf kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.

1. Adamantinoma of the tibia is a slow-growing primary bone tumor, with approximately 300 cases reported in English literature. Its origin is controversial, with a connection to osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia being a major focus. Metastasis is rare but most commonly occurs in the lungs.
2. The document reports two challenging cases of tibial adamantinoma, one of which was initially diagnosed as a cutaneous adnexal carcinoma with metastases in the groin. A review of metastatic adamantinoma in inguinal lymph nodes is provided.
3. In the first case, a 29-year-old female had a left inguinal mass, which was initially diagnosed as a cutaneous eccrine carcinoma. Upon reevaluation, it was reinterpreted as metastatic adamantinoma, with a past clinical history of tibial adamantinoma excision in 2004.
4. The second case involves a 58-year-old female with a painful swelling on her mid-shaft left tibia. In 2009, she underwent tibial allograft and intramedullary nail fixation, revealing a fibrous dysplasia-like pattern with occasional clusters of plump epithelioid cells.
5. A literature search on adamantinoma of the tibia with inguinal lymph node metastases resulted in 10 reported cases since 1930. The table summarizes these cases, including reference number, year reported, author, sex, age at diagnosis, bone involved, location in bone, symptoms, latent period, treatment, and outcome.
6. Adamantinoma of the tibia can be classified into two main groups based on histology and biological behavior: classical adamantinoma and differentiated adamantinoma. Risk factors for metastases include male sex, persistent pain, symptoms of less than five years duration, and inadequate initial treatment.

1. Hyperhidrosis is a condition that affects 0.6 to 1.0% of the population, typically young adults, and can cause intense discomfort, impacting social, affective, and professional lives.
2. The principal characteristics of hyperhidrosis include excessive sweating in the axillae, palms, plantar surface of the feet, and face, which can be exacerbated by emotional stress.
3. While various treatment options are available, such as topical and systemic therapies, iontophoresis, regional nerve block, and botulinum toxin injection, they have limitations.
4. Video-assisted thoracic sympathicotomy (VATS) has been accepted globally as a treatment for primary palmar hyperhidrosis.
5. A study compared two simplified methods of VATS, transecting the sympathetic chain in either the third or fourth rib segment (R3 or R4 sympathicotomy), focusing on their impact and efficacy.
6. The study found no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, sex, and positive family history, but the incidence of moderate to severe compensatory sweating was higher in the R3 group.
7. No patient requested reoperation or expressed regret after surgery, and the dominating indication for sympathetic surgery is hyperhidrosis of the upper limb.
8. Selective sympathicotomy has been proposed to minimize side effects, and numerous studies have reported that sympathicotomy is a safe and effective procedure for hyperhidrosis management.
9. The study suggests that R4 sympathicotomy decreases the extent of side effects without compromising efficacy, making it the method of choice for treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis.

1. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons, with intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. The clinical diagnosis of PD can be challenging, especially in mild or uncertain cases, and differentiating it from other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes is difficult.
2. Molecular imaging techniques, such as PET or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), have improved the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and the sympathetic innervation of the heart are popular tests used in clinical practice.
3. Imaging of DAT binding with [I]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) successfully visualizes the presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract. However, DAT imaging alone cannot differentiate between the various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy.
4. Several studies have shown the utility of meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy in assessing the sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals in PD patients. A decreased cardiac MIBG uptake is observed in PD patients compared to other parkinsonian syndrome patients, in whom the MIBG uptake is normal.

1. The tick in question is a large, ornate, longirostrate tick of the genus Amblyomma, specifically identified as a female adult of A. testudinarium based on its morphological characteristics. This tick is known to feed on a wide variety of vertebrates and has been reported to bite humans in Asian countries, including Korea, where it is distributed but human infestation is rare.

2. The patient in this case, a 73-year-old Korean man, presented with a round nodule in the left perianal area after a trip to a rural county in Jeollanam-do province, South Korea. He had defecated in the sitting posture on the grass near a water reservoir and felt pain around his anus, indicating a possible tick bite at that time. The tick was later surgically removed, and histopathological examination revealed an intense skin reaction at the attachment site.

3. The feeding lesion formed by the tick was composed of two different portions: a superficial perirostral portion and a deep cavitary portion. The perirostral portion was 2.1 mm in depth and much wider at the distal part than at its entrance, while the deep cavitary portion was relatively small and filled with purulent exudates containing inflammatory cells and erythrocytes. There was no evidence of infection or residual disease up to 1 month after surgical removal of the tick.

4. A. testudinarium is more common in tropical areas, including Southeast Asia and the Indian peninsula. In Japan, it is one of the most common ticks infesting humans, especially in southwestern areas. In Korea, it is distributed in Jeju Island and the southern coastal area of the mainland, with the first and second human cases reported in Suncheon city and Tongyeong city, respectively. The present case extends the geographic range of distribution of A. testudinarium in Korea to the southwestern coastal area below 36 north latitude.

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, often with predominant involvement of the interventricular septum. It can be caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with the major genes implicated including MYH7, TNNT2, MYBPC3, and others.
2. TNNT2 mutations, which account for approximately 15% of familial HCM, are associated with a severe form of the disease characterized by a poor overall prognosis with a high incidence of sudden death despite only mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Most TNNT2 mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle, especially the calcium sensitivity of force development and ATPase activity.
3. The phenotypic expression of TNNT2 mutations varies considerably, ranging from asymptomatic individuals with a normal life expectancy to those with sudden cardiac death or the need for an early heart transplant. Clinical parameters such as the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, the presence or absence of a left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and electrophysiology testing have not been predictive markers of poor prognosis.
4. Late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance can be a predictive marker of ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in HCM. Mutation-specific risk stratification has been considered not possible, but genetic test-based risk stratification has been reported to be clinically informative.

1. Schistosomatidae is a family of digenetic endoparasites with complex life cycles, alternating between intermediate (freshwater gastropods) and definitive hosts (birds, reptiles, fishes, and mammals). The Schistosoma species, including those that infect humans, can live in the human host for over 5 years. The genus Schistosoma, which includes avian and mammalian blood flukes, is the most studied genus in Schistosomatidae, with six species known to infect humans: S. haematobium, S. intercalatum, S. japonicum, S. malayensis, S. mansoni, and S. mekongi. Other species infect a wide range of mammals, such as hippopotamus, rodents, carnivores, and ruminant animals.

2. Schistosomiasis, a chronic and debilitating disease, is considered a serious public health issue and the second most prevalent tropical disease, with high morbidity worldwide. It is endemic in 77 countries, and its transmission depends on the existence and distribution of intermediate hosts. Approximately 237 million people require treatment, and 600 to 779 million people live in endemic areas, at risk of infection. The disease is responsible for the loss of 1.7 to 4.5 million years of life, as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALY), one of the highest indexes among all neglected tropical diseases. Control of schistosomiasis is based on drug treatment (praziquantel), snail control, improved sanitation, and health education.

3. Recent advances in schistosome research, particularly in genomics and transcriptomics, have been made possible by the development of powerful and scalable methods to analyze nucleic acids and proteins, as well as the application of computational tools and methods. These advances have expanded our perspective of schistosome biology and allowed a better understanding of processes such as host-parasite interaction. The scientific community has joined efforts to assess the schistosoma genomic information, starting in 1994, as an initiative of WHO/TDR, to strengthen traditional methods and provide new information",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

Both primary tumor resection and hepatectomy for liver metastasis can lead to long-term survival in these patients. However, the optimal surgical strategy remains controversial, with both simultaneous and staged resections having their own advantages and disadvantages.

2. A study was conducted to determine which patients could benefit from staged resections instead of simultaneous resection by identifying predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM. The study found that predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and for anastomotic leakage were intraoperative blood loss and operation time greater than 8 hours, respectively. The overall morbidity rate and the rate of anastomotic leakage were significantly higher in patients with operation time greater than 8 hours. The study suggests that staged resections should be selected to prevent anastomotic leakage or serious complications when the scheduled operation would result in considerable surgical stress.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 6}"

1. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the performance of daily activities, and pharmacological treatment is essential to manage it. Inhalation is the most widely used approach for asthma treatment, allowing drugs to reach the lungs in a selective manner and reducing systemic adverse effects. However, only half of asthma patients use the prescribed medication correctly, and incorrect inhaler use can lead to treatment failure and difficulties in achieving clinical asthma control.
2. The frequency of incorrect use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) ranges from 14% to 90%, with an estimated mean of 50%. Instruments that assess the difficulties patients face in using inhaled drugs can help healthcare professionals devise educational programs targeting common errors, improving treatment adherence.
3. Scoring systems have been developed to assess inhaler technique in patients with lung disease, but there is no gold standard for this purpose. Leal developed a scoring system for MDI use, and Santos et al. expanded it to include dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Although these instruments have not been validated, they are used in a hospital to assess inhaler technique in patients with asthma and COPD.
4. Validation of instruments allows determination of the congruence between the scoring system used and the reality being measured, increasing reliability. Using validated instruments to assess inhaler technique in asthma patients will yield more reliable results and ensure data quality.
5. The present study aimed to validate two scores quantifying patients' ability to use MDIs or DPIs, identify the most common errors during their use, and identify patients in need of an educational program for using these devices.

1. Bacteriocins, such as enterocin S37 produced by E. faecalis, are antimicrobial peptides with potential applications in food preservation and human and veterinary medicine. The activity of enterocin S37 against various bacteria, including Listeria and Campylobacter, has been demonstrated. However, the anti-Campylobacter activity was not observed in this study, suggesting instability.
2. Enterocin S37 retained its antibacterial activity after heating and pH treatments, but lost activity when treated with proteolytic enzymes. The purification process increased the activity of enterocin S37, and k channel modulators, such as pinacidil and cromakalim, affected the growth of L. monocytogenes and its bacteriocin-resistant variant.
3. The antibacterial activity of enterocin S37 is attributed to its interaction with the cell membrane, leading to the formation of pores and loss of intracellular components. The lipid composition of the membrane plays a crucial role in the efficiency of bacteriocin activity. Enterocin S37 alone did not affect the growth of the bacteriocin-resistant variant of L. monocytogenes, but the combination of enterocin S37/k channel modulators strongly impacted the growth of the resistant variant.

1. The first case of a ciliated hepatic foregut cyst (CHFC) was described by Friedrich in 1857, and the term ""CHFC"" was coined by Wheeler and Edmonson. CHFCs are thought to result from the evagination of the foregut during embryogenesis and have specific characteristics, including four layers: a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer with interspersed mucus cells, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule.
2. CHFCs are rare, with only 103 cases reported since 1857, and are usually found in segment IV of the left lobe just beneath the hepatic capsule. They are typically asymptomatic and are mostly located superficially in the median segments of the liver. CHFCs can range in size from less than 1 cm to 24 cm in greatest diameter.
3. CHFCs can be challenging to differentiate from other hepatic cysts, and their imaging appearances are variable. Ultrasound may show anechoic or hypoechoic cysts with spotty hyperechoic areas, while CT findings may show a non-enhancing rounded lesion of varying density. MRI may show a hyperintense cyst on T2-weighted images and a variable appearance on T1-weighted images.
4. Pathologically, CHFCs are typically solitary and unilocular, with four layers: an outer fibrous rim, a layer of smooth muscle (often incomplete), subepithelial connective tissue, and a lining of ciliated, pseudo-stratified, mucin-secreting columnar epithelium. The differential diagnosis of a hepatic cyst includes simple cyst, hydatid cyst, biliary cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and bronchogenic cyst.

1. The oral route is a popular and safe method of drug administration, with around 60% of conventional dosage forms available as oral solid dosage forms. However, low bioavailability, longer onset of action, and difficulty swallowing have led to the development of alternative forms such as parenterals and liquid dosage forms.
2. Fast dissolving tablets, also known as mouth-dissolving tablets or orodispersible tablets, dissolve or disintegrate within 60 seconds when placed in the mouth, providing a convenient and acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulty swallowing.
3. However, fast dissolving tablets have disadvantages such as physical solid form, psychological fear of swallowing or chewing, friability, and expensive packaging costs. To address these issues, a new technology was developed in the form of orally dissolving strips.
4. Orally dissolving strips are a more advanced form of oral solid dosage form, providing greater flexibility and comfort for patients. They dissolve within a minute in the oral cavity, improving the efficacy of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and providing quick absorption and instant bioavailability.
5. Orally dissolving strips are particularly useful for patients such as pediatrics, geriatrics, bedridden individuals, and those with conditions such as sudden episodes of allergic attacks or coughing.

2. In physiotherapy practice, self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests are used to monitor OA knee rehabilitation progress in terms of pain, symptoms, ADL, and QOL. Self-reported questionnaires provide subjective information about the disease process without examiner bias, while performance-based tests objectively measure a patient's ability to perform ADL activities.
3. Examples of self-reported questionnaires include WOMAC, SF-36, and KOOS, while performance-based tests include the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Six-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT), and Stair Climbing Test. Performance-based tests are affected by motivation but not by psychogenic factors such as beliefs, expectations, cognitive impairments, and cultural, lingual, and educational level.
4. A difference between the two types of tests is that performance-based tests measure functional limitation, whereas self-reported questionnaires reveal disability, which includes the social and psychological aspects of functional limitation. Functional limitation is often detected earlier by performance-based tests than self-reported questionnaires.
5. While some prefer self-reported questionnaires due to their ease of administration and high internal consistency features, others prefer performance-based tests for ADL evaluation. Ideally, both types of tests should be used in knee rehabilitation settings to ensure more valid results.
6. The present study aimed to correlate the subjectively measured KOOS questionnaire with the objectively measured 6-MWT, age, height, weight, and BMI in primary OA knee patients. The study found weak to strong correlations between KOOS subscales and 6-MWT, weight, and BMI, while there was no correlation between age and any of the KOOS subscales except for the QOL subscale.

2. This retrospective study analyzed 344 patients who underwent BAE due to hemoptysis, and found that tuberculosis and bronchiectasis were the most common causes.
3. The findings of angiography suggested that indirect appearances, such as tortuosity, hypertrophy, and hypervascularity, were more common than direct signs of bleeding.
4. The responsible arteries were mainly right bronchial arteries, left bronchial arteries, and combined right and left bronchial trunk, with more right intercostal arteries involved than left.
5. BAE was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 96% of patients, but 17.7% had recurrent hemoptysis within 1 month after the procedure.
6. Of the recurrent hemoptysis patients, 44 were performed a second bronchial arteriography, and an additional bronchial or nonbronchial collateral artery was embolized in 27 patients, resulting in successful control of hemoptysis.
7. The etiologies of recurrent hemoptysis were mainly cancer, tuberculosis, and severe bronchiectasis, and the disease development contributed to the rebleeding.
8. The source of massive hemoptysis is usually due to the bronchial circulation, and the anatomy of bronchial arteries is variable from person to person.

1. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and celiac disease (CD) can both cause lymphocytic gastritis (LG), but the pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. In both conditions, a systemic humoral immune response is detected, and local immune inflammatory reactions are characterized by the presence of increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the gastric mucosa.

2. A study was conducted to investigate the relationship between H. pylori and CD in pediatric patients with LG. Four groups of patients were examined: normal controls, patients with new active CD without H. pylori infection, celiac disease negative patients infected by H. pylori, and new active CD patients infected by H. pylori. The diagnosis of CD was based on histological findings and positive serology for CD, and H. pylori status was assessed using conventional biopsy-based criteria and a positive urease test.

3. The study found that patients with CD and H. pylori gastritis had increased numbers of IELs compared to patients without LG. The highest proportion of LG was found in CD patients without H. pylori infection, followed by patients with CD infected by H. pylori, H. pylori positive patients without CD, and none in the control group. The distribution and total number of lymphoid aggregates in the antrum were highest in patients infected with H. pylori, regardless of CD status.

4. The study suggests that in undefined cases of CD with overlapping clinical and histological features, the number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum might hint toward the diagnosis of CD rather than H. pylori infection, and the number of lymphoid follicles directs toward the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Therefore, it is important to include immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 lymphocytes in the antrum in undefined cases of CD.

1. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is required for solid tumor growth, and is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which binds to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.
2. Inhibition of angiogenesis with drugs is a promising approach in cancer treatment, as it can limit tumor growth and metastasis, and these drugs should have low toxicity and not interfere with normal dividing cells.
3. VEGF is a primary stimulant for tumor angiogenesis, and its inhibition is a critical target for cancer therapy, with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
4. In breast cancer, anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab, 2c3 or r84 inhibits the growth of established orthotopic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, reduces tumor microvessel density and limits the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages.
5. Selective inhibition of VEGFR2 with an anti-VEGF antibody is sufficient for effective blockade of the protumorigenic activity of VEGF in breast cancer xenografts.
6. Inhibition of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 by 2c3 has been shown to reduce tumor size both in pancreatic and breast tumors.
7. The effect on tumor growth after the treatment with r84 in an orthotopic breast cancer model is similar to 2c3, significantly reducing tumoral growth.
8. VEGF is an abundant cytokine in the tumor microenvironment and is known to stimulate immune cell chemotaxis, and its inhibition reduces macrophage infiltration in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.
9. In a mouse model of thyroid cancer, anti-VEGF therapy with 2c3, r84, or bevacizumab reduced tumor microvessel density, and the reduction of macrophage infiltration is presumably due to expression of VEGFR2 on",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18}"

1. Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common medical condition in postmenopausal women, caused by the loss of estrogen stimulation on vaginal and vulvar tissue, and it is chronic, progressive, and will not resolve without treatment.
2. An estimated 32 million postmenopausal women in the US suffer from VVA symptoms, including dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation.
3. The Revive survey, conducted among a large cohort of postmenopausal women in the US, highlights the poor understanding of VVA among women and their concerns about the efficacy, convenience, and safety of VVA treatments.
4. The survey results emphasize the need for better communication between women and their healthcare providers (HCPs) about VVA and its treatment options.
5. Of the 8081 postmenopausal women surveyed, 38% reported at least one symptom consistent with VVA, but most were unfamiliar with the terms VVA or vulvar and vaginal atrophy.
6. Many women were unaware that their vaginal symptoms could be caused by menopause or hormonal changes, and only 25% specifically identified menopause as the cause of their symptoms.
7. Almost half of the study population had never discussed their VVA symptoms with an HCP, and 40% of women with VVA symptoms expected HCPs to initiate the conversation.
8. The survey findings highlight the need for increased awareness, understanding, and communication about VVA to improve diagnosis and treatment.
9. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in identifying women suffering from VVA, providing essential patient education, and guiding them to appropriate treatment options.

1. Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a significant predictor of coronary and cerebral vascular risk, often caused by atherosclerosis leading to narrowed arteries in the lower extremities.
2. Statins, lipid-lowering drugs, have been suggested for PAD treatment, as they not only reduce lipid levels but also improve endothelial function and reduce oxidative stress.
3. A study examining lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in PAD patients undergoing surgery found enhanced oxidative stress in PAD patients before surgery.
4. The study also revealed that 35 and 710 days after surgery, the total antioxidant capacity decreased, and thiol group concentrations were lower than those before surgery and in patients treated with simvastatin.
5. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was higher in PAD patients before surgery and 710 days after surgery, while simvastatin therapy increased ceruloplasmin activity in men on simvastatin therapy.
6. The findings suggest that lipid peroxidation may be a mechanism promoting PAD, and statin therapy could be beneficial in PAD treatment due to its antioxidant properties.

1. The use of herbal remedies like FIJK in Nigeria is popular, but there is a lack of scientific data supporting their safety and efficacy, with many having toxic effects and no empirical data available on FIJK. This study aimed to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to FIJK on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology.
2. The oral administration of FIJK to rats caused a significant reduction in rat plasma protein levels and elevated plasma levels of triglycerides, LDL-c, and atherogenic index, while reducing HDL-c levels, which may predispose to cardiovascular disorders.
3. The study also found that FIJK caused hepatic alterations, including hypochromic, hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, and hyperemia, and reduced rat liver weights, indicating potential liver toxicity.
4. The rat plasma levels of ALT and AST were elevated by exposure to repeated administration of FIJK mixture, indicating tissue toxicity and possible acute or chronic liver injury.
5. The study also found that oral exposure to FIJK caused lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, as indicated by increased rat plasma MDA levels and decreased GSH levels.
6. The histopathological findings support the biochemical alterations caused by oral and repeated exposure to FIJK herbal mixture, indicating potential hepatic injury and organ toxicity.

1. Preconceptional carrier screening can benefit prospective parents by making them aware of possible genetic risks to their future offspring and providing reproductive options such as prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, using donor sperm or oocytes, seeking adoption, or refraining from having children.
2. Carrier screening and carrier testing are two approaches to identifying carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders. Carrier screening is the detection of carrier status in persons who do not have an increased risk, while carrier testing is for persons with a higher a priori risk based on personal or family history.
3. Carrier screening can be offered on an individual basis or as an organized screening program, either during or before pregnancy, with the goal of strengthening reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making.
4. Preconceptional carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been studied extensively, revealing positive attitudes towards CF carrier screening from healthcare providers, patients, their relatives, and the general public.
5. Despite recommendations from the National Institutes of Health, the American College of Medical Genetics, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, preconceptional CF carrier screening is not currently offered in most countries.
6. Traditional healthcare systems have hesitated to implement carrier screening programs for the entire population of couples planning a pregnancy due to concerns about the psychological impact, risk of stigmatization/discrimination, impairment of freedom of choice, medicalization, difficulty in reaching couples before conception, and provider-related barriers.
7. Commercial companies have started offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers, providing information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring.
8. The availability of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing services has created a debate about their desirability, with concerns related to the validity and utility of tests offered, absence of individualized medical supervision, lack of an adequate consent procedure, absence and/or quality of pre- and post-test genetic counselling, inappropriate testing of minors, respect for privacy, and potential burden on public health resources.

1. The text discusses the growth of options for operative fracture treatment and the debate over implant removal after fracture union. After fracture union, implants made of titanium alloys or stainless steel serve no purpose and can cause functional impairment, growth disturbance, foreign body reaction, chronic infection, and corrosion. The removal of asymptomatic hardware is still debated, and there is a lack of clear guidelines. The study found that the most common reasons for implant removal were pain, discomfort, prominent hardware, infected hardware, implant failure, and patient insistence.
2. The study found that 39.75% of patients who required implant removal experienced hardware pain or discomfort or prominence. The most commonly responsible implants were patella tension band wiring, olecranon tension band wiring/plates, distal humeral plates, and femoral IM nails. After removal, 44.11% of patients reported complete relief of pain, and the average pain visual analog scale score decreased significantly (p < 0.05). However, one patient developed an ulnar nerve palsy postoperatively, which recovered.
3. The study also found that 28.91% of patients required hardware removal due to infection at the implant site. The most commonly removed implants included distal tibial/ankle plates and screws, proximal tibial plates, and olecranon plates. After removal, infection subsided in 87.5% of patients. However, one patient had a refracture of the tibial shaft after sequestrectomy.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive conditions caused by defects in various enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). In patients with 21-OHD, some precursors are shunted into the androgen synthetic pathway, causing signs and symptoms of androgen excess.
2. Since the discovery of cortisone in the 1950s, CAH has been managed effectively, and the clinical course of the disease has markedly improved with typical medical treatment consisting of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration. However, recent reports reveal a high appearance of small tumors in patients with untreated CAH, and two of four cases in the study were managed with adrenalectomy due to increasing adrenal mass size and virilization.
3. The development of adrenal adenoma or carcinoma in patients with CAH is rare, but the incidence of adrenal masses appears to be higher in CAH patients and in heterozygotes than in the general population. Recent reports have revealed a high prevalence of small adrenal tumors in patients with untreated 21-OHD CAH, and the pathogenesis of adrenal tumor in patients with 21-OHD CAH is thought to be related to a consequence of ACTH hypersecretion.
4. Patients with 21-OHD CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumor, improve its symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorder, particularly hyponatremia. Follow-up imaging may help to discover the appearance of adrenal tumor in patients with long-term management of 21-OHD CAH. There has been much improvement during the past 50 years in the understanding of CAH, and the management with CAH continues to improve.

In the US and other countries, SRH is commonly used as a health-indicating tool. Poor health, as indicated by SRH, has been attributed to a lack of adherence to medical recommendations, including diet and physical activity.

a. Worldwide, noncommunicable diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic lung diseases are largely attributed to four main behavioral factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity, and harmful alcohol use.

b. Lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.

c. Higher daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and physical activity have been associated with a reduction in chronic disease burden and an increase in quality of life.

2. SRH has been positively associated with fruits and vegetables intake and negatively associated with high-fat diets and eating at fast-food restaurants. Following dietary and physical activity recommendations can help prevent and lessen the severity of cardiovascular diseases.

a. Unhealthy dietary patterns and lack of physical activity place a burden on society due to lack of work productivity and increased healthcare costs.

b. Several studies have found an association between lifestyle behaviors and SRH, with regular physical activity being significantly associated with SRH in various populations.

c. Participants who reported lower fruits and vegetables intake, higher fatty-food intake, and less physical activity were more likely to have poor/fair SRH, even after adjusting for covariates.

The accuracy of ultrasound in detecting fetal pathology, including ventriculomegaly, depends on the sonographer's expertise and is affected by factors such as fetal head descent, skull bone ossification, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios. Fetal MRI has become increasingly important in diagnosing prenatal anomalies, particularly in the evaluation of central nervous system pathology, due to advances in technology and better knowledge of fetal pathology.
2. Ventriculomegaly can be classified based on the maximal diameter of the atrium of the lateral ventricles or the thickness of the overlying brain parenchyma. Its causes include an imbalance in cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, abnormal cerebral development, and destructive disease processes. Fetal MRI is valuable in detecting small intraventricular hemorrhages, corpus callosum dysgenesis, cortical anomalies, and fossa posterior malformations, which can significantly impact prognosis and parental counseling. The added value of MRI is debated due to practical issues such as availability, cost, and expertise, but it is generally accepted for cases of moderate and severe ventriculomegaly and may demonstrate additional findings in mild unilateral ventriculomegaly.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 6}"

1. Lung cancer is a common and deadly form of cancer in the United States, with a high likelihood of diagnosis at an advanced stage. The five-year survival rate varies greatly depending on the stage at diagnosis, with 3.5% for distant stage, 24% for regional stage, and 52.9% for localized stage.
2. Bone is a common site of metastasis for lung cancer patients, which can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain. These SREs significantly impact a patient's quality of life and overall survival. However, data on the occurrence and outcomes of bone metastasis and SREs in elderly lung cancer patients is limited.
3. This study aimed to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and SREs on mortality among older lung cancer patients by analyzing a combined population-based cancer registry and Medicare claims database. The study found that 19.8% of patients aged 65 and older with newly diagnosed lung cancer had evidence of a possible bone metastasis, and 51% of these patients had SREs.
4. The study also found that having a possible bone metastasis was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer, regardless of whether it was complicated with an SRE or not. The skeleton is a frequent site of metastasis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, which is the most common type of lung cancer.
5. The study's limitations include the use of Medicare claims data, which may not be generalizable to patients less than 65 years of age or those who reside in geographic areas not included in the SEER program. Additionally, the study did not validate the procedures used to identify bone metastasis, and there may be other confounding factors such as treatment factors or concurrent comorbid conditions that were not included in the analysis.
6. Despite these limitations, the study found that having a bone metastasis as indicated by Medicare claims was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer. The study highlights the need for further research on the impact of bone metastasis and SREs on mortality among elderly lung cancer patients.

3. The composition of the gut microbiota is strongly influenced by the main nutritional source, with distinct bacterial profiles observed in omnivores, carnivores, and herbivores.
4. A small group of healthy individuals has been studied to understand the convergence and variability of the human gut microbiome, revealing that the gut flora mainly belongs to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla.
5. Recent high-throughput studies have provided more details about human bacterial communities, with one major study identifying 18 species present in all individuals and 57 species seen in more than 90% of samples.

The mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups at 12 months of age and fed daily with control diet supplemented with NDGA. The health of the mice was monitored twice daily by laboratory staff and weekly by a veterinarian. The study found that NDGA consumption, even at doses below its therapeutic dose, was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis in mice.

The results showed that optimum oral treatment with NDGA at 3.0mg/ml medium increased the median lifespan of the flies by approximately 23%. However, the study did not find any effect of NDGA on food consumption, body weight, or locomotor activity in Drosophila. The results suggest that at least some of the target(s) of NDGA action are phylogenetically conserved between mice and flies.

1. Genetic variation plays a crucial role in disease susceptibility and treatment response, with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enabling the discovery of genetic variants contributing to complex genetic diseases and pharmacogenetic markers (Manolio, 2010; Link et al.). Personalized medicine, which involves promoting individualized treatment decisions, has the potential to improve medical decision-making.
2. Personalized medicine applications extend beyond the identification of optimal drugs and dosages, encompassing situations such as withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients. For instance, DNA biomarker tests can determine whether treatment may be safely delayed for prostate cancer patients, or guide preventive surgery decisions in hereditary cancer cases.
3. Biomarkers, or biological markers, are diverse in their definitions, but a commonly adopted one states that biomarkers are any substances or biological structures that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain, or predict the incidence or outcome of disease (Gallo et al., 2011).

658," 1. Myosin VA (Myova) is a processive molecular motor that transports intracellular cargo along the actin cytoskeleton.
2. Myova is composed of a pair of motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain.
3. Myova's movement is driven by a conformational change in the motor domain after ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms.
4. Calmodulin dissociation from the lever arm due to high calcium concentrations can reduce Myova's processivity.
5. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual Myova motors and their subdomains.
6. The study found that Myova's lever arms have a flexural stiffness of 0.0346 pN/nm, and this stiffness decreases by 40% after calcium addition.
7. The distal rod domain of Myova has a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm, and its effective length is likely composed of coiled-coil segments interspersed with disordered segments.
8. The study suggests that the lever arm/rod junction of Myova must be highly compliant, contributing to the motor's free diffusive search and maneuverability.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients. The combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is commonly used, but its accessibility is limited due to regulations and resource availability.
2. A magnetic tracer and handheld magnetometer have been evaluated as a radiation-free alternative, and while it showed noninferior identification rates, there were discrepancies in the sentinel lymph nodes identified between the magnetic and combined techniques. Further research is being conducted to optimize the magnetic technique for SLNB by evaluating the performance of different sized superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-based formulations.

2. The main causes of mouth breathing in children include hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids, nasal congestion, and habitual mouth breathing.
3. Morphological adaptations in mouth-breathing children include maxillary hypoplasia, mandibular rotation, and alterations in dental occlusion.
4. Functional changes in mouth-breathing children include alterations in speech, chewing, and deglutition.
5. A multidisciplinary team, including otorhinolaryngologists, odontologists, phonoaudiologists, physiotherapists, and pediatricians, is essential for the diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention of mouth breathing in childhood.
6. Accurate diagnosis of the cause of mouth breathing is crucial for effective treatment, and the type of care used for mouth-breathing patients is typically determined by the etiology of the altered respiratory mode.
7. Most causes of mouth breathing are diagnosed through a physical examination, except for the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, which requires complementary exams.

1. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in breast carcinoma patients is less than 6%, but distinguishing between true local recurrence and new primary tumors is crucial due to different clinical relevance.
2. To differentiate between true local recurrence and new primary tumors, factors such as the location of the new tumor, staging, and histological subtype are studied.
3. A case is described of a patient with moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) who received breast-conserving surgery, systemic adjuvant therapy, and radiation therapy.
4. Four years after surgery, the patient noticed periareolar thickening in the same breast, and a new IDC diagnosis was confirmed, consistent with inflammatory breast cancer.
5. The new tumor had different histological subtype, staging, and receptor expression compared to the primary tumor, indicating a new primary tumor rather than true local recurrence.
6. The patient received a different treatment regimen for the new primary tumor, including weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab.
7. IBTR can be classified as true local recurrence (TR) or new primary tumor (NPT) based on pathologic features, genetic sequencing, and changes in histology and ploidy.
8. NPT is more common in younger patients at initial diagnosis, but there are no age differences at relapse, and the rate of NPT in the ipsilateral breast does not differ significantly from the rate of primary contralateral tumors.
9. Salvage mastectomy is the standard treatment for IBTR, but further studies are needed to determine the indications, and optimal systemic therapy after surgical management is unknown.
10. TR has a poor prognosis, while patients with NPT generally have a favorable prognosis, but there is a need for better chemoprevention strategies due to the higher risk of developing contralateral breast carcinoma.

1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in developed countries, with the neovascular form of AMD being the most common cause of AMD-related severe central vision loss. This form of AMD is associated with choroidal neovascularization, which is characterized by fluid exudation or bleeding.
2. The development and progression of AMD have been linked to the upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The management of neovascular AMD has been transformed by the advent of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, which is more effective in preventing vision loss and improving visual acuity than previous alternative treatments.
3. Current management of neovascular AMD involves the use of continuing anti-VEGF treatment to control signs of exudation and prevent vision loss. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents ranibizumab and aflibercept are approved options for the treatment of neovascular AMD.
4. Large clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of monthly ranibizumab and intravitreal aflibercept injection every 8 weeks in preventing vision loss and improving visual acuity in patients with neovascular AMD. Aflibercept has a higher binding affinity to VEGF and a longer duration of action than ranibizumab, allowing for less frequent dosing.
5. Contrast sensitivity (CS) is a measure of an individual's ability to detect low contrast images and to perceive differences between light and dark. CS is a sensitive and arguably essential outcome end point for a complete assessment of visual function and visual performance, including driving, mobility, reading speed, and general vision-related quality of life.

It is most commonly found in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40, and is associated with several genetic and environmental factors.
2. The study aimed to evaluate the association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in an Iranian population, using a sample size of 75 subjects in each group. Blood samples were collected from patients admitted to Sina Hospital and control samples from Tehran Blood Transfusion Services.
3. The results showed no statistically significant difference in the distribution of genotypes between patients with MS and the controls (p = 0.901). The logistic regression model also found no significant association between the IL-25 gene polymorphism and MS development.
4. The study also found no significant difference in the distribution of a and c alleles between the two groups (p = 0.728). The odds ratio of MS development in patients with the a allele versus patients with the c allele was 0.907 (95% CI: 0.522 - 1.574), which did not reach statistical significance level (p = 0.729).
5. The study suggests that the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene is not associated with MS and cannot be considered as a risk factor for MS development. However, other polymorphisms within the IL-25 gene may regulate IL-25 expression and should be evaluated in future studies.

The prevalence of TAAs was 36.5% (181/496) and AAAs was 6.0% (30/496). The presence of TAAs was associated with older age, larger body surface area, higher diastolic blood pressure, and the absence of dyslipidemia. In contrast, AAAs were independently associated with the presence of dyslipidemia, current or past smoking, and TAAs.
2. The study also found that the prevalence of AAAs was significantly higher in current or past smokers compared to non-smokers (7.4% vs. 2.4%). The prevalence of AAAs among nonsmokers was very low (2.4%), and none of the nonsmokers had a large AAA (> 40 mm). These findings suggest that race influences AAA prevalence and that Asians generally have a low prevalence of AAAs.

1. Endometrial cancer has surpassed cervical cancer as the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries. Screening methods for cervical cancer have advanced due to improved cytologic preparation and evaluation systems since the 1950s. There is a need to develop effective screening approaches for endometrial carcinoma and its precursors to reduce new cases and deaths.
2. Endometrial complex hyperplasia with atypia and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) are precursors of type I endometrioid adenocarcinoma, while endometrial glandular dysplasia leads to type II carcinoma. These lesions require a certain period to develop into cancer. Traditional endometrial sample collection for histologic analysis is performed through D&C or hysteroscopy, which are reliable methods for evaluating endometrial condition.

1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with high incidence rates in Europe and North America. Screening mammography has been associated with a reduction in mortality rate, and digital mammography (DM) is now the most commonly used procedure for breast cancer detection in the US.
2. The DMISRT trial found that DM is as effective as screen-film mammography and has a slightly higher sensitivity, but it may still miss cancers in women with dense breast tissue. Tomosynthesis, a 3-D procedure, may help solve this problem by reducing tissue overlap.
3. Newer prospective population-screening trials from Oslo, Italy, and Australia have provided more definitive results on the use of tomosynthesis in clinical settings. Recent developments have also addressed the challenge of radiation exposure in tomosynthesis.
4. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) uses x-rays like conventional mammography but creates image slices of a tissue volume, decreasing the problem of confusing overlapping tissue. DBT radiation exposure is approximately the same as that of sfm or DM.
5. DBT can increase mammogram accuracy, decrease recall rates, and increase cancer detection, particularly in women with dense breast tissue. A recent population-based prospective clinical trial reported a 40% higher invasive cancer-detection rate when integrating 2-D and 3-D mammography screening.
6. The addition of DBT to DM increases the radiation dose in screening, but it has been considered necessary for detection and characterization of calcifications. DBT can more clearly depict benign findings than routine screening views, reducing recall rates and false-positive biopsies.
7. Synthetically reconstructed 2-D images can be made from DBT data, eliminating the need for double exposures and reducing the radiation dose to that of conventional mammography. Radiologist-interpretation time is longer for DM + DBT, but decreased recall rates and decreased need for additional views may offset this.

1. The number of metastatic lymph nodes in breast carcinoma is associated with axillary lymph node status, which is a crucial prognostic factor. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/International Union Against Cancer (UICC) TNM classification categorizes nodal disease into three groups based on the number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes.
2. However, the number of removed lymph nodes, which is dependent on the surgeon and pathologist, can influence the count of metastatic lymph nodes. Recent studies suggest that the lymph node ratio (LNR), defined as the ratio of metastatic lymph nodes to removed lymph nodes, can provide more useful prognostic information compared to the traditional nodal disease classification.
3. The LNR threshold value varies across different studies, and its prognostic value has been analyzed mainly in all lymph node-positive patients, without subdivision based on n1, n2, and n3 disease groups.
4. In a study of breast carcinoma patients with 13 axillary metastatic lymph nodes, the researchers evaluated the prognostic significance of the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR. They found that patients with higher LNR had significantly worse prognoses in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).

2. Although Charles Elton's book on invasions in the 1950s raised awareness, it wasn't until the 1980s that a global research surge occurred, led by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE).
3. This research revealed that invasions impact ecosystems at various levels, affecting nutrient cycles, hydrology, and fire cycles, as well as causing genetic hybridization and introgression between native and invasive species.
4. Hybridization can lead to the creation of new, more invasive species, like common cordgrass in England, which arose from native and North American species.
5. Molecular genetic techniques have been instrumental in tracing sources and routes of invasions, as well as revealing the extent of hybridization and introgression.
6. Introduced populations often combine genes from multiple source populations, resulting in novel genetic combinations and increased genetic variation.
7. The ""invasional meltdown"" phenomenon has been observed, where multiple introduced species facilitate each other's establishment or enhance their impact on native species.
8. Lag effects have been detected, with widespread establishment and impact of invasive species occurring years after initial arrival.
9. Critics argue that the problems caused by invasions are overblown, that introduced species can increase native biodiversity, and that the antipathy toward invasive species is xenophobic.
10. Despite these criticisms, the majority of introduced species have not been studied, and the relative frequency of harmful impacts is higher for non-native species compared to native species.

The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for photoanode material in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering required for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, enabling the use of conductive plastic substrates.
2. The authors have previously demonstrated the use of ESA with ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes. The addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to the ZnO surface significantly impacts crystal growth and crystallographic orientation.

In the case of ZnO/Eosin Y (EY) hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed, with the space between the ZnO nanowire filled with aggregates of EY. By soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline solution, the solid EY can be completely removed, resulting in porous crystal ZnO thin films with high surface area and crystallinity.

1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, and it is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication that normally disappears during fetal development. If the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, a cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis can develop, while crusts adhering to the orifice without obstruction can form the crust type.
2. The crust type is characterized by the periodic shedding of crusts from the nasopharynx, causing an offensive smell and unpleasant taste. Although most patients with nasopharyngeal bursitis are asymptomatic, some develop bursitis, a cyst, or an abscess, resulting in symptoms such as nasal obstruction, eustachian tube obstruction, dysphagia, cranial nerve paralysis, or rhinitis.
3. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, with a peak incidence between 15 and 30 years and no gender predilection. While most published literature focuses on the cystic type, a clinicoanatomical audit aimed to identify the incidence of nasopharyngeal bursa disease, its different types, and its clinical presentation over two years in a single rhinology practice.
4. The audit identified six patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal bursitis, with an equal incidence of cystic and crust types. The cystic type presented with postnasal discharge, throat irritation, and cough, while the crust type presented with crust expectoration, retching, and occasional occipital pain.
5. Endoscopic examination and radiologic investigation are useful in diagnosing nasopharyngeal bursitis, and a combined endoscopic endonasal and transoral approach with electrocauterization is a minimally invasive and effective treatment for both types of the disease.

1. The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing, with an estimated 76,250 new cases and 9,180 deaths in the USA in 2012. Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer, and early diagnosis of melanoma is crucial for improving prognosis.
2. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that enhances the visualization of morphological features, increasing diagnostic sensitivity by up to 30%. However, its effectiveness depends on the experience of the dermatologist, as inexperienced practitioners may have lower diagnostic accuracy.
3. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to assist less experienced clinicians in diagnosing skin lesions, but their success is limited due to low within- and between-observer concordance, even among expert observers.
4. In the last two decades, there has been growing interest in automated analysis of digitized images obtained by dermoscopy techniques to differentiate early melanoma from benign skin lesions.
5. Computational intelligence methods can help physicians and dermatologists in faster data processing, resulting in better and more reliable diagnoses. Various computerized diagnostic systems have been reported in the literature, using different border detection, feature extraction, selection, and classification algorithms.
6. A comprehensive up-to-date review of automatic diagnostic models for skin lesions is not available, necessitating a review of the diverse classification algorithms and techniques used in dermoscopic image analysis.
7. A standard automatic decision support system based on semantic analysis of melanoma images and further classification of characteristic objects commonly found in pigmented skin lesions can provide a framework for selecting suitable algorithms in the automatic diagnostic procedure.
8. Performance evaluation measures and model validation details are essential for analyzing various algorithms and models, ultimately leading to more accurate diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.
9. Predictive models are widely used in medical domains for diagnostic and prognostic tasks, with the potential to significantly impact skin cancer diagnosis and management.

2. The International Diabetes Federation reported that the number of people with diabetes worldwide is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030.
3. T2D is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors, and the PGC-1 gene is associated with T2D in different populations.
4. The ESRRA protein, which binds to the PGC-1 protein, regulates the expression of the MFN2 gene.
5. The MFN2 gene is involved in mitochondrial fusion and plays a role in tissues with high energetic requirements.
6. The study found that the c allele of rs2878677 of MFN2 gene and the borderline association between genotype distributions of rs873458 of MFN2 gene and T2D are associated with T2D susceptibility.
7. The haplotypes a - c - g - t - c and g - t - c - t - c in MFN2 gene were significantly associated with T2D.
8. The study suggests that there are interactions between genetic variants in the MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1 gene.
9. The study found that the mfn2 gene is not involved in many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T2D.

Inter-individual variations in ex vivo platelet aggregation during clopidogrel therapy have been linked to reduced exposure of the active clopidogrel thiol metabolite and differences in p2y12 receptor occupancy. High on-treatment platelet reactivity and low platelet inhibition during clopidogrel therapy are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, particularly stent thrombosis.
2. Carriers of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting. Recent advances suggest that clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation, with the inactive prodrug first oxidized to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic CYP450 enzymes and then converted into the thiol metabolite.
3. A recent study using sophisticated metabolomic methods suggested a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (PON1) as the rate-limiting enzyme in the second step of clopidogrel biotransformation. A common polymorphism of PON1 (Q192R) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the QQ (AA) haplotype.

1. Gallstones affect approximately 20 million adults in the US, with 1 million new cases diagnosed each year, making cholelithiasis treatment the most costly digestive disease, with an annual cost of over $5 billion.
2. In 1992, the National Institute of Health held a consensus development conference to discuss cholelithiasis treatment and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, concluding that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no increase in morbidity or mortality.
3. The panel found that laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduced pain and disability, leading to equal or slightly lower treatment costs and substantial savings for patients and society due to the shortened disability period.
4. Despite higher charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the actual costs may be lower due to reduced length of stay, nursing, and hospital support requirements compared to open cholecystectomy.
5. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients showed that the average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922 (SD = $7,134), while open cholecystectomies cost $13,042 (SD = $9,715) (p=<0.01).
6. To make laparoscopic cholecystectomy more cost-effective, reducing charges by applying reusable instruments and having surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills operate on patients with a higher probability of conversion is necessary.

The proportion of girls and boys was comparable among remitters and nonremitters. Mean age at diagnosis was similar between subgroups, and height and BMI z-scores were also similar between remitters and nonremitters.
2. The absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was significantly higher in PR patients than in no PR patients, and this effect was more pronounced in boys. Mean PR duration was 9.2 months, and 71.6% of patients had a PR duration shorter than 1 year. Patients entering PR had a lower baseline A1c than patients with no subsequent PR.
3. PR duration was significantly shorter in patients having 2 positive anti-GAD65 and anti-IA2 antibodies at diagnosis compared with patients with only 1 positive antibody. Anti-IA2 antibody titers positively correlated with A1c+2y levels. C-peptide secretion was significantly different in PR versus no PR patients from diagnosis until 3 years after diagnosis. Higher baseline c-peptide concentrations were observed in both girls and boys entering PR compared to patients without PR.

1. Regular structured exercise has numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Exercise alone can also decrease visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL), both of which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. However, it is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar benefits.
2. Cross-sectional analyses have shown an inverse relationship between central adiposity and self-reported physical activity levels, as well as between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and physical activity. Prospective studies have further supported this association. In the Finnish Twin Cohort study, physically inactive twins had higher liver fat scores than their active counterparts, and habitual physical activity was the strongest correlate of central abdominal fat.
3. While self-reported behavior is subject to reporter bias, emerging evidence using objective measures of physical activity via accelerometry supports these observations. However, research using accurate assessments of VAT and IHL is limited. If the epidemiological data can be confirmed by high-quality objective assessments, encouraging habitual physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior will have important clinical ramifications.
4. In this study, the researchers aimed to evaluate whether levels of accurately quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of VAT and IHL in adults with overweight/obesity. They hypothesized that there would be a negative relationship between time spent in moderate intensity physical activity and levels of VAT and IHL and a positive relationship between time spent in sedentary behavior and VAT and IHL content.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by an isolated elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with a normal free thyroxine (FT4) level, which is considered to represent early, mild thyroid failure. The prevalence of SCH varies and ranges from 4% to 20% in the adult population, with women, elderly people, and iodine-sufficient populations being affected more often.
2. The causes of SCH include chronic autoimmune thyroiditis associated with the presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, which is a marker of chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis. The disorder is more common in girls and women, but the overall incidence increases with age in both sexes.
3. The clinical significance of SCH is still a matter of controversy, and the optimal TSH cutoff values and clinical significance of these subclinical abnormalities are even more controversial. The treatment of SCH is typically considered only for patients who are pregnant, infertile, exhibit associated symptoms, or have a high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism.

1. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, with antimicrobial drugs disrupting the normal intestinal flora and allowing C. difficile to flourish and release toxins that induce C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).
2. Although CDAD is a common healthcare-associated infectious disease, treatment or infection countermeasures are not applied to patients who do not present with diarrhea, including asymptomatic adults who carry C. difficile in their intestines.
3. The diagnosis of CDAD widely uses an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B released by the C. difficile cells, but the low detection sensitivity of EIA for the CD toxins has been reported.
4. Bacterial content is higher in specimens containing colonies in solution compared to stool, which may result in markedly higher toxin concentration.
5. If a specimen is GDH positive, follow-up testing with a nucleic acid amplification test, such as PCR, is recommended to compensate for the low sensitivity of EIA.
6. PCR detection of tcdA or tcdB genes is the evidence for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile, but bacterial toxin proteins are not detected, which may result in positive results for patients carrying C. difficile without CDAD.

Research is focused on preventing the early development of CVD risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
2. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to have beneficial effects in reducing CVD risk, including lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects. These nutrients have been found to modulate the inflammatory response, which is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.
3. The two main types of PUFAs are omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, which differ in the location of the last double bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule. The human body can produce all fatty acids except for linoleic acid (LA, c18:2 n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, c18:3n-3), which are essential fatty acids that must be obtained through the diet.
4. The biochemical pathways converting ALA to EPA and EPA to DHA are limited in humans, resulting in low conversion rates. Therefore, tissue and circulating EPA and DHA levels are primarily related to their dietary intake. Fish is the major food source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, while ALA is primarily found in seeds, nuts, and their oils.

However, the differential effects of EPA and DHA on cardiovascular health are still not firmly established, and further research is needed to establish their independent effects on various cardiovascular outcomes.

This idea was later supported by Pelayo Correa, a Colombian pathologist who published a model for gastric cancer development in 1975, positing that the intestinal subtype of gastric cancer resulted from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over the next 30-50 years.
2. Correa initially believed that environmental factors, such as a diet high in salt and n-nitroso-compounds and low in micronutrients from fresh fruits and vegetables, were responsible for promoting this slow progression from gastritis to cancer. However, in 1988, he briefly discussed a possible role for Campylobacter pylori, a newly discovered gastric bacterium, in the initiation of the disease.

4. Initial investigations into a possible association between H. pylori and gastric cancer provided only weak evidence for a link. However, three large cohort studies with nested case-controls conducted in the 1990s found that evidence of prior H. pylori infection was significantly more common in those subjects who subsequently developed gastric cancer, providing compelling evidence for the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer.

1. Severe hypoproteinemia (SHP) in preeclampsia (PE) is associated with increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Women with SHP were delivered earlier, had a higher rate of cesarean sections (CS), and were more likely to have severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta compared to those with mild hypoproteinemia (MHP).
2. Neonatal outcomes were also worse in the SHP group, with lower average birth weight, higher rates of fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that SHP was a significant risk factor for CS, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes in PE women.

711," 1. There is a growing recognition of the importance of nurses' involvement in national policy processes due to their significant role in healthcare delivery and their unique insights into service delivery and health systems strengthening. However, historically, nurses have had limited involvement in policy formulation and modification, which has been attributed to several factors including lack of awareness of policy issues, inadequate knowledge and skills, and lack of opportunities to contribute to policy decisions. Additionally, gender differences in the healthcare system have also played a role in limiting nurses' participation in policy processes.
2. Studies have shown that nursing programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often lack a policy focus, and nurses have inadequate training and mentoring in research, which hinders their ability to generate evidence to inform policy decisions. To enhance nurses' engagement in policy processes, several strategies have been suggested, including assuming formal leadership positions, lobbying and advocacy through professional organizations, and building nurses' understanding of and competencies in policy and politics.
3. A survey of nurse leaders' involvement in health policy processes in East Africa found that nurse leaders' participation in all stages of policy development was limited and inconsistent. Similarly, a study on nurses' involvement in HIV/AIDS policy in four LMICs, including Kenya and Uganda, revealed nurses' lack of involvement in policy processes, poor communication of policies from the national level, and a lack of resources for nurses to implement the policies.
4. The study applied a critical theory perspective to examine how nurses had been involved in national health policy processes in Kenya, eliciting the perspectives of nurses and decision-makers working at various levels of the healthcare system. The findings revealed that nurses' underengagement in policy processes has been attributed to several factors, including limited policy knowledge and skills, lack of opportunities to contribute to policy decisions, and gender differences in the healthcare system. To improve nurses' involvement in policy processes, the study suggests addressing hierarchies, domination, and gender issues inherent in the healthcare system and establishing mechanisms through which nurses' views could be included in national-level decision-making.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 12}"

2. Despite this, the genomic landscape contains rich veins of knowledge related to gene function, which can be accessed through annotation and signposting.
3. There are two main ways of annotating genes: through experimental characterization and through predicted evolutionary relationships. The latter method relies on the concept of homology, where genes with similar sequences are assumed to have similar structures and functions.
4. However, homology assignment is not always indicative of functional similarity, and there are many examples of homologous genes with divergent functions.
5. Domains, which are compact units of protein structure, represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution. There are several resources, such as Pfam and Smart, that predict domains in protein sequences using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments.

1. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, characterized by specific types of seizures, EEG patterns, and cognitive impairment. It is caused by various congenital or acquired etiologies, with boys being affected more frequently than girls.
2. The typical age of onset for LGS is between 2 and 5 years, and the prognosis is generally poor, with both seizures and cognitive outcomes being affected. Risk factors for poor cognitive prognosis include symptomatic etiology, history of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, prior infantile spasms, and early age of seizure onset.
3. LGS is known for its resistance to treatment, with many drugs reducing seizures initially but losing effectiveness over time, often leading to polypharmacy and increased side effects. The seizures themselves are thought to contribute to cognitive impairment and behavioral comorbidities.
4. Diagnosing LGS can be challenging due to heterogeneous causes and the absence of classic clinical and EEG features at the onset. Systematic difficulties further complicate drug trials in LGS, including the frequent occurrence of atypical absence seizures, inaccurate parental reports, wide range of etiologies, and evolution of seizure types over time.

Interpopulational variation in sexual chemical signals can contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation in animals, with phenotypic plasticity playing a key role in initial signal divergence. In lizards, chemical compounds from the femoral gland can convey information about social status and genetic quality.
2. The Iberian wall lizard (Podarcis hispanica) is a species complex with cryptic speciation, and chemical cues are essential in male-male interactions and female mate choice. Five distinct populations of P. hispanica in central Spain, differing in morphology and coloration, were selected for this study.
3. Morphological measurements, including body mass, body size, head length, head depth, femoral pores, and blue ocelli, were taken for each individual lizard. One-way analyses of variance revealed significant differences in all morphological measurements between populations.
4. Lipophilic compounds in femoral gland secretions of male P. hispanica were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealing 53 compounds, with cholesterol being the most abundant. Thirty-four chemical compounds were shared by all populations, while 19 compounds showed population-specific presence/absence.

1. The use of cell type-specific molecular markers and gene-specific RNA probes has enabled the description and analysis of developmental morphogenesis in various biological systems. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a common technique used to visualize gene expression patterns by detecting RNA transcripts in whole mounts. Initially performed using radioactive probes, WISH became more accessible with the use of nonradioactive probes. This technique is now widely used in several biological systems, including drosophila, xenopus, quail, dictyostelium, and zebrafish.

2. The development of chromogenic multilabeling techniques allowed the detection of more than one transcript simultaneously. However, a major limitation of these methods is that the overlapping regions of expression are difficult to discern. The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts may overcome this limitation, but successful implementation is rare, especially in the mouse or xenopus embryos. Imaging the signal is also complicated due to the strong autofluorescence of the embryos, which interferes with fluorescent detection of RNA and makes the use of enzymatic amplification necessary.

3. Direct labeling of the probe is a promising approach to improve resolution and enable single-cell and intracellular resolution of the localization of a particular mRNA. This method also allows simultaneous hybridization of multiple mRNAs, as long as fluorophores can be spectrally resolved. Despite successful implementation in cell culture, direct labeling of messenger RNAs in embryos has not been possible due to the low fluorescent intensities of organic fluorophores.

1. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer with a high mortality rate and poor survival rates. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are PDAC, which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential. The survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC can vary significantly depending on various factors, including demographic characteristics, pathologic nature of the tumor, and treatment type.
2. Cox proportional regression models have been used to estimate the relative impact of distinct risk factors on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC. Demographic factors, such as gender, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, and time period of diagnosis, as well as clinical factors, such as tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases, have a significant influence on PDAC survival.
3. Surgical resection of the tumor has the most dramatic influence on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC, but less than 20% of patients are suitable for surgical resection. The combination of surgery with radiation and chemotherapy can improve survival compared to surgery alone. However, the estimates of the relative impact of risk factors on PDAC survival vary depending on the data used, variables considered, and technical approaches employed.
4. The credibility of Cox proportional hazards regression models can be estimated using concordance indexes (c-indexes), which present the probability that for any pair of randomly drawn patients, the patient with the worst outcome estimated by this model dies earlier than one with the better estimated outcome. A c-index value of 0.5 indicates that the predictive power of the model is not better than random chance, while a level of 1.0 signifies perfect discrimination.

1. Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a significant and widespread parasitic zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus, with humans becoming infected through the accidental ingestion of eggs from infected dogs. The disease is common in areas with close contact between intermediate hosts (such as sheep) and definitive hosts (usually dogs).
2. CE in humans typically presents with symptoms related to fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other organs. Diagnosis is established using radiology and serology, but treatment can lead to postsurgical relapses or treatment failure due to non-radical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material.
3. Postsurgical follow-up of CE patients is necessary for years to detect newly growing cysts early. A posttreatment follow-up method should include markers for detecting new or relapsing cysts and tracking previously undetected but still viable cysts.
4. Serology has been used for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies makes relapse diagnosis difficult. Many serologic techniques have been evaluated, but there is still a need to develop or improve immunodiagnostic tools to meet clinicians' requirements.

2. Newer obesity indices like waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), and Body Adiposity Index (BAI) are being studied for their association with metabolic complications.
3. A study was conducted to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
4. The study enrolled 66 patients, divided into three groups based on their obesity level, and measured various clinical parameters.
5. Results showed that WtHR was significantly correlated with triglyceride (TG) levels and TG/HDL-C ratio.
6. VAI was strongly correlated with TC, TG, TC/HDL-C, LDL/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C ratios.
7. BAI was positively correlated with TC, TG, and LDL-C levels.
8. The study suggests that WtHR, VAI, and BAI may be helpful in assessing the risk of metabolic complications in obese patients.
9. Further research is needed to establish the clinical utility of these newer obesity indices.

1. The frequency response of resonators was measured using a downmixing method, which involves electrostatic actuation and applying a driving voltage to a side-gate parallel to the resonator.
2. The drive signal is set to half the actuation frequency to reduce parasitic signals, resulting in the resonator's motion being proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.
3. A bias voltage is used to down-mix the resistance change of the gauges, and a lock-in amplifier detects the low-frequency readout signal.
4. Typical measurement values include a 1.5 V bias voltage at a 500 kHz measurement frequency.
5. Measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at 10 mbar pressure and room temperature, with thermomechanical noise measured using the same setup but with the drive electrode disconnected.
6. The Allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration, and the frequency stability was extracted from the resonator's response actuated at the resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
7. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within its bandwidth.

1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and aspirin therapy is a prevention measure that can reduce the risk of major CVD events. However, many studies on aspirin use for CVD prevention may not accurately reflect physician recommendations due to self-initiation of aspirin use and varying risk assessment methods.
2. A nationally representative study analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011-2012 to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations for CVD prevention. The study found that among primary prevention patients, less than a third reported being recommended aspirin by their doctor, and over three-fourths were classified as low risk.
3. Among primary prevention patients who were recommended aspirin, the vast majority complied with the recommendation. However, there were significant differences in being told to take aspirin and taking aspirin by race, education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care.
4. Logistic regression models showed that among primary prevention patients, education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention. Among high-risk individuals, age, health insurance, and being of Asian/other descent were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin.
5. The study found that recommendations for aspirin for CVD prevention do not match up to objectively computed future risk, and decisions for treatment recommendations seem to be made on criteria other than objectively calculated future CVD risk.
6. Lack of health insurance and a usual source of care contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in primary prevention, and improved clinical decision support tools could aid in making accurate decisions for aspirin recommendations in electronic health records.

The diagnosis of HCV infection is made with a branched chain DNA signal amplification assay and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
2. Histochemical techniques are needed for detecting HCV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues, particularly for routine diagnostic purposes. In the study, an in situ hybridization (ISH) technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSALII) was established for detecting HCV-RNA in FFPE tissue sections of the liver.
3. The study used humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice and needle biopsy liver specimens of chronic hepatitis C. The LNA-based ISH detected signals in 82% of chronic hepatitis C lesions, including three showing diffuse cytoplasmic positivity and six showing focal or partial positivity. No HCV-RNA was detected in HBV-related lesions, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, and in HCC lesions.

2. The OECD and EPA have established guidelines for investigating frog metamorphosis to focus on thyroid toxicity, as amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to contaminants in wastewater due to their thin, permeable skin and aquatic habitat.
3. Frog metamorphosis is regulated by thyroid hormones, which promote the remodeling of aquatic larvae into adult tetrapods, making it a useful parameter for reflecting endocrine disruption.
4. Thyroid hormone balance is influenced by various processes, including sulfation, deiodination, glucuronidation, inhibition of iodide uptake, and suppression of peroxidase activity. Environmental contaminants can disrupt thyroid hormone metabolism at multiple stages.
5. Thyroid hormone sulfating activity is present in the liver cytosol of frog tadpoles and can be inhibited by chemical compounds, leading to decreased thyroid hormone levels. Glucuronidation, another pathway for reducing circulating thyroid hormones, is relatively minor in amphibians.

1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are crucial in various physiological functions, including blood pressure regulation, nociception, and adipogenesis. They are produced via metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, particularly members of the 2c and 2j families. The ratio and stereocomposition of EET isomers are dependent on the specific cytochrome P450 isoform, making them species- and tissue-specific.

2. The stability and potential therapeutic utility of EETs are hindered by factors such as aerial or auto-oxidation, esterification, metabolism by other arachidonate cascade pathways, conjugation, -oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide. In biological milieu, hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) significantly influences the steady-state levels of EETs. Inhibition of sEH has been shown to elevate EET levels, offering a potential pharmacologic intervention strategy.

3. Researchers have developed EET surrogates with improved stability, which were evaluated for vascular relaxation and sEH inhibition. The latest generation of analogues modifies the free carboxylic acid of previous EET mimics while retaining key structural features. These analogues were tested for vasorelaxation, EC50 for vasorelaxation, and IC50 for sEH inhibition, with varying results depending on the bioisostere and its position along the carbon chain.

1. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model is a healthcare approach that aims to improve patient care quality and decrease costs by implementing team-based care, coordinating services, and increasing access to services. This model is an extension of Edward Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) and has been successful in reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care quality. Over 1,500 sites and 7,700 clinicians across the United States have successfully completed the NCQA recognition process and are functioning as PCMHs.
2. The transition to PCMH can be challenging, with common concerns including promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records. These challenges can be addressed by creating written policies that adhere to PCMH principles and fit the specific practice structure, accounting for patient panels, location, and financial resources. Practices must decide whether to attempt the transformation incrementally or all at once.
3. To become recognized as a PCMH by the NCQA, practices must provide documentation of the practice's guidelines for implementation and complete an online survey. Recognition increases the likelihood of reimbursement for pioneering PCMH procedures, which are currently undercompensated. However, the NCQA standards do not offer instructions for practices to follow in making the transition, so each practice must create its own written policies.
4. The PCMH model emphasizes team-based care, which requires staff to address patient treatment decisions collectively. This includes previsit meetings to allocate resources, ensure adequate health maintenance, and address chronic care management. Previous studies have shown that the use of previsit huddles has resulted in improved decision-making and care for patients, as well as patient satisfaction.
5. The PCMH model also focuses on educating patients regarding their health and ensuring they have the knowledge necessary to improve it. National PCMH demonstration projects have shown that patient education has increased their participation in their own care and subsequently their quality of life. Patients are encouraged to interact with practice staff and their providers regularly during appointments and through new means of communication, such as online patient portals.

It was first described in Austria and has since been identified in many salt deposits worldwide. Polyhalite is often associated with other evaporite minerals such as halite, anhydrite, and glauberite.
2. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, and can be synthesized in laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite has been found to start at 255°C and reach a maximum of 343°C.
3. Polyhalite forms early diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact with the precursor rock. It is stable between room temperature and 255-343°C, making it useful for absolute age dating in deciphering the geological history of a region.

2. The results showed that Wo file extruded significantly more debris (27% increase) compared to Ptn (19% increase) and Saf (12% increase).
3. The Saf file, a single-file system with an abrasive surface, was associated with the lowest percentage of debris extrusion (12%).
4. The Saf file adapts to canal irregularities and creates fine dust that is easily removed by continuous irrigation, leaving more than 38% of the canal cross-section free for backflow of fluid and dentin debris.
5. The Wo files, with a modified triangular cross-section and larger taper, have been associated with decreased cutting efficacy and excessive debris formation, leading to higher debris extrusion.
6. The Ptn file system has rare reports of apical debris extrusion, and its design provides more cross-sectional space for enhanced cutting and debris removal.

752," 1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have shown that the dynamic folding of the chromatin is crucial in regulating gene expression and DNA replication. The genome is organized into hierarchical structures such as chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), which are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions.
2. TADs, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size, exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions. In human cells, TAD boundaries have been associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and the timing of replication domains.
3. BRG1, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions and for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions. A recent finding indicates that BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength, and its loss affects nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization.
4. BRG1 plays a role at TAD boundaries by regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization. BRG1 loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and preclude the binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries, leading to altered nucleosome occupancy and reduced boundary strength. The interplay and functional cooperativity between CTCF, BRG1, and topoisomerases suggest a strong link between chromatin remodeling enzymes, architectural proteins, and topoisomerases in genome organization.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

2. ECDHFR exhibits significant structural rearrangements along its catalytic cycle, making it a suitable system for studying the impact of conformational changes on the active site electrostatic environment.
3. Researchers incorporated thiocyanate probes at specific locations in the ECDHFR active site to analyze the electrostatics and degree of hydration of the microenvironments surrounding the probes.
4. Experimental data and mixed quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) analyses of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that the electrostatic interactions arising from the active site microenvironments led to different observed CN vibrational stretching frequencies and CNMR chemical shifts along the catalytic cycle.

1. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO). The SPIOs' superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated enable MPI to provide high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios. Possible application scenarios for MPI include cardiovascular imaging and interventions. However, the development of suitable MPI scanners and appropriate tracer material is necessary for its clinical application.

2. Resovist, an approved T2\* contrast agent for MRI, is the most important benchmark material for MPI, although it has a hydrodynamic diameter greater than 50 nm, which limits its in vivo distribution. The pharmacokinetics of Resovist, especially its half-life in blood, is important for its use in cardiovascular MPI. Previous reports show that SPIO with a hydrodynamic size greater than 50 nm have rapid and specific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream. Therefore, an ideal MPI tracer should have a homogeneously distributed iron core diameter of 30 nm, resulting in a relatively high hydrodynamic diameter and a shorter half-life in blood.

3. The present study compared the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) for two different versions of Resovist, distributed by Bayer Pharma AG in Europe and Irom Pharmaceutical Co.

1. Intracellular pathogens, like Leishmania, have evolved to coexist with host defense mechanisms, and their interaction with the host is a complex process that involves various pathways and responses.
2. Studying the host-pathogen interaction in vitro excludes the inflammatory milieu, while in vivo studies face the challenge of distinguishing pathogen-specific responses from general inflammatory or common host responses. These responses are driven by the activation of components of the complement cascade, coagulation pathway, and the acute phase response, among others.
3. The study of Leishmania infection in a mouse model revealed that the transcriptomic response of uninfected cells exposed to inflammation could serve as a measure of the baseline or normal in vivo response to insult. Transcriptomic networks specifically observed in infected cells, but not in neighboring uninfected cells, represent cell-intrinsic pathogen-induced changes.
4. The transcriptomic analysis of Leishmania-infected and inflamed kupffer cells (KCs) at 2 hr and 12 hr post-infection (p.i.) identified genes that were commonly or uniquely regulated in both infected and inflamed cells. A subtractive analysis of the gene lists revealed that 241 genes were differentially regulated in inflamed cells, but not in cells that contained intracellular amastigotes, suggesting the potential involvement of these genes in antimicrobial defense regulated by inflammation.

Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids or proteins, or adipose tissue, while more recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract or associated organs.
3. These models aim to account for the regulation of appetite and body weight through the identification of specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.
4. An alternative view on appetite control comes from the study of energy balance, with the inter-relationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI).
5. The view suggests that any increase in EE will be met with an equivalent increase in EI, and that differences in food intake must originate in differences in energy expenditure.
6. Experimental studies have shown that there is no correlation between EE and EI in any one single day, but there is a good correlation over two weeks.

1. Microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea, are known to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as intracellular energy and carbon storage compounds. Bacterial cells with a higher PHA content can survive longer due to their ability to utilize reserve material more efficiently. The type of PHA produced depends on the metabolic pathway of the microorganism, and the enzyme PHA synthase plays a major role in PHA synthesis. PHA synthases are classified into four classes based on substrate specificities and subunits organization.

2. Extremophiles, such as those inhabiting polar areas, are a source of novel enzymes with great economic potential in various industrial processes. Shallow Antarctic reservoirs influenced by variable trophic conditions are underexploited sources of microorganisms with biotechnological potential. Psychrotrophic bacteria, which are adapted to variable temperatures and other fluctuating conditions, may offer important advantages for industrial PHA production.

3. The study aimed to determine whether bacteria inhabiting freshwater reservoirs in glacier forefield areas have the potential to synthesize PHAs. Samples were collected from five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream located in the foreland of Ecology Glacier near the Polish Antarctic station Arctowski.

1. Reclaiming arid and semi-arid lands involves three main categories: topography modification, surface composition creation, and vegetation establishment. Establishing vegetation is the most uncertain due to reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment.
2. Vegetation establishment is crucial for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing productive reuse of land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape. Natural rainfall can establish robust native or non-native vegetation, but natives are now preferred due to long-term stability, resource value for wildlife, and better public acceptance.
3. A mixed plant community is recommended for maximizing long-term positive impact, with the same ratio of functional groups as a natural community in the same area. Diversity increases resiliency to disturbance, and perennial grasses contribute significantly to surface stability and erosion prevention.
4. The study assumes native, warm-season (C4) grass seeds are available in the soil from 0.1 cm deep, and all seeds germinate when exposed to suitable monsoon conditions. Two scenarios are evaluated for each rain gage: 2 days and 3 days of suitable conditions resulting in germination.
5. Plants are counted as germinated if the water volume in the 0.25 cm layer stays above 0.09 cm/cm for 2 or 3 days. An intermediate value for water volume is chosen because the 0.25-cm layer dries quickly, but seeds can germinate if the relative humidity remains high at the soil surface.

Additionally, there is a glymphatic system that enables communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes, facilitating immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid. These findings suggest that the CNS immune system is more active than previously thought.
2. Microglia are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and enter the brain during different developmental stages. They mature from primitive c-kit erythromyeloid precursors into cd45 c-kit cx3cr1 immature cells and then into cd45 c-kit cx3cr1 mature cells. Proliferating a2 cells develop into microglia and invade the developing brain at E9.5, requiring matrix metalloproteinase activity. In the postnatal brain, microglia are maintained through cellular division or expansion of progenitors that colonized the brain during CNS development. They form an autonomous population of cells within the brain and demonstrate activities independent of circulating monocyte activity.

Microglia have multiple functions in the postnatal brain, including immune surveillance, initiating an inflammatory response, phagocytosing pathogens and apoptotic neurons, exerting scavenging actions on tissue debris under pathological conditions, recognizing apoptotic cells, refining synapses, and playing a role in angiogenesis. They also express voltage-sensitive ion channels and sense electrical activity pertaining to cortical spreading depression (CSD). CSD can initiate inflammatory activation of microglia, forming a positive feedback mechanism that favors the perpetuation of CSD induction.

1. Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 87% of stroke-related deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries. The genetic influences on ischemic stroke are likely polygenic, with multiple genes exerting small effects.
2. Beta-adrenergic receptors (βAR), including the β2AR subtype, are members of the G-protein coupled receptor family and are involved in neurohormone epinephrine and nor-epinephrine signaling. Mechanisms contributing to loss of β2AR activity include uncoupling from adenylyl cyclase, internalization, and phosphorylation of internalized receptors.
3. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays a role in atherogenesis and is a potential target for preventing and treating atherosclerosis. The two major non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the β2AR gene are rs1042713 (A>G) and rs1042714 (C>G), resulting in changes at positions 16 (Arg>Gly) and 27 (Gln>Glu) of the amino terminus and the fourth intracellular loop.

Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), the removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries to reduce the risks of breast and ovarian cancer, is a common cancer prevention strategy for women with germline mutations in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes (BRCA1/2). However, the magnitude of risk reduction associated with RRSO in this population is unclear.
2. A fixed-effects meta-analysis of pooled results from 10 published reports found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

1. The isolation of pure cell populations is crucial in both clinical and basic research, such as in the diagnostic test for HIV infection and in research on the body's response to injury.
2. Recently, the isolation of rare cells has become an active area of research, with the identification of islet 1+ cells in mouse and human hearts as potential resident cardiac progenitor cells.
3. These cells are present in very small numbers and are currently isolated through pre-plating, but the development of more efficient methods for isolating rare cells would be a major contribution to stem cell biology.
4. Miniaturized cell separation devices offer several advantages over conventional techniques, including small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential integration with analytical techniques.
5. These devices can be broadly classified into two categories: techniques based on size and density, and techniques based on affinity (chemical, electrical, or magnetic).
6. Size-based separation processes are being employed in micro- and nanoscale devices, which are compact, simple, and do not require additional energy sources or equipment.

2. These devices force a fluid containing a heterogeneous particle population through a series of channels or obstacles of varied size, ensuring laminar fluid flow and allowing for the separation of particles based on size.
3. This approach does not require the presence of cell-specific markers or proteins, making it useful for isolating stem cells and other rare cells that do not express known markers.
4. However, maintaining cell viability is a major concern with this approach, and one limitation is the requirement of laminar flow and the possibility of random diffusion between adjacent lanes.

3. Nanofabrication may allow for improved resolution and sorting of supramacromolecules such as viral particles and protein complexes.
4. Another size-based separation approach is the use of a series of channels of successively smaller width, which acts like a sieve to separate cells based on size.
5. This approach has been used to isolate rare cells, such as metastatic cancer cells, from peripheral blood, and can be applied to separation systems of mixed cell populations provided that the two cell types being separated are sufficiently different in size.

2. Several studies have shown that there are morphological signs of cirrhosis that can be identified on routine clinical imaging examinations, with different signs appearing on various techniques such as ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
3. The caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL) is a quantitative measurement that has demonstrated high specificity and accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis, but it is time-consuming and not commonly used in daily clinical work.
4. The expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF) and the right posterior notch (RPN) are simple qualitative visual signs of cirrhosis that have shown high specificity and positive predictor value for the MRI diagnosis of cirrhosis.
5. A comparison of the C/RL, EGF, and RPN in cirrhotic liver has not been studied, and the purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare the diagnosis performance of these signs in diagnosing cirrhosis.
6. The study found that the C/RL and RPN had similar diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, while the EGF had lower values. However, the EGF had a high specificity of 91%, and there was a statistical significance difference between the last two signs and EGF in diagnosing cirrhosis.

The prevalence and severity of AI are measured through patient self-reporting, with no objective assessment methods available. Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is a leading cause of AI in nonpregnant women, and multiple vaginal deliveries increase the risk of AI regardless of sphincter injury.
2. Other risk factors for AI include age, obesity, and medical conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and gastrointestinal disorders. The prevalence of AI among women varies widely in previous studies and between different study populations. Postpartum studies show a high prevalence of AI in women with OASIS, and women attending gynecological outpatient clinics have a higher prevalence of AI compared to the general female population.
3. Community-based studies show differences in prevalence of AI between age groups, with increasing prevalence by increasing age. The most frequent AI is found among nursing home residents, among the oldest women with frequent additional complaints and comorbidity. Few previous studies have assessed the prevalence of AI in a female population of fertile age, and few studies have included nulliparous women.

The study found no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups, although more hypertensive patients (6/30) developed hypotension compared to normotensive patients (1/30).
2. Hypertensive patients had significantly higher systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure values at all measurement times compared to normotensive patients. Both groups did not show any significant change in heart rate values compared to basal measurements.
3. Six patients in the hypertensive group and seven patients in the normotensive group received atropine due to bradycardia, which resolved with a single dose of 0.5 mg intravenous atropine. Patients who developed hypotension were treated with a single dose of 5 mg ephedrine, and the hypotension resolved.
4. The study cites previous literature suggesting that hypotension due to spinal anesthesia is more frequent in hypertensive patients, but other studies have shown no difference in the incidence rates between hypertensive and normotensive patient groups. The study suggests that the difference in findings may be due to the age of the patients, as older patients may have a greater decrease in systemic vascular resistance after spinal anesthesia.
5. The study suggests that antihypertensive treatment may improve vascular structural changes and decrease basal sympathetic activity, which may explain why there was no difference in the incidence of hypotension between normotensive and hypertensive patients in this study. The study also notes that venous capacitance is decreased in hypertensive patients, and antihypertensive treatment may improve venous capacitance, which may explain why there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups.

Numerous studies have shown that pain is associated with limitations in daily activities, poor self-rated health, and increased prevalence of depressive disorders.
2. In primary care, 22-40% of all contacts are due to pain, and persistent pain often co-occurs with depression in both general and disease-specific conditions. Despite this, primary care physicians may underestimate the intensity of pain and its impact on patients with depression.
3. A study conducted at Laegehuset Noerretorv in Grindsted, Denmark, aimed to determine the usefulness of Dolotest as a screening tool for depression in primary care patients and to find its sensitivity and specificity. The study included 715 patients who filled out Dolotest and Major Depression Inventory questionnaires.
4. The results showed that women had a statistically significantly higher Dolotest score than men, and 16.1% of all patients met the criteria for depression using the MDI scale. The prevalence of depression was statistically significantly higher in the study group (patients visiting due to pain) than in the control group (patients visiting for other reasons).

Delirium is a common and severe complication in elderly patients, associated with increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and a higher risk of post-discharge institutionalization and dementia. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium could help improve recognition and care. A study investigated the relationship between delirium and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) status, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and nitric oxide (NO) production in patients.
2. The study included 86 participants, of whom 23 were diagnosed with delirium. Mean levels of arginine were significantly lower in patients with delirium, and phe/tyr and trp/lnaas ratios were significantly higher, suggesting disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission and increased oxidative stress in these patients. However, hva levels were not statistically different between the two groups. The association between arginine and delirium did not reach statistical significance when adjusted for mmse score.
3. The study's findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and increased oxidative stress may have played a role in the pathogenesis of delirium in the patient group. However, the authors recommend further research in a larger, comparable population and to explore potential differences in the pathophysiology of delirium in patients with and without cognitive disorders.
4. The study's limitations include the small sample size, potential confounding factors such as the degree of patients' cognitive functioning, and the possibility of delirium duration and severity influencing the levels of biochemical markers. Despite these limitations, the intensive monitoring of clinical symptoms and the DSM-IV diagnosis by a geriatrician make it less likely that delirium was missed or misdiagnosed in the study.

1. Malaria is a major global health issue, caused by Plasmodium parasites, with five species affecting humans. In Brazil, the most common species are P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae, transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, primarily Anopheles darlingi.
2. The Brazilian Ministry of Health provides free antimalarial medicines, including chloroquine and primaquine, to treat malaria; however, these drugs can have side effects. Chloroquine can cause retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, neuromyopathy, and gastrointestinal issues, while primaquine can induce hemolysis, particularly in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD).
3. A study conducted in the municipality of Mâncio Lima, in the western Brazilian Amazon, evaluated the frequency of symptoms in vivax malaria patients before and after antimalarial treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. The study found that chloroquine significantly reduced fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain, but increased nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste, weakness, and hypochondrial pain. Primaquine led to a significant increase in choluria.
4. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, were more commonly reported after initiating antimalarial treatment, particularly with primaquine. Although severe hemolytic events are infrequent, healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential side effects of primaquine, especially in regions with high G6PD deficiency prevalence, to ensure proper management and treatment adherence.

1. The human lifespan has increased worldwide, leading to a higher proportion of elderly people, who often experience lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), erectile dysfunction (ED), and decreased libido simultaneously. These conditions coexist due to possible causes such as overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.
2. Studies have shown that age, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), nocturia, and uroflow rate correlate significantly with the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). The correlation between LUTS and ED persists even when controlling for age, implying that erectile function is not affected by subjective LUTS with a relatively greater prostate size.
3. Treatment of LUTS, a risk factor for ED, is essential for effectively improving sexual function in patients with BPH who concurrently have LUTS and ED. A combination of an alpha-blocker (tamsulosin) to improve LUTS and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin to improve irritative symptoms of the bladder is expected to have a positive effect on secondarily improving sexual function.

798," 1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be expressed in a cell-type specific manner and can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in cancer. In the context of cancer, specific miRNAs, including members of the miR-200 family, can affect the expression of proteins involved in pathways relevant to cancer, such as apoptosis, migration, and metastasis. The miR-200 family is responsible for repressing the expression of transcription factors such as Zeb1 and Zeb2, which are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that enables cancer cells to become more motile and metastatic.
2. The miR-200 family members are thought to be expressed in an epithelial cell-specific manner in normal tissues, and the ability of Zeb1 to transcriptionally repress the expression of miR-200 family members creates a double negative feedback loop that allows for plasticity between the epithelial and mesenchymal states. In breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, the mutual repression between Zeb1 and miR-200c is functional in some, but not all cells, and the reintroduction of miR-200c to cancer cells that lack it has been shown to decrease migration and invasion independently of the restoration of E-cadherin. Additionally, the repression of tubb3 by miR-200c has been shown to restore sensitivity to paclitaxel, indicating that loss of miR-200c is a marker for chemoresistance and aggressiveness in these cancers.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8}"

1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence involves two methods: the outside-in approach, first described by Delorme, and the inside-out approach, later described by de Leval. Both approaches aim to reduce potential complications associated with the retropubic approach. A meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the three most common surgical approaches, including the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator procedures.

2. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches in relation to neurovascular structures. However, traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the mesh (mus) configuration in relation to the urethra. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approaches using CT scan image analysis after tantalum wire marked mesh slings were implanted in cadavers.

3. The study found that the out-in mesh tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior, and are more closely wrapped around the inferior ischiopubic ramus than the in-out tapes. Both techniques showed a safe distance from the tapes to the obturator canal. The mean full inner angle in a strict anteroposterior view formed by the in-out mesh measured 122 (95%CI: 107-136), versus 144 (95%CI: 131-151) for the out-in mesh (p = 0.02).

4. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory. This technique can be applied to different types of non-radio-opaque implants, allowing for a better spatial understanding of the anatomical position within the pelvis. The findings from this study can help surgeons pay more attention to the second half of the helical pass, whichever way they chose to go, and can potentially correlate these findings to nuances in clinical outcomes",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16}"
