Encoding information in spin offers potential advantages, including lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation.\n4. In 1994, a scheme for a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed.\n5. However, these spintronic logic gates face challenges, such as metastable states and the need for unidirectional signal flow.\n6.

Another theory suggests a merger scenario where inner protoplanets perturb each other and merge to form a single massive, eccentric planet.\n5.

Six stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity are known to possess stellar companions in wide binary orbits.\n7. The Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the planet if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large.\n8.

Bell-nonlocality occurs when measurements violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality.\n3. EPR steerability is a weaker form of non-locality, where one party (Alice or Bob) can demonstrate steering by showing that correlations cannot be described by a local hidden state (LHS) model.\n4. Non-separability refers to states that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents.\n5.

Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experiences directed transport, and there is interest in extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems.\n2. Recent attention has been focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets. Chaotic systems are defined as those which are sensitively dependent on initial conditions, and the behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is generally sensitively dependent on the parameters of the system.\n3. The phase-space structure of nonlinear systems is usually complicated, consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas, or of simultaneously coexisting attractors. This can change significantly as parameters change, leading to dramatic changes in transport properties.\n4. A few years ago, Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the velocity of the particles averaged over time and the entire ensemble, could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.\n5. Mateos conjectured a connection between the reversal of current direction and a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics. However, a later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that this was not a valid rule even in the specific system considered by Mateos.\n6. Barbi and Salerno presented results showing that it was possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior. They proposed an alternative origin for the current reversal, suggesting it was related to the different stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system.\n7. The authors of the current document report on studies of the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the same system as considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno. They consider the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.\n8.

The source transmits confidential messages to the destination with the help of relays on the same band as the primary users, while the eavesdropper attempts to intercept the transmission.

The study of its essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence has attracted much attention in recent years.\n3. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) of qubits under Markovian decoherence can occur, but entanglement can also revive after some time.\n4. Even in some cases, ESD does not happen, and finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit due to structured environments.\n5. Recent research has shown that lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics.\n6. The entanglement does not disappear but changes location, reminiscent of entanglement dynamics in a double Jaynes-Cummings model.\n7. This paper shows that the identity about entanglement in the whole system can be satisfied at any time for a system of two qubits interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs.\n8. The distribution of entanglement among bipartite subsystems depends on the explicit properties of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.\n9. Instead of being entirely transferred to the reservoirs, entanglement can be stably distributed among all bipartite subsystems if qubit-reservoir bound states form and non-Markovian effects are important.\n10. The entanglement sudden death (ESD) of qubits is not always accompanied by the occurrence of entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of reservoirs.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 20}}

The production of hadrons at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally described in two steps: a hard scattering of partons followed by their fragmentation into hadrons.\n2. The first step is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second step uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.\n3. Recent findings show that this mechanism is inadequate for producing particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions, where recombination of partons is more appropriate, especially for soft partons.\n4. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.\n5. The shower parton distributions (SPDs) are primarily of interest in high-energy nuclear collisions, where hadronization occurs in an environment of soft partons.\n6. Semi-hard shower partons can recombine among themselves or with soft partons in the environment. In the former case, the fragmentation function is reproduced, while in the latter, a new component emerges in heavy-ion collisions.\n7. The main objective of this work is to quantify the properties of shower partons and illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons.\n8. The concept of shower partons is not new, but previous attempts to generate them in pQCD processes could not be used down to the hadronization scale.

Several discrete schemes have been proposed, but defining such a scheme has proven challenging, particularly with regards to the Hodge star and wedge product between forms.\n3. **Adams' Proposal**: Adams introduced a proposal that describes a local, discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space using two parallel lattices to maintain the locality of the Hodge star and a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product.

Often, such publications are discovered through the citation mechanism, with the number of citations serving as an estimate of scientific credibility, although this should not be taken too literally as some publications may go unnoticed or be forgotten over time.\n2. **Citation Distribution and Preferential Attachment**: Empirical studies, such as the one conducted by Redner (1998), have shown that the citation distribution of scientific publications follows a power-law form with an exponent of approximately -3. This power-law behavior is a consequence of a preferential attachment process, where highly cited papers are more likely to acquire further citations.\n3. **Modeling Citation Networks**: While there exist network models to mimic the complex structure and empirical results of citation distributions, these models often concentrate on the total number of citations without providing information about the issuing publications. To address this, a simple model is proposed that considers two research areas and references within and across each other, making it applicable to various complex systems, including the web of human sexual contacts.\n4. **Model Definition and Analysis**: The model is defined with the following considerations: initially, both networks contain nodes with no cross-links. At each time step, two new nodes with no incoming links, one belonging to each network, are introduced simultaneously. The new nodes attach their outgoing links preferentially to pre-existing nodes in both networks. The time evolution of the model is analyzed using a rate equation approach, focusing on the joint distribution of intra-links and cross-links.\n5. **Model Findings and Applications**: The model's analysis reveals that the total in-degree distribution in both networks follows a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes. The distribution of intra-links and cross-links also exhibits power-law behavior, with exponents that depend on the coupling parameters between the networks. The model's flexibility allows it to represent various complex systems, such as citation networks and the web of human sexual contacts, and its findings can be compared with existing data and empirical studies.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 20}}

The AGN feedback process has been observed through scaling relationships between the mass of the SMBH and different properties of the host galaxy, such as the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge, the bulge mass, and the bulge luminosity.\n5. However, there is still debate about the exact mechanism of AGN feedback and its dominant role in the overall evolution of galaxies, as new observations at low and high redshifts seem to deviate from the well-established relationships.\n6. To study the starburst-AGN connection, it is essential to have accurate estimates of the SFR in AGN host galaxies, which can be challenging due to contamination from the central AGN in well-calibrated indicators such as H\u03b1 emission and UV luminosity.\n7. Many studies turn to the infrared (IR) regime, where dust re-emits the stellar light from young stars, providing insights into the current SFR (within the last ~100 Myr).\n8. Dust fills the ISM of galaxies and plays an important part in their physics, but it contributes very little to their overall mass, with the radiative output mainly in the IR regime constituting roughly half of the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy on average.\n9. The Herschel Space Observatory, with its Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), has pushed into the submillimeter range, probing the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the modified blackbody that accurately describes the broadband FIR SED of galaxies.\n10. Recent studies have shown the power of long-wavelength Herschel data to better constrain the SFR, dust mass, and dust temperature in AGN host galaxies.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 20}}

Organic molecular crystals are promising candidates for nanoscale devices in electronics and optoelectronics, with applications in solar energy harvesting, surface photochemistry, organic electronics, and spintronics.\n2. These devices typically consist of an organic component (active part) and an inorganic component (electrical contact), with the electronic structure of their interface playing a crucial role in device performance.\n3. Charge transfer between the organic and inorganic components, and the energies at which this occurs, are important factors to understand and determine.\n4. Upon adsorption on a substrate, the electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change from their gas phase counterparts due to polarization of the substrate.\n5. A common approach to calculate these energies is the quasiparticle (qp) description, which ignores molecular orbital relaxation and takes the relative alignment of the metal Fermi level with the molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) as removal and addition energies, respectively.\n6. Density functional theory (DFT) is often used to calculate HOMO and LUMO energies, but local and semi-local approximations perform poorly, even for the HOMO level. Hybrid functionals, self-interaction-corrected functionals, and range-separated functionals show improved results.\n7. Calculating the energy levels alignment of a molecule near a metal presents additional challenges, as the formation of the image charge is a non-local phenomenon that many functionals fail to capture.\n8. The GW approximation can capture energy levels renormalization due to the image charge effect but is highly computationally demanding and may not be feasible for larger systems.\n9. Constrained density functional theory (CDFT) is a more resource-efficient alternative for evaluating charge transfer energies in organic molecules physisorbed on inorganic substrates.\n10. In this paper, CDFT is used to study the adsorption of molecules on a 2D metal (graphene) in various configurations, revealing that the addition and removal energies decrease in absolute value as the molecule approaches the graphene sheet, following a classical electrostatic model.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 40}}

MOPE-D is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on model parameters, requiring calculation and inversion at each likelihood evaluation.\n3. However, MOPE-D only guarantees maintaining the Fisher matrix of the likelihood at a chosen point, which can lead to issues with multimodal and some degenerate distributions.\n4. This paper explores the limitations of MOPE-D's application, noting that while it can provide significant speed improvements, it may not accurately represent the likelihood function in all cases.\n\n5. MOPE-D works by compressing data into a smaller set of independent, unit-variance values, simplifying likelihood calculations to a single operation.\n6. The compression is done using weighting vectors generated from a fiducial set of parameter values, which can be iteratively improved.\n7. The peak of the MOPE-D likelihood function is not guaranteed to be unique, as multiple points in the original parameter space may map to the same point in the compressed space.\n8. MOPE-D assumes the covariance matrix is independent of parameters, but it can handle more complex noise models at a computational cost.\n\n9.

The relation between chaotic behavior and tunneling phenomenon in classically chaotic systems is an interesting and important subject in the study of quantum physics.\n4. Lin and Ballentine studied the interplay between tunneling and classical chaos for a particle in a double-well potential with oscillatory driving force.\n5. They found that coherent tunneling takes place between small isolated classical stable regions of phase space bounded by Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) surfaces, which are much smaller than the volume of a single potential well.\n6.

Several unresolved aspects of collisions are notable, including the role of low-x gluons in relation to the underlying event, the nature and systematics of the underlying event, and the possible existence and phenomenology of a nonjet azimuth quadrupole component of 2d angular correlations.\n4. A two-component (soft+hard) model (tcm) of hadron production in high-energy nuclear collisions has been reviewed, serving as a mathematical framework for data description and a basis for physical interpretation of data systematics.\n5. The tcm has been interpreted to represent two main sources of final-state hadrons: longitudinal projectile-nucleon dissociation (soft) and large-angle scattered parton fragmentation (hard).\n6.

Homopolymers, which consist of identical monomers, have a well-understood physical behavior, while heteropolymers, which have a random sequence of monomers, are less understood.\n2. The behavior of heteropolymers can be studied using statistical descriptions, which treat them as ensembles of molecules with various interactions. These models have connections to spin glasses and exhibit disordered behavior.\n3. The energy of a heteropolymer is determined by various interactions, including van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, and Coulomb interactions. These interactions cause the polymer to fold into a specific shape, which is responsible for its activity.\n4. The study of heteropolymers is challenging due to the large number of monomers and the complexity of their interactions. However, recent experimental studies of solutions and gels of polymers with randomly charged groups have provided new insights.\n5. The paper focuses on simple models of heteropolymers, which include the essential ingredients of the problem. The overall size and shape of a polymer are controlled by Coulomb interactions, which are the strongest and have the longest range.\n6.

The security of standard BB84 with basis-dependent flaw has already been shown to be secure, and this idea can be generalized to the case where there is basis-dependent flaw from both Alice and Bob.\n4. In the virtual protocol of the phase encoding scheme I, Alice and Bob prepare joint systems in a state that is a purification of the BB84 states, and they send the second system to the eavesdropper (Eve) who possesses the measurement unit (MU).\n5. The first system given to Eve in the virtual protocol allows her to know which coherent pulses contain data in the sifted key, and she can post-select only the relevant pulses.\n6. The most important quantity in the proof is the phase error rate in the code bits, which is the rate of bit errors along the Z-basis in the sifted key if Alice and Bob had chosen the Z-basis as the measurement basis when both of them have sent pulses in the X-basis.\n7. The key generation rate given the X-basis, in the asymptotic limit of large n, is given by an equation that depends on the bit error rate in the X-basis, the inefficiency of the error correcting code, and the phase error rate.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 28}}

Unlike graphene, AI3 exhibits several distinct characteristics, including tilted Dirac cones, anisotropic Fermi surfaces, and a smaller average Fermi velocity.\n2. **Electronic Correlations**: The smaller Fermi velocity in AI3, compared to graphene, suggests stronger electronic correlations. This is because the effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions is inversely proportional to the Fermi velocity, making it ten times larger in AI3 than in graphene.\n3. **Additional Massive Carriers**: AI3 also hosts additional massive carriers near the Fermi level, as indicated by ab initio band structure calculations. However, the interplay between massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers has not yet been experimentally proven.\n4. **Topological Merging of Dirac Points**: At high but experimentally accessible pressures, a topological merging of Dirac points is expected in AI3.\n5. **Magneto-Transport Measurements**: The study presents magneto-transport measurements of AI3 crystals under hydrostatic pressures greater than 3 GPa, where Dirac carriers are present. These measurements confirm the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and, for the first time, experimentally prove the presence of low-mobility massive holes, agreeing with recent band structure calculations.\n6. **Interplay of Carrier Types**: The main result of the study is the interplay between massless Dirac fermions and massive holes at low energy. The measured mobilities for both carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.\n7. **Temperature Dependence of Carrier Densities and Mobilities**: The study shows that the carrier densities for both massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers exhibit a strong temperature dependence, with a low Fermi temperature that suggests the absence of charge inhomogeneities. The carrier mobilities also display a power-law behavior with temperature, with exponents consistent with theoretical expectations for massive and massless Dirac particles.\n8. **Thermopower Measurements and Carrier Types**: Thermopower measurements under pressure support the two-carrier scenario, with a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient indicating that the relevant carriers at low temperatures have a different charge than those at high temperatures. The study concludes that massless Dirac electrons dominate the low-field conduction, while massive holes drive the conduction at high magnetic fields and low temperatures.\n</", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 32}}

Quantum entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, characterized by a set of conservation laws and treated as a physical resource. It can be quantified using measures such as the entropy of entanglement, which is unity for maximally entangled Bell states and conserved under local operations and classical communication.\n2. In practical scenarios, quantum systems interact with their environment, leading to mixed states. The quantification of entanglement in mixed states is less clear, as a given density operator can be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for the average entanglement. Various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem, such as the entanglement of formation and entanglement of distillation.\n3. The cascaded qubit system considered in this paper produces unconditional entangled states as the steady-state solution to a master equation. However, the approach to the steady state takes place over an infinite amount of time for a special choice of parameters (resonance). The master equation itself offers limited insight into the behavior of the system at resonance.\n4. Quantum trajectory theory can provide answers to questions about the entanglement dynamics of the cascaded qubit system. By considering the conditional evolution of the system, it was shown that, at resonance, the system is either in a maximally entangled Bell state or oscillating between two Bell states, leading to the concept of an entangled-state cycle.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 16}}

Majorana fermions (MFs) are real solutions of the Dirac equation and are their own antiparticles, initially proposed as a model for neutrinos but recently predicted to occur as quasi-particle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems.\n2. MFs obey non-Abelian statistics, which is crucial for realizing subsequent potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing. Recent research has focused on hosting MFs in exotic solid-state systems, particularly topological superconductors.\n3. Various realistic platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires (SNWs), and atomic chains, have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect. However, observing unique Majorana signatures experimentally remains a significant challenge.\n4. MFs are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments, manifesting as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs). Theoretical predictions of ZBPs have been observed experimentally in SNWs, interpreted as signatures of MFs.\n5. The first reason why zero-bias conductance peaks can also appear due to other mechanisms is the zero-bias anomaly due to Kondo resonance and disorder or band bending in the SNW. The second reason is that Andreev bound states in a magnetic field can also exhibit a zero-energy crossing, giving rise to similar conductance features.\n6. Most experimental evidence for Majorana bound states relies on measurements of the tunneling conductance, and the observation of Majorana signatures based on electrical methods remains a subject of debate. Identifying MFs only through tunnel spectroscopy is problematic, necessitating alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFs.\n7. The authors propose an alternative all-optical scheme to detect MFs using a coupled hybrid quantum dot (QD) - nanomechanical resonator (NR) system with an optical pump-probe scheme. This scheme provides another method for detecting MFs, distinct from the zero-bias peak in tunneling experiments.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21}}

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by no hydrogen but strong silicon lines in their spectra at maximum brightness, making them brighter than most other supernova types and exhibiting uniform light curves, which makes them useful as standard candles for measuring distances to remote galaxies.\n2. A plausible explosion model for SNe Ia is the accreting white dwarf (WD) model, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from its companion star, increases its mass, and eventually explodes. Recent progress in this model includes the introduction of a stellar wind from the WD while it accretes material, which helps sustain stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.\n3. According to this model, there are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. These paths predict which companion stars lead to SNe Ia, but this scenario has not been confirmed by observations due to the need to identify the companion star near the explosion site.\n4. A study by @xcite argued that they identified a G2IV star as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) by measuring the velocities and distances of stars near the center of the SNR. However, the thick disk star alternative is unlikely due to the low expected stellar mass in the region.\n5. The authors propose a direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SNR ejecta. Observations of an S-M star near SNR 1006 suggest that broad wings in the absorption lines can indicate the star's position relative to the SNR ejecta.\n6. The authors estimate the amount of Fe I in the ejecta of Tycho's SNR and calculate spectra of a star located at the center of the SNR to discuss whether the Fe I absorption lines can be used to identify the companion star. Even if a star with these absorption features is found, it may not necessarily be the companion star, as other stars in the vicinity could also be accelerated by the explosion.\n7. The authors conclude that, if the companion star is located at the center of a young SNR like Tycho's, it should exhibit very deep absorption lines with unique shapes in its spectrum. However, factors such as the number of ionizing photons and the ionization state of ions in the shocked region could reduce or even erase these distinct absorption features.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 28}}

These features are interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like or circular appearance in projection and evidence for expansion in position-velocity space.\n3. Two main classes of explanations for the supershells posit internal and external sources of kinetic energy: starbursts driving stellar winds and supernova explosions, and infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies.\n4. However, these models face difficulties in explaining the supershell phenomenon, particularly in isolated galaxies like NGC 3556 and NGC 3044, where there is no evidence of recent star formation or interaction with other galaxies.\n5. A new explanation for HI supershells is proposed, involving radio jets that plow through the interstellar medium (ISM), accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles.\n6. This model is supported by observations of radio bubbles and shells within the lobes of radio galaxies, as well as the presence of dark shells straddling the nucleus along the radio outflow axes in Hercules A.\n7.

The most drastic changes in the macroscopic properties of a physical system occur at phase transitions, which often involve a symmetry breaking process.\n3. The theory of such phase transitions was formulated by Landau as a phenomenological model and later derived from microscopic principles using the renormalization group.\n4. One can identify phases by knowledge of an order parameter which is zero in the disordered phase and nonzero in the ordered phase.\n5. In many known models, the order parameter can be determined by symmetry considerations of the underlying Hamiltonian, but there are states of matter where such a parameter can only be defined in a complicated non-local way.\n6. These systems include topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin hall states, or quantum spin liquids, and new methods are needed to identify parameters capable of describing phase transitions.\n7. Machine learning techniques have been employed by physicists in recent years, with supervised learning algorithms and reinforcement learning being the most commonly used.\n8. Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as principal component analysis, have also been used to reproduce Monte Carlo sampled states of the Ising model and find phase transitions.\n9. Variational autoencoders, a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, have shown promising results in encoding and reconstructing data in the field of computer vision.\n10. In this work, unsupervised learning is used to determine phase transitions without any information about the microscopic theory or the order parameter.\n11.

For instance, searching an item in an unsorted database of N elements requires only O(\u221aN) steps with Grover's algorithm, compared to O(N) with classical algorithms.\n2. **Grover's Algorithm and Physical Systems**: Grover's algorithm has been realized using various physical systems like NMR, superconducting qubits, and atom-cavity QED systems. Superconducting qubits, particularly squids, are attractive due to their strong coupling limit in microwave cavities compared to atoms in cavity QED.\n3. **Implementation of Grover's Algorithm**: The goal of the work is to implement Grover's algorithm using four-level squids in cavity-QED. The scheme uses a three-qubit phase gate, reducing the number of quantum gates required. The algorithm is probabilistic and requires multiple iterations to achieve high success probability.\n4. **Imperfections and Decoherence**: The implementation considers the effects of imperfections, such as spontaneous decay from intermediate levels and cavity decay. The scheme is designed to suppress decoherence caused by adjusting level spacing and uses resonant and off-resonant interactions to speed up Grover's iterations.

This discovery may also have implications for the field of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.\n3. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature may be beneficial for having the Higgs responsible for inflation and as a suppression mechanism for the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields.\n4. Upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons from LHC experiments have been discussed, and bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity may also be obtained by considering strong-gravity astrophysical objects.\n5. The presence of a strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles such as the electron.\n6. Nucleons, however, should be minimally affected by the strong curvature since most of their mass arises from the gluonic fields that are not coupled to the Higgs field at tree level.\n7. Peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions but should be strongly suppressed for molecular transitions in which the main role is played by the nuclei themselves.\n8.

The analysis of modern accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments requires a good understanding of the intermediate-energy neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section, particularly the importance of multi-nucleon events in charge-changing quasielastic cross sections at typical neutrino energies. The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data, leading to a growing interest in including 2p-2h models into the Monte Carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations. The only 2p-2h model implemented so far is the IFIC Valencia model, incorporated in the GENIE generator, with plans to include the Lyon model and phenomenological approaches like the effective transverse enhancement model in other generators such as NuWro.\n\n2. One of the main challenges in implementing 2p-2h models is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over the final 2p-2h states. To speed up calculations, several approximations can be made, such as choosing an average momentum for the nucleons in the local Fermi gas, neglecting exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations to two nested integrals by performing a non-relativistic expansion of the current operators. In this work, a fast and efficient method called the frozen nucleon approximation is presented, which reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model from 7 to 1. This approach is validated by comparing the nucleon frozen approximation with the exact calculation and found to work properly in computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 8}}

Physically, there is a difference between external and internal symmetries.\n4. The breakdown of an external symmetry is not dangerous for the consistency of the theory, but it provides, for instance, the physical explanation for the K0 decay or the solution to the U(1) problem in QCD.\n5. On the other hand, the breakdown of an internal symmetry (i.e., gauge symmetry) leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory.\n6. The anomalies destroy the renormalizability of the theory and also the unitarity of the S-matrix.\n7. To avoid such anomalies, severe restrictions are imposed on the physical content of a theory.\n8.

This method involves augmenting the target space parametrized by the scalar fields to a larger space of lorentzian signature, with the logarithm of the scale factor playing the role of time. The cosmological trajectories in this augmented space are geodesics with respect to a conformally rescaled metric, which are timelike for positive potentials, null for zero potentials, and spacelike for negative potentials.\n2. The text also discusses the asymptotic behavior of cosmologies in models with general potentials by comparing them to the asymptotic behavior of cosmologies in models with exponential potentials. For flat cosmologies with positive potentials, the scalar fields approach constant values at late times, and the characteristic functions of the potential also become constant.

This star was identified as LSPM J2322+7847, a candidate nearby low-mass dwarf, and was previously reported by Luyten in 1967 as LP 12-90.\n2. **Photometry and Parallax**: New photometry was obtained for Hip 115147, its known visual companion Hip 115147b, and LSPM J2322+7847. Preliminary trigonometric parallax astrometry for LSPM J2322+7847 yielded a distance of 24.5 pc, suggesting it is an M-dwarf at the same distance as Hip 115147.\n3. **Age and Origin of the System**: Hip 115147 is a young, rapidly rotating G9V star with strong chromospheric and coronal activity, suggesting an age of less than 20 myr. It is part of the Local Association, which includes stars of diverse ages. The star's high X-ray luminosity also points to a young age, possibly less than 100 myr.\n4. **HR Diagrams and Isochrones**: HR diagrams in 2MASS J, H, and K passbands were plotted using photometric data from the literature and the authors' own data. The best fit for all three stars was found with the 50 myr isochrone from Siess et al., suggesting an age of around 50 myr for the system.\n5. **Comparison with Other Stars**: The stars were compared with members of the TW Hydrae Association and other young stars in the solar neighborhood. Hip 115147 and its companions were found to be older than the TWA members and likely older than 16 myr. They may have originated from the LDN 1709 molecular cloud in the Ophiuchus star-forming region.\n6. **Future Work**: More accurate absolute proper motions for both companions and spectroscopic radial velocities are needed to clarify the dynamical status of", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 24}}

Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models are attractive due to their calculable soft terms, real and flavor invariant, and renormalization group invariant properties. However, they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass squared parameters, leading to tachyonic states.\n2. The original solution to this problem is to add a universal mass term to the AMSB soft terms, rendering them positive. This results in the parameter space of the minimal AMSB model (mAMSB) being given by m_0, m_3/2, and sign(\u03bc).\n3. An alternative setup for AMSB is hypercharged anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (HCAMSB), which uses a similar setup as AMSB but with susy breaking localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, geometrically separated from the visible region.\n4. In HCAMSB, the warping suppresses contributions due to tree-level gravity mediation, and anomaly mediation can become the dominant source of susy breaking in the visible sector. However, gaugino masses of U(1) gauge symmetries are not determined by anomaly mediation.\n5. The HCAMSB soft susy breaking contribution is parametrized using a dimensionless quantity, \u03b1, such that the parameter space of HCAMSB models is given by m_0, m_3/2, \u03b1, and sign(\u03bc).\n6. In HCAMSB, the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively by the large top quark Yukawa coupling, and the soft susy breaking (SSB) terms are of the form: m_1 = \u03b1m_3/2, m_a = m_3/2 (a=2,3), m_i^2 = -14(g_1^2 + g_2^2)m_3/2^2, and a_f = m_3/2.\n7. The wino and gluino masses receive a contribution from the bino mass at the two-loop level, making them one loop suppressed compared to the scalar masses in pure hypercharge mediation.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21}}

Surveys using bolometer arrays at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths are potentially sensitive to dusty objects at extreme redshifts, galaxies that drop out of surveys at shorter and longer wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavourable @xmath11 corrections. The first cosmological surveys using SCUBA and MAMBO quickly changed the accepted picture of galaxy formation and evolution, with the discovery of so-called `SCUBA galaxies' being greeted with surprise due to the remarkable evolution in the dusty, starburst galaxy population implied by such a large source density at the flux levels accessible to the first generation of bolometer arrays.\n2. Excitement was replaced by pessimism with the first efforts to study SMGs at optical and infrared (IR) wavelengths, as early reports suggested that the majority of the submm population had no plausible optical counterparts. Attention was diverted to various redshift engines and broadband photometric techniques, resulting in only a handful of detailed studies being attempted, often for extreme and possibly unrepresentative galaxies. Recent progress has largely been the result of radio imaging of submm survey fields, with early radio follow-up detecting roughly half of the submm sources observed, with an astrometric precision of @xmath30.3@xmath12 and, combined with the submm flux density, providing a rough estimate of redshift. Radio data also enabled some refinement of submm samples, increasing the detection fraction to two-thirds of SMGs at 0.85-mm flux density levels in excess of @xmath35mjy. With positions in hand, these bright SMGs were found to be a diverse population, some quasar-like, with broad lines and x-ray detections, some morphologically complex, some extremely red, some with the unmistakable signatures of obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds. Spectroscopic redshifts have been difficult to determine, with the first survey based on a submm/radio sample undertaken by Chapman et al.

The goal of the paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps induced by a cobordism between two 3-manifolds, under certain conditions.\n4. The paper assumes that the cobordism is built from two-handle additions, and that the induced maps on the heegaard floer groups are surjective.\n5.

The Hilbert space inverse wave (HSIW) algorithm is applied to the collected data to form images, accounting for phase, amplitude, and beam diffraction.\n4. An exemplary application is the characterization of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).\n5. The RRDT method can also be combined with elastography to gain further insight into a surrounding medium's elastic properties.\n6. The RRDT method can be used for non-destructive characterization in applications other than intravascular imaging, such as tracking underground contamination plumes or waste in contamination barrels.\n7. The Hilbert space wave inversion involves mapping from a continuous object space to a discrete measurement space using a scattering operator.\n8. The HSIW method derives an inverse of the scattering operator using singular value decomposition (SVD) and solves for the object function given measured data.\n9.

The ventilator delivers air or air enriched with oxygen to the subject via an interface such as a nose-mask, at a pressure that is higher during inspiration and lower during expiration.\n4. In the awake state and while waiting to go to sleep, the subject's ventilatory pattern is variable in rate and depth.\n5.

The inventor has designed a new valve that allows intermittent flushing and cleaning while maintaining the sterile condition of the process system.\n3. **Invention**: The valve combines elements previously found in the valve art with a unique feature of partial separation of the rotor-stator faces to allow flushing across the process fluid-contacting surfaces. A diaphragm-like elastomeric seal retains sanitizing process fluids when the faces are partially separated for cleaning.\n4. **Operation**: The valve operates by rotating the rotor, which has an elastomeric diaphragm molded to form multiple sealing ports. The diaphragm's integral dynamic wipe sealing lips maintain fluid-tight sealing engagement with the stator face even when the rotor is moved orthogonally away from the stator for sanitization.\n5. **Applications**: The valve is designed for use in liquid chromatographic columns and sanitary liquid handling systems. It can be used in simulated moving bed (SMB) adsorption and separation processes, such as those used in the pharmaceutical industry for purifying biological macromolecules.\n6. **Advantages**: The valve provides a simple and reliable elastomeric means of ensuring sealing of all ports, which is tolerant of imperfect flatness or parallelism of the stator or rotor sealing faces.

The travelling assembly moves with the work during buttonhole sewing and includes a slidable member positionable by a button for which a buttonhole is to be sewn.\n4. **Buttonhole Formation**: The slidable member carries a tab to actuate a tripping lever on the machine during movement of the assembly, limiting the length of the buttonhole formed to that suitable for the inserted button. An adjustable stop mounted on the travelling assembly engages the tripping lever to terminate buttonhole formation, allowing the operator to precisely define the closure point.\n5. **Machine Operation**: The machine sews top bar and left leg zig-zag stitches with the tripping lever in a forward position, and bottom bar and right leg zig-zag stitches with the lever in a rearward position. The travelling assembly moves with the work, and the adjustable stop engages the tripping lever to end the sewing operation.\n6. **Adjustment and Use**: After sewing a buttonhole in sample material, the operator can adjust the stop to ensure proper closure. When sewing in different materials, the stop is readjusted to compensate for varying slippage, ensuring perfect buttonholes in each garment.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 24}}

The dry cleaning machine of the present invention provides an air flow system for bringing ambient air into the access opening whenever the door is opened, which is exclusive of the air recirculating system and substantially reduces exhausting the residual solvent vapors from the tubs. This is achieved by a separate intake fan and duct interposed between the access opening of the machine housing and the open ends of the interior tubs, with a normally closed valve so that during normal operation of the machine, the separate intake system is isolated from the solvent vapors developed during the cleaning cycle. In response to the access door being opened, the intake fan is energized and the valve is opened so that air is drawn into the access opening and directly into the interposed duct with only that vapor generally immediately adjacent the open end of the tubs commingling with the intake air and lost to atmosphere. However, for the most part, the vapors within the tubs are retained and the loss of solvent is minimized.\n2. The machine includes a separate solvent flow system that operates in distinct cycles during the cleaning process. During the stand-by, fill, and wash cycles, the solvent is pumped from a storage tank through filters and into the tubs, with the solvent then being drained and spun out of the clothes during the drain and spin cycles. During the tumble dry with heat cycle, the solvent continues to flow through the filters, but the system is isolated from any evaporative air circulated during the dry cycle. In the last minute of the cycle, the solvent is caused to flow through the filters in a reversed direction in an operation known as \"backwash\" to clean the filters. The machine also includes a separate air flow system that operates in distinct cycles during the cleaning process. During the stand-by with the access door closed, there is no airflow as no blower is energized and the valves are normally closed. However, should the door become open, a door switch immediately energizes a valve and an exhaust blower to draw ambient room air through the front opening and into the upper portion of the header chamber with minimal penetration into the interior of the tubs so that the solvent vapors within the tub are not exhausted while the air is being drawn through the front opening to prevent the user from encountering solvent vapor fumes.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 8}}

The valve allows for a mixture ranging from 0% inlet A fluid, 100% inlet B fluid to 100% inlet A fluid, 0% inlet B fluid.\n2. **Industry Background and Need**: In the commercial airline industry, aircraft are cleaned extensively on a yearly basis by teams of airline employees using various cleaning agents and bulky machinery. There is a need for a stand-alone cleaning apparatus that allows multiple users to accomplish specific cleaning tasks without disrupting other team members and provides each user with complete control over the strength of the particular cleaning solution being used.\n3. **Valve Components**: The mixing valve comprises a valve body, a first inlet passage for receiving a first fluid at a first predetermined pressure, a second inlet passage for receiving a second fluid at a second predetermined pressure, an outlet passage for providing a proportional mixture of the two fluids, and a valve means disposed within the body for directing the two fluids toward the outlet passage.\n4. **Valve Adjustment**: The valve means is adjustable to permit the mixture to range, in an analog fashion, between a proportion of about 0% first fluid, 100% second fluid to about 100% first fluid, 0% second fluid.\n5. **Valve Operation**: The valve operates by rotating a handle that moves two offset bores, each connected to one of the inlet passages, into and out of alignment with their respective outlet passages. This allows for the continuous adjustment of the mixture ratio.\n6. **Flow Control**: The valve includes a flow restricting device in the first inlet passage to reduce the flow rate of the first fluid and maintain constant fluid pressures at the inlet passages. Additionally, the maximum flow rate through each bore occurs only when it is aligned with its respective outlet passage, further helping to maintain constant fluid pressures.\n7. **Valve Assembly and Sealing**: The valve assembly includes a spool valve with cylindrical portions and spools that are slidably received within the valve body's bore. Fluid seal rings are used to retain the fluids in their respective areas and prevent leakage, with the seal rings being resistant to chemicals present in the cleaning solutions.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 28}}

The fabrication method described in patent EP 0971044 can be applied to butt-welded blanks, but this method runs into difficulties when welding coated steel blanks, as a portion of the initial surface pre-coating is transferred into the molten area created by the welding operation, forming intermetallic areas that reduce the overall deformability of the welded joints after heat treatment.\n3. The present invention provides a solution to this problem by eliminating the source of these intermetallic areas, namely the initial surface metal coating liable to be melted during butt-welding, by removing a portion of the precoat on either side of the future welded joint.\n4. The width of this area from which the pre-coating is removed must be at least equal to that of the future area melted by welding so as not to encourage subsequent formation of intermetallic areas. In practice, it must be much more than this, to allow for fluctuations in the width of the molten area during the assembly operation.\n5.

The parent application disclosed thin substrate waveguides for convenient white light illumination and uniform illumination.\n2. **Challenges in Traditional Illumination**: Traditional illumination systems require substantial space, contain multiple optical elements, and can cause stability and alignment issues. They may also waste light by flooding the object instead of patterning it. Additionally, they may require spectral filtering, especially for hologram illumination.\n3. **Advantages of Waveguide Hologram Illuminators**: Waveguide hologram (WGH) illuminators offer several advantages, including compact size, high diffraction efficiency, and minimal stray light.

Solutions include attaching the light source firmly to the waveguide, using a broad source and allowing the waveguide to select the matched light, recording the hologram non-uniformly, absorbing or reflecting the light emerging from one side, and using polarization or phase modulation for SLMs.\n5. **Recording Systems for WGH**: Two basic architectures were used to record the WGH grating: a modified conventional holographic recording system using a cubic glass prism, and a system suitable for waveguides with more stringent requirements using a prism coupler.\n6. **Experiments and Results**: Experiments involved illuminating a SLM with a white light illuminator recorded using the first configuration, and analyzing the quality of the reconstructed beams.

It compares charge pump circuits and switching regulator circuits, noting that charge pumps have high energy efficiency but low current capability, while switching regulators provide high current but generate radiated energy as noise.\n2. **Problem**: Conventional charge pump circuits may not provide sufficient current for larger displays, such as those on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch. Switching regulator circuits, while capable of high current, produce significant EMI, which can degrade the quality of transmitted and received signals in devices with wireless capabilities.\n3. **Solution**: The document presents methods and apparatus for generating supply voltages for display driver circuits at high efficiencies and with low EMI. The solution involves modifying switching regulator circuits to create multiple circuit paths that carry electric current in opposite directions, canceling out radiated noise.\n4. **Circuit Design**: In one embodiment, the parallel source and drain paths are configured in an alternating relationship, with a source path to ground placed between each two drain paths providing the output voltage. This arrangement cancels out EMI generated in the source paths by the EMI generated in the drain paths.\n5. **Terminal Leads**: In another embodiment, terminal leads are added at the periphery edges of the circuit. These leads act as RF antennas to pick up any leaking fields generated by the last fully-connected paths in the circuit, further reducing EMI.\n6. **Media Player Apparatus**: The document also describes media player apparatus operating in accordance with the methods and circuits of the present invention, which can produce sufficient current to drive circuits for relatively large displays without generating excessive EMI.\n7. **Detailed Description**: The detailed description provides a schematic diagram of a switching regulator, a timing diagram depicting its operation, a schematic diagram of a conventional implementation of a switching regulator for a digital display, and a schematic diagram illustrating various embodiments of the present invention, including the use of terminal leads to further reduce EMI.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 28}}

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides two main approaches for reorganizing or terminating large financial companies: judicial bankruptcy process and special legal and regulatory resolution regimes.\n2. Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure aiming to help individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts, with a goal of equitable treatment of creditors.\n3. Bankruptcy proceedings under Chapters 7 and 11 can be voluntary or involuntary, with the debtor typically remaining in control of its assets under Chapter 11.\n4. The automatic stay in bankruptcy prevents most lawsuits, foreclosures, and collection activities against the debtor, preserving assets and preventing creditors from taking company assets.\n5. The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities, including bankruptcy courts, the Judicial Conference of the United States, AOUSC, the Federal Judicial Center, the Department of Justice\u2019s U.S. Trustee Program, and the judiciary\u2019s Bankruptcy Administrator Program.\n6. Large, complex financial companies that are eligible to file for bankruptcy generally file under Chapter 11 of the Code, with many operating in the United States and organized under both U.S. and foreign laws.\n7. Certain financial institutions may not file as debtors under the Code and face special restrictions in using the Code, including insured depository institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, and commodity brokers.\n8. Regulators often play a role in financial company bankruptcies, with the Code not explicitly naming federal financial regulators as a party of interest with a right to be heard before the court.\n9. The safe harbor provisions in the Code allow nondefaulting counterparties in qualified financial contracts (QFCs) to exercise certain contractual rights even if doing so otherwise would violate the automatic stay.\n10.

They provide a variety of common administrative services, such as payroll processing, information technology support, employee assistance programs, public relations, and contracting. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized the Office of Management and Budget to designate six federal agencies to establish the franchise fund pilot program. Congress anticipated that the franchise funds would be able to provide common administrative services more efficiently than federal agencies\u2019 own personnel.\n2. **Operating Principles**: The original operating principles for franchise funds included offering services on a fully competitive basis, using a comprehensive set of performance measures to assess the quality of franchise fund services, and establishing cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors\u2014other government organizations providing the same types of services. The franchise funds are required to recover their full costs of doing business and are allowed to retain up to 4 percent of their total annual income.\n3. **DOD's Use of Franchise Funds**: DOD primarily uses two franchise funds for contracting services\u2014GovWorks, operated by the Department of the Interior, and FedSource, operated by the Department of the Treasury. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to a range of regulatory requirements and contracting practices designed to protect the government\u2019s interests.\n4. **Contracting Process**: The contracting process involves three main parties: the government customer, the franchise fund, and the contractor. DOD program officials are most familiar with the technical requirements for the goods and services they need. DOD contracting officers can place orders directly through many interagency contracts, or DOD can pay the franchise fund to assume many of the contracting responsibilities that normally would have been handled by DOD\u2019s contracting officers.\n5. **Competition and Pricing**: To ensure that the government\u2019s interests are protected when purchasing goods and services, competition, determining fair and reasonable pricing, and monitoring contractor performance are essential. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) states that contracting officers must purchase goods and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. Price competition is the preferred method to ensure that prices are fair and reasonable.\n6. **GovWorks and FedSource Review**: We reviewed 10 orders totaling about $164 million in fiscal year 2003 funding for GovWorks and 7 projects amounting to $85 million for FedSource.

The consultation process may result in a jeopardy opinion and reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to avoid harm to the species.\n2. **Exemption Process**: If a federal action cannot proceed without jeopardizing a species and RPAs are not feasible, an exemption may be sought. The exemption process involves a committee of top government officials who balance the national interest in protecting listed species against the national interest in proceeding with the project. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) reviews applications, and an exemption can be granted if there are no reasonable alternatives, the benefits of the action outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action, the action is of regional or national significance, and no irreversible commitments have been made.\n3. **Exemption History**: Since the ESA was enacted, only six exemptions have been sought, with only two granted. The exemption process has been used rarely, with most attempts occurring in the 1970s and 1980s. In recent years, there have been proposals to seek exemptions for California water projects, but no exemptions have been granted.\n4. **Exemption Process Limitations**: The ESC cannot grant an exemption if the Secretary of State certifies that the action would violate a treaty or international obligation. Conversely, the ESC must grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense finds that it is necessary for national security. In cases of a presidentially declared disaster, the President can make the determinations that would have been made by the Secretary and the ESC.\n5. **ESA Interaction with Other Laws**: Even if an exemption is granted, other underlying issues related to natural resources may still exist. The ESA may interact with state laws, and where ESA requirements are stricter or incompatible, they will preempt state requirements. However, in some cases, both ESA and state requirements may apply simultaneously. Additionally, other federal laws may still be in play, potentially leading to continued controversy and legal challenges even after an exemption is granted.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 15}}

Premiums are capped, usually between 150% and 200% of standard risk rates. States augment premium collection with assessments on insurers, general revenue, and other state sources, as well as federal grants.

It was primarily a response to concerns about the impact of chain grocery stores, like A&P, on smaller competitors.\n\n2. **Key Provisions and Exceptions**: The act applies only to goods sold for resale within the U.S. and does not cover services. It allows exceptions for commodities not of \"like grade and quality,\" sales for export, and certain defenses like meeting competition and cost justification. The 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act exempts purchases by nonprofit institutions for their own use.\n\n3. **Nonprofit Institutions Act Interpretation**: The Supreme Court in Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Association (1976) and Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Ass'n., Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories (1983) interpreted the nonprofit exemption strictly, limiting it to purchases that meet the needs of the institution and its staff, excluding purchases for resale or private practice.\n\n4. **Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)**: The Ninth Circuit Court in De Modena v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (1984) ruled that HMOs are eligible institutions under the Nonprofit Institutions Act, allowing them to purchase drugs for resale to members at discounted prices.\n\n5. **Damages and Enforcement**: To recover damages under R-P, a plaintiff must prove actual injury attributable to anti-competitive effects. The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), with most cases brought by disfavored buyers.\n\n6. **Legislative History and Modernization**: The 94th Congress considered amendments or repeal of R-P in the mid-1970s, but no legislation was introduced. The Antitrust Modernization Commission (2007) recommended repealing the act, citing its potential to increase consumer prices.

The bill proposes changes to \u00a7 1113 to limit the modifications to the existing CBA that can be proposed by the debtor, requiring them to be no more than the minimum savings needed for the debtor to reorganize successfully and not overly burden the labor group compared to other groups.\n8. The bill also requires the court to find that the parties are at an impasse before approving rejection of a CBA and to consider alternative proposals by the authorized representative.\n9. Additionally, the bill establishes a presumption that the debtor has overly burdened the labor group if it has implemented incentive pay, bonuses, or other financial returns for insiders or senior management personnel during the bankruptcy or within 180 days before the case began.\n10. The bill defines rejection of a CBA as a breach, allowing for money damages and self-help by affected employees, and requires the court to grant requests for future modifications if the change would result in the new provisions being no more than the minimum savings needed for the debtor to reorganize successfully.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 30}}

Tablets and capsules are popular oral dosage forms, but swallowing difficulties can arise, especially during travel or sudden coughing episodes.\n4. Fast-dissolving tablets (FDTs) address this issue by dissolving in the mouth within 60 seconds without water or chewing.\n5. FDTs have disadvantages like physical solid form, psychological fears, and expensive packaging, leading to the development of orally dissolving strips (ODSs).\n6. ODSs are flexible, comfortable, and dissolve within a minute in the oral cavity, providing quick absorption and instant bioavailability.\n7. Clobazam, a well-tolerated antiepileptic drug, was chosen for ODS formulation due to its low-dose requirement and indication in children.\n8. A 3x3 factorial design was used to optimize clobazam ODSs using polyvinyl acetate (PVA) as a film former and sodium starch glycolate (SSG) as a disintegrant.\n9.

They often present asymptomatically or incidentally, with a slight female predominance and an average age of 52 years.\n3. **Location and Size**: CHFCs are most commonly found in the left lobe (segment IV) and range in size from less than 1 cm to 24 cm, with a mean of 4 cm.\n4. **Origin and Pathology**: CHFCs are thought to result from evagination of the foregut during embryogenesis. Pathologically, they have four typical layers and are typically solitary and unilocular.\n5. **Imaging Features**: On imaging, CHFCs appear as non-enhancing, rounded lesions with variable density depending on their contents. They are hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI and have a variable appearance on T1-weighted images.\n6. **Differential Diagnosis**: The main differential diagnosis is a bronchogenic cyst due to their shared embryonic origin. Simple cysts, hydatid cysts, biliary cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and other benign entities can also be considered.\n7. **Treatment Recommendations**: Surgical excision is recommended for CHFCs larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, and asymptomatic lesions with wall abnormalities or abnormal liver function tests.\n8. **Laparoscopic Excision**: Laparoscopic excision is the preferred approach for CHFCs in segments II to VI, offering minimal morbidity and allowing for effective ambulatory procedures.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 24}}

Inhalation is the most widely used approach for treatment, allowing drugs to reach the lungs selectively and reducing systemic adverse effects. Correct inhaler technique is essential for achieving and maintaining clinical asthma control.\n2. **Adherence and Education**: Only half of all asthma patients use their prescribed medication correctly. Low treatment adherence is related to patients not knowing how to use or having difficulty using inhaler devices. Asthma education is a key component of management, helping to improve inhaler use and clinical asthma control.\n3. **Incorrect Use and Consequences**: Incorrect inhaler use can lead to treatment failure by reducing drug concentration in the airways and contribute to treatment nonadherence, making clinical asthma control difficult. The frequency of incorrect use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) ranges from 14% to 90%, with an estimated mean of 50%. Increased bronchodilator use, nebulizer use, and hospitalizations were observed in more than 50% of patients who did not adhere to treatment.\n4. **Scoring Systems for Inhaler Technique**: Instruments or scoring systems that assess the difficulties patients face in using inhaled drugs can be useful for reducing those difficulties. Health professionals can use these instruments to devise an educational program targeting the most common errors made by patients, thus improving treatment adherence.\n5. **Existing Scoring Systems**: Some scoring systems assess inhaler technique in patients with lung disease, but there is no one system considered the gold standard for this purpose. An instrument that could play an important role in the evaluation of patients using inhalers is needed.\n6. **Validation of Scoring Systems**: The validation of an instrument allows determination of the congruence between the scoring system used and the reality being measured, increasing the reliability of the instrument. Validated instruments for assessing inhaler technique in asthma patients will yield results that are more reliable and ensure data quality.\n7. **Objectives and Methodology**: The objectives of the present study were to validate two scores quantifying the ability of patients to use MDIs or dry powder inhalers (DPIs), to identify the most common errors made during their use, and to identify patients in need of an educational program for the use of these devices. The study was conducted in three phases: validation of the reliability of the inhaler technique scores, assessment of the content validity of the two scores, and assessment of the criterion", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 32}}

The large number of disorders included in these tests challenges established specifications for carrier screening.\n8. **Responsible Offer of DTC Carrier Testing**: To ensure a responsible offer of DTC carrier testing, companies should consider the significance of the health problem, the suitability and predictive value of the test, and the potential consequences of testing. They should also provide adequate information, ensure medical supervision, and respect privacy and confidentiality.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 32}}

In 21-OHD, precursors are shunted into the androgen synthetic pathway, leading to signs of androgen excess. Since the 1950s, CAH has been effectively managed with oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration.\n2. **Case Reports**: Four cases of CAH patients managed with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were reported. Adrenal masses were found in all four cases, with two patients undergoing adrenalectomy due to increasing mass size and virilization. The ages of diagnosis ranged from neonate to 11 years, with varying presentations including ambiguous genitalia, vomiting, and virilization.\n3. **CAH Epidemiology, Genetics, and Pathophysiology**: The overall incidence of classical 21-OHD is 1:10,000 - 1:15,000. The 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2) is located on chromosome 6p21.3. The pathophysiology of CAH due to 21-OHD is linked to the degree of enzyme deficiency, leading to hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism.\n4. **CAH Classification, Diagnosis, and Management**: CAH is classified as classic (salt-losing or simple virilizing) or non-classic (late-onset or cryptic). Diagnosis involves screening for 17-hydroxyprogesterone in newborns and a corticotropin stimulation test. Medical treatment aims to suppress adrenal androgens while allowing normal growth and pubertal development. Glucocorticoids are given in doses sufficient to suppress excessive secretion of CRH and ACTH, with fludrocortisone used in cases of salt-losing manifestation.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 16}}

Lung cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, with 226,160 new cases and 160,340 deaths estimated in 2012. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, with 56% of cases presenting with distant metastasis.\n2. Bone is a common site of metastasis in lung cancer patients, with 38% of those with distant stage disease developing bone metastases within a year of diagnosis. These metastases can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain, which significantly impact patients' quality of life.\n3. In a study using the SEER-Medicare database, 19.8% of lung cancer patients aged 65 or older had evidence of bone metastasis, with 51% of these patients experiencing at least one SRE. The most common SRE was radiotherapy to bone, followed by fracture, spinal cord compression, and surgery to bone.\n4. Having a bone metastasis was associated with increased mortality in lung cancer patients, with a hazard ratio of 2.4 for both those with and without SREs compared to those without bone metastasis. The association was stronger for patients with localized stage disease at diagnosis.\n5. The study found no additional effect of SREs on mortality among patients with bone metastasis, which may be due to the short survival time in lung cancer patients compared to other tumor types. However, the study had some limitations, such as the focus on elderly patients with Medicare coverage and the reliance on claims data for identifying bone metastases.\n6. The study highlights the significant impact of bone metastases and SREs on the mortality and quality of life of lung cancer patients, and the need for effective prevention and management strategies to address these complications.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 24}}

These enterotypes have unique properties and are not correlated with geographical location, sex, age, or body mass index.\n6. **Enterotype Functionality**: Each enterotype is characterized by a unique set of properties, including the prevalence of bacteria, methods of harvesting energy, and overrepresentation of certain enzymatic pathways. For instance, enterotype 1 is dominated by bacteroides and enriched in biotin biosynthesis genes.\n7. **Enterotype Stability and Transferability**: Although significant changes in the microbiota can occur rapidly on dietary change, no temporary shifts in enterotypes are observed, suggesting they are stable and not easily altered. The phenotype can be somewhat transferable, with germ-free mice colonized with flora from obese mice or mice receiving a high-fat diet storing fat better than those colonized with a normal flora.\n8. **Enterotype Potential**: Despite our incomplete understanding of enterotypes, their potential uses are tantalizing, setting a standard to which disease-associated bacterial flora or microbiome may be compared.

Calcium is required to activate MyoVa's ATPase activity, but high calcium concentrations (>1 mM) reduce motor processivity and may cause calmodulin dissociation from lever arms.\n4. MyoVa can maneuver through actin intersections and travel along actin bundles in vitro, requiring sufficient structural flexibility for the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search.\n5.

Dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that enables visualization of morphological features not discernible by naked eye examination.\n3. **Dermoscopy Techniques**: There are different dermoscopy techniques, such as solar scan, epiluminescence microscopy (ELM), cross-polarization ELM (CPM), and side transillumination (TLM), which can greatly increase the morphological details visualized. Dermoscopy enables better diagnosis compared to unaided eye examination, with an improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of 10-30%.\n4. **Dermoscopy Limitations**: While dermoscopy improves diagnostic accuracy, it may also lower it in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists. The diagnosis is highly dependent on subjective judgment and is scarcely reproducible, making it difficult to use the color diffuse image for further skin tumor differentiation.\n5. **Scoring Systems and Algorithms**: Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of less experienced clinicians. However, these systems show problems with low within- and between-observer concordance, even for expert observers.\n6. **Automated Image Analysis**: Due to the varied presentations and physical characteristics of melanoma, there has been growing interest in the automated analysis of digitized images obtained by ELM techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions.\n7. **Feature Extraction and Selection**: The next stage of the image analysis process is to extract important features of the image.

For antigen-specific vaccines, evaluating immune responses to the target antigen has been relatively straightforward but has not always been associated with clinical benefit.\n7. For broadly active immune modulating agents like CTLA-4 or PD-1 inhibitors, appropriate biomarkers of response have been elusive.\n8. The current study aimed to evaluate the use of machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) as a method for identifying promising biomarkers in complex data sets.\n9. The study used sera samples from three separate trials to train ML-BBNs and identify biomarkers associated with declines in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).\n10. The findings suggest that using measures of antigen spread, such as igg responses to panels of tissue-associated antigens, could serve as biomarkers of immunological efficacy for immune-active therapies.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 1, "n_sentences_total": 10}}

Different biological communities use varying definitions of 'function', requiring universal vocabularies for effective communication.\n3. There are two main ways to annotate genes: experimental data integration and predicted evolutionary relationships.\n4. Homologous genes often have similar structures and functions, making homology a useful tool for predicting gene function.\n5. However, homology only provides a general direction for function determination, as homologs may not always share similar functions.\n6. Domain architectures, the combination of homologous domains in a protein, are a key aspect of protein evolution and function.\n7. Domain-based annotation is a short-term measure, but it remains valuable until reliable results from high-throughput studies on closely related organisms are available.\n8. Comparative proteomics can relate gene content to the evolution of eukaryotic organisms, but the relationship between domain family size and cellular function is still unclear.\n9.

This method aims to improve the reliability and simplicity of HCV detection in routine diagnostic purposes.\n\n3. **Validation of the Technique**: The technique was validated using humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice and needle biopsy liver specimens from chronic hepatitis C patients. A total of 13 mouse specimens (3 non-infected, 3 genotype 1a, 4 genotype 1b, and 3 genotype 2a) and 11 human specimens were used.

The most prominent regioisomer, 14,15-EET, is produced via the metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, particularly members of the 2c and 2j families.\n2. The text also mentions that the ratio of EET isomers and their stereocomposition are isoform-dependent and species- and tissue-specific. Numerous chemical and metabolic factors complicate investigations into the roles of 14,15-EET and restrain its potential therapeutic utility. Its susceptibility to aerial oxidation or auto-oxidation necessitates handling and storage under strict conditions to minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals. A precis of inactivating enzymatic processes includes esterification, metabolism by other pathways of the arachidonate cascade, conjugation, -oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide. In biological milieu, hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) is a major determinant in maintaining the steady state levels of 14,15-EET, whose half-life has been estimated at no more than seconds to minutes.\n3. The text further discusses that inhibition of SEH can elevate EET levels both in vitro and in vivo, offering an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes. However, this strategy might prove less efficacious than an agonist replacement therapy whenever endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised, for instance, as a consequence of disease, inflammation, radiotherapy, aging, and/or exposure to xenobiotics and drugs that inhibit cytochromes P450. To address some of the stability limitations of natural EETs, the laboratories previously prepared several iterations of EET surrogates with improved stability. Advanced versions were evaluated for relaxation of precontracted bovine coronary artery rings and for in vitro inhibition of recombinant human SEH.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 3, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 9}}

Pharmacological manipulation of RXR activity perturbed the transcriptomic network of infected KCs, leading to enhanced leishmanicidal activity.\n4. **The authors validated the use of cells exposed to inflammation as a means to discover pathogen-regulated transcriptomic pathways in vivo**.

Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue.\n3. Recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, along with sensory features of food.\n4. Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones like ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from the GI tract.\n5. These models account for appetite regulation and contribute to body weight regulation through specific molecular signals.\n6. The major task is to explain the ongoing drive to eat and intermittent suppression of eating via satiety signaling and tonic inhibition.\n7. A new formulation based on 15 years of research with overweight and obese humans explains how aspects of body composition and energy expenditure regulate hunger and appetite.\n8. This formulation is an alternative to the molecular approach, arising from the study of energy balance between energy expenditure and energy intake.\n9. Acute bouts of exercise do not consistently increase food intake, but repeated sessions over 9 to 16 days show partial compensation.\n10. Exercise raises daily energy expenditure and generates a compensatory increase in energy intake, but with large individual variability.\n11. Exercise causes a significant increase in fasting hunger levels but also increases post-prandial satiety signaling from meals.\n12. The effect of exercise-related energy expenditure on appetite is different from the effect of resting metabolic rate.\n13. Detailed analysis using a multi-level platform demonstrates that fat-free mass (FFM), but not fat mass or BMI, is strongly correlated with meal size and daily energy intake.\n14. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is positively associated with meal size, daily energy expenditure, fasting hunger levels, and influences the profile of hunger across the day.\n15. RMR reflects a physiological demand for energy that acts as a driver of food intake, supporting Edholm's proposal that differences in food intake originate in differences in energy expenditure.\n16.

Double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can knock down expression levels via the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates degradation or translational inhibition of targeted mRNAs.\n4. In addition to RISC-mediated regulation at the post-transcriptional level, RNAi can also modulate gene transcription itself through the recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small non-coding RNAs.\n5. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing (TGS).\n6. In human cells, it has recently been reported that short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon called RNA activation (RNAa).\n7.

These signs can be useful in clinical practice, as they can help in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.\n3. **Different Morphological Signs**: Different morphological signs have been described on different imaging techniques, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. These signs include the transverse diameter of segment 4, caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/R), right posterior notch (RPN), right lobar atrophy, porta hepatis enlargement, and expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF).\n4. **Caudate-to-Right Lobe Ratio (C/R)**: The C/R is a quantitative measurement that has demonstrated high specificity and accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis. The size of the caudate lobe has also been correlated with the hepatic functional reserve in cirrhotic patients.\n5. **Right Posterior Notch (RPN)**: The RPN is a simple qualitative visual sign of cirrhosis. Both the RPN and the EGF showed high specificity and a high positive predictive value for the MR diagnosis of cirrhosis, despite their low sensitivity.\n6. **Expanded Gallbladder Fossa (EGF)**: The EGF is another simple qualitative visual sign of cirrhosis.

However, healthcare productivity lags behind other industries, with no equivalent law for healthcare.\n3. **Valley of Death in Healthcare Innovation**: The journey from discovery to commercialization in healthcare is challenging, with a \"valley of death\" between academic research and commercialization. Technologies without a clear commercialization pathway and value proposition often languish in the lab.\n4. **Market Risk vs. Technical Risk**: Financial investors are more concerned with market risk (whether the market needs or will pay for a product) than technical risk (flaws in the science). Academic investigators often lack commercial awareness and struggle to address market risk.\n5. **Funding Pressures**: The current funding situation, with low pay-lines, encourages investigators to focus on novelty and move on quickly, leaving technology transfer offices with the challenging task of finding licensees for technologies with no clear commercial value.\n6. **Investor Risk Appetite**: Investors are becoming less willing to take risks, particularly those they cannot control, such as market acceptance, reimbursement, and regulatory approval. They prefer to invest in opportunities where they can manage risks, like implementation-related issues.\n7. **Successful Commercialization**: Only teams that effectively de-risk both the technology and the market survive the commercialization journey. Universities and academic medical centers must prepare and support investigators interested in translating research into practice.\n8. **Healthcare Commercialization Programs (HCPs)**: HCPs, like the I-Corps program, can help academic investigators navigate the commercialization journey by balancing project advancement and skill-building.

Chronic pain and depression are common health issues among patients visiting primary care, with pain often coexisting with depression and impacting daily activities and self-rated health.\n2. Pain is a significant reason for primary care visits, with persistent pain commonly occurring alongside depression in both general and disease-specific conditions.\n3. Healthcare providers may underestimate the intensity of pain and its association with depression, leading to inadequate treatment.\n4. Patients with depression often present with somatic symptoms rather than psychological ones, making it crucial for care providers to be aware of this coexistence.\n5. Optimizing antidepressant therapy and pain self-management can improve both depression and pain, but coexistence of these conditions increases the risk of opioid misuse.\n6. Dolotest is a validated tool that integrates measurement of pain intensity with assessment of its impact, including mood, to provide a shared understanding of the patient's situation.\n7.

Additionally, mir-200c increases chemosensitivity to paclitaxel by directly targeting and repressing tubulin beta 3 class III (tubb3), a mechanism independent of increased proliferation.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 8}}

Tantalum wire-marked mesh slings were implanted in 10 cadavers, and both approaches were performed on each cadaver, alternating the type of procedure and tape between the right and left sides.\n\n2. **Findings**: The study found that the In-Out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the Out-In approach, which followed a more horizontal, flatter trajectory. The mean full inner angle formed by the In-Out MUS was 122\u00b0, while the Out-In MUS was 144\u00b0 (p=0.02). The tapes were positioned posterior/dorsal to the urethra, not inferior, and the Out-In MUS was more closely wrapped around the inferior ischiopubic ramus.\n\n3. **Clinical Implications**: The study suggests that surgeons should pay more attention to the second half of the helical pass, regardless of the approach. For In-Out, surgeons should rotate hard and carefully around the ischiopubic ramus, while for Out-In, they should ensure a full thickness vaginal epithelial layer during peri-urethral tunnel dissection. The study also highlights the potential of 3D ultrasonography to correlate these findings with clinical outcomes.\n\n4. **Limitations and Future Directions**: The study's limitation was the lack of clinical findings correlation with the static anatomic findings.
