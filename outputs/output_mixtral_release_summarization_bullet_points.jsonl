The secondary star fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off around 77 minutes.\n\n\u2022 The minimum period of CV evolution occurs when the mass transfer time scale and the thermal time scale of the donor star are approximately equal. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the rate of orbital angular momentum losses. The paper investigates ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population.\n\n\u2022 The orbital angular momentum loss rate of a CV can be written as the sum of the systemic loss rate and a term that depends on the mass transfer rate. Possible mechanisms for consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) include magnetic propellers and accretion disc winds.

Spin-based devices may have advantages over charge-based devices, including lower power dissipation, reduced sensitivity to noise, and the potential for faster operation.\n- In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins was proposed. The system uses exchange interaction between neighboring spins to create a binary variable based on the spin orientation of conduction band electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.\n- Spintronic devices may have a problem with unidirectional flow of logic signals due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction. This can prevent logic signals from propagating from the input to the output of the logic device.\n- A proposed solution to this problem is to use clocking, as is done in charge coupled device (CCD) arrays, to impose unidirectionality in time. This would involve lowering barriers between neighboring cells to allow exchange interaction and then raising them again to propagate the input state through a linear array.\n- The use of spin in classical irreversible logic gates dissipates a minimum amount of energy per bit flip, which can be significant. To overcome this challenge, logically and physically reversible quantum gates have been devised.\n- Spin coherence times in solids are much larger than charge coherence times, making spin the preferred vehicle to encode qubits in solids.

The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology. In the no-scale type Kahler potential, the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes. The only source of SUSY breaking is gaugino masses, making this scenario highly predictive.\n* The no-scale structure of the Kahler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory. If the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated in the superspace density in the supergravity Lagrangian, the Kahler potential is given as in eq. ([eq : noscalekahler]). In a five-dimensional setting with two branes, the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other, and the form of the Kahler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed eq. ([eq : noscalekahler]). In this scenario, gaugino mediation induces SUSY breaking on the hidden sector brane to the visible sector brane, and the no-scale boundary condition is given at the compactification scale of the fifth dimension.\n* The no-scale scenario has limited degrees of freedom in the SUSY particle mass spectrum because only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given. Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, mainly focusing on the mass spectrum. Direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint were considered, and the allowed region in the parameter space was identified.

Proposals exist to install forward proton detectors at 220 m and 420 m from interaction points to detect central systems with approximate mass range 70 GeV to 700 GeV.\n- The CEP process is crucial for the central exclusive production of the Standard Model (SM) and supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs bosons. For a 120 GeV Higgs boson, the dominant decay channel is H -> bb, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches at the LHC due to large QCD background. However, the CEP process suppresses the leading order background for this channel, making it observable with appropriate proton tagging detectors.\n- The acceptance of forward detectors and their ability to correctly associate detected outgoing protons with a Higgs boson candidate event in the central detector are critical for this analysis. The proposed forward detectors aim to achieve a 10 ps accuracy in the time-of-flight measurement, allowing for a vertex measurement accurate to 2.1 mm. Central detector timing measurements could further improve pile-up event rejection.\n- The acceptance of forward detectors is governed by the distance of the active edge from the beam and the aperture of LHC beam elements.

The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the charge neutrality condition and chemical equilibrium are required, which can lead to a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks and eventually destroy the Cooper pairing.\n* The chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase remains an unsolved puzzle, and it is still not fully understood how the Cooper pairing is destroyed by increasing mismatch in a charge neutral system. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system.

Understanding the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides is mandatory to unveil the physics underlying the superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated. There is ongoing debate about whether the magnetic moments are better described by an itinerant or localized model, and the role of correlation effects is still not clear.\n- Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an essential experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides. However, DFT calculations often have problems reproducing all features of ARPES spectra correctly, which is often attributed to strong correlation effects. Additionally, the connection between the magnetic phase of the iron pnictides and the resulting consequences for ARPES is often ignored, leading to mixed magnetic domains and lost information on anisotropy.\n- Experimentally, it is possible to effectively detwin the crystals by applying uniaxial stress during the measurement, but such measurements are connected with several technical difficulties.

The necessity of monitoring LO intensity for security proofs in discrete QKD protocols embedded in continuous variables has been discussed, and the excess noise caused by imperfect subtraction of balanced homodyne detectors in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations has been noted and quantified.\n* In practical CVQKD implementation, shot noise scaling with LO power measured before key distribution is assumed constant, with pulses having large LO intensity fluctuations discarded. This approach gives Eve an advantage in exploiting LO intensity fluctuations. A paper proposes an attacking scheme based on this fluctuation and analyzes the effect on the secret key rate with and without LO monitoring for reverse and direct reconciliation protocols.\n* The paper finds that LO intensity fluctuation could compromise secret keys severely if not properly addressed. It emphasizes the importance of accurate LO intensity monitoring to ensure the security of CVQKD practical implementation.\n\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "symbol": "*"}}

For example, in crystals, although the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field, understanding electric conductivity and heat capacity involves working with \"heavy electrons\" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interaction.\n- In QCD, the theory becomes too complicated at the scale of 1 GeV, making it difficult to determine the relevant physics for the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties. However, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is crucial for understanding these properties. Beyond the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks that interact through the exchange of Goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.\n- The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD has important consequences, such as the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons with low mass and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by valence (practically massless) quarks, known as constituent quarks. These constituent quarks should be considered as quasiparticles with a dynamical mass resulting from nonperturbative gluon and quark-antiquark dressing.\n- The flavor-octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit implies that the constituent quarks and Goldstone bosons should be coupled with a strength given by the quark analog of the famous Goldberger-Treiman relation.

The system uses a two-dimensional slot across the entire machine width to produce a linear plane of filaments with constant filament distribution, providing good control of cross-machine uniformity. This is a significant improvement over conventional spinning systems, which often suffer from turbulence and vorticity that can lead to entanglement and grouping of filaments, reducing the uniformity of the final product.\n* The system is also simpler than both eductive and non-eductive systems, with fewer air sources, less nozzle length, and a smaller drawing chamber. This makes it easier to maintain and clean, as there is less surface area exposed to the fiber stream, reducing the accumulation of dirt, polymer drippings, and monomer build-up. The system also uses the same air for two purposes: first to quench the filaments and then to draw them as the air exits through the drawing impingement slot at high velocity. This eliminates the need for a separate quenching air system, further simplifying the system.\n* The system is also more flexible than conventional spinning systems, as it can accommodate a wide variety of materials and operating conditions. The quench air temperature, flow rate, and slot opening can all be adjusted to achieve the desired filament properties, such as denier, tenacity, and the like.

The arrangement includes compressors, heat exchangers, valve-controlled pipelines, and control units. The invention utilizes the cooling effect of expanding compressed gas to a lower pressure to reach the desired exit temperature.\n- The invention proposes a different type of cooling during the warmer period of the year, when re-cooling units were necessary in the past for ensuring the required exit temperature. The present invention utilizes the physical effect that a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure. The gas is compressed to an excess pressure, cooled by heat exchange, and then expanded to the desired exit pressure. The excess pressure is selected so that cooling during expansion is sufficient for obtaining a temperature reduction to the desired exit temperature.\n- The expansion can be carried out in a simple manner, such as by means of a valve, or more significantly by an expansion turbine that recovers mechanical energy for providing a portion of the drive energy for the compression of the gas to the intended excess pressure. The compression to the excess pressure can be carried out in a total of three stages, with a predominant portion of the compression taking place in two successive primary compression stages. The gas is cooled between the two primary compression stages and then further cooled before expansion in an expansion turbine.\n- The invention allows for the use of compressors in the stages to be completely exchanged for one another, providing flexibility in operation during different seasons.

Therefore, the healthcare costs associated with age-related diseases like RA are likely to increase in Italy. The introduction of newer costly therapies may further contribute to the expected increase in the economic burden of RA in Italy.\n- A review of the economic impact of RA in Italy in the past two decades found that the costs of RA before and after the introduction of biological agents were not significantly different. However, the review predicted that the future costs of RA in Italy would increase, and they would be higher than the costs in other European countries.

However, primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.\n\n\u2022 A study conducted in the Brazilian Amazon found that antimalarial treatment with chloroquine and primaquine led to a decrease in fever and pain symptoms but increased gastrointestinal symptoms and hemolysis or enhanced these symptoms when already present in the patient with malaria. The sensation of itching and stinging can also hinder treatment with chloroquine.\n\n\u2022 Healthcare personnel should be aware of the possible adverse side effects of primaquine, including severe hemolysis, especially in patients with G6PD deficiency. Currently, Brazilian control programs do not have a policy for G6PD deficiency screening before malaria treatment, making it crucial for healthcare providers to monitor patients closely during antimalarial treatment.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}
