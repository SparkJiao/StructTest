• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood.
	• Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport.
	• The interest in ratchet systems lies in the possibility of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems.
• Recent studies have focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.
	• Chaotic systems are defined by their sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and their behavior is generally complex and dependent on system parameters.
• A few years ago, Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle.
	• He showed that the current, defined as the time-averaged velocity of an ensemble of particles, could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.
	• He conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in trajectory dynamics.
• Later, Barbi and Salerno argued that Mateos' conjecture was not valid even in the specific system considered.
	• They presented results showing that current reversals could occur in the absence of bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior.
	• They proposed an alternative origin for current reversal, related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.
• The authors of the current paper investigate the impact of different ensembles of particles on the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet.
	• They show that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and that it is important to discard transients in quantifying the current.
• The authors then discuss the connection between the bifurcation diagram for individual particles and the behavior of the current.
	• They find that while they disagree with many of the details of Barbi and Salerno's results, the broader conclusion still holds: it is possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from chaos to periodic behavior, as well as bifurcations without any accompanying current reversals.
• The authors propose a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture: bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter are associated with abrupt changes in the current.
	• Depending on the specific value of the current, these abrupt changes may lead to a net current reversal, but not necessarily so.

	+ * Known for planar property and mutual focusing, colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities.
		- * These singularities are weakened when waves are endowed with relative cross polarization.
		- * A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) has a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity.
		- * Yurtsever showed that CH in CPW is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations.
	+ * A linear perturbation analysis by CX also shows an analogous result.
		- * Any perturbation applied to CPW turns CH into an essential singularity.
		- * The electromagnetic (EM) field itself weakens the strength of singularity in CPW.
		- * Collision of pure EM waves must have a special significance regarding singularity formation.
	+ * The Bell-Szekeres (BS) solution describes the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves.
		- * The singularity formed in the interaction region of BS is removable by a coordinate transformation.
		- * On null boundaries, it possesses essential curvature singularities.
		- * Cross polarization and EM field both play roles in the nature of resulting singularity.
	+ * The cross-polarized version of BS (CPBS) solution was found long ago.
		- * This metric has the nice feature that Weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region.
		- * Cross polarization does not remove singularities formed on null boundaries.
		- * The paper considers CPBS as a test ground with various added test fields to justify the validity of a CH stability conjecture.
	+ * The conjecture suggests that for all maximally extended spacetimes with CH, the backreaction due to a field will affect the horizon in one of the following manners.
		- * If certain scalars are finite, the CH remains non-singular.
		- * If certain scalars diverge, an nsc singularity will be formed at the CH.
		- * If null dust density diverges, an sc singularity will be formed at the CH.

		- * Generic test fields are added to the background geometry to study their reaction.

• **X-ray Studies of Normal Galaxies:**
	• Deep field surveys have reached exposures of 1 Ms, detecting normal galaxies at fluxes below 9 × 10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band.
	• Normal galaxies contribute up to 50% of the X-ray background (XRB) flux in the 0.5-2 keV band.
	• The Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N) survey has detected many normal galaxies down to fluxes of 2 × 10^-17 erg cm^-2 s^-1, corresponding to a look-back time of 9 Gyr.
	• The X-ray luminosity per unit B-band luminosity is expected to be larger at higher redshifts due to increased star formation rates.
• **Stacking Analysis:**
	• The study focuses on normal galaxies in the redshift range 0.52-1.0, using the CDF-N data.
	• Galaxies were selected based on optical magnitude, morphology, and lack of X-ray detection within 40"".
	• The sample was divided into redshift bins, and X-ray images were stacked for each bin.
• **Results:**
	• Significant detections were found in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) for all redshift bins up to z = 0.9.
	• The average X-ray luminosity of galaxies increased by a factor of 1.6 from z = 0.52 to z = 0.9.

• **Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) and their Orbital Period Distribution**
	+ • CVs are short-period binaries with a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary.
	+ • The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
	+ • The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors lacks systems in the 2-3 hr period range (period gap) and has a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.
	+ • Theoretical models have not been able to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
• **Theoretical Models and Observations**
	+ • Systems evolving under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum reach a minimum period at around 65 minutes.
	+ • The probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region, leading to an accumulation of systems (a spike) at the minimum period.
	+ • The observed distribution does not show this spike, suggesting that the minimum period is not caused by GR alone.
	+ • The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, governed by mass transfer and thermal relaxation.
• **Investigating the Minimum Period and the Period Spike**
	+ • The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of minimum periods in the CV population.
	+ • They study the effect of a form of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) where the angular momentum is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary.
	+ • The authors also consider the effect of tidal deformation of the secondary on the period minimum.
	+ • They compare the observed short-period CV period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions based on their calculations.

	• Narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are reliable measures of the local quasar rest frame, except for 'blue outliers' with weak [OIII] emission.
	• Population A sources rarely show systematic red or blue shifts, while Population B sources show more complex line shift properties.
• **Fe II Shifts**:
	• A study (H08) claimed a systematic redshift of Fe II relative to [OIII]5007 and Hα in a majority of Type 1 quasars.

• **Entanglement Dynamics in Quantum Multipartite Systems**
	• Entanglement can be transferred among bipartite partitions in a double Jaynes-Cummings model without decoherence, satisfying an identity at any time.
	• In a system of two qubits interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs, the identity is still valid despite the presence of decoherence and non-equilibrium relaxation.
• **Entanglement Distribution and Sudden Death/Birth**
	• Entanglement can be stably distributed among all bipartite subsystems if qubits and reservoirs can form bound states and non-Markovian effects are important.
	• Entanglement sudden death (ESD) of qubits is not always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of reservoirs, contrary to previous findings.

• **Origin of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Gravitational Waves (GWs)**
	• **GRBs** are powerful flashes of gamma-rays lasting from less than one second to tens of seconds, observed above the terrestrial atmosphere with x-ray and gamma-ray detectors aboard satellites.
	• **GWs** are expected to be associated with GRBs, with a predicted duration of a few milliseconds and an amplitude of ~10^-21 at 1 Gpc.
• **Detection of GWs from GRBs**
	• **Current Sensitivity** of GW detectors is not sufficient to detect GWs from a single GRB, but detection of a signal associated with the sum of many events is more realistic.
	• **Search for Correlation** between GRBs and GW signals was conducted using an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors, Explorer and Nautilus.
• **Bayesian Analysis**
	• **Bayesian Approach** was used to infer the GW amplitude consistent with the observation and to provide an upper limit on the GW amplitude.
	• **Prior Probability Density Function** of GW burst intensities was considered, with a uniform distribution bounded to non-negative values.
• **Results**
	• **Upper Limit** on the GW amplitude was determined to be ~10^-20 with 95% probability, with a time window of 100 ms.
	• **Improved Upper Limit** was obtained with a time window of 1 s, improving the previous GW upper limit to about ~10^-21.
• **Comparison with Previous Results**
	• **Previous Paper** by the same authors had given more stringent upper limits, but under the hypothesis that GW signals always occur at the same time with respect to the GRB arrival time.
	• **Auriga/BATSE Result** estimated an upper limit of ~10^-21 with 95% confidence level, under the assumption that GWs arrive at the GRB time within a time window of 3 s.
• **Method Application**
	• **Method** can be applied for any expected delay between GRBs and GWs, with appropriate time shifting of the integration window with respect to the GRB arrival time, according to the prediction of the chosen model.

• The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum involves a two-step process: hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation to hadrons.
  • The first step is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second step uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
  • The fragmentation process is found to be inadequate for intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions, where recombination of partons is more appropriate.
  • The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
  • The shower parton distributions (SPDs) are determined from fragmentation functions using a fitting procedure and are shown to reproduce the fragmentation functions well.

	• • Star clusters form in molecular clouds, with only a small percentage of gas turned into stars.
	• • Gas expulsion occurs due to stellar winds and supernovae, causing rapid changes in the cluster's gravitational potential.
	• • This process can leave clusters out of equilibrium, with significant mass loss and a tail of escaping stars.
• **Observations and Simulations:**
	• • Observations of three young massive clusters (M82-F, NGC 1569-A, NGC 1705-1) show excess light at large radii.
	• • Simulations of gas expulsion from star clusters reproduce these observations, confirming that the clusters are not in dynamical equilibrium.
	• • The simulations suggest that the clusters have effective star formation efficiencies of around 40-50%.
• **Implications and Future Work:**

	+ * The force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions can be derived according to an analytical formula.
	+ * At very short distances, the theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force.
	+ * At larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction.
	+ * Lifshitz's equation also shows that two plates made out of the same material always attract, regardless of the choice of the intervening medium.
	+ * For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed.
* **Parsegian and Weiss's Work on Anisotropic Materials**
	+ * Parsegian and Weiss derived an equation for the non-retarded van der Waals interaction energy between two dielectrically anisotropic plates immersed in a third anisotropic material.
	+ * The torque between two parallel birefringent slabs causes them to spontaneously rotate towards the configuration in which their principal axes are aligned.
	+ * The anisotropy of the zero-point energy between the plates generates the torque that makes them rotate towards configurations of smaller energy.
	+ * The casimir-lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been receiving considerable attention in the modern literature.
* **Experimental Validation of the Torque Effect**

	+ * They consider a small birefringent disk made out of quartz or calcite placed parallel to a birefringent barium titanate (BTO) plate in vacuum.
	+ * The magnitude of the torque is within the sensitivity of available instrumentation, provided that the plate and the disk are kept at sub-micron distances.
	+ * At such short separations, the tendency of the two surfaces to stick together represents a major technical difficulty.

* **Phase Diagram of Quenched Polymers with Long-Range Interactions:**
	+ In 3D, pas behave similarly to random chains with short-range interactions for small excess charge, and spatial conformations strongly depend on excess charge for larger values.
	+ In every space dimension, there is a critical charge such that pas with excess charge cannot form a compact state.
	+ The probability of a randomly charged pa having such an excess charge depends on both the space dimension and its length.
	+ The borderline case of 3D provides valuable insight into the behavior of the system in general space dimensions.
* **Ground State Energies of Polymers:**
	+ The ground state energy of a pa can be determined accurately by specifying its net charge.
	+ The ground state energy of alternating polymers is only smaller by about 16% than the mean condensation energy of unrestricted sequences.
	+ The dependence of the quench-averaged ground state energies on the length of the chain scales as expected from the energy definition.
* **Density of States and Heat Capacity:**
	+ The density of states for different excess charges is shifted with respect to each other.
	+ Almost all pas have a unique ground state, and the gaps to the second lowest energy states remain of order of the energy discretization.
	+ The heat capacity of pas with zero excess charge vanishes in the low-temperature limit.
	+ The heat capacity of random pas with zero excess charge also has a peak, which may represent a crossover or a glass transition.
* **Contour Plots of Energy vs. Radius of Gyration:**
	+ The contour plots show that the lowest energy configurations are very different for different excess charges.
	+ The lowest energy contour of the chain with excess charge slightly smaller than the critical value is almost horizontal, indicating that the chain will not collapse upon lowering temperature.
* **Radius of Gyration and Annealed Polymers:**
	+ The radius of gyration of the unrestricted ensemble of quenches scales differently from the sub-ensembles of fixed excess charge.
	+ The ground states of annealed pas correspond to a uniform distribution of excess charge along the backbone.
	+ The energies per atom of the ground states of annealed pas are consistent with the known values of the condensation energy and surface tension.

  • The fireball model is strongly favored to explain GRBs.
• **Beaming and Energetics of GRBs**
  • It is not known whether GRBs are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs.
  • The energetics involved cannot be determined definitively without knowing the degree of beaming.
  • Three methods have been proposed to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs:
    • Analytic solutions suggest that optical afterglows from a jetted GRB should have a break in the light curve during the relativistic phase.
    • Gruzinov argued that optical afterglows from a jet can be strongly polarized, up to tens of percents.
    • The third method involves the detection of orphan afterglows, which are not associated with any detectable GRBs.
• **Orphan Afterglows and Failed GRBs (FGRBs)**
  • Orphan afterglows can be produced by both jetted GRBs and isotropic fireballs (FGRBs) with initial Lorentz factor much less than one hundred.
  • FGRBs can be observed in x-ray bands in the initial bursting phase, not in gamma-ray bands.
  • Some anomalous events, such as fast x-ray transients and x-ray-rich GRBs, may be FGRBs.
  • The detection of orphan afterglows does not necessarily mean that GRBs are highly collimated.

• **Stellar Parameters and Surveys**
	• • Stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, microturbulence) are crucial for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way and other galaxies.
	• • Large spectroscopic surveys like SEGUE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO, and HERMES provide data to infer characteristics of different stellar populations.
	• • Stellar parameters are determined by spectroscopic methods, with metallicity only measurable through spectroscopy.
• **Atmospheric Parameters and Methods**
	• • Atmospheric parameters can be estimated from a spectrum in a consistent and efficient way, avoiding reddening issues.
	• • Common methods include ionisation or excitation equilibrium using Fe lines under LTE and HE assumptions.
	• • However, LTE assumptions may lead to systematic biases, especially at low metallicity and/or surface gravity.
• **NLTE Effects and Corrections**
	• • Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects can significantly impact the determination of surface gravity and metallicity.
	• • NLTE corrections for Fe lines are necessary to eliminate discrepancies between Fe and Fe lines.
	• • NLTE calculations and corrections are available for Fe lines, but not yet for H lines.
• **Effective Temperature Determination**
	• • Effective temperature can be estimated using different methods, such as excitation balance of Fe lines, photometric calibrations, or the infrared flux method (IRFM).
	• • Balmer lines provide a reliable method for effective temperature determination in FGK stars.
	• • However, systematic biases may affect the Balmer line effective temperature scale due to physical limitations of models.
• **NLTE-Opt Method**

		- Standard mass distribution models struggle to reproduce the observed slope.
		- Broader mass distribution models (bifocal pdfs) can explain the observations, but require higher optical depths.
		- Biasing has little effect on the slope of the SNe-galaxy relation.

* **Pushing the resolution limits of light microscopy**
	+ Most early work focused on near-field optical microscopy and related techniques.
	+ Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have pushed resolution down to the nanometer range.
	+ These methods rely on accurate localization of individual fluorescent markers.
	+ Determining the location of an isolated fluorescent marker is limited by photon noise, not diffraction.
* **Challenges in turbid media**
	+ Certain biological tissues or soft matter systems appear turbid due to intense scattering.
	+ The image formed consists of a superposition of multiple fields, producing a chaotic intensity distribution known as a speckle pattern.
	+ Techniques to measure distances between nano-objects without imaging their position exist, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).
	+ Determining distances between two emitters in the range of 10 to 500 nm in a scattering medium remains a challenging problem.
* **New approach to sensing distance between two incoherent sources**
	+ The paper introduces a method to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment by analyzing the fluctuations of the emitted light.
	+ The method is based on the analysis of the intensity-intensity correlation function and intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources.
	+ This approach permits monitoring the relative distance between the sources in the range of 10 to 500 nm, with a precision not limited by diffraction but by the microstructure of the scattering medium.
	+ In the context of green's function retrieval in complex media, the approach replaces the two-point field-field correlation of the background noise by a measurement at a single point of the intensity noise due to the two fluctuating sources.
* **Potential applications and advantages**
	+ The method could provide an alternative to green's function retrieval techniques based on the correlations of the isotropic ambient noise measured at two receivers.
	+ Multiple scattering can enhance the performance of sensing, imaging, and communication techniques, as demonstrated in various contexts.
	+ The approach might simplify the technique, especially at visible or near-IR frequencies where time-domain field-field correlations are not easy to measure.
	+ The results also illustrate that multiple scattering can actually enhance the performance of sensing, imaging, and communication techniques.

• **Kauffman Networks**:
	• • Disordered dynamical systems proposed by Kauffman in 1969 as a model for genetic regulatory systems.
	• • Attracted the interest of physicists in the 80s due to their analogy with disordered systems studied in statistical mechanics, such as the mean field spin glass.
	• • A dynamical phase transition was found and studied in the framework of mean field theory.
	• • The annealed approximation, introduced by Derrida and Pomeau, was used to study the properties of the attractors, but it was found to be reliable only when the system is chaotic enough, becoming exact for a random map.
	• • The study of the relevant elements, suggested by Flyvbjerg, was used to understand the statistical properties of the attractors in the frozen phase and on the critical line, where the annealed approximation fails.
• **Relevant Elements**:
	• • Elements that are unstable and control some unstable variable, and are the only ones that can influence the long time behavior of the system.
	• • The number of relevant elements was found to scale as N^0 in the frozen phase and on the critical line, and as N^0.5 in the chaotic phase.
	• • The annealed approximation predicts that the number of elements whose state is different in two asymptotic configurations is independent of N and depends only on the product of the parameters k and p in the frozen phase.
• **Magnetization and Stable Elements**:
	• • The magnetization of an element was defined as the activity of the element averaged over many initial configurations.
	• • The annealed approximation predicts that the average distance goes to zero in the infinite size limit in the frozen phase and to a finite value in the chaotic phase.
	• • The annealed approximation was found to be reliable in the chaotic phase, but it fails on the critical line.
• **Numerical Results**:
	• • The number of unstable elements was found to scale as N^1.5 on the critical line.
	• • The average length of the cycles increases exponentially as a function of the number of relevant elements for large p, and more slowly for small p.
	• • The average weight of the attraction basins has a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the number of relevant elements.

• **Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGNs) and their Properties**
  • LLAGNs, with a Hα luminosity of less than 10^42 erg/s, reside in about 40% of nearby bright galaxies and are the majority of the AGN population.
  • Their low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes, often explained by the model of optically thin discs such as an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF).
  • ADAFs are predicted to have a 'submillimetre bump' in their spectral energy distribution, while standard discs are responsible for the 'big blue bump' in luminous AGNs.
  • Future very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) instruments will provide micro-arcsec resolutions, making the first imaging investigations for accretion discs promising.
  • However, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands, indicating additional unknown emission.
• **Millimetre Survey and Submillimetre Data Analyses for LLAGNs**
  • A millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses were conducted for many LLAGNs using the Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT).
  • The NMA observations were made at 96 GHz, while the JCMT data were available at 347 GHz.
  • The millimetre measurements were used to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF, while the submillimetre data were used to estimate dust contamination.
  • The sample consisted of 20 out of 25 known LLAGN radio sources that had been detected with VLBI, excluding five sources that had already been observed at 3 mm.
  • The observations were made between 2002 November 28 and 2003 May 25, with most weak targets observed over several days for integration.

  • The order parameter in HTS has been proven to have mainly a d-wave pairing symmetry.
  • Thermal transport measurements have shown the predominance of d-wave gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature Tc.
  • The fourfold oscillation in the thermal conductivity, observed when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO2 planes, can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles, assuming a d-wave gap.
  • However, deviations from the expected angular pattern within a pure d-wave symmetry have been attributed to the effect of vortex pinning.
• **Temperature Range for Observing Nodal Characteristics of the Gap**
  • The first question addressed in the paper is the temperature range at which the nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity.
  • The second question is whether thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature can explain the experimental results, including the change of symmetry of the gap as a function of temperature.
• **Numerical Calculations of Thermal Conductivity**
  • The thermal conductivity at different angles and temperatures at fixed magnetic field was calculated numerically, assuming an Andreev reflection model for the scattering of quasiparticles by supercurrents.
  • The calculations were compared to experimental data from angle scans in a magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO2 planes in two single crystals of YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO) high-temperature superconductor.
  • The overall results agreed with the theoretical model and confirmed the predominance of the d-wave gap up to Tc.

• The present invention provides a method for installing a window panel in a curved opening of a vehicle.
  • The method uses a flat, uncontoured glass panel instead of a pre-contoured one.
    • This reduces the cost of the glass panel.
    • It also makes the glass panel more flexible and less brittle.
  • The glass panel is flexed to conform to the curvature of the window opening.
    • This is achieved by placing the glass panel within the curved window bay.
    • The glass panel is secured in place using a holding means.
  • A weather sealant and adhesive compound is then applied along the confronting edges of the window panel.
    • This compound is allowed to cure, permanently fixing the panel in its conforming curvature.
  • The holding means comprises a plurality of resilient clips and a reveal molding.
    • The clips are uniformly spaced about the perimeter of the window bay.
    • The reveal molding is cooperatively secured to the clips.
      • The reveal molding is provided with a resilient bias, pressing on the outer surface of the glass panel.
      • This pushes the glass into conforming engagement with the bay of the window opening.

	+ IRS' approach is inconsistent with federal guidance on strategic planning and industry practices.
* **IRS' Training Challenges**
	+ IRS faces challenges in training customer service representatives due to the broad range of complex topics and the cyclical nature of taxpayer demand.
	+ IRS' training program includes classroom instruction and on-the-job training, but it lacks a mechanism to identify individual refresher training needs.

	+ IRS was not actively monitoring attrition and determining what steps, if any, were needed to address it.
	+ Officials do not track how many representatives leave, why they leave, or where they go.

* **Demographic Changes and Labor Force Participation**
	+ * Aging of baby boom generation will lead to significant changes in the aged dependency ratio
		- Ratio of working-age population to population age 65 and older will rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% in 2030
		- This increase is due to both the growing numbers of older persons and the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers
	+ * Labor force participation rates among older persons have been growing, especially among women
		- Participation rate for persons age 55 and older increased from 30% in 2000 to a projected 37% in 2015
		- This increase is primarily driven by the growth in the number of older women and their labor force participation rates
* **Occupational Distribution and Earnings of Older Workers**
	+ * Older workers are employed in a diverse group of occupations but are a growing proportion of white-collar occupations
		- In 2000, nearly the same percentage of workers in the age categories of 40 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 to 74 were employed in white-collar occupations
		- By 2008, the percentage of workers over age 55 in professional occupations is projected to grow from 14% to 19%
	+ * Older workers have made relative gains in earnings compared to younger workers
		- Between 1989 and 1999, older workers experienced larger percentage gains in median earnings than younger workers

* **Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA)**
	+ **Purpose**: To facilitate legitimate travel of visitors for business or tourism while boosting international business and tourism, airline revenues, and economic benefits to the United States.
	+ **Implementation**: Announced in June 2008, began accepting voluntary applications in August 2008, and required for all VWP travelers starting January 12, 2009.
	+ **Process**: Travelers apply for ESTA approval anytime before boarding a plane or ship bound for the United States, and DHS systems evaluate the applicant's biographical information and responses to VWP eligibility questions.
	+ **Compliance**: Carriers must verify ESTA approval for almost 98 percent of VWP passengers before boarding them, with fines or rescinded VWP signatory status for noncompliance.
	+ **Burden and Feedback**: ESTA reduced the burden on passengers by eliminating the I-94W form for most air and sea travelers, but the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 (TPA) fee collected as part of the ESTA application has been criticized as unfair and unrelated to VWP travel.

	+ Administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
	+ Mandatory for owners of properties in special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) with mortgages from federally regulated lenders.
* **NFIP's Financial Challenges**
	+ Does not charge all participants rates that reflect the full risk of flooding.
	+ Subsidized and grandfathered rates, as well as Preferred Risk Policy (PRP) Eligibility Extension, do not reflect actual flood risks.
	+ High costs associated with post-disaster borrowing to pay claims, with NFIP still owing approximately $17.8 billion from 2005 hurricanes.
* **Mitigation Efforts**
	+ FEMA has taken steps to mitigate properties through elevation, relocation, and demolition.
	+ Number of repetitive loss properties increased from 76,202 in 1997 to 132,100 in March 2011.
	+ FEMA has limited authority to increase premiums for property owners who refuse mitigation offers.
* **Expanding Participation in NFIP**
	+ Estimated participation rates as low as 50% in SFHAs and 1% outside of SFHAs.
	+ Expanding participation could lower premium rates and reduce taxpayer costs.
	+ Careful implementation is needed to avoid increasing the concentration of high-risk properties and subsidized rates.
* **Encouraging Private Market Participation**

• **Beneficiary-Pays Principle**: Fee design should be guided by who primarily benefits from the program.

  • If a program primarily benefits identifiable users, such as customers of the U.S. Postal Service, it should be funded by fees.
  • If a program benefits both the general public and users, it should be funded in part by fees and in part by general revenues.
• **Equity and Efficiency**: User fees can promote equity and economic efficiency by ensuring that resources are allocated to the most highly valued use.
  • Equity: Users pay for the cost of services actually used.
  • Efficiency: Users take into account the ""price"" of a service when deciding how much of the service to consume.
• **Revenue Adequacy**: Fee collections should be sufficient to cover the intended share of program costs over time.
  • Fees may not keep pace with increases in costs due to factors such as inflation.
  • Regular reviews and updates of the fee are necessary to ensure that the fee remains aligned with program costs.
• **Administrative Burden**: The primary challenge in determining when and how to collect a fee is striking a balance between ensuring compliance and minimizing administrative costs.
  • Fees can be collected at the point of sale, point of service, or after the service has been provided.
  • Collecting the fee at the point of sale or point of service may decrease administrative costs, but other practices can complicate a point-of-sale/service collections system.
  • Ensuring compliance may become more complicated when a private party takes over the collection function.
• **Congressional Oversight**: Congress determines to what extent an agency may access (obligate and spend) fee collections.
  • Congress has various mechanisms to strike a balance between flexibility and oversight, such as annual appropriation, permanent authority, and defining authorized uses of the fee.
  • Congress may also limit agency flexibility in the use of the fees by directing the agency to use the fees at the location where the fees were collected.
  • Restrictions on use of fees may fail to keep pace with program needs over time as activities that support the service change.

• **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Overview**
  • • AMT is an alternative tax calculation on a broader tax base than the regular tax.
  • • AMT is triggered when an individual's tax liability under the regular tax system is less than the AMT liability.
• **AMT Base and Rates**
  • • AMT base includes business preferences, certain itemized deductions, standard deduction, and personal exemptions.
  • • AMT rates are 26% for the first $175,000 (joint returns) and 28% for the remainder.
• **AMT Exemptions and Inflation**
  • • AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, leading to an increase in the number of taxpayers covered by the AMT.
  • • In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but by 2009, it is projected to cover 9 million taxpayers.
• **AMT Interaction with Regular Tax Cuts**
  • • Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities but do not also alter the AMT can increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT.
  • • Marriage penalty relief provisions in H.R. 1836 would have increased the number of taxpayers on the AMT or constrained by it via credits by 49% by 2010.
• **AMT and Marriage Penalty**
  • • Marriage penalty arises when family income is combined and subject to progressive tax rates, causing some income to be taxed at higher rates.
  • • H.R. 1836 proposed to address the marriage penalty for most taxpayers, but many joint returns would not receive marriage penalty reduction benefits due to the AMT.
• **AMT Growth and Future**
  • • The cost of correcting the AMT is significant, with indexing AMT exemptions costing $13.9 billion by 2008.
  • • AMT tax liability is projected to rise from $6.4 billion in 2001 to $38.2 billion in 2010, with a total amount of $182 billion over the ten-year period.

	+ • Opponents argue that such restrictions would increase costs for food manufacturers and consumers, and potentially harm U.S. dairy exports.
	+ • Major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. would likely seek compensation under WTO rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports.
	+ • U.S. imports of MPCs have been relatively stable since the late 1990s, with primary suppliers including New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union.
• **MPC Production and Uses**
	+ • MPCs are produced by ultrafiltration, blending, or co-precipitation of skim milk and contain both casein and whey protein.
	+ • They are used in various food products, including infant formula, processed cheese, and sports drinks, due to their functional characteristics and high protein content.
	+ • The United States produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates, partly due to federal dairy policies that favor nonfat dry milk production.
	+ • MPCs are classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) with a very low tariff of 0.37 cents per kilogram.
• **Proposed Import Restrictions**
	+ • The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act (S. 1542) was introduced in 2009 to limit imports of MPCs, casein, and caseinates by establishing two separate tariff rate quotas (TRQs).

		- Provide health coverage to individuals who cannot obtain or afford private market insurance due to preexisting conditions
		- Target individuals who have sought coverage in the individual market but were denied or received high premiums
		- Comply with HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions
	+ *Enrollment*
		- Around 200,000 individuals enrolled in 2008, out of an estimated 4 million potentially eligible
		- Limited enrollment due to narrow focus on individuals with preexisting conditions, no access to public or group insurance, and seeking private non-group market coverage
	+ *State-established Pools vs. PPACA*
		- Original, state-established pools have existed since the mid-1970s
		- PPACA requires a temporary high risk pool program prior to 2014 for individuals with preexisting conditions who have been uninsured for six or more months
* **High Risk Pools' Role in Health Insurance System**
	+ *Niche in Health Insurance System*
		- Fill a gap between private markets and public programs
		- Target individuals who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) or are not eligible for public programs
	+ *Private Market Underwriting*
		- Applicants to individual market undergo medical underwriting, which can lead to rejections or high premiums for those with preexisting conditions
		- Group market does not individually underwrite policies, charging each person the same premium regardless of health status
* **State High Risk Pools' Characteristics**
	+ *Governance and Funding*
		- Operated through state-established nonprofit organizations
		- Private insurance companies handle daily administrative duties, but pools bear insurance risk
		- Boards oversee governance, consisting of representatives from insurance companies, consumer groups, health care providers, and state agencies
		- States cap premiums, with most caps between 150% and 200% of standard risk rates
	+ *Benefits and Eligibility*
		- Benefits reflect coverage available in private nongroup market, with most plans offering more than one option
		- Most pools exclude coverage for preexisting conditions for 6-12 months
		- Eligibility criteria vary, but many states allow HIP",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"

	+ • Obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel, enter into contracts, receive services, and engage in similar transactions in a given fiscal year.
	+ • Outlays are the funds that are actually spent during the fiscal year.

	+ • Offsetting funds are collected by the federal government, either from government accounts or the public, as part of a business-type transaction such as collection of a fee.
	+ • These funds are not considered federal revenue and are counted as negative outlays.

• **Gross vs Net Job Loss**:
  • Gross job loss is the total number of jobs eliminated by contracting firms, while net job loss is the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains.
  • Gross job loss is a normal part of a functioning market economy, while net job loss is detrimental and typically occurs during recessions.
• **Causes of Gross Job Loss**:
  • Trade, trade deficits, offshore outsourcing, overseas investment, and economic restructuring all cause gross job loss.
  • However, none of these typically cause net job loss in normal economic conditions.
• **Policy Implications**:
  • Policymakers can use expansionary fiscal and monetary policy to mitigate net job loss.
  • Policies that impede gross job loss can have high efficiency costs and may reduce gross job gains.
• **Role of Government in Insuring Workers**:
  • Government can play a role in insuring workers against the risks associated with gross job loss through programs like unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and wage insurance.

• **Inland Waterways System (IWS) and Funding Issues**
	+ • IWS carries 16% of national freight, with 50% on 12,000 miles of fuel-taxed federal waterways.
	+ • IWS is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), which develops, operates, and maintains infrastructure.
	+ • Funding for IWS is through the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF), with costs shared between the Corps (100% for studies and operations & maintenance, 50% for construction) and commercial users (50% for construction and major rehabilitation).
	+ • Current fuel tax ($0.20 per gallon) is insufficient to cover nonfederal costs, leading to federal taxpayers covering more than half of these costs in some years.
• **Proposed Solutions**
	+ • Bush and Obama Administrations proposed replacing fuel tax with lock usage fees, but were rejected by Congress.
	+ • Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed increasing fuel tax ($0.06-$0.09 per gallon) and shifting more costs to the federal government.
	+ • Obama Administration proposed new annual fees for commercial shippers, with revenues set to achieve a specific target.
	+ • Other proposals include increasing user fees to cover all costs, or making inland waterways self-funding.
• **Congressional Issues**
	+ • **Investment Level and Urgency**
		- • Commercial users argue for increased investment due to aging infrastructure, expanded capacity needs, and environmental benefits.
		- • Taxpayer and environmental groups argue against increased funding, citing misrepresentation of benefits and inadequate justification.

		- • Congress may consider changes to the fuel tax, new fees, or other revenue sources.
		- • Cost-sharing arrangements may also be altered, with some arguing for increased user responsibility for operations and maintenance.
• **IWUB Proposed Reforms**
	+ • IWUB proposes increasing its involvement in project planning and construction, with sign-off on plans and status updates.

* **Prevalence of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in Italy:**
	+ Estimated at ~0.5% in Italy, similar to the average prevalence in Europe.
	+ Prevalence increases with age and is higher in women than men.
	+ Incidence is lower in southern than in northern European countries.
* **Costs of RA in Italy:**
	+ Before the introduction of biological agents, indirect costs accounted for the largest part of disease management costs.
	+ Direct medical costs accounted for 21% of the total costs in Italy, with nonmedical and indirect costs mainly sustained by individual households and the economy.
	+ The structure of RA costs has changed over the years, with a substantial increase in direct costs due to the availability of newer, more costly biological agents.
* **Future Costs of RA in Italy:**
	+ The annual cost of RA is expected to increase from €3.3 billion in 2009 to a peak of €4 billion in 2029, including both direct and indirect costs.
	+ Costs will vary between regions and will be only partially correlated with the number of inhabitants in different Italian regions.
	+ RA is expected to account for a total of 1% of all NHS costs in 2029.
* **Impact of Biosimilars on RA Costs:**
	+ The development of biosimilar biologics may alter the landscape of biologics and their associated costs in the future.
	+ Physicians' attitudes, regulatory authorities' indications, and national recommendations will have a major impact on the use of biosimilars in the management of RA.
* **Economic Impact of RA in Italy:**
	+ RA imposes a heavy socioeconomic burden on the NHS in Italy due to its association with loss of work capability and the need for informal care in the later stages of the disease.
	+ The severity and progression of RA have a great influence on the costs of the disease, with indirect costs estimated to be twice as high as direct costs when the disease progresses.
	+ A reliable estimate of the cost-effectiveness of a drug class should take into consideration the effects of such drugs on the progression of the disease.

• **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and HGF-CMET Pathway**
  • HCC is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with a high burden in developing countries and males.
    - Risk factors include chronic liver inflammation, excessive alcohol use, and environmental carcinogens.
    - Prognosis and treatment options depend on the severity of underlying liver disease.
    - Median overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced disease is around 58 months.
  • HGF-CMET pathway plays a crucial role in HCC development and progression.
    - HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) and its receptor CMET (cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion.
    - Dysregulation of HGF-CMET axis contributes to tumor cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasion, proliferation, and angiogenesis in HCC.
    • HGF-CMET inhibitors as therapeutic strategies for HCC
    - Various inhibitors target ligand-receptor interaction, CMET kinase activity, CMET and adaptor protein interaction, or downstream pathway inhibition.
    - Tivantinib and cabozantinib have shown promising results in phase 2 trials for HCC.
  • Patient selection and biomarkers for CMET targeted therapy
    - Tumor CMET content quantification and met sequence status assessment are current strategies for patient selection.
    - Pharmacodynamic serum markers are under evaluation to assess clinical response.
    - CMET overexpression, phosphorylation status, and sequence status may predict response to CMET inhibitors.
    - Acquired and primary resistance mechanisms may require rational combination therapy and innovative clinical trial designs.

* **Study Aim**
	+ Determine if clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) can be predicted by functional polymorphisms in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
* **Polymorphisms Studied**
	+ Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in aurka, erbb2, mdm2, cdh1, cdkn2a, and tp73 genes were genotyped.
* **Patient Cohort**
	+ 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent between 1996 and 2001.
* **Associations with Disease-Free Survival (DFS)**
	+ No significant associations found in univariate analysis for any of the tested polymorphisms in EAC or ESCC patients.
	+ In multivariate analysis:
		- Patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous mdm2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved DFS compared to those with the wild-type t/t genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 0.63, 95% CI [0.45-0.88], p = 0.007).

* **Potential Explanations for Findings**
	+ Improved survival in patients with the mdm2 t/g genotype may be due to interaction with tumor p53 status, as shown in a breast cancer study.
	+ The cdh1 ga/ga genotype may enhance esophageal cancer progression by reducing cdh1 transcription and impairing cell-cell adhesion.
* **Future Directions**

  - Aim: To evaluate whether levels of accurately quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL) in adults with overweight/obesity.
  - Hypotheses:
    - There would be a negative relationship between time spent in moderate intensity physical activity and levels of VAT and IHL.
    - There would be a positive relationship between time spent in sedentary behavior and VAT and IHL content.
    - Levels of sedentary behavior and moderate physical activity would explain a significant proportion of variance in VAT and IHL when modeled with known obesity-related health risk factors.

• **Key Findings:**
  - Traditional risk factors (e.g., sex, age, waist circumference) were associated with VAT and IHL, but no relationship was observed between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat.
  - A weak positive association was found between VAT volume and time spent in moderate activity, and total energy expenditure.
  - Inclusion of objectively measured levels of moderate activity and sedentary behavior did not improve the potency of traditional risk factors for predicting the liver fat concentration or level of visceral adiposity.

• **Cardiovascular Disease and N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (N-3 PUFAs)**
  • Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality, with ongoing research focusing on preventing early development of risk factors like atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
  • N-3 PUFAs, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have cardioprotective effects, including lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic properties.
  • Low-grade chronic inflammation is a prominent process in CVD development, with N-3 PUFAs modulating inflammatory response and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers like C-reactive protein (CRP).
  • N-3 PUFAs are essential fatty acids, with EPA and DHA primarily derived from dietary sources, while alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a plant-based precursor with limited conversion to EPA and DHA.
  • Epidemiological evidence and randomized controlled trials support the cardioprotective effects of fish oil-derived EPA and DHA, with modest intake reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
  • EPA and DHA have pleiotropic effects on cardiovascular health, influencing membrane fluidity, permeability, and the activity of transmembrane proteins, including receptors, enzymes, and ion channels.
  • DHA, rather than EPA, is preferentially incorporated into myocardial cell membranes, contributing to its antiarrhythmic and heart rate-lowering effects, as well as its hypotensive and anti-inflammatory actions.
  • N-3 PUFAs, especially EPA and DHA, reduce triglyceride (TG) levels, with long-term intake also increasing LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, mainly due to larger, potentially less atherogenic LDL particles.
  • Hypertension and dyslipidemia are important risk factors for CVD, with modifications of erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition being early indicators of lipid metabolism pathology and ah pathogenesis.
  • N-3 PUFAs improve endothelial function, reduce markers of endothelial dysfunction, and enhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, potentially explaining reductions in nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events.

• **Historical Theories of Appetite Control**
	• Early theories focused on specific metabolic signals:
		- Glucostatic (Mayer, 1955)
		- Aminostatic (Mellinkoff et al., 1956)
		- Lipostatic (Kennedy, 1953)
	• Modern central nervous system models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, along with sensory features of food.
	• Major signals include leptin, ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin.
• **Edholm's Energy Balance Hypothesis**
	• Increase in energy expenditure (EE) should be met with an equivalent increase in energy intake (EI).
	• Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a stable, uniform component of EE that could act as a driver of daily EI.
	• Physical activity EE has a different, more variable effect on appetite control.
• **Exercise and Appetite**
	• Acute exercise bouts do not consistently increase food intake.
	• Repeated exercise sessions over 9-16 days show partial compensation in EI.
	• Long-term exercise (12-32 weeks) leads to variable weight loss, with individual differences in appetite responses.
	• Exercise increases fasting hunger levels and post-prandial satiety signaling.
• **Body Composition and Appetite**
	• Fat-free mass (FFM) is strongly correlated with meal size and daily EI, but not fat mass (FM) or body mass index (BMI).
	• RMR, which is highly correlated with FFM, is also positively associated with meal size, daily EI, and hunger levels.
	• FFM and RMR reflect a physiological demand for energy that drives food intake.
• **New Formulation for Appetite Control**
	• Tonic drive for food arises from the physiological demand for energy, mainly from FFM and RMR.
	• Tonic inhibition comes from leptin, reflecting energy storage in adipose tissue.
	• Episodic signals from the GI tract periodically suppress the drive to eat.
	• Prolonged exercise has a dual-action effect on appetite, stimulating hunger and increasing post-prandial satiety signaling.
• **Implications and Future Research**
	• Using body composition instead of body weight or BMI in obesity research and management.

  • Injection molding has advantages like reduced processing time and lower cost compared to compression molding.
• **Bond Strength between Denture Teeth and Denture Base Resins**
  • Debonding of denture teeth is a major problem in prosthodontic practice.
  • Previous studies have tried various methods to increase bond strength, such as grinding, painting with monomer, and mechanical retention features.
  • Clancy and Boyer found that heat-polymerized resin had the strongest bonding to plastic teeth.
• **Study Aim and Hypotheses**
  • The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of surface treatments on shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat-polymerized and autopolymerized denture base resins.
  • The null hypotheses were: 1) No significant difference between the shear bond strength of the denture teeth to the two denture base resins, and 2) Surface treatments of the denture teeth have no effect on their bond strengths to the denture base resins.
• **Study Design and Materials**
  • 60 maxillary central incisor acrylic teeth were divided into two groups: heat-polymerized (Meliodent) and autopolymerized (Futura Gen).
  • Teeth were further subdivided into three subgroups: untreated, treated with monomer, and treated with airborne particle abrasion.
• **Results and Conclusions**
  • There was a significant difference between the shear bond strengths of the denture teeth to the two denture base resins.
  • Surface treatment of the denture teeth significantly affected the bond strength.
  • Treatment with monomer or airborne particle abrasion improved bond strengths to the denture base resins, with no significant difference between the two methods.

	+ IPSS total score significantly higher in tamsulosin-only group due to exclusion of patients with suspected significant bladder outlet obstruction.
* **Treatment Outcomes**
	+ Both groups showed significant improvement in IPSS total, voiding, storage, and QOL scores after treatment.
	+ No significant differences in IIEF-5 score, voiding parameters, or residual urine between or within groups before/after treatment.
* **Correlation between LUTS and Sexual Function**
	+ In tamsulosin-only group, improvement in IIEF-5 score significantly correlated with improvement in IPSS storage domain score.
	+ In tamsulosin + solifenacin group, no significant correlation found between IPSS domains and IIEF-5 score improvement.
* **Study Implications**
	+ Improvement in LUTS, particularly storage symptoms, may improve sexual function in men with LUTS/BPH and ED.
	+ Concomitant use of alpha-blockers and antimuscarinics improves LUTS but does not significantly improve sexual function in these patients.
* **Future Research**
	+ Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between specific LUTS symptoms and erectile function, and to evaluate the long-term effects of combination therapy.

* **Role of mir-200c in cancer:**
	+ Mir-200c is a tumor suppressor that maintains epithelial phenotype and inhibits metastasis.
	+ It represses Zeb1 and Zeb2, transcription factors that promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
	+ Mir-200c also represses a program of mesenchymal and neuronal genes.
* **Mir-200c and Zeb1 regulation:**
	+ Mir-200c and Zeb1 regulate each other in a double-negative feedback loop.
	+ TGF-β signaling can disrupt this loop, leading to EMT.
* **Mir-200c in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers:**
	+ Loss of mir-200c is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes in these types.
	+ Mir-200c restoration decreases migration, invasion, and adhesion to basement membrane complex and laminin.
	+ Mir-200c increases chemosensitivity to paclitaxel by repressing tubulin beta 3 (TUBB3).
* **Mir-200c and Zeb1 feedback loop:**
	+ Not all cells exhibit the double-negative feedback loop between mir-200c and Zeb1.
	+ This can be exploited to identify the distinct roles of mir-200c and Zeb1.

* **Study Aim:**
	+ Compare the relationship between midurethral sling (MUS) and urethra in inside-out (In-Out) and outside-in (Out-In) transobturator approaches.
* **Method:**
	+ CT scan image analysis of tantalum wire-marked mesh slings implanted in 10 cadavers.
	+ Alternating In-Out and Out-In procedures on right and left sides.
* **Findings:**
	+ In-Out approach angulated more acutely around the urethra (122°) than Out-In (144°).
	+ Both approaches formed a u-shaped band behind the urethra, not inferior.
	+ Out-In tapes wrapped more closely around the inferior ischiopubic ramus.
* **Clinical Implications:**
	+ Surgeons should pay attention to the second half of the helical pass for both approaches.
	+ In-Out: Rotate hard and carefully around the ischiopubic ramus.
	+ Out-In: Ensure full thickness vaginal epithelial layer in peri-urethral tunnel.
* **Limitations:**
	+ Cadaveric study, no clinical findings correlation.
	+ Static anatomy, dynamic clinical findings may differ.
* **Future Directions:**
	+ Three-dimensional ultrasonography for in vivo dynamic measurements.
	+ MRI visualization of mesh with iron particle-based implants.
