As a result, we have `nums = [15, 32, 19, 22, 41]`.\n  - Set `swapped` to True.\n  - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.\n  - Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`.

Since `nums[0] = 15` and `nums[1] = 22`, we have `nums[0] < nums[1]`.\n  - Swap `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`.

Since `gaps` must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 0.\n- Set `swapped` to False.\n- Initialize `i` to 0.\n- Iterate over the range of `gaps + i < len(nums)`, which is 0 to 0.\n  - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.\n  - Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. Since `nums[0] = 22` and `nums[1] = 15` does not exist (because `i+gaps = 1` is out of range), we don't compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`.\n\n### Step 6: Fifth iteration of the while loop\n- Since `gaps` is 0, we exit the while loop.\n\n### Step 7: Return the sorted list\n- Return `nums`, which is `[22, 15, 19, 32, 41]`.\n\nSo the final result is\n<ans>\n[22, 15, 19, 32, 41]\n</ans>", "format_properties": {}}

As a result, we have `nums[2] = 37` and `nums[5]` is out of range, so we stop the iteration.\n\n### Step 3: Second iteration of the while loop\n- Calculate `gaps` by dividing the current value of `gaps` by `shrink_fact`. As a result, we have `gaps = 3 / 1.3 = 2.3076923076923077`. Since `gaps` must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 2.\n- Set `swapped` to False.\n- Initialize `i` to 0.\n- Iterate over the range of `gaps + i < len(nums)`, which is 2 + 0 < 5. As a result, we have `i = 0, 1, 2`.\n- In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[0] = 5` and `nums[2] = 37`. Since `5` is not greater than `37`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[1] = 15` and `nums[3] = 25`. Since `15` is not greater than `25`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[2] = 37` and `nums[4] = 79`. Since `37` is not greater than `79`, we don't swap the elements.\n\n### Step 4: Third iteration of the while loop\n- Calculate `gaps` by dividing the current value of `gaps` by `shrink_fact`. As a result, we have `gaps = 2 / 1.3 = 1.5384615384615385`. Since `gaps` must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 1.\n- Set `swapped` to False.\n- Initialize `i` to 0.\n- Iterate over the range of `gaps + i < len(nums)`, which is 1 + 0 < 5. As a result, we have `i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.\n- In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[0] = 5` and `nums[1] = 15`. Since `5` is not greater than `15`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`.

Since `15` is not greater than `37`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[2] = 37` and `nums[3] = 25`. Since `37` is greater than `25`, we swap the elements. As a result, we have `nums[2] = 25` and `nums[3] = 37`.\n- In the fourth iteration, we have `i = 3`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[3] = 37` and `nums[4] = 79`. Since `37` is not greater than `79`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the fifth iteration, we have `i = 4`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[4] = 79` and `nums[5]` is out of range, so we stop the iteration.\n\n### Step 5: Fourth iteration of the while loop\n- Calculate `gaps` by dividing the current value of `gaps` by `shrink_fact`. As a result, we have `gaps = 1 / 1.3 = 0.7692307692307693`. Since `gaps` must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 0.\n- Set `swapped` to False.\n- Initialize `i` to 0.\n- Iterate over the range of `gaps + i < len(nums)`, which is 0 + 0 < 5. As a result, we have `i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.\n- In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[0] = 5` and `nums[1] = 15`. Since `5` is not greater than `15`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[1] = 15` and `nums[2] = 25`. Since `15` is not greater than `25`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[2] = 25` and `nums[3] = 37`. Since `25` is not greater than `37`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the fourth iteration, we have `i = 3`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[3] = 37` and `nums[4] = 79`. Since `37` is not greater than `79`, we don't swap the elements.\n- In the fifth iteration, we have `i = 4`.\n- Compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i+gaps]`. As a result, we have `nums[4] = 79` and `nums[5]` is out of range, so we stop the iteration.\n\n### Step 6: Return the sorted list\n- Since `gaps` is 0, we return the list `nums`.\n\nSo the final result is\n<ans>\n[5, 15, 25, 37, 79]\n</ans>", "format_properties": {}}
