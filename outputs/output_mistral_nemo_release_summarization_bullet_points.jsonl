High-risk HPV types are associated with cervical cancer and other mucosal anogenital and head and neck cancers, while low-risk types cause benign or low-grade cervical tissue changes and genital warts.\n* HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in sexually active adolescents and young women, with at least 50% of sexually active adults having had a genital HPV infection. Globally, 75% of individuals will experience an HPV infection at least once in their lifetime, with the highest rates occurring in those under the age of 25 years.\n* The HPV prevalence in North America and Europe is estimated at 11.5% and 14.2%, respectively, while the prevalence in Africa is estimated at 21.1%, with sub-Saharan Africa topping the list at 24%.\n* In Nigeria, the prevalence of HPV is high in all female age groups, with the highest prevalence in women aged 15-23 years.

In Nigeria, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women aged 15-44 years, with an incidence rate of 27/100,000.\n* HPV infection is strongly related to sexual behavior, and the prevalence of HPV increases with increasing number of sexual partners and early sexual debut.
