In charge-based devices, such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors, switching between logic 0 and logic 1 is accomplished by moving charges into and out of the transistor channel. \n3.

Recently, the Atlas and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle, which is consistent with the SM Higgs boson. This discovery strengthens the correctness of the SM. Several groups have reported an anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (\u03bcg-2), which has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions (e.g., see references therein). The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than xmath10, as listed in table [tab: g-2]. Although it is too early to conclude that this anomaly is evidence of new physics beyond the SM, we expect new particles and interactions related with the muon sector once we regard it as a hint of new physics. Gauge interactions have been playing a central role in constructing fundamental models in particle physics history. Following this line, in this paper, we propose the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM. The measured muon g-2 (\u03bcg-2) and the estimated differences (\u0394\u03bcg-2) from the recent SM predictions in several references have been calculated. From the charge assignments, renormalizable terms in a Lagrangian that contribute to the lepton masses are given by xmath13. The neutrino mass is determined from yukawa couplings, majorana masses, and yukawa couplings. Note that the mass terms between the left and right-handed neutrinos are diagonal. Therefore, the neutrino mixing is obtained by mixing among the right-handed neutrinos. If the majorana masses (\u03bcm) and \u03bcm are of the same order, the seesaw mechanism provides the observed order one neutrino mixing. From the seesaw formula, a relation between the parameters is given by xmath22. The interactions given by eq. (eq: mass terms) break the lepton symmetry. On the other hand, the anomaly against the gauge interaction is efficient at the early universe by the sphaleron process in the finite temperature. Therefore, the baryon asymmetry is washed out if both effects are important simultaneously. Let us calculate a condition such that the washout does not occur.

It plays an important role in quantum information processing.\n3. The study of its essential features and dynamical behavior under the ubiquitous decoherence of relevant quantum systems has attracted much attention in recent years.\n4. For example, it was found that the entanglement of qubits under the markovian decoherence can be terminated in a finite time despite the coherence of single qubit losing in an asymptotical manner.\n5. The phenomenon called \"entanglement sudden death\" (ESD) has been observed experimentally.\n6. This is detrimental to the practical realization of quantum information processing using entanglement.\n7. Surprisingly, some further studies indicated that ESD is not always the eventual fate of the qubit entanglement.\n8. It was found that the entanglement can revive again after some time of ESD.\n9. This revival entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.\n10. Even in some occasions, ESD does not happen at all, instead finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit.\n11. This can be due to the structured environment and physically it results from the formation of a bound state between the qubit and its amplitude damping reservoir.\n12. These results show rich dynamical behaviors of the entanglement and its characters.\n13. The entanglement does not go away, it is still there but just changes the location.\n14.

They found that the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions of the whole system but an identity (see below) has been satisfied at any time.\n17. This may be not surprising since the double-jacobs model has no decoherence and any initial information can be preserved in the time evolution.\n18. However, it would be surprising if the identity is still valid in the presence of the decoherence, in which a non-equilibrium relaxation process is involved.\n19.

{"idx": 25, "result": 0, "generated": "Theoretical descriptions of hadron production at large transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) in either hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies are traditionally framed in a two-step process that involves first a hard scattering of partons, followed by the fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron. The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part makes use of fragmentation functions that are determined phenomenologically. Such a production mechanism has recently been found to be inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate @xmath2 in heavy-ion collisions. Instead, it is the recombination of partons that is shown to be the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when the soft partons are involved. Although at extremely high @xmath2 fragmentation is still dominant, it is desirable to have a universal description that can be applied to any @xmath2 based on the same hadronization scheme. To achieve that goal, it is necessary that the fragmentation process can be treated as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet. The main objective of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and to determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The subject matter of this work is primarily of interest only to high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons. Semi-hard shower partons initiated by a hard parton can either recombine among themselves or recombine with soft partons in the environment. In the former case, the fragmentation function is reproduced, and nothing new is achieved. It is in the latter case that a very new component emerges in heavy-ion collisions, one that has escaped theoretical attention thus far. It should be an important hadronization process in the intermediate @xmath2 region. Our main objective here is to quantify the properties of shower partons and to illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons. The actual application of the shower parton distributions ( spd ) developed here to heavy-ion collisions will be considered elsewhere.

One possible scheme for the operation of the cognitive radio network is to allow secondary users to transmit concurrently on the same frequency band with primary users as long as the resulting interference power at the primary receivers is kept below the interference temperature limit. Note that interference to the primary users is caused by the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions, which allows the signals to be received by all users within the communication range. Note further that this broadcast nature also makes wireless communications vulnerable to eavesdropping. The problem of secure transmission in the presence of an eavesdropper was first studied from an information-theoretic perspective in Wyner's work, where he considered a wiretap channel model. In Wyner's result, the secrecy capacity is defined as the maximum achievable rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver, which can be attained while keeping the eavesdropper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages. Later, Wyner's result was extended to the Gaussian channel in his work. Recently, motivated by the importance of security in wireless applications, information-theoretic security has been investigated in fading multi-antenna and multiuser channels. For instance, cooperative relaying under secrecy constraints was studied in Pei et al.'s work. In this paper, we investigate the collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints in the cognitive radio network. First, we characterize the secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (AF) cognitive relay channel. Then, we formulate the beamforming optimization as a quasiconvex optimization problem that can be solved through convex semidefinite programming (SDP).

The starting point is the following. A classical @xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFSs, so why not maintain the @xmath0-invariance during the quantization process in a CFS? Doing so, a free field living in a CFS might behave like in a flat space and the corresponding Wightman two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts. The work confirms this assertion in the special case of the Maxwell field in de Sitter space. In general, a new and simple two-point Wightman function is found and which has the same physical (gauge independent) content as the two-point function of Allen and Jacobson. This is because the faraday propagator is the same. The present work extends to general CFS and clarifies the quantum structure of the formalism developed in @xcite. We use the Dirac six-cone formalism and realize all CFSs as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. The introduction of auxiliary fields and the use of the Gubla-Beler quantization scheme are necessary to deal with gauge freedom of the Maxwell field. Another important ingredient is the use of a well-suited coordinate system. This allows to get a Minkowskian form. The main result is a set of Wightman two-point functions for the Maxwell and auxiliary fields. This paper is organized as follows. [geom] sets the coordinates systems and the geometrical construction of CFSs. [fields] defines the fields and gives their dynamical equations. In sec., [quant-field] , the dynamical system is solved, the quantum field is explicitly constructed and the two-point functions are written down. Some technical details are given in appdx.

Parallel Chip-Firing Games (PCFGs) are a special case of the more general chip-Firing Games (CFGs), where each vertex fires exactly one chip to each of its neighbors. The period of a PCFG is the number of moves required to repeat the game, which is either 1 or 2.\n2.

{"idx": 42, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Organic Molecular Crystals: Emerging Applications in Nanoscale Devices</summary>\n\nOrganic molecular crystals, composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces, are emerging as excellent candidates for fabricating nanoscale devices. These have potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics, particularly in areas such as solar energy harvesting, surface photochemistry, organic electronics, and spintronics. The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance, and this is a challenging task, especially in the single-molecule limit. Upon adsorption on a substrate, the electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change value from that of their gas phase counterparts. This is expected since, when the molecule is physisorbed on a polarisable substrate, the removal (addition) of an electron from (to) the molecule gives rise to a polarisation of the substrate. The image charge accumulated on the substrate in the vicinity of the molecule alters the addition or removal energy of charge carriers from the molecule. A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle (qp) description. Within the qp picture, one ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons and consequently takes the relative alignment of the metal fermi level, @xmath1 , with either the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) and highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of a molecule as removal energy. This effectively corresponds to associate the electron affinity and the ionization potential respectively to the lumo and homo of the molecule. The adequacy of the qp description then depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the homo and lumo. If the theory of choice is density functional theory (dft), then a number of observations should be made. Firstly, it is important to note that except for the energy of the homo, which can be rigorously interpreted as the negative of the ionization potential, in general the kohn - sham orbitals can not be associated to qp energies. However, this is commonly done in practice and often the kohn - sham qp levels provide a good approximation to the true removal energies, in particular in the case of metals. Unfortunately, the situation is less encouraging with the local and semi-local approximations of the exchange and correlation functional, namely the local density approximation (lda) and the generalized gradient approximation (gga), performing rather poorly even for the homo level", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 40}}

Recent developments in the fabrication of 2D materials have sought to clarify the details of the transition, with the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Yang (KTHNY) picture as the most widely accepted theory. The KTHNY theory proposes that two separate, continuous transitions can be distinguished, with the solid transforming into a liquid in quasi-equilibrium steps by slow heating. During the first stage, the translational order vanishes, while in the second stage, the orientational order decays. All this is mediated by the unbinding of (i) dislocation pairs into individual dislocations and (ii) dislocations into point defects. The strength of this theory is its compatibility with the Mermin-Wagner theorem that forbids exact long-range positional order in 2D for a wide range of pair potentials at finite temperatures. The most criticized weakness of the theory is that it assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which is in contradiction with observations where the alignment and accumulation of dislocations into small angle domain walls was found. Since the birth of the KTHNY theory, investigations of its validity for systems with different pair interactions have been in focus. The examination of its validity for systems with dipole-dipole and debye-hckel interactions has shown that the phase transition is not first order but second order. The effect of the range of the potential on two-dimensional melting was studied in the 2D lennard-jones system for a wide range of Morse potentials.

The necessary equilibration time, in turn, strongly depends on the measured quantity of interest.

A central problem in network science is the study of the random walks (rw) on a graph, and in particular of the relation between the topological properties of the network and the properties of diffusion on it.\n3. This subject is not only interesting from a purely theoretical perspective, but it has important implications to various scientific issues ranging from epidemics to the classification of web pages through pagerank algorithm.\n4. In this paper, we set up a new framework for the study of topologically biased random walks on graphs. This allows to address problems of community detection and synchronization in the field of complex networks.\n5. In particular, by using topological properties of the network to bias the rw, we explore the network structure more efficiently.\n6. A similar approach but with different focus can be found in @xcite. In this research, we are motivated by the idea that biased random walks can be efficiently used for community finding.\n7. To this aim, we introduce a set of mathematical tools which allow us an efficient investigation of the \"bias parameters\" space.\n8.

The spread of information in online social networks, the evolution of an epidemic outbreak in human contact networks, and the dynamics of cascading failures in the electrical grid are relevant examples of these processes. While major advances have been made in this field, most modeling and analysis techniques are specifically tailored to study static networks. However, empirical observations in social, biological, and financial networks illustrate how real-world networks are constantly evolving over time. Unfortunately, the effects of temporal structural variations in the dynamics of networked systems remain poorly understood. In this research direction, we find the seminal work by Gross et al. in @xcite, where a simple adaptive rewiring mechanism was proposed in the context of epidemic models. In this model, a susceptible node can cut edges connecting him to infected neighbors and form new links to any randomly selected susceptible nodes without structural constraint in the formation of new links. Despite its simplicity, this adaptation mechanism induces a complex bifurcation diagram including healthy, oscillatory, bistable, and endemic epidemic states. Several extensions of this work can be found in the literature, where the authors assume homogeneous infection and recovery rates in the network. Another model that is specially relevant to our work is the adaptive susceptible-infectious-susceptible (asis) model proposed in @xcite. In this model, edges in a given contact network can be temporarily removed in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic. An interesting feature of the asis model is that, in contrast with Gross model, it is able to account for arbitrary contact patterns, since links are constrained to be part of a given contact graph. Despite its modeling flexibility, analytical results for the asis model are based on the assumption of homogeneous contact patterns (i.e., the contact graph is complete) and homogeneous node and edge dynamics (i.e., nodes present the same infection and recovery rates, and edges share the same adaptation rates). In contrast, while controlling epidemic processes over static networks, we find a plethora of tools based on game theory or convex optimization. In this paper, we study adaptation mechanisms over arbitrary contact networks. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the asis model for arbitrary networks, as well as heterogeneous node and edge dynamics. In the case of homogeneous node and edge dynamics, we show that the lower bound is proportional to the epidemic threshold of the standard sis model over a static network.

The origin of the latter is still debated. In general, pnictides and chalcogenides can be divided into two subclasses, pnictides and chalcogenides, with the square lattice of iron as the basic element, though with orthorhombic distortions in lightly doped materials. Iron is surrounded by as or p sites in the tetrahedral positions within the first subclass and by se, te, or s sites within the second subclass. Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe-orbitals and excluding extreme hole and electron dopings, it consists of two hole sheets around the Fermi point and two electron sheets around the Fermi point in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ) corresponding to one Fe per unit cell (the so-called 1-FBZ). Electron pockets are centered at the Fermi point. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to the enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations with the maximal scattering near the wave vector k equal to k2 or k3 in the 1-FBZ or to k5 in the 2-FBZ. Different mechanisms of Cooper pairs formation result in the distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure. In particular, the RPA-SF approach gives the extended k-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets (k6 state) as the main instability for the wide range of doping concentrations. On the other hand, orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have the sign-preserving k symmetry. Thus, probing the gap structure can help in elucidating the underlying mechanism. In this respect, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool since the measured dynamical spin susceptibility (\u03c7s) in the superconducting state carries information about the gap structure. There are many reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems appearing only for k3 at or around k4. The common explanation is that the peak is the spin resonance due to the k6 state. Indeed, since k6 connects fermi sheets with different signs of k gaps, the resonance condition for the interband susceptibility is fulfilled and the spin resonance peak is formed at a frequency k5 below k6 with k2 being the gap size.

Despite receiving much attention, their formation process remains enigmatic. Observations reveal that massive stars form via accretion (similar to low-mass stars) or through mergers of intermediate-mass stars. Advances in instrumentation have enabled sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at wavelengths less affected by large column densities of material that obscure regions at shorter wavelengths. Recent observations have uncovered the environment surrounding individual massive protostellar systems, from analysis of @xmath42.3 @xmath0 m co bandhead emission, @xcite have inferred keplerian disks very closely surrounding four massive young stellar objects, while interferometric, mm-continuum observations have found the mass-function of protostellar dust clumps lies close to a salpeter value down to clump radii of 2000 au. These high-resolution observations point toward an accretion formation scenario for massive stars. Further discrimination between the two competing models is possible by examining the properties, in particular the young stellar populations, of hot molecular cores. The mid-infrared (mir) window offers a powerful view of these regions.

These transitions are often associated with symmetry breaking, where the underlying microscopic theory is no longer valid. The most common examples include the melting of a solid into a liquid, the transition from a solid to a gas, and the transition from a liquid to a gas. These transitions are crucial for understanding the behavior of materials and have wide-ranging applications in various fields, including materials science, condensed matter physics, and quantum mechanics.\n\nPhase transitions are characterized by a sudden change in the macroscopic properties of a system, such as temperature, pressure, or concentration. The microscopic theory that describes the behavior of the system must be modified to account for the new macroscopic properties. This process is known as phase transition theory.\n\nThe most dramatic changes in macroscopic properties of a physical system occur at phase transitions, which often involve a symmetry breaking process. The theory of such phase transitions was formulated by Landau as a phenomenological model and later developed from microscopic principles using the renormalization group. One can identify phases by knowledge of an order parameter, which is zero in the disordered phase and nonzero in the ordered phase.\n\nIn the context of the ising model, the phase transition is found using principal component analysis (PCA) and variational autoencoders (VAE). PCA is used to identify the latent parameters that encode the order parameter, while VAE is used to reconstruct the input data from its latent representation.

While it is clear that SXRTs are powered by accretion, the origin of the low-luminosity X-ray emission that has been detected in the quiescent state of several SXRTs is still unclear. An interesting possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSRP) turns on in the quiescent state of SXRTs, providing a missing link between persistent LMXRBS and recycled MSPs.

Grover's algorithm has been realized using many physical systems like nmr, superconducting qubits, and atom cavity qed. Superconducting qubit cavity qed is an attractive approach for quantum information processing due to its strong coupling limit in microwave cavity compared to atoms in cavity qed. Squids have attracted much attention among superconducting qubits due to their design flexibility, large-scale integration, and compatibility to conventional electronics. Recently, Carlo et al. demonstrated the implementation of two-qubit Grover and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms using four-level squids in cavity qed. The goal of this work is to implement three-qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level squids in cavity qed. We consider a three-qubit phase gate, which reduces the number of quantum gates typically required for the realization of Grover's algorithm. Three-qubit Grover's algorithm is probabilistic, as compared to two-qubit Grover's algorithm. Therefore, to achieve high success probability, we have to implement basic searching iterations several times. The implementation of three-qubit Grover's search is much more complex as compared to two-qubit case. In our scheme, two lowest energy levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 of each squid represent logical states. The scheme is based on resonant, off-resonant interaction of cavity field with squid and application of resonant microwave pulses. Our scheme does not require adjustment of squid level spacing during the implementation of Grover's search iteration, thus, decoherence caused by the adjustment of level spacing is suppressed. We do not require identical coupling constants of each squid with the resonator and direct coupling between levels @xmath4 and @xmath6. Grover's iteration time becomes faster due to resonant and off-resonant interactions as compared to second order detuning or adiabatic passage.

The cb (conduction-band electrons) can have many different effects on the x-ray photoelectron spectrum from the core level. If the excitation could be considered adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by the cb electrons would lead to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy (lower binding energy of the core level). Now the excitation is not adiabatic, the excitation is swift. The excitation frequency is large compared to the frequency components taking part in the screening of the core hole. This has the effect that the cb electrons are shaken up and are left in a nonequilibrium state. This is analogous to the case of the following case: assume that a cork is floating in a glass of water. If we remove the cork very slowly the water will be very quiet and without any ripples. If we on the other hand remove it very briskly the water will be in an upset state with many surface waves excited. In a metal, the water waves correspond to plasmons, collective excitations of the cb electrons. The shake-up effects will show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum; the main peak will be at the adiabatic position; the first replica, a smaller copy of the main peak, will be at a shifted position to lower kinetic energy where the shift is equal to the plasma frequency; the second replica is even smaller and shifted with two plasma frequencies; this goes on until further peaks are absorbed by the background. The main peak corresponds to the system left in quasi equilibrium (fully equilibrium would demand that the core hole be filled by one of the electrons). The second to a state where one plasmon is excited, the third to a state where two plasmons are excited and so on. Since all plasmons do not have identical energies, the plasmon curve shows dispersion, the replicas are not completely identical smaller versions of the main peak. In a metal, single-particle excitations can take place. These electron-hole pair excitations form a continuum, starting from zero frequency and upwards. These excitations lead to a deformation, including a low-energy tail, of both the main peak and the plasmon replicas.

It owes its popularity to its algorithmic simplicity: the cumbersome problem of tracking moving solid-liquid interfaces or grain boundaries is avoided by describing the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields. The phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods. The foundations of the phase-field method and its application to solidification have been the subject of several recent review articles. Several topics are discussed where robust phase-field modelling tools are not yet available because some fundamental questions remain open. In sec. 2, the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models is examined, and it is shown that the currently available approaches can not in general eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness. In sec. 3, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification are discussed, and it is shown that the standard equation of motion usually written down for the orientation field is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter. Finally, in sec. 4, the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is reviewed, and it is shown that the standard approach can not be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation. The common point of these topics is that they pose challenges or limitations for straightforward computations. Indeed, a characteristic feature of the phase-field method is that its equations can often be written down following simple rules or intuition, but that their detailed properties ( which have to be known if quantitative simulations are desired ) become only apparent through a mathematical analysis that can be quite involved. Therefore, it is not always easy to perceive the limits of applicability of the method. It is hoped that the present contribution will be helpful to point out some pitfalls and to stimulate further discussions that will facilitate the solution of these issues. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been greatly enhanced in the last decade by a detailed control of their properties. Phase-field models are rooted in the mean-field description of spatially diffuse interfaces by order parameters. However, to be useful for simulating microstructure formation in solidification, phase-field models need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of the physical solid-liquid interfaces and the typical scale of the microstructures. This is achieved by increasing the interface width in the model, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Obviously, this procedure magnifies any physical effect that is due to the diffuseness of the interface.

DNA loops play a crucial role in genetic expression, replication, and recombination. For example, in E. coli, the lac repressor (lac repressor) mediates loop formation, which is essential for repressive regulation of lac genes. The hairpin loop formation is an elementary step in protein folding, and the cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium. Single molecule experiment techniques provide detailed information on the DNA loop formation. Recently, the power spectrum of the fluctuating force exerted on cytoskeleton was measured to be an order of magnitude larger than that expected from thermal equilibrium condition. This indicates that the cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium. The advance of single molecule experiment techniques provides detailed information on the DNA loop formation. Finzi and Gelles observed laci-mediated DNA loop formation and dissociation by monitoring nano-scale brownian motion of the micron-sized particle attached to one end of the DNA. Gemmen studied effects of tension in the presence of two-site restriction enzymes which can cut the DNA upon binding on two sites simultaneously. They found that the cleavage activity decreases approximately 10-fold as the tension increases from 30 fn to 700 fn. They also found that the optimum loop size decreases with the tension, which is qualitatively in agreement with theoretical predictions. More recently, Chen et al. studied effects of tension in femtonewton range on the kinetics of laci-mediated DNA looping. They found that small tension of 100 fn scale on the substrate DNA can increase the looping time by more than two orders of magnitude. There is room for improvement in their approach, however, on the evaluation of the free energy that can be valid for short end-to-end distance of the chain as well as a description of detailed kinetic process using the mean first passage time approach.

The honeycomb lattice is characterized by the presence of heavy or rare metal elements, such as bismuth or iridium, which poses constraints on the search for topological materials. Despite these constraints, ubiquitous mutual coulomb repulsions among electrons have been proposed to generate effective spin-orbit couplings, leading to topologically non-trivial phases. The honeycomb lattice becomes a topologically non-trivial insulator driven by the coulomb interaction, which is often called a topological mott insulator (TMI). This phenomenon is unusual because an emergent spin-orbit interaction appears from the electronic mutual coulomb interaction, but it shows an unconventional quantum criticality that depends on the electron band dispersion near the fermi point. The proposed TMI phase is stabilized by reducing the fermi velocity of the Dirac cones, which is achieved through the use of the extended hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. The stability of the TMI phase is studied using mean-field approximations, and the results show that the fermi velocity can be tuned to stabilize the TMI phase. The stability of the TMI phase is also examined in real materials such as twisted bilayer graphene, where the honeycomb lattice is used as a platform for the realization of the TMI phase.

This discovery is particularly relevant in models in which the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector, as invoked in various extensions of the standard model. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature may be beneficial for having the Higgs responsible for inflation, and as a suppression mechanism for the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields at the LHC. The presence of a strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles such as the electron. The analysis of the distance dependence of the newtonian gravitational constant has been discussed, and bounds on the gravitational interaction of the Higgs boson from the LHC experiments have been recently discussed. Bound on the curvature scalar of the Higgs field has also been obtained by considering strong gravity astrophysical objects. The presence of a strong curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles such as the electron. The effective mass parameter of the Higgs field gets an extra term due to the scalar curvature as @xmath16, and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field will become spacetime dependent through the curvature scalar as : @xmath17 where the approximation holds in a weak curvature limit. This implies that the mass @xmath18 of fundamental fermions, such as the electron, will be simply changed proportionally to the Higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath19 in other words, the presence of coupling of the Higgs field to space-time curvature adds to its inertial mass a contribution, which acts as a mass renormalization due to curved space-time (however, for an opposite interpretation of this mass shift see @xcite ). This mass shift is not present for protons and neutrons, due to the fact that their mass is primarily due to the gluonic fields which, being massless, are unaffected by the Higgs field. As discussed in more detail in @xcite, this implies that all molecular transitions only depending on the nuclei mass, such as vibrational and rotational spectra, should be unaffected by the Higgs - curvature coupling at leading order. Unfortunately, the ricci scalar outside spherically symmetric masses is zero, so we cannot use this coupling to infer possible mass shifts", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 27}}

Possible applications include the use of a mott state of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice as a starting point for creating controlled multiparticle entanglement as an essential ingredient for quantum computation.

The QGP phase is currently being actively studied, and revealing the QGP phase transition structure is one of the central aims of ongoing and future theoretical and experimental research in the field of hot and dense QCD matter.\n3. The QGP phase transition is characterized by the asymptotic freedom of the system, where the quarks and gluons interact weakly.\n4. The asymptotic freedom suggests two possible recipes for the creation of the QGP: the recipe for high temperature quarks and gluons, or the recipe for high baryon density quarks and gluons.\n5. The phase transition of the QGP is described by the Landau fermi liquid theory, which is based on the Landau fermi liquid picture. The theory predicts that the energy density of weakly interacting quarks in the QGP is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4\\pi g_q}{(2\\pi)^3} ( \\pi^2 \\mu + \\mu^3 )\n   \\]\n   where \\( g_q \\) is the degeneracy of quarks, \\( \\mu \\) is the chemical potential, and \\( \\pi^2 \\mu \\) is the bag pressure.\n6.

Stochastic resonance is the effect of nonmonotone dependence of the response of a system on the noise when this noise is added to a periodic input signal.\n3. An extensive review on stochastic resonance and its presence in different fields of applications can be found in @xcite.\n4. Following @xcite, as stochastic resonance we intend the phenomenon in which the transmission of a signal can be improved by the addition of noise.\n5. The problem is to estimate a signal @xmath4 transmitted through a channel. This signal has to be detected by a receiver that can reveal signals louder than a threshold @xmath1.\n6. If @xmath2 is bounded from above by @xmath1, the signal is not observable and the problem has not a solution.\n7. But, if some noise @xmath3 is added to the signal, the perturbed signal @xmath4 may be observable and inference can be done on @xmath2.\n8. Too few noise is not sufficient to give good estimates and too much noise deteriorates excessively the signal.\n9. The optimal in some sense level of the noise will be called stochastic resonance in this framework.\n10. Usually, the criterion applied to measure optimality of estimators are the shannon mutual information or the kullback divergence.\n11. More recently, the fisher information quantity have been also proposed (see @xcite and @xcite).\n12. Here we are concerned with the fisher information quantity.\n13. It happens that this quantity, as a function of the noise, can be maximized for certain noise structures. If there is only one global maximum, the corresponding noise level is the value for which we have stochastic resonance, if several local maxima are present, the phenomenon is called stochastic multi-resonance.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 14}}

The ZRP is conventionally represented as the boundary condition on the matrix wavefunction at some point. Alternatively, it can be represented as a pseudopotential (Breit, Xmath6). On the other hand, Darboux transformation (DT) allows for the construction of exactly solvable potentials. General starting points of the theory go up to the Matveev theorem (see Xmath). The transformation can be defined on the base of the covariance property of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with respect to a transformation of wavefunction and potential (Matveev and Salerno, Xmath7). Darboux formulas in multi-dimensional space can be applied in the sense of Andrianov, Borisenko, and Ioffe ideas (Xmath). In the circumstances, DT technique can be used so as to correct the ZRP model. We attempt to dress the ZRP in order to improve the possibilities of the ZRP model. We use notations and some results from Xmath. DT modifies the generalized ZRP boundary condition (section Xmath8) and creates a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum. In the section Xmath10, we consider the non-spherical potential so as to dress a multi-centered potential, which includes ZRPs. As an important example, we consider electron scattering by the Xmath1 and Xmath2 structures within the framework of the ZRP model (section Xmath12).

To permit replacement or insertion of pages, one or other of the screws is removed to permit removal of the front or the back cover and possibly some of the album pages at the front or back while the other screw remains in position to retain the remainder of the album pages in alignment. This screw-type fastening system has been in use for many years but is not particularly convenient to use as it can be quite difficult to align the male and female screws while maintaining alignment of the pages particularly when adding album sheets to increase the size of the album.\n\n3. The strap-type fasteners are particularly preferred for their ease of use and versatility in increasing the size of the album. The strap-type fasteners are designed to be easily inserted and removed from the album, and the adjustable length of the strap allows for variable thickness of the album. The strap-type fasteners also provide a secure locking effect, enabling the album to be easily assembled and disassembled.\n\n4. The strap-type fasteners are also useful for adding or replacing pages, as they can be easily inserted and removed from the album. The adjustable length of the strap allows for variable thickness of the album, which can be adjusted to suit the number of pages within the album. The adjustable length of the strap also provides a secure locking effect, enabling the album to be easily assembled and disassembled.\n\n5.

{"idx": 226, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary>\n\n1. The invention addresses the problem of decreasing the force peak (break-away peak) during a crash, thereby achieving a simple and cost-effective yet functional implementation.\n2. This is achieved through a steering column with elastic prestress on at least one bending wire or strip.\n3. The jacket unit is prestressed with respect to the retaining part in the displacement direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft in the direction toward the vehicle front.\n4. This prestress acts on the break-away connection between the jacket unit and the retaining part.\n5. The force required in the event of a crash to release the break-away connection is decreased, since the elastic reset force of the at least one bending wire or strip is added to the force exerted, in particular through the secondary collision of the driver with the steering wheel, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft in the direction toward the vehicle front.\n6. The force peak during the breaking away of the jacket unit from the retaining part (=break-away peak) can be decreased or entirely avoided.\n7. The invention provides an adjustable steering column that is also adjustable in length.\n8. The steering column is preferably implemented such that it is adjustable in length.\n9. An advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that the retaining part is formed by a part of the securement device.\n10. The retaining part in the closed state of the securement device is herein in engagement with a securement part which is secured in position with respect to the bracket unit such that it is nondisplaceable in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft. Through this engagement between the securement part and the retaining part, at least a portion of the securement force is applied securing, in the closed state of the securement device, the jacket unit against a displacement parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft. In the opened state of the securement device, the retaining part and the securement part are out of engagement. However, the energy absorption device for enabling the energy absorbing dislocation of the jacket unit in the event of a crash is integrated into the securement device. In this embodiment of the invention, the vehicle-stationary mounting of the bracket unit can be provided. A further energy absorbing dislocateability between the bracket unit and a mounting part, displaceably supporting this bracket unit parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft and mounted stationarily on the vehicle, can consequently be omitted.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 40}}

The present invention is directed to a method of forming a two-sided nonwoven fabric, which exhibits a pronounced three-dimensional image that is durable to both converting and end-use application. In particular, the present invention contemplates that a fabric is formed from a first precursor web comprising a fibrous matrix and a second precursor web comprising a second matrix. Between the first and second precursor web, a fluid-pervious support layer or scrim, is interposed and subjected to hydroentanglement on a moveable imaging surface having a three-dimensional image transfer device. By formation of a nonwoven fabric in this fashion, a three-dimensional image that is durable to abrasion and distortion due to elongation is imparted and a product formed which exhibits on its opposite surfaces the unique properties of the respective fibrous matrix used. \n\n2. In accordance with the present invention, a method of making a nonwoven fabric embodying the present invention includes the steps of providing a first precursor web comprising a fibrous matrix and a second precursor web comprising a second matrix. While use of staple length fibers is typical, the first and/or second fibrous matrices may comprise substantially continuous filaments.

The invention involves knitting two tape-shaped knit pieces by a flat knitting machine with multiple needle beds, either front or rear, and overlaying symmetrical loops of the final course of both knit pieces across the boundary.\n3. The method consists of two steps: knitting two pieces of tape-shaped knit fabric in a specified length by arbitrary needles in different ranges across the boundary in the longitudinal direction of one of the needle beds.\n4. When two pieces of tape-shaped knit fabric reach a specified length, the loop portion of the final course of one of the knit fabrics is transferred to the needles of the other needle bed, which is the moving side knit fabric, the needle bed is moved so that the loop portion of the end part of the moving side knit fabric is overlaid on the loop of the end part of the part adjoining other fixed side knit fabric, and the loop of the moving side knit fabric of the overlaying part is transferred and overlaid on the loop of the fixed side knit fabric and a new loop is formed on this overlaid part.\n5. The method repeats this sequence of forming a new loop on an overlaid loop by a proper number of times depending on the width of the knit fabric, until the end parts of both knit fabrics are joined and the final end portion of the junction is prevented from loosening the stitch.\n6.

The invention relates to ladders, particularly to ladder attachments for positioning the ladder away from the work surface, preventing the ladder from defacing the work surface, and preventing the ladder from slipping or sliding.\n2. One problem with ladders, especially when painting or cleaning the exterior of a house, is that there is an amount of instability because the ladder rests on the side of the house with the only contact with the house being a small portion of the siderails of the ladder. When a person on the ladder reaches outside the rails, the center of gravity shifts causing one or both rails may slide along the work surface, thereby damaging the work surface.\n3. Another problem with typical ladders is that the siderails of the ladder rest on the work surface with a very small contact area which sometimes dents, scrapes, bruises or otherwise defaces the work surface. It is desirable to have a ladder that contacts the work surface with a broad surface area that does not deface the work surface.\n4. With typical ladders, a work surface with a corner presents a problem. The ladder has to be positioned on one of the two surfaces forming the corner to stabilize the ladder, but this makes the other surface difficult to reach. A typical ladder cannot straddle the corners because the rungs would rest against the corner with the siderails void of contact with the two surfaces creating an unstable condition.\n5.

The invention provides a method of multiplexing multiple position sensors on a minimum number of wires, reducing the number of wires required and minimizing energy consumption. The key components of the invention include a waveform generator, an error correction generator, and a window reference circuit. The waveform generator generates an unconditioned sensing signal, which is modified by the error correction signal to provide a conditioned sensing signal. The error correction generator determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about the position of the object being sensed. The window reference circuit compares the sensor output to an ideal minimum value, adjusting the output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal. The sensor monitoring system receives the conditioned sensing signal via two wires, making it ideal for multiplexing with other sensors. The invention also includes a digitally stored offset and error correction closed-loop compensation circuit that constantly compares the sensor output to a desired minimum value and generates a correction signal to deliver a sensor signal output that is as close to the desired minimum value as practical without requiring unnecessary circuitry. The constant comparison of sensor output to the desired value, an ideal minimum value, proceeds in a first direction relative to a direction of signals generated when the object (a target) being monitored moves in a relatively slow manner compared to the speed of objects being monitored. The number of bits chosen for the operation of the counter 108 and the DAC 106 are such that the increase and decrease in the output 105 S, while the differential amplifier 102 output changes, are not a significant portion of the dynamic signal generated by the transducer 104 when the object being monitored moves.

These signals are processed to provide a control signal to a DC motor that automatically sets the throttle position for optimal performance, maintaining the vehicle along its ideal operating line. The control unit also provides an output signal which controls a clutch. The clutch connects the accelerator pedal directly to the throttle valve when manual control is desired. During manual control, the vehicle driver has full control of the vehicle. Changing control from automatic to manual, however, does not occur until the throttle valve is moved either to a predetermined position or is positioned to match what is commanded by the accelerator pedal. Thus, the vehicle is prevented from lurching forward or stalling when control is shifted from automatic to manual.

Another key objective is to design a housing structure that facilitates circumferential cooling flow in the rotor housing while permitting the insertion of spark plug bosses thereunder, with the housing being structured to minimize thermal distortion, particularly in the zone surrounding the spark plug bosses.\n3. Another important aspect of the invention is to provide a housing for a rotary internal combustion engine with a peripheral cooling circuit defined so that there are separate flow paths for release of boiling vapor from a plurality of spark plug bosses interrupting such circuit.\n4. Yet another objective is to provide a housing structure for a rotary internal combustion engine that employs circumferential cooling having a vertical flow moving past bosses therein which are an integral part of the structure, the structure being made to increase the heat transfer coefficient of the cooling circuit at the spark plug boss zone by at least 20% over prior art capabilities.\n5. Structural features of the invention include the use of plug bosses interposed in a circumferential cooling flow passageway of the rotor housing, staggered with respect to the direction of flow, the arrangement of the plurality of spark plugs and accompanying bosses are offset but symmetrically oppositely oriented about a centerplane of the flow and skewed with respect thereto so that the staggered arrangement promotes relatively close in-line arrangement of the spark plug terminals, the incorporation of a predetermined and limited offset from a line extending between the spark plug terminals so as not to detrimentally affect propagation of the combustion flame while yet allowing for the staggered boss configuration, and the use of flow diverters or flow controllers between the spark plug bosses to insure a controlled flow regime between the bosses and for strengthening the housing structure.\n6.

The present invention addresses the issue of minimizing flow disturbance caused by the closing and reopening of turbine control valves during periodic operational testing, specifically focusing on using control valve positions as feedback to minimize such disturbances.\n2. The method of the present invention utilizes control valve positions as feedback to minimize steam boiler pressure changes or turbine power changes during turbine control valve operational safety testing. By maintaining the total mass flow through several parallel turbine inlet control valves constant, the steam generator pressure is maintained constant, and the inlet pressure regulator is unaffected during testing.\n3. The flow is determined as a function of control valve position, with the flow change due to closure of one of the several parallel flow paths during valve testing resulting in a change to the system that is controlling pressure from N valves to N-1 valves. The flow characteristic for each valve of the system with N valves, and for the system with N-1 valves, is determined during the turbine design process. The flow characteristics thus determined are based on total flow and individual valve stem lift.\n4. The flow difference between the N and N-1 condition is known, and this difference is applied to the total flow demand to each of the N-1 valves on the basis of the total N valve demand derived from the position of the valve under test.  \n5.

{"idx": 316, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary>\n\nThe invention relates to a method of compressing gas in a compressor station for a gas pipe line, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method includes compressing the gas at least during individual intervals to a substantially higher pressure (excess pressure) than the desired exit pressure, cooling the compressed gas by the heat exchange to a temperature above the exit temperature, and obtaining the further cooling to the desired exit temperature by expanding the gas from the excess pressure to the desired exit pressure. A compressor station for a gas pipeline for carrying out the above-described method includes at least one compressor for compressing gas, at least one heat exchanger for cooling compressed gas, additionally valve-controlled pipelines for connecting the compressor and the heat exchanger to one another and to the gas pipeline, as well as control units for controlling the compressor and the valves. The invention starts from the fact that it is known to carry out the compression of a gas supplied at an entry pressure below the nominal pressure (rated pressure of the gas pipeline) to an increased pressure, wherein the compression can be carried out in a single stage or in multiple stages in compressors which are connected in series. Between the compressor stages and particularly after the last compressor stage, cooling by heat exchange takes place (usually air/gas heat exchange), in order to reach the required lower exit temperature of at most 0\u00b0 C., preferably -5\u00b0 C., for the re-entry of the compressed gas into the gas pipeline. During the warmer period of the year, in which the use of re-cooling units was necessary in the past for ensuring the required exit temperature, the present invention provides for a different type of cooling. The present invention utilizes the known physical effect according to which a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure, either by throttling or with the simultaneous performance of work. In order to ensure the required exit pressure or nominal pressure at the exit of the compressor station, the present invention provides that the gas to be transported is compressed to an excess pressure which is substantially above the exit pressure, for example, 10 to 50 bar above the exit pressure, to carry out at the end of the single-stage or multiple-stage compression a cooling by heat exchange, particularly by air/gas heat exchange, and subsequently to expand the compressed gas to the desired exit pressure. The excess pressure is selected in such a way that, taking into consideration the extent by which the gas compressed to excess pressure can be cooled by heat exchange, cooling during expansion is", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_sentences_per_point": 1, "n_sentences_total": 4}}

The two ring elements are composed in such a manner that they contact one another via their bridge portions, wherein the in each case corresponding spherical cap pockets which face one another then jointly form ball guide pockets into which in each case a ball can be inserted. The two ring elements which contact one another via the bridge portions are welded to one another in the region of the bridge portions by spot weld points. In order to manufacture the ring elements, these are punched out from a sheet metal material and formed in a forming tool such that they obtain the axial profiling required to form the ball guide pockets.\n\n<summary>Summary</summary>\nThe object of the invention is to reduce the production costs which arise during the manufacture of rolling body guide cages. According to the invention, this object is achieved by a rolling body guide cage with a ring element which is produced from a sheet metal material and has an axial profiling formed by forming techniques and several rolling body guide structures which are arranged in succession in the circumferential direction, the ring element being composed of at least two flat material ring segments which are joined to one another in succession in the circumferential direction and are connected, in particular welded, to one another in a production step which precedes the formation of the axial profiling. \n\nThe invention has been shown to be particularly advantageous in particular in the manufacture of rolling body guide cages with an internal diameter of more than 140 mm since the process costs associated with the formation of three weld joints are, at this diameter, already substantially below the material costs of the cutting waste which has hitherto arisen. \n\nAccording to one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the flat material ring segments placed in succession with one another in the circumferential direction are put together across an engagement zone and in this engagement zone are", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 30}}

The invention relates to a technique for easily and quickly determining the optimum value of feedback gain used for calculating correction amount in feedback control.\n2. The method of determining feedback gain according to the invention, as schematically shown in FIG. 1, comprises a first step of provisionally determining a predetermined value of a feedback gain, a second step of executing feedback control by using the provisionally determined feedback gain, a third step of detecting an error between a designated value and an actual value of the subject of control during the execution of the second step, a fourth step of calculating an evaluation value indicative of the character of feedback control according to the error detected in the third step, a fifth step of executing the second to fourth steps repeatedly a plurality of times after provisionally determining a new feedback gain value different from the previous value, and a sixth step of calculating a feedback gain value which can provide for a suitable evaluation value according to the relation between the feedback gain value and the evaluation value obtained through the fifth step.\n3. This method permits a feedback gain providing for a suitable evaluation value to be calculated on the basis of the relation between feedback gain value and evaluation value, and it is thus possible to determine a feedback gain which can realize a suitable feedback control characteristic quickly and reliably.\n4. Particularly, in case of determining the proportional gain, in the fourth step, the ratio between the length of a curve obtained by plotting the error against time axis and the length of the time axis is calculated as the evaluation value, and in the sixth step, a feedback gain value providing for the minimum evaluation value is calculated.\n5. The proportional gain is a factor which influences the stability of control. The stability of control can be evaluated from the extent of variations of the error, and thus the length of the curve obtained by plotting the error against time axis is suited for evaluating the proportional gain. Thus, by using the length of the curve obtained by plotting the error against time axis as the evaluation value, it is possible to obtain quickly and accurately a value of the proportional gain that provides for the optimum stability.\n6. In case of determining the integral gain, in the fourth step, the evaluation value is calculated by integrating the error, and in the sixth step, a value of feedback gain that provides for an evaluation value closest to zero is calculated.\n7.

When the device becomes inactive for a long period of time, the device is often put into a \"sleep mode\" in which most of the electric power is cut off to save energy.  \n2. The toner used in such an imaging device is charged with a tribo-electro-static charge (also known as tribo). A toner concentration (TC) sensor measures the concentration of the toner in the developer by detecting the tribo charge of the toner, and based on the output of the TC sensor, a toner dispenser may adjust the supply of toner to increase the concentration of the toner when the concentration of toner is low.  \n3. If the imaging device is inactive for a long period of time, such as from the end of a business day to the next morning, the tribo charge of the toner may decrease. The tribo charge greatly affects the image quality in an imaging operation. Therefore, the image quality in an imaging operation after a delayed period may become inconsistent and darker than the image quality during normal or continual use.  \n4. The exemplary embodiments address these and other issues. For example, in various exemplary embodiments, a method for charging a toner used in an imaging device may include determining one or more periods of inactivity of the imaging device, and charging the toner to a predetermined level based on the determined period of inactivity.  \n5. In various exemplary embodiments, a method for charging toner used in an imaging device may include determining one or more periods of inactivity of the imaging device, measuring a toner charge level when the printing machine is recovered from the inactivity, and charging the toner to a predetermined level based on a difference between the measured charge of toner and a predetermined level.  \n6.

The invention is a novel electron multiplier designed for use in photomultiplier tubes and particle detectors, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates.\n2. The foil electron multiplier uses a series of thin foils in an evacuated enclosure to multiply electrons in a series of transmission stages.\n3. Foils are arranged collinearly, with voltage applied to each foil to accelerate electrons emitted from the back of one foil to an energy level that effectively transmits the electrons through the next foil in the series.\n4. Foil electron multipliers are defined as having N foils and a resistor divider between each foil with an applied voltage V APP, for N&gt;1, such that the potential between individual stages is V S =V APP /(N\u22121).\n5. Foil electron multipliers are used in photomultiplier devices, where an incident particle can be directed into an electronic amplifier, whereupon the amplified pulse can be measured using detection electronics.\n6. Foil electron multipliers are also used as detectors in particle detectors, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates.\n7. Foil electron multipliers have a mean gain of G N =T I T G \u03b3 I [T SE T G \u03b3 SE +1] N\u22121, where T I is the probability of incident particle transmission through the first foil, T G is the transmission through a single stage, T SE is the probability of secondary electron generation at the exit surface of a foil, and \u03b3 SE is the secondary electron emission yield.\n8. Foil electron multipliers have a gain advantage over conventional multipliers due to the secondary electron yield from the rear surface of a foil, which is greater than that from the same surface that an incident electron impacts.\n9. Ion feedback in electron multipliers is limited primarily to continuous multipliers, where ions generated by electron avalanches are typically absorbed in the dynode material and cannot contribute to further gain in the multiplier.\n10. Foil electron multipliers do not experience ion feedback, as ions generated at the input surface of a particular stage are accelerated toward the previous stage, but cannot penetrate the foil.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 20}}

{"idx": 369, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary>\n\n1. High-dielectric oxide materials, such as Pb/Bi-containing oxides, are convenient because of their low annealing temperatures and desirable properties in small grains. Pb and Bi are very reactive and diffuse into metals, leading to the formation of a low dielectric constant layer on Si. The integration of ferroelectrics and other large dielectric constant materials directly on Si is degraded by the formation of the low dielectric constant SiO2 layer (on metal). The diffusion of Pb or bismuth from ferroelectrics into an adjacent metal can be controlled by a thin layer of SrTiO3 or other stable ferroelectric.\n\n2. A Ge buffer layer on Si oxidizes less readily and can be used to prevent or minimize the formation of the low dielectric constant layer. An epitaxial Ge layer on Si provides a good buffer layer which is compatible with Si and also many oxides. Unlike other buffer layers, Ge is a semiconductor (it can also be doped to provide a reasonably highly conductive layer) and is compatible with Si process technology. The epitaxial growth of Ge on top of the ferroelectric or high-dielectric constant oxide is also much easier than Si which makes it possible to form three-dimensional epitaxial structures.\n\n3. The integration of oxides on GaAs is even harder than Si because the GaAs is unstable in O2 at normal growth temperatures. An epitaxial Ge and non-Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric material buffer layers solve this problem and simplify the integration of Pb/Bi-containing ferroelectrics on GaAs for the same applications as listed above.\n\n4. This method for fabricating a structure useful in semiconductor circuitry. The method comprises: growing a buffer layer of non-Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric constant oxide layer directly or indirectly on a semiconductor substrate; and depositing a Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric constant oxide on the buffer layer.\n\n5. Preferably a germanium layer is epitaxially gown on the semiconductor substrate and the buffer layer is grown on the germanium layer. The non-Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric constant oxide layer is preferably less than about 10 nm thick.\n\n6. A second non-Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric constant oxide layer may be grown on top of the Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric constant oxide and a conducting layer may also be grown on the second non-Pb/Bi", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 30}}

Generally, each such detector has a preferred operating axis either vertical or horizontal and will sense the component of motion occurring along an axis parallel to its operating axis. Thus, three orthogonally positioned detectors, one vertical and two horizontal, are needed to fully sense all components of seismic motion. Depending upon the nature of the geological investigation being undertaken, as few as one detector may be used. Means must be provided to align the vertically and horizontally operating detectors, where used, parallel and perpendicular to the vertical, respectively, for operation. Because of the nature of their remote operation, OBS&#39;s require self-leveling means for their seismic detectors.  \n3. The invention also comprises a method and apparatus for automatically leveling seismic motion detectors, when employed as the pendulum weight, for proper operation. The pendulum weight is suspended at the end of a shaft protruding from a ball rotating in an annular seat to form a free moving pendulum. A spring loaded plunger, positioned above the ball, is restrained from contact with its surface by a pin which passes perpendicularly through the plunger and is connected to a linearly acting solenoid. After the seismometer has been positioned for operation, the solenoid is activated by appropriate means causing the pin to be pulled from the plunger which, under the force of its spring, extends to contact the surface of the ball locking it, the shaft and detector(s) in their positions.  \n4.

Our invention contemplates a helmet liner in which a plurality of layers, each of which consists of an elastic thermoplastic sheet formed with an array of pockets, are arranged in superposed contacting relationship with one another, with the pockets being open and unfilled to allow their deformation in response to compressive contact with an adjacent layer.  \n2. The liner is fitted to an individual wearer's head by heating the sheets to a plastic state, placing the liner between an outer fixture and the wearer's head to deform the sheets to the proper extent, and removing the liner from the wearer's head when the liner has cooled to a rigid, nonplastic state.  \n3. By leaving the liner pockets open and unfilled rather than filling them with relatively imcompressible spacer elements, we are able to provide a helmet liner which, while sufficiently rigid to provide the necessary spacing between the outer shell and the wearer's head, is nevertheless compliant enough to smooth out the effects of relative layer alignment.  \n4. The pockets of a given layer do not have to be maintained in register with the spaces between the pockets of an adjacent layer, and the manufacturing process can be therefore greatly simplified.  \n5. Because of the increased bulk compliance of the assembled liner, our liner also conforms more readily to the contours of the wearer's head, minimizing the tendency for the outer helmet to shift in position.  \n6. By having the liner pockets open and unfilled, we are able to eliminate the drawstrings used in the previous liner to maintain the liner in tension during size adjustment.  \n7. Our liner, by contrast, need merely be maintained in compression during the fitting procedure to deform the layers to the proper extent.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21}}

The fused assembly is then cut into relatively thin wafers, and the interstices formed between the fused layers of rods and the cylindrical members form a plurality of angularly disposed passageways. The thickness of the wafer is determined by the effective aperture of the interstices and is sufficient to impart to the fluid passing through the interstices a directional component parallel to the angular displacement of the rods with respect to the common axis of the structure. The invention also includes a flat multiorifice spray plate for a fuel injector valve in which the fuel passing through the spray plate is ejected at an angle which is a function of orifices distance from the center of the structure. The method for making the multiorifice structure comprises fusing concentric layers of alternating cylindrical members and angularly disposed rods into an integral assembly, and slicing such integral assembly in a direction normal to the axis of said cylindrical members to produce a plurality of multiorifice structures wherein the interstices between said rods and cylinders form a plurality of angularly disposed passageways.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 3, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 12}}

{"idx": 403, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Surface Transportation Programs: Challenges and Opportunities</summary>\n\nSurface transportation programs have not effectively addressed the nation's transportation challenges, including congestion and growing freight demand. The current surface transportation programs are agglomeration programs that have been established over half a century without a well-defined vision of the national interest and federal role. Many surface transportation programs are not linked to performance of the transportation system or grantees, as most highway, transit, and safety funds are distributed through formulas that only indirectly relate to needs and may have no relationship to performance. The programs often do not use the best tools or best approaches, such as using more rigorous economic analysis to select projects. Finally, the fiscal sustainability of the numerous highway, transit, and safety programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund is in doubt, as a result of increased spending from the fund without commensurate increases in revenues. Since the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 funded the modern federal highway program, the federal role in surface transportation has expanded to include broader goals, more programs, and a variety of program structures. While some of these goals have led to new grant programs in areas such as transit, highway safety, and motor carrier safety, others have led to additional procedural requirements for receiving federal aid, such as environmental review and transportation planning requirements. This expansion has also created a variety of grant structures and federal approaches for establishing priorities and distributing federal funds. Most highway infrastructure funds continue to be distributed to states in accordance with individual grant program formulas and eligibility requirements. However, broad program goals, eligibility requirements, and authority to transfer funds between highway programs give state and local governments broad discretion to allocate highway infrastructure funds according to their priorities. Although some transit formula grant programs also give grantees considerable discretion to allocate funds, a portion of transit assistance requires grantees to compete for funding based on specific criteria and goals. Similarly, basic safety formula grant programs are augmented by smaller programs that directly target federal funds to specific goals and actions using financial incentives and penalty provisions. We have found that many federal surface transportation programs are not effective at addressing key transportation challenges, such as increasing congestion and growing freight demand, because federal goals and roles are unclear, and many programs lack links to needs or performance. The goals of federal surface transportation programs are numerous and sometimes conflicting, which contributes to a corresponding lack of clarity in the federal role. For example, despite statutes and regulations that call for an intermodal approach (one that creates connections across modes), only one federal program is specifically directed at intermodal infrastructure.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 8}}

The contractor team of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Helicopter Company were expected to design a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing the primary missions of armed reconnaissance and attack. Critical to achieving these capabilities are the successful development of advanced technologies, including composite materials, advanced avionics and propulsion systems, and sophisticated software and hardware. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals in order to realize significantly lower operating and support costs predicted for this program and achieve a wartime operational availability for the Comanche of 6 hours per day. In December 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program as part of efforts to meet budgetary constraints. The Secretary's restructure decision reduced funding for the program from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. In addition to extending the development phase by 3 years, it also called for two flyable prototypes to be produced and the Comanche production decision to be deferred. In response to the Secretary's decision, the Army proposed a program restructure that would allow it to acquire, within the Secretary's funding constraint, six aircraft in addition to the two prototypes by deferring developmental efforts to fiscal year 2002 and beyond. DOD approved the proposal in March 1995. The Army's restructuring of the Comanche program continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required and of higher program costs. According to DOD's April 1990 guidelines for determining degrees of concurrency, a program with high concurrency typically proceeds into low-rate initial production before significant initial operational test and evaluation is completed. Regarding the need to keep concurrency low, the guidelines note that establishing programs with no concurrency, or a low degree of concurrency, avoids the risks that (1) production items have to be retrofitted to make them work properly and (2) system design will not be thoroughly tested. As we recently reported, aircraft systems, including the T-45A and C-17, that entered low-rate initial production before successfully completing initial operational testing and evaluation experienced significant and sometimes costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance.

It highlights that Medicare payments for ambulance services are made up of two components: a service-level payment for the type of transport provided and a mileage payment. Providers may be affiliated with an institution (such as a hospital or a fire department) and share resources and operational costs, or they may be independent and freestanding. In addition, providers may be for-profit, nonprofit, or government-based. Providers may rely heavily on volunteers, use both volunteers and paid staff, or use only paid staff. Providers may specialize in nonemergency transports, or offer both nonemergency and emergency (those responding to a 911 call) transports. Also, some providers offer only basic life support (BLS) services, while others offer advanced life support (ALS) services. Revenue sources depend on the resources available in communities and communities' choices about funding ambulance services. They may include community tax support, charitable donations, in-kind contributions, state and federal grants, subscription programs, and payments from Medicare or Medicaid and private health insurance companies (including patient copayments or coinsurance). The mix and amount of revenues available may vary. Communities differ by the level of tax support for specific services, such as ensuring a minimum level of service in remote areas, sophistication of transport vehicles, and the training level of the staff. Medicare pays ambulance providers through a national fee schedule. (See fig. 5 in app. I for an overview of the Medicare ambulance payment formula.)

The electricity industry, as shown in the source document, is composed of four distinct functions: generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations. Once electricity is generated, it is generally sent through high-voltage, high-capacity transmission lines to local electricity distributors. Once there, it is transformed into a lower voltage and sent through local distribution lines for consumption by industrial plants, businesses, and residential consumers. Because electric energy is generated and consumed almost instantaneously, the operation of the electricity network requires that a system operator constantly balance the generation and consumption of power.\n2. Utilities and others own and operate electricity assets, which may include generation plants, transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations. Utilities may be owned by investors, municipalities, and individuals (as in cooperative utilities). System operators\u2014sometimes affiliated with a particular utility or independent and responsible for multiple utility areas\u2014manage the electricity flows. These system operators manage and control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power using control systems\u2014IT- and network-based systems that monitor and control sensitive processes and physical functions, including opening and closing circuit breakers.\n3. The effective functioning of the electricity industry is highly dependent on these control systems. However, for many years, aspects of the electricity network lacked technologies such as sensors to allow system operators to monitor how much electricity was flowing on distribution lines.\n4. The electricity industry has taken steps to update the electricity grid\u2014the transmission and distribution systems\u2014by integrating new technologies and additional IT systems and networks. Though utilities have regularly taken such steps in the past, industry and government stakeholders have begun to articulate a broader, more integrated vision for transforming the electricity grid into one that is more reliable and efficient; facilitates alternative forms of generation, including renewable energy; and gives consumers real-time information about fluctuating energy costs.

The smart grid is an ongoing process, and initiatives have commonly involved installing advanced metering infrastructure (smart meters) on homes and commercial buildings that enable two-way communication between the utility and customer. Other initiatives include adding \"smart\" components to provide the system operator with more detailed data on the conditions of the transmission and distribution systems and better tools to observe the overall condition of the grid (referred to as \"wide-area situational awareness\").\n6.

This development will lead to significant changes in the ratio of the working age population to the population age 65 or older. The aged dependency ratio will rise, from 21% in 2000 to 35% by 2030, due to the growing numbers of older persons and the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers.\n2. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is not only occurring because of the growing numbers of older persons but also due to the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers over the last decade. Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives to work longer. Social Security provides monthly benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers and their dependents, and to survivors of insured workers. These benefits are the primary source of income (more than 50% of the population age 65 and older) for nearly 57% of the population age 65 and older.\n3.

With growing caseloads over the past decade, the systems' ability to keep pace with the needs of troubled children and their families has been greatly taxed. From fiscal year 1984 through 1995, the foster care population grew from an estimated 276,000 children to 494,000. In 1995, about 261,000 of these children were supported by federal funds through title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The federal government plays an important role in financing foster care and establishes minimum procedural requirements for the placement process. As required by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-272), states must make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes. Once a child is removed from the home, the state must also provide services to the family and the child with the goal of reuniting them. If reunification is not possible, the state is to find permanent placement for the child outside the family home. To guide the permanency planning process by which a state is to find permanent placements for foster children, the act also requires that the state develop a case plan for each child. Each case plan must be reviewed at least every 6 months and, within 18 months, a permanency hearing must be held to determine the future status of the child. If a final decision is not made at this hearing, federal law provides that additional hearings must be held at least every 12 months. Options for the child's future status can include, but are not limited to, reuniting the child with his or her family, placing the child for adoption, continuing temporary foster care, or continuing foster care permanently or long term because of the child's special needs or circumstances. Increasingly, children are being placed with their own relatives, who then may sometimes receive foster care subsidies. The prolonged stays of children in foster care have prompted 26 states to enact laws or policies to shorten to less than the federally allowed 18 months the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing.

The administration's proposed changes for funding FAA, such as establishing direct user charges for commercial aviation and substantially increasing fuel taxes for general aviation, are intended to link FAA's revenues more closely with its costs. For other elements of FAA's budget, however, it is not possible to establish a direct link between revenues and costs. For example, because AIP expenditures are not the direct result of costs imposed by users of the NAS, the proposal to fund AIP through equal fuel taxes on all aircraft operators can best be evaluated on equity grounds.

Financial transactions could be delayed, flights grounded, power lost, and national defense affected. Moreover, America's infrastructures are a complex array of public and private enterprises with many interdependencies at all levels. These interdependencies among governments and within key economic sectors could cause a single failure to have adverse repercussions. Key economic sectors that could be seriously affected if their systems are not Year 2000 compliant include information and telecommunications; banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; power and water; and manufacturing and small business. The information and telecommunications sector is especially important. In testimony in June, we reported that the Year 2000 readiness of the telecommunications sector is one of the most crucial concerns to our nation because telecommunications are critical to the operations of nearly every public-sector and private-sector organization. For example, the information and telecommunications sector (1) enables the electronic transfer of funds, the distribution of electrical power, and the control of gas and oil pipeline systems, (2) is essential to the service economy, manufacturing, and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods, and (3) is basic to responsive emergency services. Reliable telecommunications services are made possible by a complex web of highly interconnected networks supported by national and local carriers and service providers, equipment manufacturers and suppliers, and customers.

The survey of large sponsors of DB pension plans revealed that they have made revisions to their benefit offerings over approximately the last 10 years or so. Respondents reported that they modified benefit formulas, converted some plans to hybrid plans, or froze some plans. For example, 81 percent of responding sponsors reported that they modified the formulas of one or more of their DB plans. Respondents were asked to report changes for plans or benefits that covered only nonbargaining employees, as well as to report on plans or benefits that covered bargaining unit employees. Fifty-eight percent of respondents who reported on plans for collective- bargaining employees indicated they had generally increased the generosity of their DB plan formulas between January 1997 and the time of their response (see app. I, slide 12). In contrast, 48 percent of respondents reporting on plans for their nonbargaining employees had generally decreased the generosity of their DB plan formulas since 1997. \"Unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements\" was the key reason cited for having changed the benefit formulas of plans covering nonbargaining employees (see app. I, slide 14). \"Global or domestic competitive pressures\" in their industry was the key reason cited for the changes to the plans covering collectively bargained employees (see app. I, slide 13). With regard to plans for bargaining employees, however, a number of the sponsors who offered reasons for changes to bargaining unit plans also volunteered an additional reason for having modified their plans covering bargaining employees. Specifically, these sponsors wrote that inflation or a cost-of- living adjustment was a key reason for their increase to the formula. This suggests that such plans were flat-benefit plans that may have a benefit structure that was increased annually as part of a bargaining agreement. Meanwhile, sponsors were far more likely to report that they had converted a DB plan covering nonbargaining unit employees to a hybrid plan design than to have converted DB plans covering collectively bargained employees. For example, 52 percent of respondents who reported on plans for nonbargaining unit employees had converted one or more of their traditional plans to a cash balance or other hybrid arrangement (see app. I, slide 15). Many cited \u201ctrends in employee demographics\u201d as the top reason for doing so (see app. I, slide 16).

{"idx": 474, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Medicare's Role in Assisting Elderly and Disabled Beneficiaries</summary>\n\nMedicare is a federal health insurance program designed to assist elderly and disabled beneficiaries. It covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and certain home health services. Medicare also covers physician and outpatient hospital services, laboratory and other services, and claims are paid by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers. The intermediaries process claims from hospitals and other institutional providers under part A while carriers process part B claims. The intermediaries' and carriers' responsibilities include reviewing and paying claims, maintaining program safeguards to prevent inappropriate payment, and educating and responding to provider and beneficiary concerns. Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from that of most federal programs. Most federal agencies, under the Competition in Contracting Act and its implementing regulations known as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), generally may contract with any qualified entity for any authorized purpose so long as that entity is not debarred from government contracting and the contract is not for what is essentially a government function. Agencies are to use contractors that have a track record of successful past performance or that demonstrate a current superior ability to perform. The FAR generally requires agencies to conduct full and open competition for contracts and allows contractors to earn profits. Medicare, however, is authorized to deviate from the FAR under provisions of the Social Security Act enacted in 1965. For example, there is no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts. Rather, intermediaries are selected in a process called nomination by provider associations, such as the American Hospital Association. When one of the local Blue plans declines to renew its subcontract, the Association nominates the replacement contractor. Carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers, and the number of such companies seeking Medicare claims-processing work has been dwindling in recent years. The Social Security Act also generally calls for the use of cost-based reimbursement contracts under which contractors are reimbursed for necessary and proper costs of carrying out Medicare activities but does not expressly provide for profit. Further, Medicare contractors cannot be terminated from the program unless they are first provided with an opportunity for a public hearing\u2013\u2013a process not afforded under the FAR. Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms. Freeing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities able to perform needed tasks would enable Medicare to benefit from efficiency and performance improvements related to competition.

{"idx": 483, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Federal agencies face ongoing challenges in protecting privacy and ensuring consistent implementation of privacy protections across their programs and activities. Key challenges include the need for comprehensive guidance on the protection of personal information within the context of the information sharing environment, as well as the ongoing efforts to address privacy issues while developing and implementing new technologies. The Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee, have been widely adopted as a standard benchmark for evaluating the adequacy of privacy protections. The E-Government Act of 2002 aims to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems and information collections by requiring agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA). The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies' collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act defines \"system of records\" as a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public by a \"system-of-records notice\": that is, a notice in the Federal Register identifying, among other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is collected, the intended \"routine\" uses of data, and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct personal information. The act also requires agencies to define and limit themselves to specific predefined purposes. For example, the act requires that to the greatest extent practicable, personal information should be collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an individual\u2019s rights or benefits under a federal program. The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee; these principles were intended to address what the committee termed a poor level of protection afforded to privacy under contemporary law. Since that time, the Fair Information Practices have been widely adopted as a standard benchmark for evaluating the adequacy of privacy protections. The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems and information collections by requiring that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA). A PIA is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system. More specifically, according to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance,", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 4}}

Social Security is one of the largest federal programs in the United States, providing about $546 billion in benefits in 2006 to over 49 million beneficiaries.\n2. Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) pays monthly cash benefits to nearly 7 million workers who, due to a severe long-term disability, can no longer remain in the workforce.\n3. Social Security provides benefits to over 11 million dependents, including payments to widows and widowers as well as surviving parents and children under Survivors\u2019 Insurance (SI), plus benefits to dependent spouses and children of retired and disabled workers paid from the Old Age Insurance (or Old Age) and DI trust funds.\n4. Social Security benefits often represent a significant source of income for their recipients, providing an average of $1,051 a month (as of July 2007) to retired workers, $995 a month to widows and widowers, and $979 a month to disabled workers.\n5. Although disabled workers and dependents receive slightly lower average monthly benefits than retired workers, benefits could be particularly important to these individuals.\n6. These beneficiaries may face considerable hardships; for example, a disabling condition may make work and other activities of daily living more difficult.\n7. As a result, these beneficiaries may have financial difficulties planning and preparing for death or disability in the way one might plan for retirement.\n8. Social Security was never intended to provide an adequate income by itself, but instead serves as an income base on which to build.\n9. In fact, the Social Security program balances the goals of income adequacy with individual equity, i.e., that lower income beneficiaries should receive higher benefits relative to wages than higher income beneficiaries (adequacy), and beneficiaries with higher lifetime income receive higher benefits in accordance with their income/lifetime contributions (equity).", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 18}}

To identify emerging drug use problems, researchers and government agencies look for changing patterns in drug use, some of which may signal the onset of an epidemic. Primary among these patterns are the use of a new illicit drug; a change in how a drug is taken, such as smoking rather than inhaling or \"snorting\"\u2014\"crack\" use; a change in the level of use of an existing drug among populations that routinely abuse drugs; and the use of a new population group or in a different geographic area. Some experts argue that national drug epidemics are rare, and many agree that local areas more frequently experience emerging drug crises or epidemics before they spread. Many federal agencies fund activities and programs that implement the nation's drug control strategy (see app. II). According to ONDCP, about 25 percent of federal drug control resources are for grants-in-aid or other forms of assistance provided to state and local governments and private entities, which commingle such funds with resources from other sources. In fiscal year 1997, federal funding for drug control efforts was over $15 billion, and the fiscal year 1998 request was for $16 billion. The President has requested about $17 billion in funding for fiscal year 1999. About two-thirds of federal drug control funds are channeled into efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs; the remaining one-third supports efforts to reduce drug demand.

In fiscal year 1999, DOD's annual appropriations included about $16 billion for health care, of which over $1 billion funded the care of seniors. In the mid-1990s, DOD implemented the TRICARE framework for military health care in response to rapidly rising costs and beneficiary concerns about access to military care. Its goals were to improve beneficiary access and quality while containing costs. TRICARE provides care through over 600 MTFs and a network of civilian providers managed by outside contractors. TRICARE offers three options: TRICARE Prime, a managed care option; TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider option; and TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service option. TRICARE covers inpatient services, outpatient services such as physician visits and lab tests, and skilled nursing facility and other post-acute care. TRICARE also covers prescription drugs, which are available at MTFs, through DOD\u2019s national mail order pharmacy (NMOP), and at civilian pharmacies. Medicare is a federally financed health insurance program that covers health care expenses of the elderly, some people with disabilities, and people with end-stage kidney disease. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees. Medicare enrollees receive part A benefits and are eligible for optional part B benefits if they pay a monthly premium. Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries choose their own providers, and Medicare reimburses those providers on a fee-for-service basis. Beneficiaries who receive care through traditional Medicare are responsible for paying a share of the costs for services. Most beneficiaries have supplemental coverage that pays for many of the costs not covered by Medicare. Major sources of this coverage include employer-sponsored health insurance, \u201cMedigap\u201d policies sold by private insurers to individuals, and state Medicaid programs. Beneficiaries have an alternative to traditional Medicare, the Medicare+Choice option. Medicare+Choice allows beneficiaries to enroll in private managed care plans and other types of health plans. Managed care plans provide all traditional Medicare benefits and typically offer additional benefits, such as prescription drug coverage.

However, historically, DOD has experienced problems in bringing technologies out of the lab environment and into real use. At times, technologies do not leave the lab because their potential has not been adequately demonstrated or recognized. In other cases, acquisition programs that receive the bulk of DOD's funding in research, development, testing, and evaluation of technology are unwilling to fund final stages of development of promising technologies, preferring to invest in other aspects of the program that are viewed as more vital to success. Other times, they choose to develop the technologies themselves, rather than rely on DOD labs to do so. <summary>2. The Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, for example, was initiated by DOD in 1994 as a way to get technologies that meet critical military needs into the hands of users faster and at less cost than the traditional acquisition process. Under this program, military operators test prototypes that have already been developed and matured in realistic settings. If they find the items to have military utility, DOD may choose to buy additional quantities or just use the remaining items after the demonstration. In 1980, DOD established the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program to identify, evaluate, and procure technologies that have already been developed and tested in other countries\u2014saving DOD the costly burden of maturing the technology itself.

Current federal law permits prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, color, religion, or national origin when engaging in a federally protected activity. On October 28, 2009, the President signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law.

In addition, the law broadens the circumstances under which the federal government would assert jurisdiction to prosecute such crimes. In light of the United States Supreme Court decision in United States v. Morrison, there are questions as to what underlying authority Congress may utilize to expand the scope of hate crimes to cover violence based on gender, sexual orientation, gender-identity, and/or disability. The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14 th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13 th and 15 th Amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing Congress's authority to proscribe hate crimes and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation.

Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, although the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress may regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce (i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce).

After an exemption of $45,000 for joint returns and $33,750 for single returns, the first $175,000 is taxed at 26%, and the remainder is taxed at 28%. Exemptions are phased out. The individual compares AMT liability to regular tax liability and pays the higher one. While the AMT base is broader than the regular tax base, there are many provisions that are not included in its base, notably the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds, and the itemized deduction for home mortgage interest. Indeed, the elimination of the capital gains exclusion in 1986 caused a significant contraction in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT; the current rate preferences are not part of the AMT. Credits are automatically included in the base (i.e., effectively disallowed), although under provisions adopted as part of H.R. 1836 , this rule does not apply to the most important credit, the child credit. (1) However, unlike the rest of the income tax, the AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation. The result has been an increase in the number of taxpayers who are covered by the AMT.

This number was below the 4/10 of a percent of returns that paid the tax in 1984 and fell largely because the deduction for capital gains was eliminated by the 1986 tax act and therefore automatically affected coverage under the AMT. Inflation, however, took its toll. By 1999, the AMT covered 823,000 returns, constituting 6/10 of a percent of all returns filed, an increase in percentage share of 600% between 1987 and 1999.

It includes a variety of transmission and distribution system network structures (electricity, oil, and natural gas), an array of operating models (public and private), and a variety of hardware and software.\n7. The energy sector consists of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically. Thus, interdependency within the sector and across the nation's critical energy infrastructure sectors is significant.\n8. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the virtually borderless nature of energy use and the reliance on predominantly privately-owned infrastructure.\n9. Key challenges and opportunities facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure (transmission, storage, distribution, and generation); modernizing and securing communication networks (e.g., analog to digital); accommodating new end-use technologies (for solar and other distributed resources); planning for increased interdependencies of natural gas, water, and electricity systems; and devising business models to manage the challenges while providing reliable and affordable electricity.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 36}}

The CRAF program is voluntary and is not funded by the government. It is a symbiotic relationship between the Department of Defense and the U.S. airline industry, with the government providing financial incentives to encourage participation.\n3. The CRAF program is divided into three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment includes long-range and short-range international passenger and cargo aircraft, while the national segment includes domestic and Alaskan sections. The CRAF participants must commit at least 30% of their CRAF-capable passenger and cargo fleets, and 15% of their CRAF-capable aircraft. Aircraft committed must be U.S. registered and must maintain four complete crews for each aircraft in CRAF. Air Mobility Command (AMC) analysts implement a number of surveillance initiatives to monitor the carrier's safety record, operations and maintenance status, contract performance, financial condition, and management initiatives, summarizing significant trends in a comprehensive review every six months. These initiatives are supplemented by an open flow of information on all contract carriers between AMC and the FAA through established liaison officers. The CRAF has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into the long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into the domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the aircraft performance characteristics needed. The long-range international section consists commercial airliners capable of transoceanic operations. Medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft make up the short-range international section supporting near offshore airlift requirements. The aircraft in the Alaskan section provide airlift within U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility, specific to Alaska needs.

Damage or destruction by terrorist attack could disrupt the delivery of vital human services in this country, threatening public health and the environment, or possibly causing loss of life. Further, since most water infrastructure is government-owned, it may serve as a symbolic and political target for some.

Mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local government employees would eventually eliminate the need for the WEP and GPO provisions of Social Security law, which are unpopular among the public and present administrative difficulties for SSA.\n2. Some state and local government pension plans could be affected if newly hired state and local government employees were required to participate in Social Security.\n3. The basic options for state and local governments include maintaining the current pension structure for newly hired employees; providing a different, presumably lower benefit structure for newly hired employees within an existing pension plan; closing the existing pension plan to new participants and creating a new pension plan for newly hired employees with a different, presumably lower benefit structure; or eliminating pension benefits (apart from Social Security) for new hires.\n4. Most state and local government workers currently participate in defined benefit (DB) pension plans. In DB pension plans, participants are guaranteed a monthly benefit in retirement that is determined using a formula based on an accrual rate, years of service, and the average of a number of years' final salary.\n5. Some of the changes that states and localities might consider include lowering the accrual rate for covered workers, increasing the number of high or final years of salary in the benefit formula, altering early retirement benefits, or creating defined contribution pensions.\n6. For example, one survey indicated that in 1997 the accrual rate for DB pensions provided to state and local government workers who were participating in Social Security at the time of the survey was 1.84%, compared with an accrual rate of 2.24% for workers who were not participating in Social Security. In some cases, state and local government employers might \"freeze\" their pension plans in which new hires or current employees do not accrue benefits.\n7. Increased costs might come as a result of states operating several pension plans or several benefit structures within a single pension plan. For example, states could decide to offer some combination of DB and DC pension benefits. It could take several years to determine and fully implement the changes. Whether overall costs to employees and governments would increase, decrease, or remain the same depends on the type of pension benefit structure governments adopt in response to mandatory participation in Social Security.\n8. Factors that would affect this include the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax paid by employers, the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax paid by employees, the amount of employer contributions to retirement plans, and the amount of employee contributions, if any, to retirement plans", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8, "n_sentences_per_point": 1, "n_sentences_total": 8}}

Although the clinical diagnosis of PD is often straightforward and robust in cases with typical cardinal symptoms and characteristic signs, the correct diagnosis can be challenging, especially in clinically mild or uncertain cases. Molecular imaging techniques using PET or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have offered various tests that can improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands 24 and the sympathetic innervation of the heart 1,5 have become very popular and are widely used in clinical practice. For example, imaging of DAT binding with [I]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-n-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) successfully visualizes the presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract. DAT spect abnormalities can help to support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism. Meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy in PD patients with decreased cardiac MIBG uptake compared to other PD patients with normal cardiac MIBG uptake in mibg uptake is used to assess sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals. The brain spect scans were acquired according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Procedure Guidelines for Brain Neurotransmission Spect using [I]-labeled DAT ligands (FP-CIT, Datscan; Nihon Medphys, Tokyo, Japan) after an injection of 167 mbq of Datscan.

Vegf, a primary stimulant for tumor angiogenesis, is a critical target for cancer therapy, and its inhibition is attractive.\n4. Anti-angiogenic treatments should not be designed to attack directly the cancer cells, but rather to interfere with the tumor's ability to grow and metastasize.\n5.

The technique has been FDA-approved since 2001 for grade 24 VUR in single systems with no accompanying urological malformations in children above one year of age. The technique has been popularized with surgeons and parents alike. Reports of expanded use to patients of all ages and grades of VUR even in the presence of duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies are published worldwide. In a statement from the American Urological Association, it was determined that endoscopic injection of DX/HA is an option in the management of pediatric VUR. The initial success rate was quoted as 68% and is still mentioned on the current website. The original subureteric injection technique (STING) has evolved to the intraureteric injection technique introduced by the Atlanta group using hydrodistention-implantation technique (HIT). The authors reported success rates of 89% for intraureteric injection. However, the reported worldwide success rates differ considerably (55%89% [7,8]). The radiographic success rate for patients and renal units after the first injection was 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection. Although the success rates continuously improve, the numbers of most institutions still differ significantly from the traditional 98% for open reimplants.

Advances in imaging technology and better knowledge of fetal pathology have led to an increasing role for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnostic work-up of prenatal anomalies. The role of MRI as an adjunct to ultrasound for cases diagnosed with ventriculomegaly is discussed, with a focus on the use of the term \"cerebral ventriculomegaly\" when the maximal diameter of the lateral ventricles exceeds 10 mm. The prevalence of ventriculomegaly ranges between 0.3 and 1.5, and the severity can be classified as mild (10-12 mm), moderate (12-15 mm), or severe (>15 mm). The use of precise definitions of reference planes and anatomical landmarks is important to avoid inaccurate measurements and facilitate imaging follow-up comparisons. The incidence of additional anomalies ranges from 5% for mild ventriculomegaly to up to 50% for moderate and severe cases. The added value of MRI is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to the impact of fetal motion on image acquisition and its relatively low spatial resolution compared to ultrasound. The interobserver agreement between experts using the same imaging modality is low, with only 60% of cases in a study of levine et al. achieving a consensus on normal and abnormal findings in ultrasound and MRI.

{"idx": 657, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Genetic variation contributes to both disease susceptibility and treatment response. Genome-wide association studies (GWA) have enabled rapid discovery of genetic variants contributing to the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases (Manolio et al., 2010). The driving hope of these major advances in genetic epidemiology is that promotion of personalized medicine will improve medical decision-making. Although use of the term personalized medicine is often limited to the identification of the optimal drug and the optimal dosage for a subgroup of patients, current personalized medicine applications are far more broad, and might include situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients. In prostate cancer, for example, dna biomarker tests may be used to determine whether treatment may be safely delayed for a period of watchful waiting. If the tumor is demonstrated due to lack of genes causing an aggressive form of the cancer, it may remain stable for decades, and the need for radical surgical resection with subsequent radio- or chemotherapy may be obviated (Kroll, 2008). In contrast, in other instances, genetic profiles may be used to determine preventive interventions. This approach is already used for some forms of hereditary cancer, in which individual genetic testing is the basis for deciding upon specific, sometimes very radical interventions such as preventive surgery (Kroll, 2008). Beyond treatment schemes that are applied identically across large subgroups of patients, to which some authors have applied the distinct term stratified medicine (Trusheim et al., 2007). Other personalized medicine applications offer targeted treatment options for individual patients. Anti-inflammatory therapies, for example, such as anti-tnf, anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-1, are thought to be effective in inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease (Bucher et al., 2008). Other molecules seem suitable for use as anti-inflammatory therapy as well. To choose one or a combination of different anti-inflammatory therapies, the physician might first obtain the genetic profile of a patient by sequencing.

{"idx": 658, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Myosin Va (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n- terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain. Myova's directed movement is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in the motor's processive motion as each head takes 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required to activate the atpase activity of myova; however, in the presence of high calcium ( > 1 m), motor processivity is reduced and one or more calmodulin may dissociate from each lever arm. Single myova are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. Myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusion search. The structural domains that are critical to myova's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction. Here, we used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains. In addition, we hypothesized that calmodulin disassociation from the myova lever arm decreases the lever arm's flexural stiffness, thus contributing to the motor's compromised processivity in the presence of calcium. Various myova constructs, listed as follows, were expressed in the baculovirus/SF9 cell system and purified as described previously. These constructs allowed the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains to be defined by TPM. Full-length murine myova (myova-fl) was expressed as was a double-headed short construct (myova-hmm), engineered by truncating the myova-fl heavy chain at residue 1098, followed by a biotin tag and a flag epitope tag at the c-terminus to facilitate purification. Double-headed myova constructs were coexpressed with calcium-insensitive calmodulin (camall) as described previously.

Importantly, the coprecipitation of dye molecules does not necessarily deteriorate the crystallinity of ZnO.\n6. In the case of ZnO / Eosin (Ey) hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed.\n7. The solid Ey can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline such as dilute KOH aqueous solution.\n8. Prepared ZnO thin films, consisting of large single-crystalline grains with internal porous structure, to be called porous ZnO, have large surface area for adsorption of photosensitizer dye in a large amount and high crystallinity for efficient transport of electrons; therefore, it can achieve high incident photon to current conversion efficiency (ipce) of around 90%.\n9. With the dssc application in mind, it would be highly interesting to find a compatible system for fabricating sensitized photocathodes.\n10. Recently, Powar et al. have succeeded in achieving 1.3% conversion efficiency for a dssc in an inverted structure employing a porous p-nio electrode sensitized with a specially designed dye to achieve a high rectification with kinetically reversible co(ii/iii) ethylene diamine complex electrolyte.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 30}}

Lizards from fuenfra and golondrina (northern populations) were characterized by being larger, heavier, and with larger, more robust heads than individuals from aranjuez and belmonte (southern populations).\n5.

The number of femoral pores and blue spots are used in chemical and visual intraspecific communication, respectively (e.g., [37, 39]).\n7.

Pancreatic cancer is a devastatingly lethal disease with the highest mortality and the lowest one-year and five-year relative survival rates in the United States. It is classified by cancer subtypes according to their cell type of origin, structure, and behavior.\n2. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential among pancreatic cancer histopathologic subtypes.\n3. The most dramatic influence on the survival of patients diagnosed with pdac is a surgical resection of the tumor (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation).\n4. The combination of surgery with radiation and chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival compared to surgery alone. The estimated parameters (values of the relative impact of risk factors on the survival of cancer patients) obtained by the cox proportional regression models are largely varied, depending on the quantity and quality of data used, the set of considered variables, and the technical approaches utilized in developing these models.\n5. The obtained estimates depend on the underlying cox models, the credibility of which can be estimated by values of their concordance indexes (c - indexes), which present the probability that for any pair of randomly drawn patients, the patient with the worst outcome estimated by this model dies earlier than one with the better estimated outcome.\n6. The cox proportional hazards regression models for estimation of survival for patients diagnosed with pdac were used for the development of two nomograms. One nomogram estimates the survival for patients who have undergone pancreatectomy of the malignancy and accounts for the following variables (covariates): tumor size, grade, stage, lymph node data, resected tissue amount, weight loss, and pancreatic subsite. The other nomogram predicts the risk of perioperative mortality in pdac patients scheduled to undergo pancreatectomy and accounts for patient demographics (age, gender, race), type of pancreatectomy (distal, radical, and other), hospital characteristics (size, type), as well as co-morbidities in pdac patients (renal failure, neurological disorders, hypothyroid, chronic heart failure, liver disease, uncomplicated hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n7.

Internet addiction can be used for research, seeking information, interpersonal communication, and business transactions. However, it can also be used for indulging in pornography, excessive gaming, chatting for long hours, and even gambling. There have been growing concerns worldwide for what has been labeled as internet addiction. Griffith considered it a subset of behavior addiction and any behavior that meets the 6 core components of addiction, i.e., salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse. Young linked excessive internet use most closely to pathological gambling, a disorder of impulse control in DSM IV and adapted the DSM IV criteria to relate to internet use in the internet addiction test developed by her. According to her, various types of internet addiction are cybersexual addiction, cyberrelationship addiction, net compulsions, information overload, and computer addiction. The prevalence found by Greenfield was about 6% among the general population, while Scherer found it to be 14% among the college-based population. The cross-sectional survey was carried out in 3 different colleges in the city of Mumbai during the period of August. It covered about 1000 college students (aged 16-18 years) having access to the internet from the past 6 months. The semi-structured proforma along with the scales were distributed in classes, each with roughly 40 students, and necessary instructions were given.

The device was electrostatically actuated, and the driving voltage was applied to a side-gate parallel to the resonator.\n3. To reduce parasitic signals, the drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency, thus the amplitude of motion of the resonator was proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.\n4. A bias voltage at (+) through the gauges was used to down-mix their resistance change (occurring at the actuation frequency), and the low-frequency readout signal at  was detected using a lock-in amplifier.\n5. Typical measurement values were 1.5 V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz.\n6. All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature.\n7. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same set-up, with the drive electrode disconnected.\n8.

The resulting superoxide anion (O2-) is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by cellular superoxide dismutases (SODs).\n3. Similar to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, oxidation of protein cysteine residues represents a reversible, posttranslational protein modification that can regulate signaling.\n4. Oxidative modification of cysteine thiol groups (SH) by H2O2 results in formation of sulphenic acid (SOH) which quickly forms disulfide (SS) or sulfenyl amide (SN) bonds, changing protein function.\n5. The cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms in a manner analogous to phosphatases, deubiquitinating enzymes, or histone deacetylases.\n6. Mitochondria and ROS generation are required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia.\n7. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs.\n8. Cellular mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity are increased when mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), or mesenchymal stem cells are induced to differentiate.\n9.

These nerves are mainly concentrated laterally to the prostate and these neural structures are referred to as neurovascular bundles.\n8.

Early theoretical approaches focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or proteins, respectively.\n3. More recent models emphasised inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, with hormonal signals from specialised cells in the gut or associated organs.\n4. The major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, pyy, glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1), cholecystokinin (cck), amylin, and insulin from specialised cells in the gastrointestinal tract or associated organs.\n5. Such models account for the regulation of appetite and contribute to the regulation of body weight, through the identification of specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.\n6. Interest in this type of formulation has strengthened during the period when molecular biology began to take over from integrative physiology as an explanatory approach in biological sciences.\n7. The major task facing any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat, together with intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signalling and tonic inhibition.\n8. An alternative to the molecular approach to appetite control has arisen from the study of energy balance, with the inter-relationships between ee and energy intake.\n9. The new formulation based on psychobiological research and a multi-level system allows for the disclosure of relationships between variables in the domains of body composition, metabolism, gi hormones, food composition, psychological sensations, food behaviour, psychometric traits, nutritional composition, and allelic variation.\n10.

Retroelements use retrotransposition to insert new copies of themselves into genomes, increasing the copy number of the element. Retroviruses and ltr retrotransposons are distinguished by the presence or absence of an envelope gene, which encodes a protein necessary for virus entry. After germ line infection, reverse-transcribed retrovirus genomes can integrate into the host genome and be transmitted through vertical inheritance. Gain or loss of the envelope gene can transform retrotransposons into retroviruses, and vice versa. The second large category of tes, dna transposons, excise from their original insertion site and reintegrate into a new location. Most dna transposons are found on mammalian x chromosomes, suggesting an initial event of molecular domestication on the x, followed by serial local duplication events that subsequently extended this gene family. All mart genes have retained the intronless open reading frame, some of them still encode the ancestral gag zinc finger, suggesting nucleic acid binding properties for the protein. Two autosomal mart genes, peg10 and peg11/rtl1, are subject to genomic imprinting and are expressed from the paternal allele. The epigenetic regulation of these genes has been proposed to be derived from a defence mechanism repressing the activity of the ancestral retrotransposon before domestication. Several genes derived from transposase genes from diverse subfamilies of dna transposons have been described in vertebrates and other organisms. One well-studied example is the recombination activating protein rag1, which together with rag2 catalyzes the v(d)j somatic site-specific recombination responsible for the formation and diversity of genes encoding immunoglobulins and t-cell receptors in jawed vertebrates.

Several studies have shown an independent association of gln27glu polymorphism of 2ar gene number of diseases like obesity, dyslipidemia, myocardial infarction, and diabetes.\n3. The meta-analysis suggests a significant association of gln27glu polymorphism of 2ar with ischemic stroke.\n4. The results are in agreement with earlier published studies.\n5. However, two prospective cohort studies failed to show a significant association of 2ar variant with the incidence of stroke.\n6. A case control study reported by Zhao et al. showed significant allelic association between glu allele of 2ar and risk of ischemic stroke.\n7. The meta-analysis of allelic association including three studies with the risk allele versus protective allele suggested significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke with glu27 allele.\n8. The meta-analysis for genotypic association including two studies also suggested a significant association between gln27glu polymorphism and risk of ischemic stroke under both dominant model and recessive model of inheritance.\n9. Some limitations exist in the present study, which may have affected the results of meta-analysis.\n10. The haplotype analysis was not done which plays a crucial role for association studies of complex diseases.\n11.

Evidence-based practices in healthcare have expanded rapidly over the past fifty years, with a doubling in the number of scientific papers published in the past decade. Studies indicate that 50% of patients do not receive care according to the best scientific evidence and 20% receive care that is not sufficient or harmful. Evidence-based medicine is a new paradigm that attempts to direct clinical services and care toward effective, efficient services with minimal complications and errors. It is a systematic approach for solving clinical problems that allows integration of available best evidence with clinical experience and preferences and values of the patients. This new paradigm may confirm or reject previous acceptable practices or suggest new care methods that are more effective and efficient and less vulnerable. The main challenge today is transferring and translating knowledge that helps physicians make the best clinical decisions based on the best evidence in the minimum time. National evidence-based health care systems ensure that best evidence is generated, stored, used, shared, and finally monitored and evaluated in a systematic process and according to needs of different stakeholders. The ultimate goal of the health care system in every country is maintaining and improving community health. Achieving this goal depends on effectiveness of delivered services and consistency of the services with national and local priorities. The role and importance of evidence-based practice and its remarkable impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical services and healthcare are crucial for national health care systems.
