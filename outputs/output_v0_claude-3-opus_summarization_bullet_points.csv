• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems like chaotic deterministic ratchets are not well understood. The current in these systems depends sensitively on parameters and can reverse direction.
• Mateos conjectured that current reversals are correlated with bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior. Barbi and Salerno argued this is not always valid based on single particle results.
• The authors studied the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet and found it depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble of particles, especially near bifurcation points. Transients must be discarded to get converged results.
• Not all bifurcations lead to current reversals and not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations. However, most current reversals seem to be associated with bifurcations.
• The authors propose a new heuristic rule: bifurcations correspond to sudden changes (spikes or jumps) in the current, which are not necessarily reversals. Current reversals are a special case of this.
• In some cases, apparent current reversals without bifurcations are due to ""hidden"" bifurcations in periodic windows within the chaotic regime. However, there are some exceptions to the heuristic rules proposed.
• Factoring out issues of ensemble size, location, spread and transience is important before searching for general rules relating the current to bifurcations. Ensemble dependence is most critical near certain bifurcation points.
• Open questions remain about making the conditions for the validity of the heuristic rules more concrete. The complicated behavior of these nonlinear non-equilibrium systems makes finding general principles challenging but useful.

* The wide range of eccentricities observed in extrasolar planets, unlike our solar system, has spawned several theories for the origin of highly eccentric planets, including planet-planet scattering, mergers, and interactions with stellar companions via the Kozai mechanism.
* The authors searched for evidence of additional planets in six highly eccentric planetary systems using radial velocity data and dynamical simulations to determine regions where additional planets could remain stable.
* Updated Keplerian orbital solutions are presented for HD 3651b, HD 37605b, HD 80606b, and HD 89744b using combined data from various telescopes.
* Test particle simulations were performed for each system to determine regions where additional low-mass planets could have stable orbits over 106 years.
* No evidence was found for additional planets in the six systems based on the radial velocity data.
* Dynamical simulations showed protected resonance regions where test particles remained stable for some systems, while others had test particles removed out to 1-2 AU from the star.
* Limits on additional planets were computed using the radial velocity data, with the tightest constraints of a few Neptune masses achieved for HD 3651, HD 45350, and 16 Cyg B in regions indicated as stable by the simulations.
* Poor limits were achieved for HD 37605, HD 80606, and HD 89744 due to insufficient phase coverage, short time baselines, and/or high scatter in the radial velocity data.
* The combination of dynamical simulations and observational limits is an effective way to constrain the presence of additional planets in known planetary systems.

* The rare Z-decays Z→Aγ (A→μμ), Z→AAA and Z→AA are studied in the Type-II 2HDM, Lepton-specific 2HDM, NMSSM and nMSSM models, which predict a light CP-odd Higgs boson A.
* In the allowed parameter space, the branching ratios can reach 10^-5 for Z→Aγ, 10^-8 for Z→AAA and 10^-9 for Z→AA, making the first two decays potentially observable at the GigaZ option of the ILC.
* Different models predict different sizes for the branching ratios, so these rare decays can be used to distinguish between the models.
* The decay Z→AA may serve as an alternative channel to test new physics models, especially to distinguish the NMSSM from the nMSSM.
* In the nMSSM, the Higgs boson A may be lighter than 1 GeV without conflicting with low energy data, in which case the largest branching ratio is 10^-8 for Z→Aγ (A→μμ).
* The work considers various theoretical and experimental constraints on the parameter space of the models, such as from perturbativity, unitarity, LEP searches, muon g-2, dark matter relic density, and B-physics observables.

* Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification and the existence of superpartner particles, which should have masses below the TeV range.
* The no-scale type Kahler potential, in which the hidden and observable sectors are separated, leads to vanishing scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings, with gaugino masses being the only source of SUSY breaking. This scenario is predictive and can suppress SUSY contributions to flavor-changing neutral currents.
* Phenomenological aspects of no-scale SUSY models are investigated, considering constraints from direct searches, cosmology, the lightest Higgs boson mass, and the branching ratio of b → sγ. The minimal scenario with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale is severely constrained.
* Non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale and universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale are also considered. The wino-like neutralino and tau sneutrino LSP cases are less constrained, while the higgsino-like neutralino LSP case is more constrained due to the Higgs mass bound.

* The paper analyzes the stability of quasiregular (QR) singularities in the cross-polarized Bell-Szekeres (CPBS) spacetime using test fields.
* Test electromagnetic (EM) fields applied to the CPBS background spacetime show that the QR singularity in the incoming region becomes unstable and transforms into a non-scalar curvature singularity.
* Test scalar fields applied to the CPBS background have a stronger effect, causing the QR singularity to transform into a scalar curvature singularity.
* An exact back-reaction solution representing the collision of cross-polarized EM fields coupled to a scalar field confirms the conjecture's prediction of the singularity nature.
* Test null dusts introduced into the interaction region of the CPBS spacetime also cause the Cauchy horizon to become unstable and transform into a scalar curvature singularity, as predicted by the conjecture.
* The Riemann tensor components in the incoming region vanish in the local frame but are finite in the parallel-propagated orthonormal frame, indicating a QR singularity.
* Explicit expressions for the Weyl and Maxwell scalars in the exact back-reaction solution are provided.
* An alternative interpretation of the metric as colliding EM waves in a de Sitter background shows that the collision creates an unstable horizon.
* The paper concludes that the addition of cross-polarization does not alter the existing singularity properties, and the conjecture correctly predicts the singularity nature in most cases.

* The paper investigates the EPR-steerability of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, called T-states.
* The steering ellipsoid formalism is used to develop a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for projective measurements on T-states, which the authors conjecture is optimal.
* Two sufficient conditions for T-states to be EPR-steerable are obtained via suitable EPR-steering inequalities.
* The three notions of non-locality for quantum states - Bell-nonlocality, EPR-steerability, and non-separability - are discussed in detail.

* The idea of using electron spin to encode binary information was first proposed in the mid-1990s and may have advantages over charge-based devices in terms of lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation.
* A scheme for realizing a classical NAND logic gate using three exchange-coupled electron spins in quantum dots was proposed in 1994.
* A serious problem with the spin-based logic gates is that exchange interaction is bidirectional and cannot ensure unidirectional flow of the logic signal from input to output, leading to metastable states.
* A proposed solution is to use a three-phase clock to propagate the input state through the spin array by lowering two adjacent barriers pairwise at the same time.
* Spin-based irreversible logic gates are still projected to dissipate significant power, so reversible logic gates that are not constrained by the Landauer limit were proposed.
* Spin is the preferred vehicle to encode qubits in solids because spin coherence times are much longer than charge coherence times.
* Optical read out of spin qubits appears more practical than electrical read out since it does not require making contacts to individual quantum dots.

• The global L(H2)/LX-ray ratio in the main shock is >3, confirming that mid-IR H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-ray emission over the shock structures, modifying the traditional view of cooling in the later stages of compact group evolution.
• Infrared ionic lines are interpreted as fast (100-300 km/s) ionizing shocks, and comparison between line intensities implies silicon and iron are depleted onto dust, which is not destroyed in the shock.
• Star formation in SQ is dominated by SQ-A and 7318b-south, located at the ends of the radio shock ridge, while regions dominated by warm H2 emission exhibit very low star formation rates.
• In SQ, projected coexistence of [SiII] and H2 is observed, produced by 200 km/s and 20 km/s velocity shocks respectively, consistent with a model of a multiphase postshock medium.
• The cooling pathway of warm H2 emission observed group-wide in SQ is a significant mechanism in shock systems, potentially crucial in systems ranging from ULIRGs to radio galaxies to supernova remnants.
• To determine the overall dominant cooling mechanism in SQ, an inventory of lines and continuum processes at all wavelengths is required, including contributions from [OI], [CII], and H2O lines.

* The models simulate the evolution of a passive color field to represent isotopes injected either as a single event (e.g. by a supernova) or continuously (e.g. by UV photodissociation).
* The MGU disks result in rapid inward and outward transport and mixing of the color field, reducing initial heterogeneities to dispersions of ~1-2% for single-shot injection and ~20% for continuous injection.
* The mixing and transport are robust results that are insensitive to the protostar mass, disk mass, injection location, and exact initial conditions.
* MGU disk phases may explain the homogeneity of short-lived radionuclide ratios and heterogeneity of stable oxygen isotope ratios in the early solar system, as well as the presence of refractory grains in comets.

* Cosmological models where dark matter and dark energy interact with each other can alleviate the coincidence problem of why their current values are so similar.
* An interaction between dark matter and dark energy affects the expansion history, growth of structure, CMB anisotropies, and evolution of gravitational potential. Observations can constrain this interaction.
* Phenomenological fluid and scalar field approaches are used to describe the dark energy and dark matter interaction. The interaction is expected based on general considerations like the holographic principle.
* The interaction influences the background dynamics and can solve the coincidence problem while satisfying the second law of thermodynamics.
* The interaction modifies the evolution of matter density perturbations, the non-linear evolution, and the collapse of density perturbations.
* Main observables used to constrain the interaction include CMB, supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and redshift space distortions. Current data is compatible with an interaction but not yet significant.

• An identity is found showing the entanglement is re-distributed among the bipartite subsystems in an invariant manner, independent of the reservoir details.
• When the qubit frequency is in the photonic band gap of the reservoir, a stable entanglement distribution among all subsystems is achieved due to the formation of bound states between qubits and reservoirs.

• The authors introduce the notion of shower partons and their distributions in order to represent fragmentation functions in terms of parton recombination, which is important when shower partons recombine with soft partons in the environment.
• Shower parton distributions are determined phenomenologically by fitting fragmentation functions, similar to how fragmentation functions are determined by fitting experimental data.
• The authors focus on determining shower parton distributions for light quarks, antiquarks, and gluons fragmenting to pions and kaons by solving integral equations relating the distributions to parameterized fragmentation functions.
• The shower parton distributions obtained have reasonable properties and reproduce the fragmentation functions well in the recombination model.
• The authors illustrate the importance of shower partons by calculating pion production from a quark jet in a thermal parton background, showing that thermal-shower recombination dominates over fragmentation.

• The paper describes a discrete differential geometry scheme for the Dirac-Kähler formulation of fermionic field theory, building upon a proposal by Adams that uses two parallel lattices to maintain locality of the Hodge star operator and wedge product.
• The scheme is extended to describe exact chiral symmetry using the original and dual lattice complexes. Two additional lattice complexes are introduced to enable exact flavor projection.
• Chiral and flavor projection are implemented by carefully defining the projections to operate between and within the duplicate sets of lattice complexes, allowing a single flavor of chiral field to be projected onto each complex.
• The path integral is evaluated for this formulation, considering the effects of chiral and flavor projection. Prior to flavor projection, the form is equivalent to the ""quarter-root trick"" used in lattice QCD.

• Measuring accurate SFRs in active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies is challenging, so studies often use the far-infrared (FIR) emission from dust heated by young stars.
• This study analyzes Herschel Space Observatory FIR data for a sample of 313 nearby AGN selected from the Swift/BAT ultra-hard X-ray survey to investigate the connection between AGN activity and star formation.
• The authors find that Seyfert 2 AGN are detected more often and have slightly higher FIR luminosities than Seyfert 1 AGN, but the effect is small, suggesting AGN orientation does not significantly impact global FIR properties.
• The FIR luminosities are correlated with each other but not with the 14-195 keV X-ray luminosity (a proxy for AGN power), indicating the AGN is not strongly influencing the FIR emission in most cases.
• The FIR colors of the AGN host galaxies are similar to those of high-mass non-AGN galaxies, further suggesting the FIR emission is predominantly from cold dust heated by stars rather than the AGN.
• A small subset of radio-loud AGN have anomalous FIR colors indicative of synchrotron emission from jets rather than thermal dust emission.
• Some AGN show a 500 μm excess emission that correlates with AGN strength indicators but not radio loudness, possibly related to coronal emission from the accretion disk.
• Future work will combine this FIR photometry with archival data to model the SEDs and investigate the starburst-AGN connection and AGN contribution to the FIR in more detail.

• The text focuses on an A4 symmetric model that leads to tri-bimaximal mixing in the leptonic sector. Non-zero θ13 and CP violation can be generated by breaking the A4 symmetry explicitly through higher dimensional mass terms or radiative corrections.
• The authors investigate generating non-zero θ13 through the see-saw mechanism by adding a small perturbation to the Dirac neutrino mass matrix while keeping the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix texture unchanged. They study the effects of the perturbation at different entries of the Dirac mass matrix.
• Detailed phenomenology of neutrino mass and mixing, including CP violation at low energy, neutrinoless double beta decay, and leptogenesis, is studied. The approach is minimal as A4 symmetry is broken explicitly by a single parameter in a single element of the Dirac mass matrix.
• For the complex case, the authors focus on the 13 element perturbation. They find correlations between high and low energy CP violating phases. Observable CP violation and baryon asymmetry can be generated for a right-handed neutrino mass scale of 1013-1014 GeV.

* The normal CCF on a colloid can change sign depending on its BC, distance from the substrate, and temperature, leading to stable or unstable equilibrium configurations.
* The lateral CCF between two colloids is modified by the presence of the substrate compared to the case without a substrate, and can change from repulsive to attractive for colloids with opposite BCs.
* Depending on the BCs, the colloids tend to aggregate either side-by-side to form a monolayer on the substrate, or on top of each other to form 3D clusters.
* The authors determine the many-body contributions to the CCFs by subtracting the pairwise colloid-colloid and colloid-substrate forces from the total force.

* Recent investigations using SDSS and 2dFGRS data have revealed complex relationships between galaxy properties (color, luminosity, surface brightness, concentration) and their environments, with clustering being a function of star formation history and luminosity.
* The authors examine the scale dependence of these relationships and whether large-scale density is related to galaxy properties independent of small-scale density, which has implications for halo model descriptions of galaxy formation.
* The authors use a volume-limited sample of SDSS galaxies out to 145 Mpc/h to study the environments of galaxies as a function of luminosity and color.
* They find the dependence of mean environment on color persists down to at least Mr=-17, extending previous results to lower luminosities.
* At a given color and luminosity, a stronger correlation function amplitude implies a steeper correlation function slope.
* In regions of fixed small-scale (< 1 Mpc/h) density, the large-scale (6 Mpc/h) density does not appear related to the recent star formation history of galaxies, contradicting some previous results.
* The authors attribute the contradictory results to the lower density of tracer galaxies used in the previous study, underscoring the importance of using a sufficiently high tracer density.
* The results are consistent with galaxy star formation being strongly affected only by the masses of their host dark matter halos, encouraging halo model descriptions and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

• Transverse spin fluctuations are important low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, affecting properties like long-range order, order parameter, and Néel temperature.
• A new method is described for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections in terms of magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
• The method is applied to the antiferromagnetic ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model in 2D and 3D, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit in 2D, and low-U impurities in 2D.
• For the pure Hubbard model, the sublattice magnetization interpolates between weak and strong coupling limits, approaching spin-wave theory results as U→∞.
• For spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, the quantum spin-fluctuation correction vs vacancy concentration shows that antiferromagnetic long-range order is destroyed near the percolation threshold.
• For the random-U Hubbard model with low-U impurities, spin fluctuations are suppressed locally at the impurity sites but enhanced on average, with negligible loss of antiferromagnetic order.
• The local enhancement of spin fluctuations at low-U impurities is due to increased magnon amplitude, while the overall suppression is due to stiffening of the low-energy magnon spectrum.
• The small charge gap at impurity sites compresses the magnon spectrum compared to the localized spin picture.
• The RPA method, combined with numerical diagonalization and finite-size scaling, allows for exact treatment of defects and evaluation of their impact on transverse spin fluctuations.

* The existence of dark matter has been established, and the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a promising candidate that can be accommodated by introducing an inert scalar field.
* Neutrinos have been confirmed to have tiny masses compared to the electroweak scale, which may indicate they are Majorana type. The seesaw mechanism and Higgs triplet model (HTM) are simple ways to explain tiny neutrino masses.
* The authors consider an extension of the HTM where the μ parameter that governs neutrino masses is generated at one-loop level and a dark matter candidate appears, by introducing a Z2 parity.
* In the model, lepton number conservation is imposed to forbid the μ-term at tree level, while it is broken by the vev of a Z2-even singlet scalar. A Z2-odd doublet and real singlet scalar are introduced to provide the dark matter candidate.
* The suppression factor for the radiatively generated μ parameter can naturally explain tiny neutrino masses without requiring the triplet scalars to be very heavy. The Yukawa structure is the same as the HTM.
* A potential collider signature of the model is a final state with two same-sign leptons and missing energy from the decay of doubly-charged Higgs, in contrast to the HTM where more leptons are expected in such final states.
* The model predicts a small vacuum expectation value for the triplet scalar, which is suggested by a recent study of electroweak radiative corrections.

• Output power at the Stokes frequency exhibits normal mode splitting with reactive coupling but not with purely dispersive coupling.
• Reactive coupling causes four-wave mixing, generating an anti-Stokes component not seen with purely dispersive coupling.

* Experimental and simulation results on the melting transition in various 2D systems have been incongruous, reporting first order, second order, and KTHNY-like transitions. The range of the interaction potential and dimensionality seem to affect the stable existence of the hexatic phase.

Velocity distribution and configurational temperature equilibrate relatively quickly, while long-range correlations take much longer.

* In the regular regime, the tunneling period is reduced as the perturbation strength and number of frequency components increase, which can be explained by chaos-assisted tunneling.
* In the irregular regime, the uncertainty product initially grows then saturates due to quantum interference, in contrast to the unbounded growth under stochastic perturbation.
* Quantum fluctuations are larger for classically chaotic trajectories compared to regular ones, implying quantum corrections are more dominant for chaotic trajectories.
* In the semiquantal approximation, partial quantum fluctuations enhance chaotic behavior, and chaos enhances tunneling and decoherence. Full quantum interference suppresses this effect.

* Various dark energy models have been proposed as alternatives, such as quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, Chaplygin gas, holographic dark energy, and others.
* Modified gravity theories such as f(R) gravity and teleparallel gravity based on torsion have also been explored to explain the accelerated expansion.
* f(T) gravity is a modification of teleparallel gravity, where the torsion scalar T is generalized to a function f(T). The field equations are second-order, simpler than other modified gravity theories.
* The authors aim to explore the implications of f(T) gravity on big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and constrain f(T) models using BBN observational data.
* Three specific viable f(T) models are reviewed: the power-law model, the exponential model, and the square-root exponential model.
* BBN calculations are performed to confront the f(T) models with observational data on primordial abundance of 4He.
* For the power-law f(T) model, BBN constraints require the exponent n to be less than 0.42, consistent with constraints from other observational data.
* For the exponential and square-root exponential models, the BBN constraints are satisfied for realistic parameter regions, and thus BBN cannot impose strict constraints on these models.

* The paper proposes an optimal mode selection and power allocation policy for a three-node half-duplex bidirectional relay network with fading links that maximizes the average sum rate. The policy selects from six possible transmission modes and allocates optimal powers to the transmitting nodes in each time slot based on the instantaneous channel state information.
* Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive protocol outperforms existing protocols in terms of average sum rate. The optimal policy does not select two of the transmission modes or utilize time sharing, and the optimal power allocation considerably improves the sum rate especially when the total power budget is low.

* The acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated from CMB measurements and used as a ""standard ruler"" to constrain cosmology at low redshifts.
* The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly measures the baryon-to-photon ratio and epoch of matter-radiation equality, even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted due to undetected relativistic components.
* The sound horizon depends primarily on the baryon-to-photon ratio and redshift of equality, which are well-measured by the CMB.
* Measuring the acoustic scale along and across the line of sight at low redshift constrains cosmological parameters in a way that is independent of the overall scale set by the matter density.
* Massive neutrinos create a small error in dark energy inferences by altering the low-redshift matter density relative to the CMB-inferred value.
* Alterations to the early Hubble parameter from decaying particles are unlikely to significantly affect the sound horizon without being detectable in the CMB or large-scale structure.
* Measuring the acoustic scale at high and low redshifts can isolate the cosmology at intermediate redshifts.
* The CMB is sensitive to the amount and quadrupole moment of non-photon radiation, allowing constraints on conventional neutrinos and perfect fluid extra radiation.
* Late-time cosmological measurements can constrain the actual matter and radiation densities and the presence of unknown relativistic species.
* The acoustic peak method of probing dark energy is robust to uncertainties in the matter density provided the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well-measured by the CMB.

• The author uses results from a fit to all neutrino experiments by Ohlsson and Snellman to test the ansatz.
• For a real, symmetric neutrino mass matrix, two types of solutions are found: one with two nearly degenerate neutrinos around 0.6 eV and one heavier neutrino, and another with two heavier degenerate neutrinos around 1 eV and one very light neutrino.
• The second solution is favored by constraints from neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.
• Complex neutrino mass matrices allowing CP violation in neutrinoless double beta decay but not in ordinary neutrino oscillations are also considered.
• A one-parameter family of solutions is found for the complex case, roughly falling into the same two types as the real case.
• The heaviest neutrino masses found are around 1-2 eV, bordering on the limit from non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay.

* In undirected networks, disease prevalence stabilized at similar levels despite the addition of vertices, and increased with higher probability of spreading and more edges per vertex.
* In directed networks, disease prevalence was generally lower than in undirected networks due to limitations imposed by the direction of links.
* Among undirected networks, MB networks had the lowest prevalence, likely due to the presence of many unconnected vertices, while among directed networks, BA networks had the lowest prevalence, possibly due to their specific topology.

* Fe-based superconductors can be divided into pnictides and chalcogenides, with the square lattice of iron as the basic element. The Fermi surface consists of hole and electron sheets.
* Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure. The spin resonance peak in inelastic neutron scattering provides information about the gap structure.
* Experiments show at least two distinct superconducting gaps are present in most Fe-based superconductors. The relation between the spin resonance frequency and the gap sizes is analyzed.
* The spin resonance appears below an indirect gap scale determined by the sum of gaps on two different Fermi surface sheets connected by the resonance wave vector. This provides a criterion to determine if an observed peak is a true spin resonance.
* Comparison of energy scales from inelastic neutron scattering, ARPES, and Andreev spectroscopy for most materials confirms the observed feature is the spin resonance peak, evidencing a sign-changing s-wave gap.
* In some hole-doped systems, the relation between the resonance frequency and gap sizes is less clear, requiring calculations of the spin response for the specific band structure to make a definitive conclusion.
* FeTe0.6Se0.4 is the only clear case where the resonance frequency is greater than twice the maximum gap, inconsistent with a sign-changing gap structure according to the analysis.
* The study provides a framework to interpret neutron scattering data and elucidate the pairing mechanism in Fe-based superconductors by comparing the spin resonance frequency with the superconducting gap sizes.

* The presence of impurities usually modifies the spectrum and coherence properties of a quantum system. In 1D and 2D, random impurities lead to localized states, while correlated impurities can introduce delocalized states.
* The authors introduce a 2D generalization of the dual random dimer model (2D-DRDM) where impurities cannot be first neighbors and modify hopping terms. A resonance energy exists where the impurities are transparent and states around it are delocalized.
* For a weakly interacting Bose gas on the 2D-DRDM potential, the disorder induces non-monotonic behavior of the condensate delocalization and fraction as a function of disorder strength, enhancing both near the resonance energy.
* The inverse participation ratio (IPR) is used to analyze localization properties. For the 2D-DRDM, states around the resonance energy are delocalized even at higher dimensions.
* A Gutzwiller approach is used to find the ground state of the weakly interacting Bose gas. The many-body ground-state IPR measures the homogeneity of the condensate.
* Interactions introduce a healing length over which the system feels the effect of an impurity. A mode-matching argument determines the ground states and explains the shift of the IPR minimum with interaction strength.
* The scaling behavior of the IPR with system size shows a homogeneous condensate where correlations are dominant. Super-delocalization occurs at low disorder strength.
* Density distributions show the 2D-DRDM favors delocalization more than uncorrelated disorder by partially compensating the density decrease caused by impurities. The condensate fraction is enhanced and size-independent near the resonance condition.
* The 2D-DRDM can modify and enhance the coherence of a weakly interacting many-body system. The effects could be measured in ultracold atom experiments.

* The paper proposes an all-optical scheme to detect Majorana fermions (MFs) in iron chains on a superconducting lead surface using a coupled quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator (QD-NR) system with optical pump-probe technology.
* The coupling between the QD and nearby MF results in a signature in the coherent optical spectrum of the QD, providing a potential way to detect MFs that is different from the zero-bias peak in tunneling experiments.
* The vibration of the NR acting as a phonon cavity enhances the exciton resonance spectrum and makes the MF signature more detectable.
* Under both coupled and uncoupled MF conditions, the absorption spectrum displays a phenomenon analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency due to quantum interference between the MF modes and the beat of the two optical fields via the QD.

• Identifying the companion star remaining near the explosion site would help confirm the evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia. A G2IV star was identified as a possible companion for Tycho's supernova remnant.

• The highly structured HI distribution in gas-rich galaxies, marked by shells and supershells, is an important manifestation of activity in their disks. These features have been identified in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies.
• Two main explanations for the origin of supershells are: (1) internal sources such as starbursts driving stellar winds and supernovae, and (2) external sources such as infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane.
• The authors propose a new explanation for HI supershells - that they are formed by radio jets plowing through the interstellar medium (ISM), accreting gas and inflating bubbles.
• Several examples are given of jet instabilities giving rise to bubble-shaped features in normal spirals and radio galaxies. The authors examine the possibility of supershells being inflated due to localized instabilities in radio jets as they encounter regions of large scale density decline near the outskirts of galactic disks.
• Applying jet parameters inferred for NGC 4258 to the conditions in NGC 3556, the authors show that the integrated mechanical luminosity of the jet over its minimum lifetime is adequate to account for the observed kinetic energy of the supershells.
• The jet-ISM interaction scenario could supplement other mechanisms for supershell formation, with greater relevance for extraordinarily large and energetic shells occurring at large galactocentric distances.
• If jets in spirals recur and precess, they may inflate bubbles over a variety of galactocentric radii and azimuthal angles. Segments of jet-blown supershells could shower back onto the galactic disk, triggering secondary shells, bubbles, and star formation.

• The frequency-dependent conductivity can be described by the extended pair approximation model. A universal scaling behavior is observed between the conductance, frequency, and film thickness.
• The electric-field-dependent conductivity shows nonlinear behavior at high fields, from which a characteristic length scale can be extracted. This length scale decreases with increasing film thickness.
• An empirical relation is established between the onset frequency from frequency-dependent measurements and the characteristic length scale from electric-field-dependent measurements, providing insight into the electrical transport properties of SWCNT networks.

• The effects of imperfections like cavity decay and spontaneous emission from the SQUID levels are analyzed, showing the marked state can still be searched with high fidelity.
• Compared to previous proposals using flying qubits, this scheme uses stationary SQUID qubits and has an operation time on the order of nanoseconds, with the ability to accommodate device parameter non-uniformity.

• Standard orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification do not appropriately describe the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
• Including microscopic fluctuations in phase-field equations is challenging and the standard approach cannot be used to investigate nucleation in a straightforward way.

* The problem involves determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations, calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange, and determining how the orbital parameters change over time.
* Low-frequency g-modes of stellar oscillations play an important role in dynamical tides and are determined by the Brunt-Väisälä frequency.
* The authors calculate the overlap integrals, which measure the intensity of tidal interactions, and the evolution time scales of the orbital parameters for each stellar model over its lifetime.
* For a star with 1 solar mass, planets with orbital periods <= 3 days will fall onto the star within the star's main sequence lifetime due to dynamical tides.
* For stars with 1.5 and 2 solar masses, planets with orbital periods <= 2 days will fall onto the star during the main sequence.
* The evolution of the star significantly impacts the results, and neglecting stellar evolution can lead to planets not falling onto the star when they otherwise would.

* Configurational averaging over the disorder allows the interdistance between sources to be encoded in the fluctuations of the CDOS.
* The speckle contrast measured in a single speckle spot contains the same information as the contrast of the total emitted power and is proportional to the fluctuations of the CDOS.
* Changes in the speckle contrast could be used to detect changes in the interdistance between sources with a resolution not limited by diffraction but by the microstructure of the scattering medium.
* The method provides an alternative to the Green's function retrieval technique, with the Green's function encoded in the noise due to two fluctuating sources measured at a single point.
* In the weak scattering limit, an explicit approximate expression can be given for the fluctuations of the CDOS in terms of the interdistance between sources.

• The sBPBP is shown to fail for pairs (X,c₀) and (X,ℓ₁) when X fails the uniform sBPBP. This provides examples of reflexive spaces X where (X,Y) fails the sBPBP.
• A characterization is given for when the pair (ℓ_p,ℓ_q) has the sBPBP: it holds when 1 < p < ∞ and q ≥ p*, but fails when p = 1 and 1 ≤ q < ∞.

• The widely used laor model assumes a maximally rotating black hole, while the kerrdisk model allows the spin to be a fitted parameter.
• The study compared the laor and kerrdisk models applied to XMM-Newton data of MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, finding the kerrdisk model provides a smoother parameter space and more reliable spin constraints.

• The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the 1980s to study the periodic advance of glaciers on Earth. It refers to the nonmonotonic dependence of a system's response on noise when the noise is added to a periodic input signal.
• From a statistical perspective, stochastic resonance is the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by adding noise. The optimal level of noise that maximizes a criterion like Fisher information is called stochastic resonance.
• The paper studies estimation and hypothesis testing for a model with a subthreshold constant signal perturbed by noise from an ergodic diffusion process. Two observation schemes are considered: observing the proportion of time the signal is above a threshold, and measuring the signal's energy above the threshold.
• For both observation schemes, the authors propose estimators, study their asymptotic properties, and show examples where stochastic resonance emerges. The estimators are asymptotically equivalent to maximum likelihood estimators.
• The authors also solve the problem of testing a simple null hypothesis against a simple alternative using the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion. The overall probability of error is shown to be nonmonotonically dependent on the noise level, exhibiting stochastic resonance.
• The use of ergodic diffusions as noise in stochastic resonance seems powerful, but characterizing classes of ergodic processes that enhance stochastic resonance is not as simple as in the i.i.d. case.
• The analysis of the overall probability of error in hypothesis testing seems to reveal something new compared to the current literature on stochastic resonance.

* The invention provides nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with integrated spiral structured porous sheets decorated with surface channels and electrospun fibers to facilitate peripheral nerve regeneration. The NGCs have superior mechanical strength and provide multiple channels, aligned fibers, and high surface area for cell attachment.
* The NGCs are fabricated by winding a porous polycaprolactone (PCL) sheet into a spiral structure, depositing aligned nanofibers on the surface channels, and spinning random nanofibers on the outside to form a dense fibrous tube. The size of the NGC is tunable based on the dimensions of the spiral sheet.
* In vitro studies showed the NGCs with aligned fibers had significantly higher Schwann cell proliferation compared to NGCs without fibers. The NGCs had suitable mechanical properties and porosities for use in nerve repair.
* In a rat sciatic nerve defect model, the NGCs with aligned fibers performed comparably to autografts in terms of functional recovery, electrophysiological measures, neural tissue coverage, and muscle reinnervation, and outperformed single lumen NGCs without fibers. The surface channels and aligned fibers provide topographical cues to enhance nerve regeneration.

• The invention relates to position sensors that monitor moving parts in mechanical systems like diesel engine fuel injectors, reducing wiring by providing output signals as changes in current drawn by the sensor.
• The sensor contains a waveform generator that modifies an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer based on an error correction signal, and an error correction generator that eliminates static and error signals to minimize energy usage.
• A window reference circuit compares the sensor output to preset high and low reference signals and adjusts the output if needed. The error correction generator uses comparators, a controller, and a signal processor.
• The sensor draws minimal current on startup and can be recalibrated by removing and reapplying power. A resistor converts the voltage output to a current, allowing the sensor to connect to monitoring equipment with only two wires.
• The sensor subtracts error signals when the monitored object moves quickly, but maintains position signals when the object moves slowly. It can rapidly recalibrate if offset voltage changes suddenly due to temperature or other factors.
• The sensor modulates current across the two connecting wires, which the monitoring system converts to a modulated voltage signal. Resistor values prevent attempted recalibration solely due to object movement.

* The invention relates to a system and method for design rule checking of integrated circuits containing both logic and memory regions.
* Conventional methods either check the entire design against logic rules, resulting in many false errors for the memory regions, or mask out the memory regions entirely, potentially missing real errors.
* The invention creates customized design rule check (DRC) files for each type of memory region by modifying standard logic DRC rules based on the memory bit cell design rules.
* During DRC, each region of the chip (logic, different memory types) is checked only against its corresponding set of customized DRC rules.
* This eliminates false errors from checking memory regions against logic rules while still catching real errors in the memory.
* The customized DRC rules are created by running standard logic DRC on memory bit cells and modifying the logic rules based on the memory rule violations.
* This method can be extended to any type of region on a chip that has different design rules than the logic.

* The master device selects which slave device to transfer the administrative functions to based on criteria such as the slave device's visibility on the network or its intelligence/functional capabilities.
* After transferring the administrative functions, the master device enters the power management state which has lower power consumption.
* A slave device, upon receiving a transfer request from the master, sends back an acceptance reply and receives the transferred administrative functions to become the new master.
* If the administrative functions are not successfully transferred, a suitable slave device will self-promote itself to the master role.
* When any device becomes activated on the network, it checks for beacons to determine if a master exists, and if not, it becomes the new master itself.

• Social Security provides benefits to retirees, disabled workers, and dependents including widows, surviving parents and children. Benefits represent a significant source of income for many recipients.
• Social Security has expanded over time to include benefits for dependents in 1939 and disability insurance in 1956. Major changes in the mid-1970s and early 1980s reduced the growth of benefit levels to address solvency concerns.
• Social Security is financed primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis where current workers' payroll taxes pay for current benefits. Absent changes, trust fund reserves are projected to be depleted by 2041.
• Reform proposals to restore solvency generally include revenue increases, benefit reductions, or structural changes. Benefit reductions would affect disabled workers and dependents in addition to retirees.
• GAO projections show that potential reform elements like longevity indexing, price indexing, and reducing COLAs would reduce median lifetime benefits for most disabled workers and dependents relative to currently scheduled benefits.
• Options exist to protect benefits of disabled workers and dependents from reductions, such as exempting them from reforms, providing them a ""super COLA"", or increasing benefits for certain dependents like widows and children.
• Benefit protections for disabled workers and dependents come at a cost to the Social Security program in terms of reduced solvency gains from reforms. Protections could also create incentives for more people to apply for disability benefits.
• If Social Security reforms include benefit reductions, Congress should consider the implications on disabled and dependent beneficiaries. A review of benefit protections could be coordinated with efforts to modernize the Social Security disability program.

* Since the mid-1980s, drug detection mechanisms have been modified and new mechanisms added to improve geographic and population coverage and timeliness of data, and organizational changes were made to strengthen the federal response to drug abuse problems.
* Despite these changes, concerns remain about the efficiency and effectiveness of drug detection efforts, and no overall defined federal strategy exists for determining the timing, nature, and magnitude of a response to emerging drug use trends.
* To improve the nation's drug detection and response capability, the Office of National Drug Control Policy should implement changes to improve the usefulness of drug data, develop a systematic approach for gathering and disseminating drug information, and develop a defined strategy for responding to potential drug crises or epidemics.

• The military health system has three missions: maintaining the health of active-duty service members, maintaining readiness to treat wartime casualties, and providing care to dependents of active-duty personnel, retirees and their families, and survivors of military personnel.
• In the mid-1990s, DOD implemented the TRICARE framework for military health care in response to rising costs and beneficiary concerns about access. TRICARE provides care through military treatment facilities (MTFs) and civilian provider networks.
• The Medicare subvention demonstration allowed DOD to create managed care organizations that participate in Medicare and enroll older military retirees. DOD could be paid by Medicare for enrollees' care, but only after DOD spent a historical baseline amount.
• In 1999, DOD's monthly costs for Senior Prime enrollees were $586 per person compared to the $320 monthly capitation rate. The main reason for the difference was Senior Prime enrollees' higher utilization of services compared to similar Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.
• The payment rules for the demonstration limited what Medicare could pay DOD, resulting in Medicare owing DOD nothing for the care provided to enrollees in 1999. DOD had to cover the additional costs using its appropriated health care funds.
• Without the demonstration, Medicare would have spent less than the Senior Prime capitation rate on enrollees because much of their care would have been provided for free by MTFs.
• The BBA payment rules prevented the government from paying twice for the same care and protected Medicare from increased spending, but DOD incurred greater costs for seniors due to the demonstration and had to redirect funds from other uses to cover the shortfall.

* Financial regulatory agencies are relatively independent, which insulates them from political pressure but also reduces their accountability. Tools to influence agency actions include control over agency funding, leadership structure, cost-benefit analysis requirements, and the Congressional Review Act.
* Banks face several emerging challenges, including the growth of ""shadow banking"" by non-banks, the disruptive potential of new financial technologies, rising interest rates, and competition from institutions with different charters.

• Funds for the campus-based programs are allocated to institutions through a two-stage process involving a base guarantee and a fair share increase. The current allocation formula favors long-term participants and may not adequately reflect current student need.
• In recent years, the campus-based programs have played a relatively smaller role compared to other federal student aid programs like Pell Grants and Direct Loans. In AY2015-2016, about 1.5 million students received FSEOG, 635,000 received FWS, and 422,000 received Perkins Loans.
• Some argue the campus-based programs overlap with other federal aid and could be eliminated to simplify the aid system. Others say they are still important as they require institutional matching funds, allow flexibility to target funds, and provide an additional source of aid.
• Key issues for potential HEA reauthorization include whether the campus-based programs still serve a unique purpose, whether the allocation formula should be reformed to better target needy students, and whether certain program-specific provisions should be modified.

* The gift tax liability is determined by the fair market value of the gift less exclusions and deductions. The annual per donee exclusion is $14,000, and married couples can double this through gift-splitting. Gift tax deductions include those for charitable and marital gifts.
* The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is a flat-rate tax imposed on transfers to individuals two or more generations below the transferor. The GST tax rate is equal to the highest estate tax rate (40% in 2014).
* Each individual has a $5,340,000 GST exemption for lifetime transfers. Exclusions for tuition, medical expenses, and the $14,000 annual exclusion also apply to the GST tax. The tax liability depends on the type of transfer: taxable distribution, taxable termination, or direct skip.

The current revenue from fuel taxes is insufficient to cover the costs of needed construction and major rehabilitation projects.
* Past Administrations have proposed replacing the fuel tax with lockage fees or increasing the fuel tax along with other fees, but these proposals have been rejected by Congress. The user industry favors increasing the fuel tax combined with an increase in the federal share of costs.
* The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB), a federal advisory committee, proposed its own plan in 2010 to increase the fuel tax, increase the federal share of costs, increase overall spending on inland waterways, and give the IWUB a greater role in project planning.
* Other groups have proposed significantly increasing user fees and the proportion of costs covered by user payments in order to decrease federal spending on the inland waterways.
* Key issues for Congress include determining the appropriate level of investment in aging inland waterway infrastructure, considering options to alter the user-fee system and federal/user cost-sharing arrangement, and potentially reforming the planning process and criteria for prioritizing inland waterway projects.
* The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made some changes related to cost-sharing of inland waterways projects, but did not increase user fees. The user industry continues to advocate for the IWUB proposal.
* Most agree that the current financing system is not sustainable to fund future inland waterway investments, but there is disagreement on how much investment is needed and warranted.
* Changes to the inland waterways financing system could have significant implications for the federal budget, the user industry, and the national transportation infrastructure.

• Schistosoma species are parasitic flatworms that cause the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Genome and transcriptome sequencing of several Schistosoma species has provided valuable insights into the biology and evolution of these important parasites.
• Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the evolutionary relationships among Schistosoma species and other platyhelminths, supporting an Asian origin of the genus. Transcriptomic studies have uncovered genes and pathways involved in development, host-parasite interactions, and sexual dimorphism.
• Despite progress, challenges remain in fully understanding the complex biology of schistosomes. Integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, as well as advances in functional genomic tools like RNAi and transgenesis, will be crucial for developing new interventions to combat schistosomiasis.

• The study was conducted in three phases: validating score reliability, assessing content validity, and assessing criterion and discriminant validity in eligible patients.
• The most common error for both inhalers was not maintaining total lung capacity after deep inhalation. More errors were made with MDIs than DPIs.
• Validated scores showed high interobserver correlation and agreement in classifying patients as able/unable to use inhalers correctly.
• The validated scores allow identification and correction of inhaler technique errors during visits and improvement of inhaler use.
• Previous studies have validated MDI scores in asthma patients and DPI scores in COPD patients, but this study validated both in asthma patients.
• Limitations include lack of follow-up to assess improvement and high error rates with MDIs, suggesting a need for repeated assessment.

* CHFCs are thought to originate from abnormal embryological development of the foregut and are most commonly found in segment IV of the liver.
* Imaging features of CHFCs are variable; they can appear as anechoic or hypoechoic cysts on ultrasound and as non-enhancing lesions on CT.
* Histologically, CHFCs must be differentiated from other hepatic cysts like simple cysts, hydatid cysts, biliary cystadenomas, cystadenocarcinomas, and bronchogenic cysts.
* Treatment of CHFCs ranges from observation to aspiration to surgical excision, with excision recommended for cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, and cysts with wall abnormalities on imaging.
* Laparoscopic excision is well-suited for CHFCs due to their small size, anterior subcapsular location, benign nature, and thick cyst wall.

• FTIR and DSC studies showed no interaction between clobazam and the polymers used. Physicochemical characterization indicated the strips were uniform with neutral surface pH.
• Increasing PVA increased disintegration time and tensile strength, while increasing SSG decreased disintegration time and increased drug release. Formulation F6 with 100 mg PVA and 6% SSG showed the best properties.
• In vitro drug release from the optimized strip (F6) was comparable to the marketed tablet formulation (Frisium 5). Both followed Higuchi diffusion-controlled release kinetics.
• SEM revealed a smooth strip surface with uniform drug distribution. The optimized strip was stable for at least 6 months at 40°C/75% RH.
• In vivo studies in rabbits showed no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the optimized strip and marketed tablets. The formulations were bioequivalent.
• A good in vitro-in vivo correlation (r=0.994) was established for the percentage of drug released in vitro and absorbed in vivo for formulation F6.

* Current topical treatments for onychomycosis such as amorolfine, ciclopirox, and tioconazole have limited efficacy and require long treatment durations.
* In an open observational study, topical tazarotene 0.1% gel applied daily for 12 weeks resulted in complete cure of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis in all 15 patients.

• Posterolateral LV lead position was important, as clinical response improved with a posterolateral lead instead of the original apical or anterolateral location.
• Endocardial pacing opposite the coronary sinus pacing site did not improve AHR, suggesting epicardial pacing at the optimal site may be a good alternative to endocardial LV pacing.

* Symptoms of nasopharyngeal bursitis include space-occupying lesion effects, rhinitis symptoms, and occipital pain. Incidence is around 4% in adults, peaking between ages 15-30.
* In a 2-year audit, 6 patients (4 males, 2 females, mean age 54) were diagnosed with nasopharyngeal bursitis (<1% incidence). Equal incidence was found between cystic and crust types.
* Cyst types presented with postnasal discharge, throat irritation and cough. Crust types had crust expectoration, retching, fetid discharge, and occasional occipital pain with symptom-free intervals.
* Combined endoscopic endonasal and transoral surgical approach with electrocauterization was effective with no recurrence at 1 year postoperatively.
* Histologically, the crust type showed reactive lymphoid mucosa with necrotic tissue, explaining rapid crust formation, shedding and postnasal drip.
* Proper endoscopic exam with CT/MRI is the best assessment method. Nasopharyngeal bursitis should be differentiated from nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Endoscopic bursa interruption with electrocauterization is a minimally invasive and effective treatment.

• The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing over the past few decades, with early diagnosis being key for disease prognosis. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that enables visualization of morphological features not seen by the naked eye, but it requires a lot of experience to differentiate skin lesions.
• Computational intelligence methods can assist physicians and dermatologists in faster data processing to give better and more reliable diagnoses. Numerous computerized diagnostic systems using different border detection, feature extraction, selection, and classification algorithms have been reported in the literature.
• Preprocessing steps like hair removal, color space transformation, and contrast enhancement are used to facilitate the segmentation process. Many different segmentation algorithms are available and comparative studies provide performance analysis of these algorithms.
• Feature extraction methods include statistical, model-based, and filtering-based methods. The ABCD-E system, 7-point checklist, 3-point checklist, pattern analysis, and Menzies method offer alternative approaches for deciding differentiating features. Border shape, color, and texture features are commonly extracted.
• Feature selection is critical for reducing the number of features while retaining important information. Methods include sequential forward/backward selection, floating search methods, and filter-based methods like ReliefF and correlation-based feature selection.
• Classification approaches include k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and extreme learning machines. Classifier performance is assessed using measures like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.
• Factors like class imbalance, train/test ratio, and cross-validation need to be considered when building and validating classification models. Classifier combination schemes can sometimes outperform a single best classifier.
• Many studies lack important details on data acquisition, feature extraction/selection, classification methods, and validation, making it difficult to assess the validity of performance claims. The intended end-user (general practitioner vs. expert) should also be considered when designing and evaluating automated diagnostic systems.
• The most important objective is to correctly diagnose melanoma, as failure to do so can lead to patient death. However, high sensitivity with low specificity is not useful for screening to avoid unnecessary biopsies.

• Cooperation levels were quantified for each strain based on a model of invested benefits. Cooperating strains showed enhanced growth, especially when total co-culture growth was low to moderate.
• Clustering strains based on their cooperative behavior profiles identified groups corresponding to specific biosynthetic pathways. Cooperation profiles were more similar for strains with mutations closer together in the metabolic network.
• A joint metabolic flux balance model, allowing free exchange of metabolites between strains, correlated with measured co-culture growth (ρ=0.42). The model was more predictive for amino acid biosynthesis mutants than nucleotide biosynthesis mutants.
• Shadow prices were calculated, representing the growth benefit to a recipient strain of taking up a metabolite and the growth cost to a donor strain of secreting it. An overall cooperation efficiency was defined as the benefit-to-cost ratio.
• Strains showed the most growth when they efficiently exchanged metabolites that were cheap for the partner to produce but valuable for the recipient. Cooperation efficiency reproduced the pattern of an initial benefit to cooperation followed by a cost at higher levels.

• LCN2 knockout mice gained more body weight and fat mass compared to wild-type mice, especially when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or aged.
• LCN2 deficiency impaired adaptive thermogenesis and made mice cold intolerant, likely due to reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.
• LCN2 knockout mice developed more severe insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia when fed an HFD compared to wild-type mice.
• Cold exposure increased LCN2 expression in white adipose tissue of wild-type mice. LCN2 knockout mice had diminished cold-induced HSL gene expression in brown and white adipose tissue.
• Expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation genes was reduced in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of HFD-fed LCN2 knockout mice.
• Insulin responsiveness was reduced in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver of LCN2 knockout mice, indicating systemic insulin resistance.
• LCN2 knockout mice had higher expression of gluconeogenic genes in the liver, contributing to fasting hyperglycemia.
• LCN2 expression was downregulated in adipose tissue and bone marrow macrophages in HFD-induced obese mice. LCN2 knockout mice had increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers.
• LCN2 regulates lipid metabolism, adaptive thermogenesis, and insulin resistance, possibly by binding to small hydrophobic molecules or cell surface receptors. LCN2 may be a therapeutic target for obesity-associated metabolic disorders.

* Maslow's hierarchy of needs proposes that human needs can be portrayed in a pyramid, with physiological and safety needs at the bottom as the most fundamental.
* Safety needs like personal and financial security are sometimes more important than physiological needs, as experiments have shown animals and humans prioritize avoiding threats over rewards.
* Emotions like fear serve to quickly detect threats and initiate appropriate avoidance behaviors as a protective evolutionary strategy.
* Appraisal theory proposes that emotions result from people's interpretations of the predictability of stressful events, with unexpected events causing fear and anger.
* The amygdala is the key brain region for processing fear and stress, with fast neural pathways that bypass the cortex to allow rapid threat detection.
* The locus coeruleus and norepinephrine system also contribute to stress responses and directing ""fight or flight"" behaviors.
* Mental disorders like phobias, anxiety and depression may result from maladaptive threat responses and inability to progress through the normal ""emotion flow"" of fear, anger, happiness, sadness and calm when dealing with stressors.
* In summary, the author argues safety needs are the most fundamental for humans, and that fear and anger are adaptive emotions to deal with unexpected threats, which can lead to mental disorders if dysregulated.

• Studies show that acute exercise does not consistently increase food intake, but as exercise is repeated over time, a partial compensatory response in energy intake begins to appear.

* Rats were divided into sham-operated, UUO, UUO+taxol, and UUO+taurine groups.
* Stereological methods were used to estimate kidney volume and the volume and length of various renal structures.
* UUO caused renal disruption, tubular atrophy, degeneration, necrosis, and fibrosis, which were reduced by treatment with taxol or taurine.
* Taxol was more protective than taurine in preventing structural renal damage in the UUO model.
* The protective effects of taxol and taurine may involve various mechanisms, including modulation of signaling pathways, reduction of oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory effects.

• Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger innate immune responses after sensing microbial components, but aberrant activation can lead to inflammatory diseases. Autophagy is involved in regulating innate immunity.
• Loss of autophagy components like ATG16L1 leads to enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines in response to PRR stimulation. This may contribute to Crohn's disease susceptibility.
• Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can induce autophagy, leading to elimination of intracellular bacteria and viruses. ATG proteins are required for this process.
• NOD1 and NOD2, intracellular sensors of bacterial peptides, induce autophagy upon stimulation. Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 and ATG16L1 variants are defective in autophagy induction.
• ATG proteins can negatively regulate type I interferon production in response to viral RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5. Loss of autophagy leads to enhanced antiviral innate immune responses.
• B cell receptors and TLR9 are recruited to autophagosome-like compartments upon stimulation with DNA-containing antigens, leading to hyperactivation of B cells and potential autoimmunity.
• STING, a key mediator of innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA, translocates in an ATG9a-dependent manner upon DNA stimulation. Loss of ATG9a leads to enhanced STING signaling.
• In vivo studies using cell type-specific autophagy-deficient mice are needed to fully understand the role of autophagy in regulating innate immunity and inflammatory diseases. Inducing autophagy may have therapeutic potential.

* BHH services were able to identify gaps in care such as laboratory monitoring or missed diagnoses and allow for the delivery of preventative and individualized proactive care.
* Preliminary results indicate that the use of a BHH may be useful in understanding the unique characteristics of a specific population and promoting proactive preventative care.
* Limitations of the current report include lack of a comparison group and equal amounts of services for all patients, and future research should investigate both a clinical and control sample and examine patient satisfaction with BHH services.

• Oppenheimer emphasized the role of men's socioeconomic position in declining marriage rates, arguing that men's poor economic prospects and career uncertainty were causing delays in marriage.
• Analysis of European panel data shows that men's unemployment, low income, and temporary employment deter union formation, supporting Oppenheimer's theory. Income effects are stronger than employment effects.
• Marriage in Europe is more sensitive to men's economic position than cohabitation, suggesting cohabitation is more compatible with career uncertainty.
• Men's employment and income have weaker effects on union formation in more gender egalitarian European countries compared to more traditional countries.

• The inside-out MUS angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion (mean angle 122°) compared to the outside-in MUS which followed a more horizontal trajectory (mean angle 144°), and both formed a U-shaped band positioned dorsally rather than caudally to the urethra.
• Clinical implications are that surgeons must carefully rotate the inside-out MUS around the ischiopubic ramus, while ensuring a full thickness vaginal epithelial layer during dissection of the peri-urethral tunnel for the outside-in MUS to avoid vaginal injuries.

• The industrial designer reviewed available components for the remote control including energy sources (solar, hand dynamo, kinetic, battery), case materials (wood, rubber, titanium, latex), interface options (buttons, scrolls), and chip choices. Basic battery or kinetic energy and titanium case with simple rubber buttons were recommended.
• The user interface designer presented various interface concepts including graphical user interfaces, voice recognition, spinning wheels, scroll buttons, and customizable interfaces for different users. Simplicity was emphasized as key.
• Marketing survey results indicated 70% find current remotes ugly, 80% willing to spend more for fancy remotes, 75% zap a lot, 50% use only 10% of buttons. Frustrations include losing remote 50% of the time and complicated remotes taking time to learn.
• LCD screen on remote was debated - industrial designer felt it was not necessary with on-screen display, while marketing felt it would be fancy and follow user demand. Cost needs to be evaluated.
• Speech recognition was discussed as an option to eliminate need for LCD and allow easy control. Vocabulary needs to be defined. Concerns raised about background noise interference and multiple user confusion.
• Locating lost remotes was a key issue. Ideas included voice-activated beeping, a ""find"" command, and a locator button on the charger base.
• Charger base was proposed to hold remote when not in use, eliminating need for battery changes. On-screen reminder to return remote to charger could be programmed.
• For channel selection, using a matrix of thumbnail images for available channels was suggested to visually choose a channel without speech recognition. User-defined channel names was another option.
• Several issues remain to be investigated for the next meeting, including LCD and speech recognition component costs, and user testing of proposed features.

* There was a widening of the attainment gap between free school meal pupils and others in 2017 exam results, despite the Pupil Development Grant (PDG). Free school meal pupils were less resilient in the exam system last year.
* Possible reasons include the move from BTECs to science GCSEs for more free school meal pupils, and fewer doing English/Welsh literature which provides more resilience. There is no single reason and the government is looking into it further.
* The government is moving away from using the Level 2 threshold as a performance measure, and will develop new measures as part of the new accountability system.
* Adopted children are not automatically eligible for PDG. The government is considering how to collect data on adopted children while respecting privacy, and how to encourage adoptive parents to share information with schools.
* Latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. An independent review is evaluating the impact of PDG for looked-after children. Exclusion rates are much higher for looked-after children.
* Some Schools Challenge Cymru schools made good progress while others did not, depending on their starting point, quality of advisers, and leadership changes. The government has learned lessons around importance of leadership, systems, teacher quality and collaboration.
* Regional consortia are providing ongoing support to schools after the end of the time-limited Schools Challenge Cymru program. The program invested in building regional capacity for school improvement.
* There are differing views on whether the program ended too soon after 3 years to have maximum impact. The government believes it was always clearly time-limited and transitioned support to the regional consortia.

• The basic components needed for the remote include a power source, user interface, digital signal processor, infra-red LED, on-off switch, and memory for encryption codes for different TV makes. The most costly components will likely be the chip, user interface, and casing.
• To keep costs down, the team aims to keep the technology simple and focus on an attractive design for the remote's casing. Including teletext capability is still being considered.
• The main target market is people who have lost or broken their TV remote and want an inexpensive replacement that looks nice and is durable. Adding too many extra features would increase costs too much.
• One idea proposed is to include a power cradle to hold and charge the remote, eliminating the need for replacing batteries. This could be a key selling feature, though it may somewhat reduce the convenience of using the remote.
• The team debates whether to make a very basic, low-cost remote or a more expensive, high-end model with extra features. They lean towards focusing on a durable, good-looking design at a reasonable price point to build the company's brand identity.
• The remote will only work with TVs, not other devices, to keep it simple. The team plans to emphasize the remote's design, durability and that it may be ""the last remote you'll ever need to buy"" as key marketing points.

* The Minister for Education in Wales, Kirsty Williams, discussed how schools causing significant concern could be identified earlier through better data sharing and a new multi-agency approach involving the school, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn (school inspectorate), and Welsh Government working together.
* There is variation across local authorities in Wales in terms of using their powers to intervene in underperforming schools, with some being more proactive than others. The Minister expects local authorities to take the lead in intervening when needed.
* A new national evaluation and improvement resource is being developed and tested to promote more robust self-evaluation by schools, with the aim of introducing it across Wales in September 2020.

* Regional consortia provide school improvement services and Kirsty Williams believes this regional approach is necessary for effective support, rather than it being done by 22 individual local authorities.
* The Welsh government has changed school performance measures to be broader and encourage behaviors that are in the best interest of learners, even though this makes comparisons over time more challenging.
* Wales' PISA results have shown some improvement but there is more work to do, especially in increasing the proportion of high performing students to the OECD average.

* A strategic delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones is reviewing the role of the middle tier with a focus on supporting curriculum implementation, but it is not controlled by the Welsh Government.
* Changes to school performance measures make long-term comparisons challenging, but the Minister is confident the overall trajectory is positive. The measures were changed to encourage behaviours in the best interest of learners.
* Interim school performance measures are in place for 2-3 years until permanent measures can be aligned with the new curriculum and qualifications. The Minister wants measures to capture a broader range of school behaviours beyond just exam results.
* PISA results are one tool, among others, to assess the education system. Wales has seen some improvement but still lags in the higher skill levels compared to OECD averages, especially for more able and talented learners.
* The Minister acknowledges more progress is needed to close attainment gaps for disadvantaged pupils like those on free school meals, looked after children, and some ethnic minority groups, despite investment through the pupil development grant.
