1. The classification of time series data is one of the most important tasks in data mining, and 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is one of the best classifiers for time series data.
2. However, selecting an appropriate distance measure is crucial, but the selection criteria still depend largely on the nature of the data itself, especially in time series data.
3. Although the Euclidean distance is commonly used to measure the dissimilarity between two time series, DTW distance is more appropriate and produces more accurate results.
4. The Sakoe-Chiba band (SCB) was originally introduced to speed up the DTW calculation, and later it has been introduced as a DTW global constraint.
5. The SCB was first implemented for the speech community, and the width of the global constraint was fixed to be 10% of the time series length.
6. Recently, a new representation, Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (RKB), has been proposed, which generalizes the global constraint model represented by a one-dimensional array.
7. The size of the array and the maximum constraint value are limited to the length of the time series, and the main feature of the RKB is the multi-bands, where each band represents each class of data.
8. Although the RKB allows great flexibility to adjust the global constraint, a learning algorithm is needed to discover the best multi-RKB bands.
9. We propose two new learning algorithms, i.e., band boundary extraction and iterative learning, to solve the problem of overfitting.

1. The study of harmonic maps was initiated by Fuller, Nash, and Sampson in the 1960s.
2. Harmonic maps are extrema (critical points) of the energy functional defined on the space of smooth maps between Riemannian ( pseudo-Riemannian) manifolds.
3. The trace of the second fundamental form of a harmonic map is zero, and it is a linear map that can be considered as a section of the bundle associated with the pullback metric on the manifold.
4. If a smooth two-parameter variation of a harmonic map is given, then the Hessian of the map is defined by a symmetric map that can be expressed in terms of the Levi-Civita connection and the metric on the manifold.
5. The index of a harmonic map is defined as the dimension of the tangent subspace of the manifold on which the Hessian is negative definite.
6. A harmonic map is said to be stable if the Morse index of the map is zero, and otherwise, it is unstable.
7. For a non-degenerate point, the manifold can be decomposed into its vertical space and horizontal space, and the map is said to be horizontally conformal if either the rank of the horizontal space is zero or the restriction of the map to the horizontal space is surjective and conformal.
8. The study of harmonic maps has led to important contributions in computational fluid dynamics, minimal surface theory, string theory, gravity, and quantum field theory.

1. The text discusses the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and the growth of galaxies, with a focus on the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in regulating star formation.
2. AGN are thought to play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, particularly in the most massive ones, by suppressing star formation through feedback mechanisms.
3. The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is an important indicator of their evolution, and it is often estimated through various methods, including the detection of infrared (IR) emission.
4. The IR emission is thought to be a good proxy for the total SFR of a galaxy, as it is primarily produced by the heating of dust by young, massive stars.
5. However, the IR emission can be contaminated by the central AGN, which can make it difficult to accurately estimate the SFR of a galaxy.
6. To overcome this challenge, researchers have turned to the so-called starburst-AGN connection, which suggests that there is a correlation between the SFR of a galaxy and the luminosity of its central AGN.
7. The starburst-AGN connection is thought to be mediated by the AGN feedback mechanisms, which can heat and remove gas from the galaxy, thereby suppressing star formation.
8. The AGN feedback mechanisms can also lead to the formation of a dusty torus around the AGN, which can absorb and re-emit radiation in the IR regime.
9. The IR emission from the dusty torus can be used to estimate the SFR of a galaxy, as it is thought to be a good proxy for the total IR emission of the galaxy.
10. However, the accuracy of this method can be affected by the presence of AGN-heated dust, which can contaminate the IR emission and make it difficult to accurately estimate the SFR of a galaxy.

1. The paper discusses the limitations of the moped algorithm, a method for speeding up the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis.
2. The algorithm compresses the data and creates compressed values that are independent and have unit variance, simplifying the likelihood calculation.
3. However, the algorithm can create unphysical solutions, particularly when there are multiple local maxima in the likelihood function.
4. The authors demonstrate this by showing that for a one-dimensional case with a sine-Gaussian burst signal, moped can create a second peak in the likelihood function.
5. This second peak can be due to a degeneracy in the parameters, where the algorithm creates a mapping from the parameters to the compressed values that is not one-to-one.
6. The authors show that adding more parameters to the model can sometimes improve the situation, but it does not always work.
7. They also demonstrate that the degeneracies can be visualized by plotting the contours of the compressed values in the parameter space.
8. The authors conclude that while moped can provide a significant speedup in the evaluation of likelihood functions, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to carefully consider the degeneracies present in the data.

2. The authors use 21-cm emission line surveys to map the neutral gas disks of local galaxies and measure their total gas masses, extent, and dynamics.
3. The study finds that the column density distribution function of DLAs at high redshift is consistent with the local galaxy population, indicating that the incidence rate and metallicities of DLAs can be explained by the local galaxy population.
4. The authors use high-resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies to measure the column density distribution function of DLAs.
5. The resulting column density distribution function shows that most of the DLA cross section is in galaxies fainter than @xmath29, and 45% is in galaxies with @xmath30.
6. The median absolute magnitude of a @xmath1 DLA galaxy is expected to be @xmath32, and the median impact parameter of identified @xmath11 DLA galaxies is 8.3 kpc.
7. The study finds that the metallicity distribution for hi column densities peaks around [O/H]@xmath39 to @xmath40, much lower than the mean value of an @xmath29 galaxy of [O/H]@xmath41.
8. The results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that DLAs arise in the hi disks of galaxies, and the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate and metallicities of DLAs, the luminosities of their host galaxies, and the impact parameters between the centers of host galaxies and the background QSOs.

1. The text discusses the formation and evolution of star clusters, particularly young massive clusters in nearby galaxies.
2. The author notes that the initial stellar mass function (IMF) of young clusters is not well constrained due to the lack of observational studies that consider the dynamical state of the clusters.
3. The author presents observations of three young massive clusters in the nearby galaxy M82 using the Hubble Space Telescope, which show an excess of light at large radii compared to standard IMFs.
4. The author suggests that this excess of light is evidence that the clusters are not in dynamical equilibrium, which challenges the assumption of a standard IMF.
5. The author provides evidence that the clusters are likely to be out of equilibrium due to rapid gas loss, which could explain the observed discrepancies in the IMF.
6. The author uses @xmath0-body simulations to model the violent relaxation of star clusters after gas expulsion, which shows that significant mass loss occurs but a bound core remains.
7. The author confirms previous results that show that escaping stars are not lost instantaneously and will still be physically associated with the cluster for several million years after gas expulsion.
8. The author concludes that the observed discrepancies in the IMF of young massive clusters can be explained by the clusters being out of dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss.

2. The authors numerically study the time-dependence of the transition probability between the wells based on the quantum dynamics.
3. They find that the coherent motion of the wave packet can be well-described by the semiquantal picture, while the tunneling contribution to the transition probability is not significant for large perturbation strength.
4. The delocalization of the quantum state is interpreted as chaos-induced delocalization, and the classical chaos enhances the quantum barrier crossing rate.
5. The degree of coherence of the tunneling oscillation is defined, and the transition from coherent to irregular motion is observed as the perturbation strength increases.
6. The critical value of the perturbation strength divides the behavior of the transition probability into regular and irregular motions.
7. The numerical estimation suggests that there are critical values of the perturbation strength depending on the frequency component of the external field.
8. The reduction of the tunneling period in the coherent motion regime can be interpreted by applying the floquet theorem to the quasi-energy states and the quasi-energy.

2. At the experimental level, the so-called glass transition is generally associated with a sharp increase in the characteristic relaxation times of the system, and a concomitant departure of laboratory measurements from equilibrium.
3. In the theoretical level, it has been proposed that the transition from a liquid to a glassy state is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic (equilibrium) transition, known as the Kauzmann temperature.
4. At the Kauzmann temperature, only one minimum-energy basin of attraction is accessible to the system.
5. Many of these simulations have been conducted in the context of models introduced by Stillinger and Weber and by Kob and Andersen.

3. The article highlights the difficulty in explaining the DM's properties using the standard model of particle physics, which is why alternative theories have been proposed.
4. One such theory is ""modified Newtonian dynamics"" (MOND), which posits that the DM's gravitational effects are not described by the Newtonian law of gravity.

6. The author notes that MOND has been successful in explaining many observations of galaxy rotation curves, but it has its limitations.
7. One of the limitations is that MOND cannot explain the observed large-scale structure of the universe, which requires a much higher value of the accretion constant than predicted by MOND.

3. The point sources are found at close angular separations, and future high spatial and spectral resolution observations may be able to determine whether they are physically bound.
4. The methanol masers are found closest to the brightest MIR point source (within the assumed 1 arcsecond pointing accuracy) and dominate the luminosity.
5. The time scale for a source at the core edge to migrate to the center is comparable to the hot molecular core lifetime, so it is not possible to rule out large protostellar motions within the core.
6. From the derived gas mass of the core and mass estimates for the sources, Monte Carlo simulations show that it is difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the core using a standard form of the initial mass function (IMF).

2. The method involves using a coupled hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system with an optical pump-probe scheme.
3. The interaction between Majorana fermions and the qd in the hybrid system is mainly due to the dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted by several tens of nanometers.
4. The qd is considered as a two-level system rather than a single resonant level with spin-singlet state, and once Majorana fermions appear in the end of iron chains and couple to the qd, the Majorana signature will be carried out via the coherent optical spectrum of the qd.
5. The change in the coherent optical spectrum as a possible signature for Majorana fermions is another potential evidence in the iron chains.

1. The phase-field method is a popular tool for simulating microstructure formation during solidification.
2. The method relies on describing the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields, which obey partial differential equations.
3. The phase-field method can be used to study the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models, where the interface thickness is much smaller than other physical lengths.
4. In this limit, the equations of the phase-field model can be analyzed using matched asymptotic expansions, which yield effective boundary conditions for the macroscale.
5. One of the challenges in using the phase-field method is the presence of a macroscopic discontinuity in the temperature profile across the interface, which can lead to errors in simulations.
6. To address this issue, an antitrapping current can be introduced in the diffusion equation, which modifies the function @xmath57 in eq. ( [ fdef ] ) to eliminate the temperature jump.
7. Recently, several authors have put forward generalizations of this approach for arbitrary ratios of the diffusivities.
8. For the case analyzed above (where the current far inside the solid vanishes), they reduce to the simple prescription that the same expression for the antitrapping current can be used, but with an additional prefactor that can be written as @xmath59.
9. However, this is not the only thin-interface effect that can arise in the two-sided case, and another temperature jump can arise due to the surface thermal resistance, also called the Kapitza resistance.

4. A position sensor signal conditioner and remotely electrically connected sensor monitoring equipment provide a method of multiplexing multiple sensors on a minimum number of wires with a minimum of energy required from each sensor monitoring system.
5. One embodiment of the invention is herein described as a sensor that may comprise a waveform generator and an error correction generator for modifying a sensing signal by removing unneeded power and providing the signal to a remote monitor via two wires useful in multiplexing multiple sensors.
6. The error correction generator determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about a position of an object being sensed, wherein inclusion of the static and error signals would require energy.
7. One embodiment may include a digitally stored offset and error correction closed-loop compensation circuit for constantly comparing a value of the conditioned sensing signal to a desired minimum value and generates a correction signal that is subtracted from the offset and error signal to deliver a sensor signal output that is close to a desired minimum value.
8. The constant comparing of the sensor signal output to the desired minimum value proceeds in a first direction relative to a direction of sensor output signals generated when an object being sensed moves in a relatively slow manner compared to a nominal speed of objects being monitored such that signals are generated as the objects move are not subtracted from the sensor output to a degree significant enough to cause significant variance between a position of the object and a signal level delivered by the sensor indicating the position.
9. Further, the constant comparing of the sensor signal output to the desired minimum proceeds in a second direction relative to the direction of signals generated when the object being monitored moves in a relatively fast manner compared to the speed of objects being monitored so signals generated by errors or from other noise sources are subtracted from the sensor output in a manner sufficient to allow for a deletion of these error or static signals from being a significant portion of the position signal generated by the sensor.

1. Although endoscopic resection can be a curative procedure for nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms (sdns), it remains technically challenging due to the high risk of severe adverse events (SAEs) including delayed perforation.
2. Recently, laparoscopic and/or endoscopic full-thickness resection (FTR) has been reported to be a useful technique for the treatment of nonampullary sdns.
3. Despite their minimally invasive nature, all FTR procedures are associated with the possibility of intraperitoneal tumor dissemination.
4. To address this issue, the authors developed an alternative FTR method called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFR-L).
5. In a series of 5 patients, the LAEFR-L procedure was used to resect nonampullary sdns, and the results showed that complete resection was achieved without peritoneal exposure of tumor cells or SAEs.
6. The mean operative time was 173 minutes, and the mean diameter of the resected specimen was 24 mm, with a mean tumor size of 9 mm.

2. Charles Elton's book on the general phenomenon of non-native invasions in the 1950s initiated the transformation of invasion biology into a broad research thrust. (p. 1)
3. Although particular invasions continued to attract great attention, Elton's book did not inspire a broad research thrust on invasions or a widespread public and policy response to their growing number. (p. 2)
4. In the mid-1980s, an international project of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) produced several widely read edited volumes and triggered an explosion of research on invasions. (p. 2)
5. Research on the impacts of introduced species has increased greatly, particularly in the new century, showing how a single introduced species can change processes or the physical structure of an ecosystem, or both, subtly and slowly but with significant effects on a large fraction of resident species. (p. 3)
6. Molecular genetic research has increasingly revealed a great number of cases of the stealth impact of invaders, hybridization, and introgression with native species, often subtle enough to be hidden amidst the normal variation of many natural populations. (p. 4)
7. The burst of research in the wake of the SCOPE project also revealed an increasing number of cases of invasional meltdown, in which two or more introduced species facilitate each other's establishment or enhance each other's impact on native species. (p. 5)

3. The vidian canal is a narrow bony canal located along the lateral floor of the sphenoid sinus, and schwannomas arising in this location are extremely rare.
4. The patient in this case was a 49-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis who presented with a 24-year history of multiple sclerosis (MS) flares.
5. A routine surveillance brain MRI incidentally revealed a 19 mm ovoid mass along the inferior margin of the right cavernous sinus, which was not present on previous MRI scans.
6. The mass was easily identified within an expanded vidian canal along the lateral floor of the sphenoid sinus, and a biopsy was obtained.
7. The patient decided to pursue treatment with radiation therapy, and conservative management was not considered due to the significant increase in tumor volume during the eight-year interval of MRI surveillance and the presence of bone erosion.

1. The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened up a new route for obtaining photoanode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
2. The method involves the cathodic electrodeposition of cuprous oxide (CuO) onto a conductive substrate, followed by the addition of a dye molecule that can bind to the CuO surface.
3. The addition of the dye molecule can cause the formation of nanostructured CuO thin films with a high surface area, which can enhance the efficiency of the DSSC.
4. The authors of the study have successfully employed this method to synthesize hybrid thin films of CuO and rhodamine B (RB), a cationic dye.
5. The electrodeposition of CuO was found to be highly dependent on the concentration of the dye molecule, with higher concentrations resulting in higher crystallinity and better electrochemical properties.
6. The authors also observed that the addition of RB led to the formation of nanostructured CuO thin films with a high surface area, which can enhance the efficiency of the DSSC.
7. The crystal structure of the CuO thin films was found to be highly dependent on the concentration of the dye molecule, with higher concentrations resulting in a more crystalline structure.
8. The authors also explored the use of other dye molecules, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Nile blue (NB), and found that they could also be used to synthesize hybrid thin films with high surface area and improved electrochemical properties.
9. The authors believe that the use of cationic dyes such as RB could be a promising route for improving the efficiency of DSSCs.

2. ROS is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by cellular superoxide dismutases (Sods), which can regulate signaling pathways.
3. Oxidation of protein cysteine residues by H2O2 results in the formation of sulfenic acid (SOH), which quickly forms disulfide or sulfenyl amide bonds, changing protein function.
4. Cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms, similar to phosphatases, deubiquitinating enzymes, or histone deacetylases.
