4. A study investigated BH4 status in elderly hospitalized patients with and without delirium, finding higher Phe/Tyr ratios and lower Trp/LNAAs ratios in delirium patients.
5. Patients with delirium showed disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission and increased oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of BH4 deficiency in delirium pathogenesis.
6. Levels of arginine and citrulline were lower in delirium patients, indicating a possible link to oxidative stress and impaired nitric oxide production.
7. The study highlighted the need for further research to confirm these findings in a larger population and explore differences in delirium pathophysiology in patients with and without cognitive disorders.

1. The study examines the impact of men's economic position on union formation in Europe, finding that unemployment, low income, and temporary employment deter union formation. Income effects are strong, supporting the male breadwinner hypothesis, while employment effects run partly via income, suggesting that employment uncertainty is more than just a matter of financial resources.
2. The study also explores differences in the effects of men's economic characteristics across traditional and egalitarian societies in Europe. It finds that men's economic position is more influential in traditional societies, where gender roles are less symmetrical, compared to more egalitarian societies where costs of setting up a household are more often shared between men and women, leading to weaker effects of men's economic status on union formation.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 2}
