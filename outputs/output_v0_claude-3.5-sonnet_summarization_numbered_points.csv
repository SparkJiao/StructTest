<summary>

1. The paper examines transport properties of chaotic deterministic ratchets, specifically looking at the relationship between bifurcations in single-particle dynamics and current reversals for particle ensembles.

2. The authors emphasize the importance of considering ensemble characteristics (size, location, spread) and discarding transients when calculating currents in these systems.

3. They find that not all bifurcations lead to current reversals, and not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations, contradicting earlier conjectures.

4. A new heuristic is proposed: bifurcations often correspond to sudden changes (spikes or jumps) in the ensemble current, with current reversals being a special case of this.

5. The paper demonstrates that single-particle trajectories can behave very differently from ensemble averages, especially in chaotic regimes.

6. Hidden bifurcations are observed in some cases where current reversals initially appear to occur without corresponding bifurcations.

7. The authors note that while these heuristics are useful, they are not universally valid and there are cases where they do not apply.

8. The study concludes that further research is needed to understand when and why these heuristic rules hold or fail in chaotic deterministic ratchets.

1. The document describes a study of six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems, examining the possibility of additional planets in these systems.

2. The researchers used radial velocity measurements from various telescopes, including the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), to update orbital parameters for the known planets and search for additional companions.

3. Test particle simulations were conducted to determine regions of dynamical stability where additional planets could potentially exist in these systems.

4. Detection limit computations were performed to place constraints on the mass and orbital period of possible additional planets that could have been detected with the available data.

5. The study found no evidence for additional planets in any of the six systems, but was able to rule out the presence of certain types of planets (e.g., Neptune-mass) in some of the dynamically stable regions for some of the systems.

1. The paper studies rare Z-boson decays Z→Aγ, Z→AAA, and Z→Aγγ in four models that predict a light CP-odd Higgs boson A: Type-II 2HDM, Lepton-specific 2HDM, NMSSM, and nMSSM.

2. These rare decays could potentially be observable at a future high-luminosity Z factory (GigaZ option of ILC).

3. The authors perform scans over the parameter spaces of the four models, applying various theoretical and experimental constraints.

4. For Z→Aγ, the branching ratio can reach 10^-4 in the Type-II 2HDM, making it potentially observable at GigaZ.

5. For Z→AAA, the L2HDM predicts the largest branching ratio, up to 10^-5 in the optimal case.

6. The decay Z→Aγγ has much smaller branching ratios in all models, at most 10^-9 to 10^-11.

7. Z→AZ* can have the largest branching ratio among these rare decays, up to 10^-3 in some cases when the intermediate Z* can be on-shell.

8. The relative sizes of these decay rates in different models could help distinguish between them if observed.

9. In the nMSSM, A can be very light (<1 GeV), leading to Z→Aγ with BR up to 10^-6, but detection may be challenging due to collimated decay products.

2. Three scenarios are considered: universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale, and non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale.

3. The minimal scenario with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale is severely constrained by experimental bounds, especially when combining Higgs mass and b → sγ constraints.

4. For universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale, larger parameter regions are allowed, with potential for discovery at Tevatron Run 2 in some cases.

5. For non-universal gaugino masses, constraints vary depending on the nature of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) - wino-like, higgsino-like, or sneutrino.

6. The Higgs mass bound is particularly important for the higgsino-like LSP case, requiring higher mass scales that may be out of reach for Tevatron Run 2.

1. The paper investigates mechanisms to increase the minimum orbital period of cataclysmic variables (CVs) from the theoretical 65 minutes to the observed 78 minutes, and ways to eliminate the theoretically predicted but unobserved accumulation of systems near the minimum period (""period spike"").

2. The authors examine consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) and donor star deformation as potential explanations, but find that even maximal CAML efficiency cannot sufficiently increase the minimum period, and an implausibly large deformation factor is needed.

3. Various model populations are synthesized and tested against the observed CV period distribution using a modified chi-squared test, with none fitting as well as a simple flat distribution in orbital period.

4. Models that introduce a large spread in CAML efficiency or donor star deformation factors to ""wash out"" the period spike generally perform better than other models, but most cannot be unambiguously rejected based on statistical tests.

5. The results suggest that most CVs must have formed at long orbital periods and evolved through the period gap, consistent with evidence that CV secondary stars are somewhat evolved.

6. The authors conclude that the period minimum problem and period spike problem remain unresolved, though it is possible to construct model populations where the period spike is sufficiently washed out to not be ruled out unambiguously by statistical tests.

3. Analysis of high S/N composite spectra from both the authors' sample and H08's sample shows no significant FeII redshifts.

4. Low spectral S/N and the exclusion of HeII 4686 emission in H08's analysis likely led to the erroneous conclusion of systematic FeII redshifts.

1. The paper introduces the concept of shower parton distributions (SPDs) to describe hadron production in high-energy collisions, particularly for heavy-ion collisions.

2. SPDs are determined by fitting fragmentation functions (FFs) using a recombination model, where hadronization occurs through the recombination of shower partons.

3. The authors solve integral equations to obtain five SPDs (valence quark, sea quark, gluon-initiated, and two strange quark distributions) from known FFs.

4. The resulting SPDs show reasonable properties, with valence quarks being harder, sea quarks softer, and gluon jets having a higher density of shower partons.

5. The paper demonstrates the importance of SPDs in two applications: hadron production in a thermal parton environment and dihadron correlations in jets.

6. For hadron production in a thermal environment, thermal-shower recombination is shown to dominate over fragmentation at intermediate transverse momentum.

7. The dihadron correlation calculation illustrates that SPDs are necessary to describe correlations that cannot be adequately represented by FFs alone.

1. GRB 090510 is analyzed as a short gamma-ray burst (S-GRB) originating from a binary neutron star merger, with three distinct episodes: the proper GRB (P-GRB), prompt emission, and GeV emission.

2. The P-GRB spectrum is best fitted by a Comptonized component, interpreted as originating from a dyadotorus around a newly formed black hole.

3. The prompt emission analysis reveals inhomogeneities in the circumburst medium with an average density typical of galactic halos.

4. The GeV emission begins after the P-GRB, concurrent with the prompt emission, and is one of the most intense ever observed in any GRB.

5. The GeV emission is explained by accretion onto the newly-formed black hole, requiring either isotropic emission with significant accreted mass or beamed emission with a small opening angle.

6. The analysis supports the formation of a Kerr or Kerr-Newman black hole, with the GeV emission providing evidence for its rotation.

7. The theoretical redshift derived from the fireshell model (z = 0.75) closely matches the spectroscopically measured value (z = 0.903 ± 0.003).

3. In these models, the dependence of the W boson mass on the top quark mass becomes logarithmic rather than quadratic as in the SM.

4. The triplet model shows non-decoupling effects, meaning the SM is not recovered even when the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale.

5. In the triplet model, a Higgs boson mass as large as a few TeV is allowed by W boson mass measurements, due to cancellations between SM Higgs and triplet contributions.

2. The system is modeled using a Hamiltonian that includes both dispersive and reactive coupling between the waveguide and cavity.

3. The authors derive equations for the time evolution of the system operators and solve them to obtain steady-state solutions.

4. They calculate the expectation value of the output fields using input-output relations to investigate normal mode splitting.

5. Numerical analysis shows that normal mode splitting occurs only in the presence of reactive coupling, not with purely dispersive coupling.

6. The splitting increases with higher pump power when reactive coupling is present.

7. The reactive coupling also leads to the generation of an anti-Stokes field through four-wave mixing.

8. The authors conclude that reactive coupling is necessary to observe normal mode splitting in the output fields of this optomechanical system.

1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4,100 planetary candidates, but the current Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) list assumes all host stars are single. This leads to an underestimation of planetary radii by a factor of ~1.5 on average, if stars are unvetted for companions.

2. Vetting KOI host stars with radial velocity measurements and high-resolution imaging can significantly reduce this bias, lowering the average radius correction factor to ~1.2. For future missions like K2 and TESS, where target stars are closer, vetting can reduce the correction factor to just ~1.1.

3. Undetected stellar companions can impact planet occurrence rate calculations. Without vetting, the fraction of Earth-sized planets may be overestimated by up to 15-20%, while the fraction of Neptune-sized and larger planets may be underestimated by up to 30%. Proper vetting and accounting for stellar companions is crucial for accurate planet characterization and occurrence rate determination.

2. The accreting white dwarf model is a plausible explanation for SNe Ia, with two main evolutionary paths: the super soft X-ray source channel and the symbiotic channel.

3. Identifying companion stars of SNe Ia is crucial for confirming the evolutionary scenario, with one potential companion identified for Tycho's supernova remnant.

4. The paper proposes a direct method to prove a star is inside SN ejecta by observing absorption lines with broad blue wings in the visible spectrum.

5. The authors estimate the amount of Fe I in Tycho's supernova remnant ejecta and calculate spectra to identify absorption features in a potential companion star.

6. The probability of finding a non-companion star inside the ejecta is very low, making any star with the described absorption features likely to be the actual companion.

1. The paper studies the effects of static and time-dependent tension on semiflexible polymer looping using Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical models.

2. For static tension, even small forces around 100 femtonewtons can dramatically increase polymer looping time, especially for longer chains, due to chain connectivity effects.

3. With dichotomically fluctuating tension, the looping time shows a resonant minimum at an optimal flipping time, extending the concept of resonant activation to polymer systems.

4. The effects of both static and fluctuating tension are more pronounced for longer polymer chains.

5. The results are consistent with recent experiments on DNA looping under tension, and suggest polymers may be able to self-organize optimally using ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations in biological environments.

Key findings include: overlap integrals can vary by orders of magnitude as stars evolve; planets with orbital periods ≤1 day around a Sun-like star or ≤2 days around 1.5-2 solar mass stars will likely fall onto the star within its main sequence lifetime; and accounting for stellar evolution is crucial, as orbital decay may not occur without it.

1. The document discusses a conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies, involving scalar fields that break symmetry and lead to quark confinement in an anti-de-Sitter universe.

2. A light scalar field associated with confinement is proposed, with a mass estimated to be around 38 MeV based on quark-pair creation models.

3. Evidence for this light scalar particle (called σ') is presented from various experimental data, including interference effects and missing signals in particle decay processes.

4. The σ' is proposed to be a light scalar glueball that couples to quarks proportionally to their mass, similar to how mass couples to gravity.

LDA focuses on federal lobbying disclosure, while the IRC definitions cover state/local lobbying and grassroots lobbying as well. The definitions also differ in which government officials and subject matters are covered.

2. The choice of definition can significantly affect whether an organization must register under LDA and what information it must disclose. Using IRC definitions instead of LDA can result in organizations not registering, disclosing non-comparable information, or disclosing less than LDA intended. Options to address this include harmonizing the definitions, eliminating use of IRC definitions for LDA, or requiring only federal lobbying expenses when using IRC definitions for LDA.

1. Strategic sourcing, which involves taking an enterprise-wide approach to procurement, can yield significant cost savings and other benefits for federal agencies. However, most agencies have only applied strategic sourcing to a small fraction of their spending.

2. Major challenges to implementing strategic sourcing in federal agencies include: lack of reliable spending data, lack of expertise, insufficient leadership commitment, and inadequate metrics to measure success.

3. Leading companies in the private sector have successfully applied strategic sourcing to services procurement, achieving 4-15% savings by analyzing spending patterns, centralizing procurement knowledge, developing category strategies, and focusing on total cost of ownership.

4. While the federal government has recently taken some steps to expand strategic sourcing, much more needs to be done to increase its use, particularly for high-spend categories like services. Adopting private sector best practices could enable agencies to achieve significant savings.

2. A 2017 survey found that only 40% of federal managers reported having recent evaluations of their programs, unchanged from 2013, indicating a lack of progress in expanding evaluation capacity.

3. Managers who had evaluations reported they contributed to improving program management, assessing effectiveness, and sharing best practices, but were less useful for allocating resources or informing the public.

4. Top factors facilitating evaluation use included leadership support, staff involvement, and relevance to decision-makers, while lack of resources to implement findings was the main barrier.

5. Few managers reported that quarterly performance reviews of agency priority goals facilitated evaluation use, possibly due to limited involvement of mid-level managers in these reviews.

6. Agencies appear to have limited evaluation policies and consultation with Congress on evaluation agendas, representing missed opportunities to increase relevance and use of evaluations.

7. The report recommends that OMB direct agencies to prepare annual evaluation plans describing key questions and stakeholders consulted, to better target limited evaluation resources.

1. Social Security provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to millions of Americans, with disabled workers and dependents often relying heavily on these benefits. However, the program faces long-term financial challenges that may require benefit reductions.

2. Several potential Social Security reform options were analyzed, including changes to the benefit formula and cost-of-living adjustments. Most of these reforms would reduce benefits for disabled workers and dependents compared to currently scheduled levels.

3. Various options exist to protect vulnerable beneficiaries from benefit cuts, such as exemptions or enhanced COLAs for disabled workers. However, these protections come at a cost to program solvency and may create unintended incentives, so their impacts need to be carefully considered in any reform package.

1. The Medicare subvention demonstration allowed the Department of Defense (DOD) to create managed care organizations called TRICARE Senior Prime to enroll older military retirees. Under the demonstration, Medicare would pay DOD for enrollees' care, but only after DOD spent an amount equal to its historical spending on care for older retirees.

2. DOD's costs for providing care to Senior Prime enrollees in 1999 were much higher than expected, averaging $586 per enrollee per month compared to the $320 per month Medicare capitation rate. This was primarily due to higher utilization of services by enrollees rather than their health status. As a result of the high costs and payment rules, Medicare ended up owing DOD nothing for care provided to enrollees in 1999.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a parallel tax system with a broader base than the regular income tax, requiring some taxpayers to pay the higher of their regular tax or AMT liability.

2. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, causing an increasing number of taxpayers to be subject to the AMT over time.

3. Projections show a dramatic increase in AMT coverage, from less than 1% of returns in 1987 to over 6% by 2009, with a shift towards affecting more middle and upper-middle income taxpayers.

4. The AMT interacts with various tax provisions, potentially limiting or negating the benefits of tax cuts for some taxpayers, particularly those aimed at joint filers and families with children.

5. Marriage penalty relief provisions in recent tax legislation are significantly affected by the AMT, with a large portion of the intended tax cuts being ""taken back"" due to AMT interactions.

6. The cost of correcting or modifying the AMT is substantial, with estimates ranging from billions to tens of billions of dollars annually.

7. Various approaches to dealing with the AMT have been considered, including indexing exemptions, allowing credits to offset AMT liability, and potentially eliminating the AMT altogether.

8. The AMT's structure and base are subject to debate, with questions about which tax preferences should be included or excluded, and how to adjust the AMT in tandem with regular tax changes.

9. The growth of the AMT has been a known issue for some time, with its importance increasing with each new tax cut that does not address AMT adjustments, leading to higher future costs for potential reforms.

1. The document distinguishes between gross job loss (total jobs eliminated by contracting firms) and net job loss (when gross job losses exceed gross job gains), noting that gross job flows are much larger than net changes in employment.

2. Trade, outsourcing, and foreign investment typically cause gross job loss but not net job loss, as job losses in some sectors are offset by gains in others. Historical data shows no correlation between increased trade and higher unemployment.

3. Economic downturns are the primary cause of persistent net job loss, as insufficient aggregate demand leads to layoffs until spending revives. Fiscal and monetary policy can be used to boost demand and mitigate net job losses.

4. Policies that impede gross job loss (e.g. restrictions on layoffs) may be counterproductive, potentially reducing firms' willingness to hire and hampering efficient reallocation of labor.

5. While gross job loss has social costs, it is part of normal market functioning and helps reallocate resources efficiently as economic conditions change. Even during expansions, millions of jobs are lost and gained each quarter.

3. The CVVH circuit used a standard clinical filter with a 200 μm pore size and ran for 70 minutes, with samples taken at regular intervals.

4. EMP levels decreased rapidly during dialysis, with 50% clearance in the first 30 minutes and levels reduced to 29% of the starting concentration after 40 minutes.

5. Only 5.7% of the original EMP concentration was found in the dialysate after 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis.

6. The study demonstrates that counter-current dialysis using a standard CVVH filter can remove EMPs from circulation, supporting its potential as a therapeutic intervention for acute lung injury (ALI).

7. Limitations of the model include the saturable nature of EMP clearance and differences in relative volumes compared to human circulation.

8. The authors suggest that frequent filter changes, use of specialty filters with conjugated antibodies, and application of convection and pressure gradients could improve EMP clearance.

1. Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare congenital lesions of the liver, first described in 1857, with only about 103 cases reported worldwide. They have distinct histological characteristics including four layers: ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, subepithelial connective tissue, smooth muscle, and an outer fibrous capsule.

2. CHFCs are typically asymptomatic and found incidentally, but can sometimes cause abdominal pain. They are most commonly located in the median segments of the liver and can range in size from less than 1 cm to 24 cm. Imaging techniques like ultrasound, CT, and MRI can help identify these cysts, but definitive diagnosis requires histological examination.

3. The recommended treatment for CHFCs is surgical excision, especially for cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic lesions, or those with concerning features. Laparoscopic excision is becoming increasingly favored as a minimally invasive approach, particularly for cysts in easily accessible areas of the liver, as it offers effective removal with minimal morbidity.

1. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is crucial for tumor growth. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is a primary stimulant of angiogenesis, making it an important target for cancer therapy. Anti-VEGF treatments like bevacizumab, 2C3, and R84 have been shown to reduce tumor size, microvessel density, and macrophage infiltration in breast cancer models.

2. Inhibiting VEGF not only affects angiogenesis but also modulates the tumor microenvironment by reducing the infiltration of various immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. This dual effect on both blood vessel formation and immune cell infiltration makes anti-VEGF therapy a promising approach in cancer treatment, with potential for combination therapies and preventive use in the future.

1. The study used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to measure the flexural stiffness of myosin Va (MyoVa) motors and their subdomains.

2. Various MyoVa constructs were expressed and purified, including full-length, double-headed short (HMM), and single-headed (S1) versions.

3. Quantum dots were attached to the MyoVa constructs and their motion was tracked using long exposure imaging to sample the full range of particle motion.

4. The flexural stiffness of MyoVa constructs and subdomains was calculated based on the measured motion of the tethered quantum dots relative to actin filaments.

5. The MyoVa lever arm was found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0346 pN/nm and a persistence length of 242 nm.

6. Adding calcium reduced the lever arm stiffness by 40%, likely due to calmodulin dissociation.

7. The distal rod domain had a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm.

8. The lever arm/rod junction was found to be highly compliant, contributing to MyoVa's ability to maneuver through the actin cytoskeleton.

1. The study aimed to evaluate whether objectively measured sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL) in adults with overweight/obesity. Surprisingly, no significant relationship was found between physical inactivity and raised liver fat, and there was an unexpected weak positive association between VAT volume and time spent in moderate activity.

2. Traditional risk factors such as waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin were better predictors of VAT and IHL levels than objectively measured physical activity or sedentary behavior. The study suggests that while increasing incidental activity is important for overall energy expenditure, structured exercise programs may be more effective in reducing metabolically detrimental fat depots.

2. The genome is organized hierarchically into structures including chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs).

3. TADs are stable units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions, with boundaries associated with various factors such as CTCF and cohesin.

4. The study found that BRG1, a major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, contributes to TAD boundary strength and affects nucleosome occupancy.

5. BRG1 knockdown in human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells resulted in reduced TAD boundary strength and increased inter-TAD genomic interactions.

6. Analysis of nucleosome occupancy data showed decreased occupancy at CTCF-bound regions in BRG1 knockdown cells, suggesting BRG1 plays a role in regulating nucleosome positioning at TAD boundaries.

7. The study proposes that loss of BRG1 leads to reduced nucleosome occupancy at CTCF sites, either through loss of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity or by negatively impacting CTCF binding.

8. Evidence suggests a strong link between chromatin remodeling enzymes (including the mammalian SWI/SNF complex), architectural proteins, and topoisomerases in genome organization.

3. This study evaluated the blood half-life of the MPI signal from two versions of Resovist (by Bayer and Irom) in rabbits using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS).

4. The MPI signal in blood declined rapidly, reaching 30% of baseline after 5 minutes and dropping below detectable levels within 30 minutes.

5. Resovist from Irom showed a significantly faster signal decay compared to Bayer's version, despite no major differences in particle size or MPI performance.

6. The rapid MPI signal decay contrasts with MRI studies showing a longer second elimination phase, likely due to differences in signal generation between MPI and MRI.

7. Only a small fraction of Resovist particles contribute substantially to the MPI signal, explaining the faster decay of MPI signal compared to total particle concentration.

2. Protein aggregates associated with these diseases, such as amyloid-beta, tau, and alpha-synuclein, can be transmitted between cells and induce aggregation of their soluble counterparts in recipient cells.

3. Both fibrillar assemblies and oligomeric species of these proteins can be toxic to cells, though there is debate about which form is more harmful.

4. Different ""strains"" of misfolded protein aggregates may account for the variety of clinical presentations seen in diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

5. The spread and amplification of misfolded protein aggregates likely begins years before symptoms appear, suggesting early intervention could be an effective therapeutic strategy.

6. Current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are largely symptomatic, but new approaches targeting protein aggregation, clearance, and propagation are being explored.

7. Potential therapeutic strategies include using small molecules to interfere with protein aggregation, stimulating cellular clearance mechanisms, and developing antibodies or other binders to prevent uptake and spreading of protein aggregates.

1. The study followed 346 African American patients with chronic hepatitis C for an average of 8 years to evaluate outcomes and effects of interferon-based therapies.

2. Patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) had better outcomes, including protection from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and reversal of fibrosis.

3. Patients who were not treated, discontinued treatment, or did not respond to treatment had higher risks of developing HCC and new cirrhosis.

4. African American males were more likely to develop HCC than females, but achieving SVR reduced HCC risk in both genders.

5. Fibrosis at first visit was the only moderately predictive factor for HCC development in African Americans, while cirrhosis at first visit was not predictive.

6. The study found it difficult to predict HCC development in individual patients based on initial clinical visit data or lab values.

7. The findings suggest that surveillance for HCC may be warranted in African American patients with significant fibrosis, not just cirrhosis, and that viral elimination remains the optimal goal of therapy.

1. Methadone induces rises in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) in SH-SY5Y cells, leading to delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) in some cells. This effect is independent of opioid receptors and extracellular calcium.

2. Pharmacological experiments suggest that methadone-induced DCD is primarily caused by impaired mitochondrial calcium handling, rather than effects on plasma membrane calcium channels or opioid receptors.

3. Methadone treatment leads to changes in mitochondrial morphology, causing mitochondria to become shorter and rounder, which may be associated with mitochondrial damage and cell death.

4. Methadone affects mitochondrial calcium uptake in a manner similar to the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP, with the effect potentially depending on the available respiratory substrates. This alteration in mitochondrial calcium handling may contribute to the observed DCD and morphological changes.

2. Patients with delirium had significantly higher phenylalanine/tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) ratios, suggesting a deficiency in BH4, an essential cofactor for serotonin, dopamine, and nitric oxide production.

3. Lower tryptophan/large neutral amino acids (Trp/LNAAs) ratios were found in delirious patients, indicating potentially reduced serotonin production in the central nervous system.

4. Arginine levels were significantly lower in patients with delirium, while citrulline levels were borderline significantly lower, suggesting possible disturbances in nitric oxide production.

5. No significant differences were found in dopaminergic markers (Phe/LNAAs ratios, Tyr/LNAAs ratios, and homovanillic acid levels) between patients with and without delirium.

6. The findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and increased oxidative stress may play a role in delirium pathogenesis in this patient group.
