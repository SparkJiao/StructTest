We argue that it is crucial to factor out issues of size, location, spread, and transience in computing the \"current\" due to an ensemble before searching for general rules. We propose that bifurcations in single-trajectory behavior often correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system. Current reversals are a special case of this. However, not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation, nor vice versa. The open question is whether these rules are valid or violated near certain bifurcation points. We conclude that it is useful to find general rules of thumb, even if not universally valid, to understand the complicated behavior of non-equilibrium nonlinear statistical mechanical systems.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8, "n_subpoints": 1, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Magnetic fields or waves play a key role in heating the solar corona, converting convective energy in the photosphere to thermal energy via magnetic fields or wave energy. The primary energy source for this heating is in the convection zone below the solar photosphere, where there is 100 times as much energy available as required to heat the corona. The debate centers on whether the energy to heat the corona derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events. The coronal heating mechanisms can be classified as either wave or current heating, with wave heating being more likely due to the interaction of magnetic fields with convective flows.

{"idx": 21, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* The standard model of elementary particles (SM) has been very successful in describing the nature at the electroweak (EW) scale. Recently, the Atlas and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle that is consistent with the SM Higgs boson. This discovery strengthens the correctness of the SM. Currently, no explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM has been reported from the LHC. Several groups have reported an anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (\u03bcg-2), which has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions (e.g., see [xmath9] and references therein). The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than [xmath10], as listed in Table [tab: g-2]. Although it is too early to conclude that this anomaly is evidence of new physics beyond the SM, we expect new particles and interactions related with the muon sector once we regard it as a hint of new physics. Gauge interactions have been playing a central role in constructing fundamental models in particle physics history. Following this line, in this paper, we propose the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM. The measured \u03bcg-2 and the estimated differences from recent SM predictions in several references have been calculated. The most efficient interaction which induces the symmetry violation by the majorana masses is shown in Figure [fig: lambda]. Its rate is given by [xmath32], which is smaller than the hubble scale for [xmath38] gev. From the relation ( [eq: seesaw ] ), one can see that the condition ( [eq: constraint-m] ) is severer than the condition ( [eq: constraint-l] ). Therefore, it is enough to satisfy the condition ( [eq: constraint-l] ) in order for the washout not to occur. With the relation ( [eq: seesaw ] ), the condition is interpreted as [xmath43]. Since the right-handed neutrinos are light and weakly coupled, it is necessary to consider whether they are long-lived. If they are long-lived, they might over-close the universe or destroy the success of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The most important decay channel is given by the diagram shown in Figure [fig: decay of n].

{"idx": 22, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nIn recent years, the study of entanglement in quantum multipartite systems has attracted significant attention due to its unique properties in quantum information processing. The essential features and dynamical behavior of entanglement under the ubiquitous decoherence of relevant quantum systems have been extensively investigated. For example, it was found that the entanglement of qubits under the markovian decoherence can be terminated in a finite time, while the entanglement can revive after some time of esd. This phenomenon is detrimental to the practical realization of quantum information processing using entanglement. Surprisingly, some further studies indicated that esd is not always the eventual fate of the qubit entanglement. It was found that the entanglement can revive again after some time of esd, which has been observed in optical systems. The revival entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols, even in some occasions where esd does not happen. The entanglement dynamics has been studied in a double j-c model, where it was found that the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions but an identity (see below) has been satisfied at any time. This result is not surprising since the double j-c model has no decoherence and any initial information can be preserved in the time evolution. However, it would be surprising if the identity is still valid in the presence of decoherence, in which a non-equilibrium relaxation process is involved.

A dramatic change in the behavior of the top quark mass is observed in the left-right symmetric model, which illustrates the general feature that the scalar mass dependence in radiative corrections becomes logarithmic, contrary to the case of the SM where the scalar mass dependence is quadratic. Therefore, the prediction for the top quark mass in the SM is not consistent with experimental data. We summarize the results of the left-right symmetric model in Appendix [ lrmodel] and show that the prediction for the top quark mass in the SM depends on the top quark mass only logarithmically. In the left-right symmetric model, the prediction for the top quark mass in the SM is weakly dependent on the top quark mass, while in the SM, it is strongly dependent on the top quark mass.

Large-scale simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high-mass galaxies, and some processes must be stopped or ``quenched'' to prevent the galaxy from growing too big. The answer seems to lie in supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which nearly all massive galaxies harbor in their centers. SMBHs grow through accretion of cold material (AGN) and the huge loss of gravitational energy of the cold material is converted into radiation that is evident across the whole electromagnetic spectrum and manifests itself as a bright point source in the nucleus of galaxies. The AGN can deposit this energy into the ISM of its host galaxy through jets (e.g., * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; *", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "*"}}

{"idx": 43, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nIn the context of critical casimir forces (CCFs), we have investigated the interaction between two equally sized spherical colloids immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture and close to a laterally homogeneous substrate. We have analyzed the total normal and lateral forces acting on one of the colloids, focusing on the universal scaling functions of the many-body contributions to these forces. We have found that the many-body contributions to the normal and lateral forces are significant and exhibit a change of sign at fixed lateral positions of the colloids. This change of sign is likely an artifact of numerical precision and is expected to be a result of substrate-induced changes in the colloids' behavior. We have also calculated the many-body contribution to the normal force acting on the colloids and found that it changes sign for a fixed lateral distance between the colloids. This change of sign implies that the total normal force is zero for a given temperature, suggesting that the sum of pairwise forces provides a reliable description of the interactions of the system. We have compared our results with corresponding ones for quantum electrodynamic casimir interactions and found that the many-body contribution to the total van der Waals force decays with the atom-atom distance for large atom-atom distances. This decay is faster than the decay of the many-body contribution to the normal force, which is slower than the one for the normal ccf. Furthermore, we have found that the many-body contribution to the lateral van der Waals force is repulsive while the corresponding many-body ccf is attractive regardless of the set of bcs. Finally, we have considered the configuration in which the two colloids are vertically aligned with respect to the substrate and have found that the many-body contribution to the normal force is between 10 and 15 times larger than the corresponding many-body contribution to the normal ccf.

{"idx": 50, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has attracted significant attention in recent years. The main focus is on the central exclusive production (CEP) process, where the protons remain intact and the central system is separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap. Observations of any particle, such as a standard model Higgs boson, in the central exclusive channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers. Furthermore, by detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately, it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products. Because of these unique properties, forward proton detectors should be installed either side of the interaction points of Atlas and/or CMS. The FP420 collaboration has proposed to install detectors in the region 420 meters from the interaction points. These detectors would allow the detection of central systems in the approximate mass range 70 gev. The FP420 collaboration has also proposed to upgrade the capabilities of Atlas and CMS to detect protons in the 220 meters region. These detectors, when used in conjunction with 420 meters detectors, would extend the accessible mass range well beyond 70 gev. In this paper, we focus on the central exclusive production of the standard model Higgs boson and a supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson, with 70 gev. The CEP process is shown schematically in figure [centralexclusive]. For this mass region, the dominant decay channel of the Higgs boson is to decay to the SM Higgs boson, which is very difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches at the LHC because of the large QCD background. This is not the case in central exclusive production due to the selection rule that suppresses the leading order central exclusive cross section by a factor of 14, where m is the mass of the SM di-jet system. As we shall see, this renders the SM Higgs decay channel observable at the LHC in certain scenarios if appropriate proton tagging detectors are installed.

At low temperatures, they play an important role in diverse macroscopic properties such as the existence of long-range order, magnitude and temperature-dependence of the order parameter, nel temperature, spin correlations, etc. Specifically, in the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter to nearly 1/2 of the classical (HF) value. In two dimensions, the nel temperature is reduced to nearly 1/2 of the mean-field result, for the equivalent quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet (QHAF). Recently, spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies have also been studied in the quantum antiferromagnet. In the random-3 model, where the site density is set to zero on a fraction of sites, lattice-averaged AF order parameter appears to be enhanced for small values, as seen in QMC calculations. The problem of spin vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet is also relevant to electron-doped materials like the AF, where spin-dilution behavior is observed. The problem of magnon energy renormalization due to spin vacancies has been addressed recently, while the method of self-energy corrections has been limited to the low-concentration limit.

{"idx": 56, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nIn recent years, the study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory has received much attention in various areas of physics, particularly in cosmology. The work has been driven largely by inflation, the most successful known mechanism for explaining the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe and the small-scale inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the universe. The efforts in understanding inflation and its dynamics have redoubled. One area of particular interest is the dynamics of multi-field models of inflation in which the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation. These models can lead to a variety of features unavailable in the case of a single field. Such multi-field scenarios include the hybrid inflation models studied by A. D. Dolgov and A. D. Linde, which involve the coupling of two or more dynamical, interacting scalar fields (or higher spin fields). An important aspect of such systems is the possibility of mixing between the fields. In ref. , for example, the classical inflaton decay is investigated for a two-field model by solving the non-linear equations of motion on a grid. In ref. , the authors treat the problem of coupled quantum scalar and fermion fields at the tree level. Due to the small couplings involved in inflationary cosmology, such a tree level analysis is useful in a variety of physical situations. However, hybrid models as well as the dynamics of reheating typically include processes such as spinodal decomposition and parametric amplification which require one to go beyond the tree level by including quantum effects either in a perturbative expansion or by means of non-perturbative mean field techniques such as the Hartree approximation or a large- n expansion. Going beyond tree level brings in the issue of renormalization. The problem of renormalization of time evolution equations in single field models was understood several years ago.

{"idx": 60, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nIn a recent paper, Li et al. presented a new design for an optomechanical system that consists of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide. The design has several attractive features, including the ability to study reactive effects in optomechanical coupling. The origin of reactive coupling is explained in ref., and the design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state. The paper is organized as follows: in sec. ii, the physical system is introduced and the time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators are given and solved. In sec. iii, the expectation value of the output fields is calculated, and the nonlinear susceptibilities for stokes and anti- stokes processes are obtained. In sec. iv, we discuss normal mode splitting in output fields with or without reactive coupling. We find that there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling, but normal mode splitting occurs in the presence of reactive coupling. We consider the system shown in fig. [ fig1 ] in which a microdisk cavity is coupled to a freestanding waveguide. A strong pump field with frequency xmath0 and a weak stokes field with frequency xmath1 enter the system through the waveguide. The waveguide will move along the xmath2 direction under the action of the optical force exerted by the photons from the cavity.

However, recent investigations have shown that the theory is not entirely compatible with experimental observations, particularly in systems with different pair interactions. The kthny theory is criticized for assuming a dilute, unstructured lattice distribution of defects, which is inconsistent with the observed alignment and accumulation of dislocations into small angle domain walls. The kthny theory is also criticized for its inability to describe the thermodynamic equilibration of 2D systems, which is a key aspect of the melting phase transition. The study of the kthny theory has led to the realization that increasing the system size in particle simulations alone may not be sufficient to accurately describe the melting phase transition, as the length of the equilibration period also plays a crucial role in building up or destroying correlations.

{"idx": 69, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* The transition from a liquid to an amorphous solid, often associated with a sharp increase in characteristic relaxation times, is a largely unresolved problem in statistical physics. At the experimental level, the so-called glass transition is generally associated with a sharp increase in the characteristic relaxation times of the system, and a concomitant departure from equilibrium. At the theoretical level, it has been proposed that the transition from a liquid to a glassy state is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic (equilibrium) transition. In recent years, alternative theoretical considerations have attempted to establish a connection between glass transition phenomena and the rapid increase in relaxation times that arises in the vicinity of a theoretical critical temperature (mode coupling temperature). In molecular simulations, the value of the nonergodicity parameter (nonergodicity parameters) has been estimated from the time evolution of the partial structure factors, which can be calculated once the partial structure factors and their temperature dependence are sufficiently well known.

The plates act as a cavity where only the electromagnetic modes with nodes on both walls can exist. The zero-point energy (per unit area) when the plates are kept at close distance is smaller than when the plates are at infinite separation.

Region ii is replaced by an additional term added to the hamiltonian for region i, and which acts on the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii. The embedding scheme is derived using a trial function in which continuity in the small component across @xmath1 is imposed variationally. Expanding the wave function in a basis set of separate large and small component spinors, the problem of variational collapse is avoided by using a basis satisfying kinetic balance. Calculating the spectrum of a confined hydrogen atom using this embedding scheme is shown to be stable and converge to the exact eigenvalues. The embedding potential is derived and illustrated using the continuum regime of the same confined hydrogen system and an au / ag / au sandwich structure. The non-relativistic embedding scheme has been most widely used, and the discontinuous trial function is not permitted in quantum theory. The embedding scheme places no greater emphasis on a discontinuity in the small amplitude at @xmath1 than on an incorrect ( but continuous ) amplitude elsewhere within the embedded region. It aims merely to optimise the energy of the state, and will retain a discontinuity in the small component if in doing so it can better ( in terms of energy ) approximate the solution inside the embedded region. The discontinuous derivative of the trial function implies a probability current ( and electric current ) that is discontinuous across the embedding surface. This is similarly unphysical, yet numerous applications such as those cited above have demonstrated the utility and accuracy of the method. The embedding potential should be determined at the correct energy, ensuring that the derivative of the wavefunction is continuous across @xmath1.

{"idx": 103, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* The paper introduces a generalization of the one-dimensional (1D) parity-time symmetric (PT) nonlinear oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which may be used as fundamental building blocks for the construction of 1D PT-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. The authors propose four basic types of plaquettes, three of which in the form of four-site squares, and the final one in the form of the five-site cross, motivated by earlier work on cross-shaped vortex solitons in the discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The analysis of the bifurcation responsible for the termination of the pair of branches was found to be complex, with the bifurcation responsible for the termination of the pair of branches taking a degenerate form. The difference of such modes from the considered 1D PT-symmetric ones was found to be the fact that modes with the unbroken symmetry form a continuous family of solutions with energy, see eq. (e). This feature is shared by 1D PT-symmetric ones, due to the automatic \"balance between the separated gain and loss\". The breaking of the symmetry gives rise to the typical behavior of systems with competing, but not explicitly balanced, gain and loss, which generate a single or several attractors, i.e., isolated solutions with a single or several values of the energy, rather than a continuous family. The difference between continuous families of solutions in conservative models and isolated attractors in their (weakly) dissipative counterparts is already addressed in the relevant literature, as in the very recent work of C. M. Bender and S. Boettcher. The present work may pave the way to further considerations of two-dimensional PT-symmetric lattice systems, and even three-dimensional ones. In this context, the natural generalization is to construct periodic two-dimensional lattices of the building blocks presented here, and to identify counterparts of the modes reported here in the infinite lattices, along with new modes which may exist in that case. The first step that needs to be completed would consist of the examination of a 1D PT-symmetric cube composed of eight sites, and the nonlinear modes that it can support. This, in turn, may be a preamble towards constructing full three-dimensional PT-symmetric lattices. These topics are under present consideration and will be reported elsewhere. </summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "*"}}

Despite receiving much attention, their formation process remains enigmatic. Observations have revealed that massive stars can form via accretion (similar to low-mass stars) or through mergers of intermediate-mass stars. Advances in instrumentation have enabled sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at wavelengths less affected by large column densities of material that obscure regions at shorter wavelengths. Recent observations have uncovered the environment surrounding individual massive protostellar systems, including the presence of keplerian disks around four massive young stellar objects. High-resolution observations point toward an accretion formation scenario for massive stars. Further discrimination between the two competing models is possible by examining the properties of young stellar populations and the morphology of hot molecular cores.

{"idx": 120, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nQuantum entanglement in the context of quantum information processing is a feature of quantum mechanics that has captured much recent interest due to its essential role in quantum information processing. It may be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization, and it obeys a set of conservation laws. It proves useful in making quantitative predictions to quantify entanglement. When one has complete information about a bipartite system, subsystems with a well-established measure of entanglement are pure and there exists a well-established measure of entanglement, evaluated as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix, with a unity for the bell states and a conserved under local operations and classical communication. Unfortunately, quantum systems in nature interact with their environment; states of practical concern are therefore mixed, in which case the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear. Given an ensemble of pure states, a natural generalization of the weighted average is its conditional average. A difficulty arises when one considers that a given density operator may be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for this average entanglement. Various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem, most of which evaluate a lower bound. One such measure, the entanglement of formation, is defined as the minimal amount of entanglement required to form the density operator, while the entanglement of distillation is the guaranteed amount of entanglement that can be extracted from the density operator. These measures satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure set out by Horodecki et al. They give the value zero for the bell states, which might be thought somewhat counterintuitive, since this state can be viewed as representing a sequence of random \"choices\" between two bell states, both of which are maximally entangled. This is unavoidable, however, because assigning a non-zero value of entanglement would imply that entanglement can be generated by local operations. The problem is fundamental, stemming from the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state: the state provides an incomplete description of the physical system, and in view of the lack of knowledge, definitive measures of entanglement cannot be given. An interacting system and environment inevitably become entangled. The problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system is one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment. Complicating the situation, the state of the environment is complex and unknown. Conventionally, the partial trace with respect to the environment is taken, yielding a mixed state", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_subpoints": 3, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Colloidal crystals, whose optical properties can generate iridescent colours, provide a means by which photonic crystals may be produced. Further applications range from lasers to display devices, with recent advances demonstrating tunable colours through control of lattice spacing with an external field. Further to the practical importance of colloidal crystals, their well-defined thermodynamic temperature allows colloidal dispersions to be viewed as mesoscopic ` model atoms'. Recently, the ability to tune the colloid-colloid interactions has led to the observation of a wide variety of structures. Of particular interest here, to first order ac electric fields can induce dipolar interactions between the colloidal particles, leading to anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures, some of which are not observed in atomic and molecular systems. External control of the colloid-colloid interactions allows direct observation of phase transitions. Furthermore, direct microscopic observation at the single-particle level allows an unprecedented level of detail to be accessed. The introduction of a rotating ac field opens up even more possibilities. In this case, the dipolar interactions lead to an attraction in the plane of rotation and to repulsions above and below. Studies with a rotating magnetic field on granular matter indeed produced disc like patterns consistent with expectations. Unlike granular matter, since colloidal dispersions exhibit brownian motion, thermodynamic equilibrium structures (ie crystals) may be obtained. In previous work snoswell _ et_. _ _ showed that lattice spacing within quasi-2d colloidal crystals could be controlled in - situ. The interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field may be treated to first order as a circularly symmetric attraction, due to the time averaging effect of a rapidly rotating field (1000hz) on relatively large particles on the micron lengthscale, where the diffusive timescale is of the order of seconds.

It owes its popularity to its algorithmic simplicity: the cumbersome problem of tracking moving solid-liquid interfaces or grain boundaries is avoided by describing the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields.\n3. The phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods.\n4. The foundations of the phase-field method and its application to solidification have been the subject of several recent review articles @xcite .\n5. Several topics are discussed where robust phase-field modelling tools are not yet available because some fundamental questions remain open.\n6. In sec. 2, the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models is examined, and it is shown that the currently available approaches can not in general eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness.\n7. In sec. 3, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification are discussed, and it is shown that the standard equation of motion usually written down for the orientation field is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.\n8. Finally, in sec. 4, the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is reviewed, and it is shown that the standard approach can not be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.\n9. The common point of these topics is that they pose challenges or limitations for straightforward computations.\n10. Indeed, a characteristic feature of the phase-field method is that its equations can often be written down following simple rules or intuition, but that their detailed properties ( which have to be known if quantitative simulations are desired ) become only apparent through a mathematical analysis that can be quite involved.\n11. Therefore, it is not always easy to perceive the limits of applicability of the method.\n12. It is hoped that the present contribution will be helpful to point out some pitfalls and to stimulate further discussions that will facilitate the solution of these issues.\n13.

It is stimulated by the spectacular proposals for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases at the 3d free space. The recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in the confined geometry of optical traps has opened up ways to realize these phenomena. The method of developing a quantitative analysis of the 2d quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer has been proposed. The method is based on the method suggested in @xcite for the few-dimensional scattering which was successfully applied to the dipole-dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in the 3d free space. The key elements of the method are described in section ii. In section iii, the method is applied to the 2d scattering on the cylindrical potential with the elliptical base and the 2d dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles. The results of the analysis are presented in the form of the threshold formula for the scattering amplitude on the cylinder potential with the circular base and the results of the 2d scattering of polarized dipoles.

{"idx": 163, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* We address the above questions through an explicit calculation of the fermi surface topology in the framework of the kondo lattice model (klm). In its simplest form, the klm describes an array of localized magnetic moments of spin, arising from atomic orbitals coupled antiferromagnetically (af) via the exchange interaction (ex) to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons. We present detailed dynamical cluster approximation (dca) calculations aimed at investigating the klm ground state. For simulations within the magnetically ordered phase, we have extended the dca to allow for symmetry breaking antiferromagnetic order. The klm excludes charge fluctuations on the atomic orbitals and thus a strict constraint of one electron per localized atomic orbital is included. We introduce a next-nearest neighbor hopping with matrix element (ex) to give a modified dispersion (ex) -2 t ' \\left [ \\cos(k_{x}+k_{y} ) + \\cos(k_{x}-k_{y})\\right] . As we will see, the suppression of particle-hole symmetry due to a finite value of (ex) leads to dramatic changes in the scaling of the quasi-particle gap at low values of (x) and at half-band filling. We have considered the value (ex). This choice guarantees that the spin susceptibility of the host metallic state at small dopings away from half-band filling is peaked at wave vector (x). Thus, antiferromagnetic order as opposed to an incommensurate spin state is favored. To solve the model, we have used the dca approach which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the kondo effect but neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size. The standard formulation of dca is naturally translationally invariant. To measure orders beyond translation invariance, we have generalized to lattices with a supercell containing (x) unit cells of the original lattice. The reduced brillouin zone (rbz) is then spanned by (x) and (y) and we have set the lattice constant to unity. This supercell as well as the rbz (also coined magnetic brillouin zone (mbz)) are plotted in fig. (fig1).

The paper introduces a dispersion relation approach to calculate the Ward identities and gravitational anomalies.\n4. The paper compares the dispersion relation approach with the dimensional regularization procedure of T Hooft and Veltman.\n5. The paper shows that the Ward identities and gravitational anomalies can be calculated using dispersion relations.\n6.

{"idx": 178, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* The mott-hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid mott-insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. Recent suggestions to experimentally observe this transition in optical lattices have rekindled interest in the mott-insulator transition and triggered a great deal of theoretical and experimental activity. Possible applications include the use of a mott state of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice as a starting point for creating controlled multiparticle entanglement as an essential ingredient for quantum computation. The mott-insulator quantum phase transition is driven by the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy. Perturbation theory has been used to study this model analytically and numerically, with the gutzwiller mean-field ansatz and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method being used to improve the wavefunction. The key parameter in the system is the ratio of the onsite energy and the bandwidth, which forms the key parameter in the system. In optical lattices, this parameter can be easily controlled and varied by several orders of magnitude, enabling detailed studies of the quantum phase transition. Probing the system by taking absorption pictures to image the expansion patterns yields information about the momentum distribution of the state. The essential physics of trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic mott-hubbard model describing the competition between hopping and on-site interaction. A number of approximation schemes have been used to study this model analytically and numerically, using approaches like the gutzwiller mean-field ansatz, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), exact diagonalization (ED), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). In this article, we study the short-range correlations, not included by the gutzwiller ansatz, by using perturbation theory. The main purpose is to find corrections to the short-range behavior of the one-particle density matrix, which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns. These patterns are important for determining the location of the insulator-superfluid transition. We note that in the insulating state, our perturbative approach is identical to that used in @xcite (see also @xcite ), although there the goal was different, viz., studying corrections to the phase diagram.

{"idx": 179, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nIn the context of cosmology, scalar field matter models have been studied extensively, particularly in the context of inflation and late-time acceleration. Scalar fields arise naturally from compactifications of higher-dimensional theories, such as string or M-theory. The type of scalar field potential obtained in these compactifications is sufficiently restrictive that until recently it was considered difficult to get accelerating cosmologies. However, the existence of an accelerating phase in a hyperbolic universe obtained by compactification has been noted, and non-perturbative effects in M-theory have shown that unstable de-sitter vacua can lead to transient acceleration. The transient acceleration in these models is easily understood as the positive scalar field potential that both hyperbolic and flux compactifications produce in the effective, lower-dimensional action. This perspective also makes clear the generic nature of transient acceleration. For any realistic application, the lower-dimensional spacetime must be four-dimensional, but for theoretical studies, it is useful to consider a general six-dimensional spacetime. Assuming that we have gravity, described by a metric, coupled to scalar fields with a riemannian target space with metric, the effective action must take the form * where * is the ricci scalar.

{"idx": 192, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nIn recent years, rapidity gaps, which are pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at the HERA and Tevatron colliders. These gaps are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state, and the survival probability of rapidity gaps. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without soft interactions between other partons in the scattering hadrons. The two- and three-gluon exchange models predict a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon initiated processes compared to the two- and three-gluon exchange approximation. The unitarized two- and three-gluon exchange models are capable of fitting the present Tevatron data, but the formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence and its ubiquity asks for a theoretical explanation within QCD. The unitarization of hard elastic quark and gluon scattering is not unique, but any acceptable method must preserve the successful description of hard dijet events by perturbative QCD. The phase shift approach used here fulfills this requirement: the unitarization does not change the born-level predictions for the color averaged differential cross sections. The situation is entirely different when considering the color singlet exchange component introduced by the exchange of two or more gluons or by unitarization. The color singlet exchange fractions can be described in terms of a single universal phase, which absorbs all non-perturbative effects. This suggests a unified phenomenological description of the rapidity gap data, via the gap survival probability and the phase. Such an analysis goes beyond the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of rapidity gap fractions which have just become available, and should best be performed directly by the experimental collaborations.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_subpoints": 1, "symbol": "*"}}

The axial anomaly arises from the interaction between fermions and photons, and it has been shown to be related to the chiral limit and the infrared interpretation. The paper discusses the different mechanisms by which the axial anomaly can be related to the breaking of a given symmetry, including the presence of a term independent of the fermion mass in the divergence of the axial current. The paper also explores the implications of the axial anomaly for the radiative decays of charged leptons and the chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 3, "n_subpoints": 3, "symbol": "*"}}

{"idx": 238, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n\u2022 The inventor has designed a novel sanitizable rotary valve that combines elements previously found in the valve art but adds a unique feature of partial (sealed) separation of the rotor-stator faces to allow flushing across the process fluid-contacting surfaces. This partial separation would normally result in sanitizing fluid leaking out of the valve, leading to non-aseptic operation, but a novel diaphragm-like elastomeric seal has been invented which functions to both seal the two faces together in normal use and retain sanitizing process fluids when the faces are partially separated for cleaning. This design allows the unique sanitary operation of the valve that is disclosed herein, enabling the ability to sanitize in place (SIP) without disassembling the valve. \n\u2022 The unique operation of the valve is performed by a new type of slider (or rotary) valve shown specifically in a rotary carousel diaphragm valve which has a thermoplastic elastomeric diaphragm integrally molded to form the multiple sealing ports of the rotor face. Ports or grooves molded into the face of the elastomeric diaphragm are positioned to sealably engage grooves or ports in the stator face, and to form sanitary elastomeric tubular ducts leading through the body of the rotor, terminating as elastomeric flanges. These flanges permit direct connection to sanitary piping flanges within the carousel which lead to and from multiple columns or other solid phase bed segments. \n\u2022 To permit periodic sanitization and cleaning of the port sealing faces of the stator and rotor, the external limit of the elastomeric rotor diaphragm is molded to form a flexible wiping lip seal which maintains fluid-tight sealing engagement with the face of the stator even when the rotor is moved orthogonally away from the stator far enough to permit cross flushing of the port sealing faces. \n\u2022 In the preferred embodiment, the required sealing force is minimized by relieving material from either the surface of the stator or from the rotor diaphragm to form port-sealing ledges and adjoining gutters. The gutters may carry a barrier fluid stream which is used to capture and sweep away any process fluid which escapes from the port seals. This feature prevents accumulation of dried material which may damage the sealing faces, and ensures containment of material which might otherwise constitute an environmental hazard to workers in the area. \n\u2022 The invention is directed to a sliding multi-port diaphragm valve having at least two inner surfaces, comprising: a rotor having a body wherein the inner surface", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

They have other applications such as allowing a pulling force to be transmitted from the surface to the fish or other object.\n<summary>\nFeatures: The tool described above has an outer body with a lower end that is attached to a stuck object or fish. It has a mandrel connected to the surface through a string and a passage in the string that allows pressure to be delivered to the fish or other object. The tool has a dump valve that is annularly shaped to keep the middle of the tool free and clear. This allows a central passage to exist to permit a wireline operation through the tool when the tool is not set up to be in vibratory mode. The tool can be simply put in vibratory mode by dropping a removable plug onto a seat. The dump valve opens and closes without getting slammed against a seat. The mandrel is powered by stacked pistons in the tool body to magnify the delivered power from the vibratory tool. The tool can be configured so that the pistons can travel their entire stroke without being banged against travel stops. The tool has the capability to tolerate continued downward mandrel movement to dissipate its momentum even after the dump valve opens. The components are then configured to apply power to the mandrel for a down cycle when the dump valve closes close to the point where the pistons reach their upward travel limit. The tool can be run to apply up oscillating forces with or without impacts depending on how the tool is operated by rig personnel.\n<summary>\nAdvantages: The tool has a modular design that allows selection of the number of pistons and the power delivery from the dump valve.

{"idx": 291, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nField of the Invention\nThe present invention pertains generally to retaining walls. Specifically, the invention relates to an apparatus and method of installation for a completely precast concrete retaining wall of the type typically used alongside highways and railways.\nBackground of the Invention\nVarious retaining wall systems have been developed for use in retaining soil on an embankment. In a conventional retaining wall design, one of the major design criteria that must be considered is the pressure exerted on the foundation at the front of the base (toe) of the wall system. This becomes particularly limiting in tall vertical walls with sloping backfill. Conventionally designed cantilevered walls reduce the pressure at the toe by providing a lever arm perpendicular to and behind the wall face upon which the vertical load of the backfill acts, creating a moment opposite in direction to the moment due to the horizontal force of the backfill material on the wall face. This moment is increased for design purposes by increasing the area of the moment arm until a suitable toe pressure is reached and a suitable factor of safety against overturning is reached.\nSummary\nThe present invention provides an apparatus and method for constructing a retaining wall that allows for taller walls and shorter bases by pre-manufacturing parts of the wall to be transported to and assembled at the site. Using pre-manufactured assembly components will save both installation and transportation costs. Generally, a precast, substantially solid rectangular or trapezoidal base is set on grade at the job site, and a face panel with an integral counterfort is set upright on the base with a connection joining them together. Temporary shoring is not required with this assembly. As soon as the face panel and counterfort are set on the base, it can withstand temporary wind loads immediately. The invention is flexible in that the height or width of any of the individual components can vary over a wide range. All of the pieces of the assembly can easily be made to custom sizes.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

No. 4,061,389 and is directed specifically to the improvement that promotes effective connection of a pull tool to a down hole object or fish and simple and effective disconnection of the pull tool from the article if such is desired. \n\nApplication of shocks to the pulling tool will sometimes result in disconnection, thereby enabling service personnel to remove the wire line pulling tool and substitute a tool and wire line of substantially heavier gauge. Application of mechanical shocks to the down hole equipment of the well and the wire line tool itself can easily cause failure or excessive wear of one or more of these mechanical components. It is desirable, therefore, to provide down hole service equipment, such as wire line controlled pulling tools, that will effectively become interconnected with down hole objects such as wire line tools, fish, etc., and, in the event disconnection is necessary, will readily become disconnected upon simple mechanical movement of a wire line controlled pulling tool. \n\nSummary of the Invention\nThe present invention may effectively take the form of an external pull tool or overshot that is adapted for use in well servicing operations or an internal pull tool or spear, depending upon the particular service operation that is involved. Although not restricted particularly to wire line service operations, the invention is effectively adapted to be provided on a wire line controlled pulling tool and run into the well casing or well bore for the purpose of establishing a mechanical connection with an object positioned in the well bore and applying sufficient force thereto to remove the object from the well. Whether the pulling tool takes the form of an external overshot or an internal spear, in each case, the tool structure takes the form of an outer tubular body having an inner body structure disposed in movable relation therein. Telescoping movement of the inner and outer body structures of the tool causes the overshot or spear to selectively move into gripping relationship with the object that is to be removed from the well bore. The tubular outer body is secured about the inner body by means of a catch mechanism having a locking position and an unlocking position, depending upon the relative positions of the inner and outer body structures.

When a person on the ladder reaches outside the rails, the center of gravity shifts causing one or both rails may slide along the work surface, thereby damaging the work surface.\n* Another problem with typical ladders is that the siderails of the ladder rest on the work surface with a very small contact area which sometimes dents, scrapes, bruises or otherwise defaces the work surface. It is desirable to have a ladder that contacts the work surface with a broad surface area that does not deface the work surface.\n* With typical ladders, a work surface with a corner presents a problem.

The method includes compressing the gas at least during individual intervals to a substantially higher pressure (excess pressure) than the desired exit pressure, cooling the compressed gas by the heat exchange to a temperature above the exit temperature, and obtaining the further cooling to the desired exit temperature by expanding the gas from the excess pressure to the desired exit pressure. A compressor station for a gas pipeline for carrying out the above-described method includes at least one compressor for compressing gas, at least one heat exchanger for cooling compressed gas, additionally valve-controlled pipelines for connecting the compressor and the heat exchanger to one another and to the gas pipeline, as well as control units for controlling the compressor and the valves. The invention starts from the fact that it is known to carry out the compression of a gas supplied at an entry pressure below the nominal pressure (rated pressure of the gas pipeline) to an increased pressure, wherein the compression can be carried out in a single stage or in multiple stages in compressors which are connected in series. Between the compressor stages and particularly after the last compressor stage, cooling by heat exchange takes place (usually air/gas heat exchange), in order to reach the required lower exit temperature of at most 0\u00b0 C., preferably -5\u00b0 C., for the re-entry of the compressed gas into the gas pipeline. During the warmer period of the year, in which the use of re-cooling units was necessary in the past for ensuring the required exit temperature, the present invention provides for a different type of cooling.

The enclosure is fitted with enclosure intake portals to allow ambient air to enter the enclosure interior to replace the air exhausted by cooling fan assembly 12.\n\u2022 The height of turned-out portions is less than or equal to the height of recessed portions. This allows adjacent components to directly abut the exterior of the enclosure.\n\u2022 The compression force of spring member 48 is applied to move turned-out portions fully into recessed portions, while rotating force 56 repositions resilient legs 36 into an intermediate sized opening of opening 42. Residual opening 60 is sized smaller than enlarged opening 44 but not as small as intermediate opening 58.\n\u2022 The urging function of spring member 48 assists in preventing vibrational noise between motor carrier 32 and panel 14 and also prevents resilient leg portions 36 from \"backing out\" of their respective residual openings.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

{"idx": 336, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* The present invention provides a novel implementation of a queue, particularly a FIFO-type queue (First In First Out), in a memory. The solution in accordance with the invention is intended for use specifically in connection with functional memories. By a functional memory is understood a memory in which updates, such as additions, are carried out in such a way that first the path from the root of a tree-shaped structure to the point of updating is copied, and thereafter the update is made in the copied data (i.e., the update is not directly made to the existing data). Such an updating procedure is also termed \u201ccopy-on-write\u201d.  \n* The invention is based on a tree-shaped data structure in which the nodes have a given maximum size and in which (1) additions of data units (to the queue) are directed in the tree-shaped data structure to the first non-full node, seen from below, on the first edge of the data structure and (2) deletions of data units (from the queue) are also directed to a leaf node on the edge of the tree, typically on the opposite edge. Furthermore, the invention is based on the idea of implementing the additions in such a way that the leaf nodes remain at the same hierarchy level of the tree-shaped data structure, which means that when such a non-full node is not present, new nodes are created to keep the leaf nodes at the same hierarchy level. The tree-shaped data structure will also be termed shortly a tree in the following.  \n* When the solution in accordance with the invention is used, each update to be made in the functional environment requires a time and space that are logarithmically dependent on the length of the queue, since only the path leading from the root to the point of updating must be copied from the structure. The length of this path increases logarithmically in relation to the length of the queue. (When a FIFO queue contains N nodes, log N nodes shall be copied, where the base number of the logarithm is dependent on the maximum size of the node.)  \n* Furthermore, in the solution in accordance with the invention the node to be updated is easy to access, since the search proceeds by following the edge of the tree until a leaf node is found. This leaf node provides the point of updating.  \n* In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the data structure also comprises a separate header node comprising three elements, each of which may be empty or contain a pointer, so that when one element contains a pointer it points to a", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_subpoints": 3, "symbol": "*"}}

With this invention, a wide range of applications is intended, such as television sets, monitors, etc.\nBackground of the Invention\nA known shielding device of this kind is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,465 and consists of an undeformable U-shaped shaft section of flanged plastic plate material. The shaft section is placed upside down over the housing of the screen, i.e. with the legs of the shaft section pointing downwards. Thus, the body of the shaft section rests on the upper side of the housing, while its legs are on either side of the screen. In the extended position, the shaft section projects from the housing beyond the displaying screen and prevents irritating reflections of natural light and/or artificial light on the glass of the screen, thereby rendering the image shown on the displaying screen clearer. The known shielding device is collapsible by pushing it over the housing into a position in which the shielding device does not project beyond the screen.\nSummary of the Invention\nThe object of the invention is to provide an improved extendable shielding device. For this purpose, the light-shielding device according to the invention is characterized by a number of annular strips concentrically nested and essentially enclosing one another in a tight manner, which strips are suitable to be fixed in front of a displaying screen and in that case surround the screen, said strips furthermore being suitable to slide over one another between a pushed-in position, in which they essentially cover one another, and a pushed-out position, in which they are essentially uncovered.\nThus, it is possible to fold the light-shielding device around the displaying screen so that it is of very small size. In the folded-in state, the shielding device takes up relatively little space and therefore does not form an obstruction. Furthermore, the light-shielding device according to the invention can easily be fitted to a screen, for example using Velcro.\n<summary>\nCharacteristics of the Light-Shielding Device\nThe light-shielding device according to the invention consists of as few parts as possible, is inexpensive to produce, operates reliably and can easily be fitted to a monitor.\n<summary>\nApplications of the Light-Shielding Device\nThe light-shielding device according to the invention is intended for use in television sets, monitors, etc.\n<summary>\nAdvantages of the Light-Shielding Device\nThe light-shielding device according to the invention consists of", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_subpoints": 1, "symbol": "*"}}

The majority of videoconference meetings are currently implemented using expensive, dedicated equipment such as manufactured by PictureTel\u2122. Typically, such equipment provides not only video conferencing, but also other virtual co-location tools. Because of its cost and size, this equipment is typically located in a dedicated \"videoconference room\", rather than at individual users' desktops. Such systems are used, primarily, as a means of reducing operating costs, such as air travel for the purpose of conducting face-to-face meetings. \n\nRecently, much more economical, PC-based products have been introduced to the market. Examples of current products that can be used to create a shared working environment include Intel Corporation's ProShare\u2122 and Microsoft Corporation's NetMeeting\u2122. These PC-based products are relatively low cost (in some cases free of charge) and are sufficiently small as to enable mass deployment on every networked PC of an enterprise LAN. Unlike dedicated conference room equipment, PC-based products can be viewed as workplace enhancements, providing added value to personal communications, rather than as tools for corporate cost reduction. \n\nSummary of the Invention\nAccording to the present invention, a system is provided for initiating a collaborative work-share environment between two or more parties to a telephone call, without complex and time-consuming setup processes as are common in the prior art. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, each party to a telephone call is provided with a collaboration button and an indicator on their telephone set. When the indicator is illuminated, the system is capable of establishing a work-share environment. In response to one of the parties activating the collaboration button, the system causes network enabled applications to run on the individual users' desktop computers so that the parties are able to share information between themselves, conduct a video conference, etc., while maintaining their initial voice connection. \n\nImplementation Examples\nIn its broadest aspects, the present invention is a method and apparatus for simple spontaneous setup of a shared workspace. \n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_subpoints": 3, "symbol": "*"}}

This offset estimate is then introduced at the input of the sampler by combining it digitally with the output of the predictive filter.\n* This invention is distinguished from prior art described in the references listed in the Prior Art section in four major aspects. First, the placement of the sampler inside the predictive loop allows the predictive filter to be implemented using DSP techniques, thus reducing the complexity of the overall converter plus adding flexibility in re-programming the predictive filter characteristics, which results in improvement in the converter dynamic range and noise performance. Second, operating the predictive encoder in a subharmonic mode allows the predictive loop to downconvert the signal and realize a further reduction in the complexity of the digital logic used in implementing the predicting digital filter. Third, using the digital predictive loop output to control the gain level applied to the input signal allows further increase of the dynamic range of the converter.

{"idx": 403, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n* Surface transportation programs are not addressing the nation's transportation challenges effectively. Post-interstate-era programs addressing highway, transit, and safety are an agglomeration that has been established over half a century without a well-defined vision of the national interest and federal role. Many surface transportation programs are not linked to performance of the transportation system or grantees, as most highway, transit, and safety funds are distributed through formulas that only indirectly relate to needs and may have no relationship to performance or outcomes. The programs often do not use the best tools or best approaches, such as using more rigorous economic analysis to select projects. Finally, the fiscal sustainability of the numerous highway, transit, and safety programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund is in doubt, as a result of increased spending from the fund without commensurate increases in revenues. Since the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 funded the modern federal highway program, the federal role in surface transportation has expanded to include broader goals, more programs, and a variety of program structures. Although most surface transportation funds remain dedicated to highway infrastructure, federal surface transportation programs have grown in number and complexity, incorporating additional transportation, environmental, and societal goals. While some of these goals have led to new grant programs in areas such as transit, highway safety, and motor carrier safety, others have led to additional procedural requirements for receiving federal aid, such as environmental review and transportation planning requirements. This expansion has also created a variety of grant structures and federal approaches for establishing priorities and distributing federal funds. Most highway infrastructure funds continue to be distributed to states in accordance with individual grant program formulas and eligibility requirements. However, broad program goals, eligibility requirements, and authority to transfer funds between highway programs give state and local governments broad discretion to allocate highway infrastructure funds according to their priorities. Although some transit formula grant programs also give grantees considerable discretion to allocate funds, a portion of transit assistance requires grantees to compete for funding based on specific criteria and goals. Similarly, basic safety formula grant programs are augmented by smaller programs that directly target federal funds to specific goals and actions using financial incentives and penalty provisions. We have found that many federal surface transportation programs are not effective at addressing key transportation challenges, such as increasing congestion and growing freight demand, because federal goals and roles are unclear, and many programs lack links to needs or performance. The goals of federal surface transportation programs are numerous and sometimes conflicting, which contributes to a corresponding lack of clarity in the federal role.

The contractor team of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Helicopter Company were expected to design a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing the primary missions of armed reconnaissance and attack. Critical to achieving these capabilities are the successful development of advanced technologies, including composite materials, advanced avionics and propulsion systems, and sophisticated software and hardware. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals in order to realize significantly lower operating and support costs predicted for this program and achieve a wartime operational availability for the Comanche of 6 hours per day. In December 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program as part of efforts to meet budgetary constraints. The Secretary\u2019s restructure decision reduced funding for the program from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. In addition to extending the development phase by 3 years, it also called for two flyable prototypes to be produced and the Comanche production decision to be deferred. DOD approved the proposal in March 1995. The Army\u2019s restructuring of the Comanche program continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required and of higher program costs. According to DOD\u2019s April 1990 guidelines for determining degrees of concurrency, a program with high concurrency typically proceeds into low-rate initial production before significant initial operational test and evaluation is completed. Regarding the need to keep concurrency low, the guidelines note that establishing programs with no concurrency, or a low degree of concurrency, avoids the risks that (1) production items have to be retrofitted to make them work properly and (2) system design will not be thoroughly tested. As we recently reported, aircraft systems, including the T-45A and C-17, that entered low-rate initial production before successfully completing initial operational testing and evaluation experienced significant and sometimes costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance. Under the Army\u2019s restructured program, operational testing will not begin until after the low-rate initial production decision is made, continuing the risks associated with the highly concurrent Comanche program. In responding to the Secretary\u2019s restructure decision, the Army proposed, and was subsequently granted approval, to buy six \u201cearly operational capability\u201d aircraft, in addition to the two prototypes that were to be acquired under the Secretary\u2019s decision.

FNS funds food stamp benefits and about half of the states' administrative costs and establishes regulations for implementing the Food Stamp Program. FNS regulations require that states certify household eligibility at least annually and establish requirements for households to report changes that occur after they are certified. Recently, FNS introduced several options and waivers to food stamp rules and regulations in order to increase program access and reduce the reporting burden on working families while minimizing the potential for payment errors. These include options and waivers related to program eligibility, reporting requirements, extending food stamp benefits to households leaving TANF, and options related to TANF recipients. To monitor program accountability, FNS\u2019s quality control system measures states\u2019 performance in accurately determining food stamp eligibility and calculating benefits. States implement the Food Stamp Program by determining whether households meet established limits on gross income and assets, calculating monthly benefits for eligible households, and issuing benefits to households. The actual amount of the food stamp benefit is based on household income after certain deductions\u2014including shelter, dependent care, and child support. To be eligible for benefits, a household\u2019s gross income may not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level and the value of its assets may not exceed $2,000. If the household owns a vehicle worth more than $4,650, the excess value is included in calculating the household\u2019s assets.

FNS gave states the option to extend categorical eligibility to families receiving TANF-funded benefits or services. States can determine which TANF-funded services or benefits confer categorical eligibility to food stamps. FNS offers two options that states can use to allow households to own a vehicle worth more than the amount allowed in current regulations and remain eligible for food stamp benefits. One option allows states to replace the federal food stamp vehicle asset rule with the vehicle asset rule from any TANF assistance program, as long as the rule is more liberal than the federal rule.

As the Government Performance and Results Act and SSA experience suggest, IRS will also need support for its long- and short-term goals from congressional stakeholders. IRS\u2019 telephone customer service workforce represents a substantial human capital investment in providing assistance to taxpayers. To get the most from this investment, IRS must be able to target scarce training resources where they are most needed to optimize call center and network performance, minimize turnover of trained and experienced customer service representatives to avoid unnecessary recruiting and training expenditures, and determine how its individual or collective human capital policies and practices affect its ability to achieve customer service goals and how changes in one or more human capital management practices will affect other practices. However, until IRS establishes a system for assessing competency gaps to identify the refresher training needs of individual customer service representatives, it cannot effectively target scarce training resources to meet individual training needs. Without a system for monitoring attrition, identifying its causes, and using the information gathered from that system to develop, as appropriate, strategies for dealing with the attrition of customer service representatives, IRS cannot ensure that its recruiting and training resources are used efficiently.

It is also a critical resource supporting vital services, such as power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense. The Internet relies upon a set of functions, called the domain name system, to ensure the uniqueness of each e-mail and Web site address. The rules that govern the domain name system determine which top-level domains (the string of text following the right-most period, such as .gov) are recognized by most computers connected to the Internet. The heart of this system is a set of 13 computers called \u201croot servers,\u201d which are responsible for coordinating the translation of domain names into Internet addresses. Appendix I provides more background on how this system works. The U.S. government supported the implementation of the domain name system for nearly a decade, largely through a Department of Defense contract. Following a 1997 presidential directive, the Department of Commerce began a process for transitioning the technical responsibility for the domain name system to the private sector. After requesting and reviewing public comments on how to implement this goal, in June 1998 the Department issued a general statement of policy, known as the \u201cWhite Paper.\u201d In this document, the Department stated that because the Internet was rapidly becoming an international medium for commerce, education, and communication, the traditional means of managing its technical functions needed to evolve as well. Moreover, the White Paper stated the U.S. government was committed to a transition that would allow the private sector to take leadership for the management of the domain name system. Accordingly the Department stated that the U.S. government was prepared to enter into an agreement to transition the Internet\u2019s name and number process to a new not-for-profit organization. At the same time, the White Paper said that it would be irresponsible for the U.S. government to withdraw from its existing management role without taking steps to ensure the stability of the Internet during the transition. According to Department officials, the Department sees its role as the responsible steward of the transition process. Subsequently, the Department entered into an MOU with ICANN to guide the transition. ICANN has made significant progress in carrying out MOU tasks related to one of the guiding principles of the transition effort\u2014increasing competition. However, progress has been much slower on activities designed to address the other guiding principles: increasing the stability and security of the Internet; ensuring representation of the Internet", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6, "n_subpoints": 1, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Their first initiative, undertaken in that year, was the Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR) project, which aimed to create an electronic interface that would allow physicians and other authorized users at VA and DOD health facilities to access data from any of the other agency's health information systems. The interface was expected to compile requested patient information in a virtual record that could be displayed on a user's computer screen. In our reviews of the GCPR project, we determined that the lack of a lead entity, clear mission, and detailed planning to achieve that mission made it difficult to monitor progress, identify project risks, and develop appropriate contingency plans. In 2001, we recommended that the participating agencies (1) designate a lead entity with final decision-making authority and establish a clear line of authority for the GCPR project and (2) create comprehensive and coordinated plans that included an agreed-upon mission and clear goals, objectives, and performance measures, to ensure that the agencies could share comprehensive, meaningful, accurate, and secure patient health care data. In 2002, we recommended that the participating agencies revise the original goals and objectives of the project to align with their current strategy, commit the executive support necessary to adequately manage the project, and ensure that it followed sound project management principles.

Along with using interagency contracts to leverage their buying power, a number of large departments\u2014DOD and DHS in particular\u2014are turning to enterprisewide contracts as well to acquire goods and services. Enterprisewide contracts are similar to interagency contracts in that they can leverage the purchasing power of the federal agency but generally do not allow purchases from the contract outside of the original acquiring activity. Enterprisewide contracting programs can be used to reduce contracting administrative overhead, provide information on agency spending, support strategic sourcing initiatives, and avoid the fees charged for using interagency contracts. All of these contracts are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts. ID/IQ contracts are established to buy goods and services when the exact times and exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of award. Once the times and quantities are known, agencies place task and delivery orders against the contracts for goods and services.

The aged dependency ratio, which is the ratio of workers to retirees, will rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% by 2030.\n5. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is not only occurring because of the growing numbers of older persons but also due to the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers over the last decade.\n6. Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives to work longer. Social Security provides monthly benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers and their dependents, and to survivors of insured workers. These benefits are the primary source of income (more than 50%) for nearly 57% of the population age 65 and older.\n7. In April 2000, the practice of reducing Social Security benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age (currently 65 years and 4 months) was eliminated, at least in part to remove the disincentive to work.\n8. Also, the delayed retirement credit for persons who first claim benefits after the normal retirement age is steadily being increased until it reaches 8% per year in 2008.\n9. Prior to these increases, those who chose to work beyond normal retirement age might receive less Social Security over their lifetime because the start of their benefit receipt was delayed.\n10.

This type of fee-for-service procurement process generally involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services. The requiring agency officials determine the goods or services needed and, if applicable, prepare a statement of work, sometimes with the assistance of the ordering agency. The contracting officer at the ordering agency ensures that the contract or order is properly awarded or issued (including any required competition) and administered under applicable regulations and agency requirements. If contract performance will be ongoing, a contracting officer's representative\u2014generally an official at the requiring agency with relevant technical expertise\u2014is normally designated by the contracting officer to monitor the contractor's performance and serve as the liaison between the contracting officer and the contractor.

VA's CIO has recently initiated an effort to transform the focus and functions of the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), in response to the Secretary's goal of achieving a more veteran-focused organization. The CIO's transformation strategy, initiated in January 2016, calls for OI&T to focus on stabilizing and streamlining processes, mitigating weaknesses highlighted in GAO assessments, and improving outcomes by institutionalizing a new set of IT management capabilities. As part of this transformation, the CIO began transitioning the oversight and accountability of IT projects to a new project management process called the Veteran-focused Integration Process in January 2016, in an effort to streamline systems development and the delivery of new IT capabilities. The CIO also intends to establish five new functions within OI&T: The enterprise program management office is to serve as OI&T's portfolio management and project tracking organization.

The Trust Fund was established by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA's two capital accounts\u2014the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account\u2014which provide grants to airports and funds for modernizing the air traffic control system, respectively. The Trust Fund also provides funding for the Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account and supports part of FAA's Operations account. To fund these accounts, the Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through the dedicated excise taxes. In fiscal year 2006, the ticket tax was the largest single source of Trust Fund revenue, followed by the international departure and arrival tax, the passenger segment tax, and fuel taxes (see table 1 for a description of current taxes). The administration's reauthorization proposal would change FAA's financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges. Under the proposed system, funding for ATO would come primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft. In addition, contributions from the General Fund would be appropriated to FAA to cover ATO costs of providing services to military and other public aircraft, flight service stations, and a few other services. Funding for AIP, EAS, and part of RE&D would come from an equal fuel tax on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers. Funding for Safety and Operations would include some fees, but mostly General Fund contributions.

Financial transactions could be delayed, flights grounded, power lost, and national defense affected. Moreover, America's infrastructures are a complex array of public and private enterprises with many interdependencies at all levels. These many interdependencies among governments and within key economic sectors could cause a single failure to have adverse repercussions. Key economic sectors that could be seriously affected if their systems are not Year 2000 compliant include information and telecommunications; banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; power and water; and manufacturing and small business. The information and telecommunications sector is especially important. In testimony in June, we reported that the Year 2000 readiness of the telecommunications sector is one of the most crucial concerns to our nation because telecommunications are critical to the operations of nearly every public-sector and private-sector organization. For example, the information and telecommunications sector (1) enables the electronic transfer of funds, the distribution of electrical power, and the control of gas and oil pipeline systems, (2) is essential to the service economy, manufacturing, and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods, and (3) is basic to responsive emergency services.

Respondents reported that they modified benefit formulas, converted some plans to hybrid plans, or froze some plans. For example, 81% of responding sponsors reported that they modified the formulas of one or more of their DB plans. Respondents were asked to report changes for plans or benefits that covered only nonbargaining employees, as well as to report on plans or benefits that covered bargaining unit employees. Fifty-eight% of respondents who reported on plans for collective- bargaining employees indicated that they had generally increased the generosity of their DB plan formulas between January 1997 and the time of their response (see app. I, slide 12). In contrast, 48% of respondents reporting on plans for their nonbargaining employees had generally decreased the generosity of their DB plan formulas since 1997. \u201cUnpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements\u201d was the key reason cited for having changed the benefit formulas of plans covering nonbargaining employees (see app. I, slide 14). \u201cGlobal or domestic competitive pressures\u201d in their industry was the key reason cited for the changes to the plans covering collectively bargained employees (see app. I, slide 13). With regard to plans for bargaining employees, a number of the sponsors who offered reasons for changes to bargaining unit plans also volunteered an additional reason for having modified their plans covering bargaining employees. Specifically, these sponsors wrote that inflation or a cost-of- living adjustment was a key reason for their increase to the formula. This suggests that such plans were flat-benefit plans that may have a benefit structure that was increased annually as part of a bargaining agreement. Meanwhile, sponsors were far more likely to report that they had converted a DB plan covering nonbargaining unit employees to a hybrid plan design than to have converted DB plans covering collectively bargained employees.

The Division of Investment Management administers the securities laws affecting funds and advisers.

Finally, SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement investigates and prosecutes violations of securities laws related to mutual funds. SEC regulates mutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Investment Company Act was passed specifically to regulate mutual funds and other types of investment companies. Under the act, mutual funds are required to register with SEC, subjecting their activities to SEC regulation. The act also imposes requirements on the operation and structure of mutual funds. Its core objectives are to ensure that investors receive adequate and accurate information about mutual funds, protect the integrity of fund assets, prohibit abusive forms of self-dealing, prevent the issuance of securities that have inequitable or ensure the fair valuation of investor purchases and redemptions. The Investment Advisers Act requires mutual fund advisers to register with SEC, imposes reporting requirements on them, and prohibits them from engaging in fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative practices.

Hospital insurance, or part A, covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and certain home health services. Supplemental medical insurance, or part B, covers physician and outpatient hospital services, laboratory and other services. Claims are paid by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers. Intermediaries process claims from hospitals and other institutional providers under part A while carriers process part B claims. The intermediaries\u2019 and carriers\u2019 responsibilities include: reviewing and paying claims; maintaining program safeguards to prevent inappropriate payment; and educating and responding to provider and beneficiary concerns. Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from that of most federal programs. Most federal agencies, under the Competition in Contracting Act and its implementing regulations known as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), generally may contract with any qualified entity for any authorized purpose so long as that entity is not debarred from government contracting and the contract is not for what is essentially a government function. Agencies are to use contractors that have a track record of successful past performance or that demonstrate a current superior ability to perform. The FAR generally requires agencies to conduct full and open competition for contracts and allows contractors to earn profits. Medicare, however, is authorized to deviate from the FAR under provisions of the Social Security Act enacted in 1965. For example, there is no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts. Rather, intermediaries are selected in a process called nomination by provider associations, such as the American Hospital Association. When one of the local Blue plans declines to renew its subcontract, the Association nominates the replacement contractor. Carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers, and the number of such companies seeking Medicare claims-processing work has been dwindling in recent years. The Social Security Act also generally calls for the use of cost-based reimbursement contracts under which contractors are reimbursed for necessary and proper costs of carrying out Medicare activities but does not expressly provide for profit. Further, Medicare contractors cannot be terminated from the program unless they are first provided with an opportunity for a public hearing\u2013\u2013a process not afforded under the FAR. Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms. Freeing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities able to perform needed tasks would enable Medicare to benefit from efficiency and performance improvements related to competition.

The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) also addresses the protection of personal information in the context of securing federal agency information and information systems. The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her name or another personal identifier. It also defines \u201csystem of records\u201d as a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public by a \u201csystem-of-records notice\u201d: that is, a notice in the Federal Register identifying, among other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of data, and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct personal information. Among other provisions, the act also requires agencies to define and limit themselves to specific predefined purposes. For example, the act requires that to the greatest extent practicable, personal information should be collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an individual\u2019s rights or benefits under a federal program. The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee; these principles were intended to address what the committee termed a poor level of protection afforded to privacy under contemporary law. Since that time, the Fair Information Practices have been widely adopted as a standard benchmark for evaluating the adequacy of privacy protections. Attachment 2 contains a summary of the widely used version of the Fair Information Practices adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 1980. The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems and information collections by requiring that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA).

When they do conduct eligibility determinations, the quality of the determinations varies. Without performing annual determinations, an essential management control, FSA cannot identify estates being kept open primarily to receive these payments and be assured that the payments are proper. Generally, under the 1987 Act, once a person dies, farm program payments may continue to that person\u2019s estate under certain conditions. For most farm program payments, USDA regulations allow an estate to receive payments for the first 2 years after the death of the individual if the estate meets certain eligibility requirements for active engagement in farming. However, FSA must annually determine that the estate is still active and that obtaining farm program payments is not the primary reason it remains open. Despite these limitations, FSA field offices in 16 of the 26 states we reviewed made less than one-half of the required determinations of their estates from 1999 to 2005. The percentage of estates reviewed by FSA ranged from 0 to 100 percent in the states we reviewed. FSA field officials also found that FSA lacked sufficient personnel and time, and competing priorities for carrying out farm programs, which explains why many determinations were either not conducted or not conducted thoroughly. Despite these shortcomings, officials told us that they would investigate these cases for potential receipt of improper payments and would start collection proceedings if they found improper payments. FSA cannot be assured that millions of dollars in farm program payments it made to thousands of deceased individuals from fiscal years 1999 through 2005 were proper because it does not have appropriate management controls, such as computer matching, to verify that it is not making payments to deceased individuals. In particular, FSA is not matching recipients listed in its payment databases with individuals listed as deceased in the Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File. In addition, complex farming operations, such as corporations or general partnerships, make it difficult for FSA to prevent improper payments to deceased individuals. FSA paid $1.1 billion in farm program payments in the names of 172,801 deceased individuals\u2014either as individuals or as members of entities, from fiscal years 1999 through 2005, according to our matching of FSA\u2019s payment databases with the Social Security", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Despite small rates of growth in the total enrollment of all K-12 children, the enrollment of school-aged children with limited English proficiency across the United States grew exponentially between school years 1989-90 and 1997-98 (see fig. 1). While California, Florida, New York, and Texas continue to have the largest number of children with limited English proficiency (see fig. 2), other states that previously had small populations of such children have experienced large increases in recent years.

The 1994 reauthorization of BEA created the four bilingual education grant programs\u2014Program Development and Implementation Grants (PDI), Program Enhancement Projects (Enhancement), Comprehensive School Grants (Comprehensive), and Systemwide Improvement Grants (Systemwide)\u2014to distribute funds directly to school districts serving children with limited English proficiency.

While full address canvassing helped ensure the accuracy of the address list, we believe it was also very costly. According to Bureau decision documents leading up to the 2010 Census, the Bureau canceled planned research on the feasibility of targeting its canvassing when prioritizing its research agenda early in the decade given its funding levels. As part of the Bureau\u2019s effort to conduct the 2020 Census at a cost lower than the 2010 Census, the Bureau is researching the feasibility of conducting targeted address canvassing, verifying addresses in only select areas that are more likely to require updates to the address list. To support targeted address canvassing, the Bureau plans to increase its reliance on other previously used sources of updates, including U.S. Postal Service files, commercial database files, and significant input from state and local governments. For example, GSS-I is working to allow government agencies at all levels to more regularly share and update their address lists with the Bureau throughout the decade (rather than solely 2 years prior to the decennial, as had been the case in prior decennial censuses) so that fewer areas need to be fully canvassed.

The act was substantially overhauled in 1970, and EPA has set national ambient air quality standards for pollutants at levels that are necessary to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety and to protect public welfare from adverse effects. EPA has established standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. In addition, the act directed the states to specify how they would achieve and maintain compliance with the national standard for each pollutant. The Congress amended the act again in 1990. The major provisions of the 1990 amendments are contained in the first six titles. As requested, this report addresses EPA\u2019s actions related to Titles I, III, and IV: Title I establishes a detailed and graduated program for the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards; Title III expands and modifies regulations of hazardous air pollutant emissions and establishes a list of 189 hazardous air pollutants to be regulated; Title IV establishes the acid deposition control program to reduce the adverse effects of acid rain by reducing the annual emissions of pollutants that contribute to it. Although the Clean Air Act is a federal law, states and local governments are responsible for carrying out certain portions of the statute. For example, states are responsible for developing implementation plans that describe how they will come into compliance with national standards set by EPA. EPA must approve each state\u2019s plan, and if an implementation plan is not acceptable, EPA may assume enforcement of the Clean Air Act in that state. Once EPA sets a national standard, it is generally up to state and local air pollution control agencies to enforce the standard, with oversight from EPA. For example, state air pollution control agencies may hold hearings on permit applications by power or chemical plants. States may also fine companies for violating air pollution limits. According to EPA, by many measures, the quality of the nation\u2019s air has improved in recent years. Each year EPA estimates emissions that impact the ambient concentrations of the six major air pollutants for which EPA sets national ambient air quality standards. EPA uses these annual emissions estimates as one indicator of the effectiveness of its air programs.

The empirical evidence indicates that capital gains income is heavily concentrated in the upper income ranges. It is probable that large capital losses are also concentrated in the same income ranges. Taxpayers in the middle income ranges tend to hold capital gains producing assets as part of tax favored retirement savings plans. The benefits of increasing the net capital loss deduction would tend to accrue to taxpayers in the upper income ranges. It is also unclear whether increasing the net loss deduction would stimulate the economy. Economic analysis suggests that measures to stimulate the economy should focus on spending or on tax cuts likely to be spent, that will directly increase aggregate demand. An expanded deduction for capital losses has a tenuous connection to expanded spending; thus, presumably, the argument is that such a tax benefit will benefit the stock market. However, it is not at all certain that an increase in loss deduction would increase the stock market; it might increase sales of poorly performing stocks and depress these markets further. This report provides an overview of these issues related to the tax treatment of capital losses. It explains the current income tax treatment of losses, describes the historical treatment of losses, provides examples of the tax gaming opportunities associated with the net loss deduction, examines the distributional issues, and discusses the possible stimulative effects of an increase in the net loss deduction. Under current income tax law, a capital gain or loss is the result of a sale or exchange of a capital asset (such as corporate stock or real estate). If the asset is sold for a higher price than its acquisition price, then the sale produces a capital gain. If the asset is sold for a lower price than its acquisition price, then the sale produces a capital loss. Capital assets held longer than 12 months are considered long-term assets while assets held 12 months or less are considered short-term assets. Capital gains on short-term assets are taxed at regular income tax rates. Gains on long-term assets sold or exchanged on or after May 6, 2003, and before January 1, 2013, are taxed at a maximum tax rate of 15%. For these assets, the maximum long-term capital gains tax rate is 0% for individuals in the 10% and 15% regular marginal income tax rate brackets.

The AMT base is broader than the regular tax base, but there are many provisions that are not included in its base, notably the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds. The elimination of the capital gains exclusion in 1986 caused a significant contraction in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT; the current rate preferences are not part of the AMT. Credits are automatically included in the base (i.e., effectively disallowed), although under provisions adopted as part of H.R. 1836 , this rule does not apply to the most important credit, the child credit. \u2022 The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation. The result has been an increase in the number of taxpayers who are covered by the AMT. \u2022 In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, constituting 1/10 of one percent of all returns filed. This number was below the 4/10 of a percent of returns that paid the tax in 1984 and fell largely because the deduction for capital gains was eliminated by the 1986 tax act and therefore automatically affected coverage under the AMT. \u2022 The AMT coverage has increased over time, with the AMT covering 823,000 returns, constituting 6/10 of a percent of all returns filed, an increase in percentage share of 600% between 1987 and 1999. This effect occurred eventhough the exemptions were increased in 1990. \u2022 The AMT would probably constitute a larger share of joint returns filed, since incomes are higher for these returns than for single returns. The AMT would also constitute a larger portion of returns with tax liability; since typically about a quarter of returns filed pay no tax, taxpayers on the AMT would constitute over 8% of", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6, "n_subpoints": 2, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Title I of the annual THUD appropriations bill generally funds DOT. The department is primarily a grant-making and regulatory organization. Its programs are organized roughly by mode of transportation, providing grants to state and local government agencies to support the construction of highways, transit, airport, and intercity passenger rail infrastructure, while overseeing safety in all modes of transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is exceptional among DOT's large sub-agencies in that the largest portion of its budget is not for grants but for operating the U.S. air traffic control system. In support of that task, it employs over 80% of DOT's total workforce, roughly 46,000 of DOT's approximately 56,000 employees. Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill generally funds HUD. The department's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs\u2014Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance\u2014account for the majority of the department's funding. Two block grant programs\u2014the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)\u2014help communities finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families. Other, more specialized grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons, including those with AIDS.

Indian leaders regularly speak of \"civilizational ties\" between the two countries, a reference to the interactions of Persian and Indus Valley civilizations over a period of millennia. As U.S. relations with India grow deeper and more expansive in the new century, some in Washington believe that New Delhi's friendship with Tehran could become a significant obstacle to further development of U.S.-India ties. However, India-Iran relations have not evolved into a strategic alliance and are unlikely to derail the further development of a U.S.-India global partnership. At the same time, given a clear Indian interest in maintaining positive ties with Iran, especially in the area of energy commerce, New Delhi is unlikely to abandon its relationship with Tehran, or accept dictation on the topic from external powers. Many in Congress voice concern about India's relations with Iran and their relevance to U.S. interests. Some worry about New Delhi's defense relations with Tehran and have sought to link this with congressional approval of U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation.

{"idx": 550, "result": 0, "generated": "* The federal government first supported a program for energy storage and electric power system technology during the 1970s, before the establishment of the Department of Energy (DOE). In those early days, the program was focused mainly on energy storage\u2014especially to even out the variable power production from rapidly growing use of wind and solar technologies\u2014but also to support large coal and nuclear power plants. The advancement of computer capacity, miniaturization, and industrial controls has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows. The subsequent increase in networking of computerized devices for grid data collection and control advanced the ability of operators to anticipate, avoid, and otherwise mitigate potential power crises, such as blackouts. However, in more recent years, Internet-connected networks have become vulnerable to unwanted computer-driven intrusions and disruptions, revealing a new cybersecurity challenge for electric power systems. The nation's energy infrastructure is diverse. It includes a variety of transmission and distribution system network structures (electricity, oil, and natural gas), an array of operating models (public and private), and a variety of hardware and software. The energy sector consists of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically. Thus, interdependency within the sector and across the nation's critical energy infrastructure sectors is significant. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the virtually borderless nature of energy use and the reliance on predominantly privately-owned infrastructure. Key challenges and opportunities facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure (transmission, storage, distribution, and generation); modernizing and securing communication networks (e.g., analog to digital); accommodating new end-use technologies (for solar and other distributed resources); planning for increased interdependencies of natural gas, water, and electricity systems; and devising business models to manage the challenges while providing reliable and affordable electricity. These activities are constrained by the need for cost control, physical security, cybersecurity, improved system resiliency, and the flexibility to adapt to weather and market uncertainties. Further opportunities arise from growing use of shale gas production and decreasing costs for information technologies which allow improved grid control and more opportunities for customer management of power use. The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is charged with a mission to support more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure.

These nonenforcement, under enforcement, or delayed enforcement decisions have generally been implemented through stated agency policies directing officials not to take action to ensure compliance with statutory requirements that federal law imposes upon a third party. Notably, these policies have been grounded in practical or policy considerations, and have not been based on any argument that the statutory provisions themselves are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Instead, the Administration has largely justified its inaction as consistent with a proper exercise of enforcement discretion, a legal doctrine that generally shields executive branch enforcement decisions, including the determination of whether to initiate a criminal, civil, or administrative enforcement action, from judicial review. This report focuses on two distinct forms of enforcement discretion: prosecutorial discretion, exercised in the criminal context; and administrative enforcement discretion, exercised in the administrative context. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has cited prosecutorial discretion as the basis for its efforts to curtail the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in states that have adopted both medical and recreational marijuana legalization initiatives. Although the possession, cultivation, or distribution of marijuana remains a clear federal crime, the DOJ has directed federal prosecutors to \"not focus federal resources [] on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana.\" Rather, U.S. Attorneys have been directed to prioritize investigative and prosecutorial resources on persons whose actions relate to identified federal priorities such as distribution to minors, the participation of criminal enterprises and cartels, or the use of marijuana on federal property. In 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security relied on the doctrine of administrative enforcement discretion in a memorandum setting forth guidelines on how to \"enforce the Nation's immigration laws against certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home.\" The directive provided that, rather than use limited agency removal resources on low priority deportation cases, immigration officers should exercise their discretion to forego enforcement actions, for at least a period of time, against a specific class of individuals who unlawfully entered the United States as children, have not committed certain crimes, and meet other key requirements.

{"idx": 561, "result": 0, "generated": "\u2022 Campus-based financial aid programs, including FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loan, were created under the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide supplemental financial aid to students who demonstrated financial need. These programs operate alongside other federal aid programs and benefit students with varying degrees of need. The campus-based programs are unique in that they are designed to provide aid to students who are eligible for other federal aid programs, such as Pell Grants and Direct Loans. The campus-based programs are considered campus-based because federal funds are awarded directly to participating institutions, rather than being allocated to individual IHEs. The campus-based programs' authorizations of appropriations, along with many other provisions under the HEA, expired at the end of FY2015. The FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, most recently through the Continuing Appropriations Act 2018 (P.L. 115-56), which extended funding for the programs through December 8, 2017. The Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 (Extension Act; P.L. 114-105 ). The Extension Act prohibits future appropriations for the Perkins Loan program and prohibits an automatic extension of it under the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA; P.L. 90-247, as amended). The campus-based programs are among the oldest of the federal financial aid programs. As federal aid has largely transitioned to a system that allows for \"portability\" in receipt of student aid, meaning that most forms of aid are made available to students at whichever participating institution a student chooses to attend, the campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort. For example, of the approximately $125 billion of federal aid that was made available to students through programs authorized under the HEA in FY2016, 76% was through the Direct Loan program, 21% through the Pell Grant program, and 2% through the campus-based aid programs. The HEA authorizes most of the federal programs that provide direct financial aid to postsecondary students. As lawmakers consider reauthorization of the HEA, several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered. These include the extent to which the campus-based programs provide types of aid that are not provided via other postsecondary aid programs, whether", "format_properties": {"n_points": 3, "n_subpoints": 3, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The act refers to career and technical education (CTE) rather than vocational and technical education. Perkins IV retains the overall purpose of the act, making technical changes. It retains the overall structure of the Perkins Act. Sections 1 through 9 deal with certain overarching provisions, such as purposes of the act (Section 2), definitions that apply throughout the act (Section 3), and authorization of appropriations (Section 9). Title I of the act authorizes and specifies the central provisions of the act dealing with assistance to states for career and technical education. Title I-A deals with allotments and allocations. Title I-B specifies state provisions. Title I-C details local provisions. Title II of the act authorizes the tech-prep program. Title III contains general provisions related to federal administration of the program (Part A) and state administration (Part B). Section 9 of P.L. 109-270 authorizes appropriations for Title I of the act, except for three sections that have separate authorizations: Section 114, dealing with national activities; Section 117, authorizing funding for tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institutions; and Section 118, authorizing funds for occupational and employment information.

The two nations, which fought together in many of America's wars and established the Australia-New Zealand-United States (ANZUS) alliance in 1951, are once again close security partners in the Asia Pacific and beyond. New Zealand's nuclear policies in the mid-1980s that prohibited nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered ships from entering New Zealand ports led the United States to restrict bilateral defense cooperation with New Zealand. For many years this difference largely defined the relationship between the two nations. Recent developments, while not restoring the formal alliance relationship, have greatly bolstered practical aspects of the two nation's bilateral defense and security cooperation as well as reaffirmed an overall close United States bilateral relationship with New Zealand. The extent to which the nuclear issue had been put into the past was demonstrated when President Obama invited Prime Minister John Key to attend the Nuclear Summit in April 2010 and stated that New Zealand had \"well and truly earned a place at the table. \" New Zealand was the only non-nuclear state invited to the conference. Several organizations and groups, some involving Members of Congress, help promote bilateral ties between the United States and New Zealand, including the United States-New Zealand Council in Washington, DC, and its counterpart, the New Zealand-United States Council in Wellington; the Friends of New Zealand Congressional Caucus and its New Zealand parliamentary counterpart; and the more recent Pacific Partnership Forum.

S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The law requires mandatory reporting to expire on September 30, 2015. Livestock industry stakeholders supported the reauthorization of the act, and producer groups put forward proposals amending mandatory reporting. The House passed a reauthorization bill (H.R. 2051) in June 2015. In September 2015, the Senate amended the House-passed bill, and Congress reauthorized LMR until September 30, 2020, in the enacted Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54). Before mandatory price reporting was enacted by Congress in 1999, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price and related market information from meat packers on a voluntary basis under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. \u00a71621 et seq.). AMS market reporters collected and reported prices from livestock auctions, feedlots, and packing plants. The information was disseminated through hundreds of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual written and electronic USDA reports on sales of live cattle, hogs, and sheep and wholesale meat products from these animals. The goal was to provide all buyers and sellers with accurate and objective market information. By the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone many sweeping changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, more production specialization, and more vertical integration (firms controlling more than one aspect of production). Fewer animals were sold through negotiated (cash; or \"spot\") sales, and more frequently sold under alternative marketing arrangements (e.g., formula sales based on a negotiated price established in the future) with prices not publicly disclosed or reported. Some livestock producers, believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine \"fair\" market prices for livestock going to slaughter, called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat. USDA had estimated in 2000 that the former voluntary system was not reporting 35%-40% of cattle, ", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The U.S. Department of Treasury has imposed special measures to regulate and monitor financial flows, including Department of Treasury advisories for enhanced scrutiny over financial transactions and five special measures listed under 31 U.S.C. 5318A.

The Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2007 (H.R. 3890) would prohibit the importation of gems and hardwoods from Burma, among other restrictions. After more than a decade of applying sanctions against Burma, many analysts conclude that the sanctions have done little to change the situation. The effectiveness of U.S. sanctions is limited by several factors, including unevenly applied sanctions against Burma by other countries and international organizations, a booming natural gas production and export industry, continued unwillingness of Burma's fellow members in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to impose economic sanctions against Burma, historical isolation from the global economy, and China's continued economic and military assistance to Burma. In addition, some analysts suggest that sanctions are, in part, culpable for the flourishing black markets in Burma, including trafficking in humans, gems, and drugs, because legal exports are barred. The United States is assisting neighboring countries with stemming the flow of trafficked contraband from Burma into their territories. The United States is working to train law enforcement and border control officials in neighboring countries through anti-crime assistance programs.

The 2008 amendments are expected to reduce illegal logging, which will reduce corrupt practices and increase biodiversity and conservation in timber-supplying countries, and increase revenues for foreign and domestic companies that sell and process wood. The 113 th Congress has addressed the 2008 amendments with proposed legislation. H.R. 3324 would amend the Lacey Act so that importers would need to possess and make available certain information about the plant or plant products being imported. Currently, importers are required to file this information. The bill would amend the rulemaking authority of the Secretary to give more flexibility for specifying the applicability of declaration requirements. H.R. 3280 would amend the Lacey Act to exempt plants and plant products imported before May 22, 2008, from the Lacey Act. This section reviews the implementation of declaration requirements, enforcement, and funding under the 2008 amendments. Policy issues associated with implementation are discussed below in \" Issues and Legislative Options .\" Under the Lacey Act, all plants or plant products being imported into the country must be declared, with some exceptions that include common cultivars, packaging material, and scientific specimens, among other things. The declaration is to be made by the importer at the time of import. The declaration requirements in the 2008 amendments are expected to facilitate accountability and improve data collection on plant imports. Similar declaration requirements are used for the import of wildlife to the United States.

Both types of payments will be available to producers with annual agreements with USDA. The measure maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiencypayments as they are now, with changes in most loan rates. The new law, which covers the 2002-2007 crop years, brings soybeans and the minor oilseeds (e.g., sunflowers, etc.) fully under the support program rules that apply to grains and cotton. In a major departure from the past, FSRIA redrew the support system to operate like that for grains, oilseeds, and cotton, instead of the traditional system of peanut marketing quotas and nonrecourse price support loans. The new counter-cyclical program will be decoupled from current output, with producer payments not tied to prices or current production. However, the program is expected to cause U.S. spending to exceed $19.1 billion, raising concerns about the U.S. commitment to open trade. The new program also would increase federal costs, or reduce assistance levels for major commodities. The FSRIA also would perpetuate past patterns tying aid to output rather than economic need, and some critics argue that farm programs are not \"welfare\" but rather part of a larger policy to ensure U.S. agriculture remains competitive in the global economy.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "*"}}

The classification of gram-positive bacteriocins is challenging due to their heterogeneity and the continuous evolution of classification schemes. Enterococcal strains isolated from various ecosystems have been characterized as antagonists of broad-range foodborne pathogens. Enterocin s37, a peptide produced by e. faecalis, was isolated from chicken feces and has been studied for its antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

In 1997, the UK Department of Health introduced clinical governance (CG) as a strategy for improving quality of health care services. The classic definition of CG is provided by Scally and Donaldson as a system through which health organizations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish. The IRAN Ministry of Health and Medical Education (Mohme) has applied CG as a framework for improving quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009. The CG model consists of seven interlocking components, including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information. The system awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication are considered as a foundation of this model. The IRAN Medical Universities have developed a qualitative research method to explore senior managers' viewpoints on CG implementation barriers and facilitators. The study found that sufficient knowledge and clear understanding about the principles and practice of CG have major roles in achieving desired improvement in service quality and patient safety. The study also highlighted the importance of supporting culture, appropriate organizational structure, and managerial commitment as perceived facilitators in CG implementation. The findings are parallel with the findings of many other studies. The model developed by O'Brien et al outlines four dimensions in successfully implementing clinical governance: cultural, technical, structural, and strategic. The cultural dimension related to beliefs, values, norms, and behaviors in the organization that either suppress or support quality improvement activities. The organizational factors include strong and clear vision and goals, stable managerial leadership, supportive structures for team work, effective interactions and interprofessional relationships, and continuous learning culture. The barriers include lack of adequate managerial support, resource, structural, and cultural issues, and professional boundaries.

About 317 patients (92.2%) were suggestive of causes of hemoptysis, and 27 patients (7.8%) showed focal hemorrhage.\n8. Blood lobes could be identified by chest CT scan in 105 cases (30.5%).\n9. Bleeding sources could be localized in unilateral lung but could not be defined in an exact lobe in 90 cases (36.2%).\n10. Both lungs had unusual films but not focal hemorrhage in 149 patients (43.3%).\n11. The findings of angiography suggested that few direct signs found during arteriography, most of the indirect appearances that support a site of bleeding include tortuosity, hypertrophy, hypervascularity, aneurysms, extravasation, and bronchial artery to pulmonary artery or vein shunting.\n12.

However, there is limited scientific data to support medicinal claims of these herbal formulations. Herbal remedies are commonly used in many Nigerian homes, and the increasing commercial promotion of herbal remedies necessitates the need for assessment of safety and validity of medicinal claims. The toxic effects of indiscriminate use of packaged herbal remedies have been recognized, and the general belief that herbal medicines are natural, effective, and without adverse effects has contributed to the upsurge in the patronage of herbal formulations. The study aimed to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to fijk herbal mixture on rat biochemical indices and liver morphology. The oral administration of fijk herbal mixture did not produce significant changes to average body weights of animals, but the relative organ to body weight ratio showed no significant difference among the various treatment groups. However, repeated administration of fijk herbal mixture caused significant reduction in rat plasma protein level compared to the control group. The study also revealed that repeated exposure to fijk herbal mixture caused hepatic alterations including hypochromic, haemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, and hyperemia. The study also found that the levels of alt and ast were elevated by repeated administration of fijk mixture relative to control. The alt and ast are normally found in the red blood cells, liver, heart, and kidney tissues. The levels of alt and ast have long been used to assess the functions of liver. The levels of alt and ast have been linked to tissue toxicity [21, 22]. The study also found that the ratio of ast to alt in plasma was less than one ( < 1 ), which may indicate ensuing acute or chronic liver injury.

Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n- terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain. Myova's directed movement is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in the motor's processive motion as each head takes 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required to activate the atpase activity of myova; however, in the presence of high calcium ( > 1 m), motor processivity is reduced and one or more calmodulins may dissociate from each lever arm. Single myova are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. Myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusion search. The structural domains that are critical to myova's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction. Here, we used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains. In addition, we hypothesized that calmodulin disassociation from the myova lever arm decreases the lever arm's flexural stiffness, thus contributing to the motor's compromised processivity in the presence of calcium. Various myova constructs, listed as follows, were expressed in the baculovirus/SF9 cell system and purified as described previously. These constructs allowed the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains to be defined by TPM (figure 2).

The most common schwannoma is the vestibular schwannoma, which arises from the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve and accounts for 51% of all schwannomas found anywhere in the body. The vidian canal, also referred to as the pterygoid canal, extends from the pterygopalatine fossa to the foramen lacerum in the floor of the sphenoid sinus. The vidian nerve arises from the joining of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and the deep petrosal nerve. The greater superficial petrosal nerve consists of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. The deep petrosal nerve consists of postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the carotid sympathetic plexus.

This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering typically needed for nanoparticulate TiO\u2082 electrodes, which prevents the use of conductive plastic substrates. We have previously demonstrated the use of esa with the ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes. Minor addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to ZnO surface brought about a significant impact on the crystal growth for evolution of various nanostructures and alteration of the crystallographic orientation of the film. The coprecipitation of dye molecules does not necessarily deteriorate the crystallinity of ZnO. In the case of ZnO/EOSIN hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed. The space between the ZnO nanowire is filled with aggregates of eosin. The solid eosin can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline such as dilute KOH. Thus, prepared ZnO thin films, consisting of large single-crystalline grains with internal porous structure, to be called porous ZnO, have large surface area for adsorption of photosensitizer dye in a large amount and high crystallinity for efficient transport of electrons; therefore, it can achieve high incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of around 90% with the dSSC application. Recently, Powar et al. have succeeded in achieving 1.3% conversion efficiency for a dSSC in an inverted structure employing a porous p-nio electrode sensitized with a specially designed dye to achieve a high rectification with kinetically reversible co(ii/iii) ethylene diamine complex electrolyte.

Cuscn has been frequently used as a hole conductor in nanostructured solar cells and also as a sensitized photocathode in combination with hole-injecting dyes. Therefore, esa of cuscn-based hybrid thin films could serve nicely as a counterpart to the well-established ZnO-based hybrid systems.

Estimated 76,250 new cases of invasive melanoma were diagnosed in the USA in 2012, with an estimated number of 9,180 that result in death. The most dangerous characteristic of melanoma is that it can spread widely via the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that links clinical dermatology and dermatopathology by enabling the visualization of morphological features which are not discernible by examination with the naked eye. Dermoscopy enables better diagnosis as compared to unaided eye with an improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of 1030%. However, it has also been demonstrated that dermoscopy may actually lower the diagnostic accuracy in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists due to this method requiring great deal of experience to differentiate skin lesions. Only experts have arrived at 90% sensitivity and 59% specificity in skin lesion diagnosis, while for less trained doctors these figures show significant drop till around 62%-63% for general practitioners. The main problem is that the diagnosis is highly dependent on subjective judgement and is scarcely reproducible. Several scoring systems and algorithms such as the abcd-e rule, the seven-point checklist, three-point checklist, and the menzies method have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of less experienced clinicians. Although this simplification has enabled the development of these diagnostic algorithms with good accuracy, still they showed problems that have not yet been solved. The most important shortcoming is that the purpose for which they were designed was not achieved, because the within- and between- observer concordance is very low, even for expert observers. Despite extensive research in investigating the varied presentations and physical characteristics of melanoma, a growing interest has developed in the automated analysis of digitized images obtained by elm techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions. Application of computational intelligence methods helps physicians as well as dermatologists in faster data processing to give better and more reliable diagnoses. Studies related to the automated classification of pigmented skin lesion images have appeared in the literature as early as 1987.

It is characterized by localized tumors in the head and neck region, which are uncommon but can occur in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The tumor is characterized by various symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, clicking of the TMJ, hearing impairments, dizziness, and otorrhea. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma are rare, but can be observed after irradiation [3,4]. The diagnosis is challenging due to the inherent risk of malignant progression, and incomplete resection carries a high risk of recurrence. Therefore, it is advisable to attempt a complete surgical removal for the curative treatment of chondroblastoma. The study presents methods for diagnosing chondroblastoma and suitable surgical procedures for maintaining postoperative functionality. A 41-year-old male with TMJ disorder initially diagnosed with otitis media presented with chronic hearing loss on the right side. He underwent several attempts at antibiotic therapy and eustachian tube blockage but his symptoms were unresponsive to both systemic antibiotics and tubing therapy. His initial diagnosis was based on physical assessment of malocclusion and complaints of subsequently developed trismus. After 2 years, endoscopic surgery, followed by several attempts to correct malocclusion for the TMJ disorder, was implemented but resulted in no significant improvement in clinical manifestations. The patient was further assessed and a CT scan and pathologic examination showed the presence of a giant cell tumor in the temporal bone. The patient harbored the primary disease and consulted us for persistent restriction of the mouth opening as well as hearing loss and dizziness, which he had noticed 5 years earlier. The re-examination of the CT scan revealed that the tumor mass had progressively enlarged and had widely destroyed the middle cranial fossa in the temporal lobe (Fig. 1). MRI showed the presence of a poorly defined mass, with predominantly low signal and relatively high signal intensities, on T1 and T2-weighted sequences, respectively, involving the right middle cranial fossa and infratemporal fossa floor.

It is a relatively common disorder, with the prevalence ranging from 4% to 20% in the adult population. The treatment of Sch is considered only for patients who are pregnant, infertile, exhibit associated symptoms, or have a high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. The optimal TSH cutoff values and clinical significance of these subclinical abnormalities are even more controversial. The prevalence of Sch varies according to population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement. The relationship between pathological thyroid dysfunction and body weight is well established. Cross-sectional studies using population cohorts have demonstrated that variations in thyroid function within the population reference range have a substantial impact on weight and body mass index (BMI). Higher levels of TSH are associated with an increased BMI and rising TSH levels which, in turn, are associated with enhanced weight gain. Additionally, an increasing amount of evidence indicates that higher levels of TSH are associated with worsening blood pressure (BP) and altered lipid levels. A cross-sectional study demonstrated that subjects with Sch exhibit increased BP and a population-based study observed positive linear associations between TSH levels and systolic and diastolic BP. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis found that Sch is associated with higher systolic BP. Thyroid hormones exert multiple effects on the regulation, absorption, and metabolism of lipid synthesis as well. Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that elevated levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), and possibly triglycerides (TG) are reversed in individuals with overt hypothyroidism following levothyroxine (T4) therapy. A number of studies have reported significant increases in serum TC, LDL-C, and TG in patients with Sch and the findings of a meta-analysis found that the TC, LDL-C, and TG levels of Sch subjects are significantly increased relative to euthyroid individuals. Similarly, a Korean study demonstrated that Sch subjects with an intermediate-to-high risk of CVD had higher coronary calcium scores than euthyroid subjects.

Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of ifg, igt, or both ifg and igt based on a screening 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT). Participants were randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two-by-two factorial design and followed for a median of 3 years after randomization. Participants were assessed at regular intervals to ascertain the occurrence of the primary outcome, which included new-onset diabetes or all-cause mortality. The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow-up. -cell function was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration. Both indexes have previously been validated against gold-standard measures of insulin secretion (18,19) and have been shown to be significant predictors of incident diabetes in large epidemiological studies. To account for the compensatory response of insulin secretion in relation to background insulin resistance, igi was divided by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (defined as fasting glucose / fasting insulin / 22.5) for univariate analysis or adjusted for HOMA-IR in multivariate analysis. Similarly, PI concentration was divided by c-peptide concentration (i.e., the PI / c ratio [PI / c]) for univariate analysis or adjusted for insulin secretion using c-peptide as a covariate in multivariate analysis. Although the PI-to-insulin ratio is often used to identify disproportionate elevations in PI, c-peptide offers advantages over insulin as a denominator for PI because it is cosecreted with insulin in an equimolar ratio, but unlike insulin it is not extracted by the liver and thus it has a constant peripheral clearance.

These studies have highlighted the importance of understanding the complex signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and resistance to anti-angiogenic treatments.\n\u2022 The development of anti-angiogenic drugs, such as Avastin (bevacizumab), has been a cornerstone of cancer treatment. However, recent withdrawals of Avastin for breast cancer have underscored the need for alternative therapies, such as PTK inhibitors, to ensure that scarce healthcare resources are well spent in the treatment of cancer.\n\u2022 Other growth factors, such as VegF-c and VegF-d, have also been identified as potential targets for promoting resistance to Avastin. These ligands can modulate the effect of VegF-a by displacing it from its receptors on endothelial cells.\n\u2022 The development of mabs specific to the VegF-d vhd domain, capable of inhibiting binding to Vegfr-2 and Vegfr-3, could be a viable target for anti-cancer therapy.\n\u2022 The growth factor VegF-c is closely related to VegF-d, and it includes a central VegF homology domain (vhd) related to other VegF family members.

Biologists must become adept at navigating the vast genomic data landscape, which may appear uniform but harbors rich knowledge. Surveying and signposting this apparently bland genomic landscape should guide investigators towards experiments addressing specific hypotheses about gene function. If the genome is to offer its secrets to all scientific communities, its surveyors need to adopt universal vocabularies. Proteins annotated by homology should be guided by comparisons of hmms or gps with protein sequence databases and implementation of an upper threshold value for e, the number of unrelated sequences expected by chance that are aligned with a particular score, or higher, in the search. The first completely sequenced genomes, such as that of haemophilus influenzae, were annotated following searches of all available sequence databases with each predicted gene product. This approach assumes that matters are straightforward, but encounters sequence similar, homologous portions of genes embedded in otherwise sequence dissimilar, non-homologous contexts. The importance of annotating genes by homology is that protein homologs invariably have similar tertiary structures and frequently also have similar functions. Domain architectures of the lbc oncogene product, and the experimentally uncharacterized protein kiaa1415, as predicted using smart, demonstrate that domain invention in the chordate lineage has made only a minor contribution to proteome diversity, whereas expansions and contractions of domain families, and domain additions and deletions, have all added greatly to proteome innovation. The animal genome sequencing projects already underway will proceed in the same manner as the publicly funded human project, through numerous draft stages and on towards completion. Proteome annotation by domain content implies that a gene product's function is a synthesis of the generalized functions of its component parts.

Rubella vaccination is crucial for preventing CRS and its serious complications in pregnant women and their fetuses. The most common rubella vaccine is derived from the Ra27/3 virus strain, which is more effective than other vaccines and induces similar immune responses. The study found that rubella vaccination significantly reduced the rate of negative antibody from 20. 42% to 0. 7% in 2006, which is in line with reliable sources and extensive country studies. The results also agree with research conducted in Mashhad, Iran, and other countries in the west of Iran. Mass rubella vaccination in 5 to 25 years old Iranian population during 2003, and continued thereafter as MMR in the national vaccination program, has significantly increased the anti-rubella antibodies and immunity in high-risk people, as premarriage Kermanshahi girls, and compared to many of the results specified in local and international sources.

Gene-specific RNA probes are now extensively used as they enable visualization of gene expression patterns and provide valuable information about the role of specific genes during development, as well as positioning and movement of a particular cell type at different stages of development.\n\u2022 Whole mount in situ hybridization (wish) was initially performed using radioactive probes but was radically simplified when nonradioactive probes were used successfully [24]. It is now widely used in several biological systems, including drosophila, xenopus, quail, dictyostelium, and zebrafish. In situ hybridization (ish) is a common technique among developmental research labs, yet its uses are quite diverse and include medical and prenatal diagnostics [916]. Not long after its introduction, protocols using two different labels for the RNA probes and two color substrates were described, allowing the detection of more than one transcript simultaneously. However, a major limitation of these chromogenic multilabeling techniques is that the overlapping regions of expression are very difficult to discern.\n\u2022 The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts may overcome this limitation; yet fluorophores for single- as well as double-transcript visualization in whole mounts have only been used extensively in the fly and to some extent in the zebrafish. More recently, simultaneous fluorescent detection of three transcripts was reported in the chick, and multiplexing has been used to detect up to seven transcripts in the fly [1921]. However, successful implementation of current fluorescent protocols is very rare, especially in the mouse or xenopus embryos, and even then the fluorescent images are of insufficient quality and thus cannot rival the staining obtained with normal chromogenic substrates. Additionally, imaging the signal is complicated due to the strong autofluorescence of the embryos, which interferes with fluorescent detection of RNA and makes the use of enzymatic amplification necessary in the mouse, xenopus, chick, and other embryos.\n\u2022 The amplification step is also necessary in the case of chromogenic protocols; however, this step undermines the resolving ability of both methods. Amplification reactions create a precipitate which is deposited in the area surrounding the RNA and then diffuses out. Therefore, it does not remain localized within the particular intracellular region or compartment where the RNA in question is localized.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_subpoints": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential among pancreatic cancer histopathologic subtypes. The survival of patients diagnosed with pdac may vary significantly depending on many factors, including demographic characteristics and the pathologic nature of the tumor, as well as the type of performed treatment. The most dramatic influence on the survival of patients diagnosed with pdac is a surgical resection of the tumor (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation). The estimated parameters (values of the relative impact of risk factors on the survival of cancer patients) obtained by the cox proportional regression models are largely varied, depending on the quantity and quality of data used, the set of the considered variables, and the technical approaches utilized in developing these models. The obtained estimates depend on the underlying cox models, the credibility of which can be estimated by values of their concordance indexes (c - indexes), which present the probability that for any pair of randomly drawn patients, the patient with the worst outcome estimated by this model dies earlier than one with the better estimated outcome. The reliability and generalizability of a model are essential when a model's predictions are considered for clinical practice. The reproducibility and transportability of these models were checked, and the reproducibility is defined as the performance of a model on a sample of similar patients not included in the development of the model, while transportability reflects a model's ability to predict among patients from different but plausible related populations. The models were developed using univariate models with the kaplan-meier method and multivariate cox proportional hazards models, and the models were validated using cross-validation with 10 iterations.

ROS are converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by cellular superoxide dismutases (SODs). Similar to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, oxidation of cysteine residues represents a reversible posttranslational protein modification that regulates signaling. Mitochondrial ROS generation is essential for the propagation of cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs. The epidermis contains increased mitochondrial and oxidant content when induced to differentiate, and increased ROS levels correlate with differentiation of escs and ipscs. The results show that mros generation is required for activation of notch and -catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth, and that mros acts as pro-differentiation signals. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial metabolism promotes cellular differentiation remain poorly understood, and more studies are needed to determine how mitochondrial metabolism regulates differentiation.

It is commonly associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides. The crystal structure of polyhalite is first determined in samples from altaussee in Austria and later confirmed by laboratory conditions. Polyhalite can be synthesised under laboratory conditions by a reaction of gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system k2so4mgso4h2o at temperatures above 70\u00b0C. It is stable between room temperature (0\u00b0C) and 255\u00b0C or 285\u00b0C.

Microfluidic devices offer advantages over conventional separation techniques, such as small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential for integration with analytical techniques. Examples include the magnetic separation of leukocytes from erythrocytes, the isolation of fluorescent and non-fluorescent escherichia coli cells, and the separation of immunogenic t cells from whole blood. Microfluidic systems can also be used to separate rare cells, such as metastatic cancer cells, from peripheral blood. The development of microfluidic systems with integrated waveguides and cell culture chambers has the potential to reduce sample loss due to external handling or dead volumes, making them particularly relevant for the isolation of rare cells. The combination of magnetic microbeads and external magnetic field has been used in a y-shaped microfluidic device to separate immunogenic t cells from whole blood, achieving high throughput (up to 40%) with a purity of >90%. The use of magnetic microbeads and external magnetic field has also been demonstrated in a static microfabricated system, providing a method to extract useful proteomic or genomic data from selected cells.

The employment interaction effect is weaker in more traditional societies, while the other interaction effects are not affected. The article concludes that the employment effects on union formation are more than just a matter of financial resources, in line with the uncertainty hypothesis.

The study found that symptoms such as fever, chills, sweating, and pain symptoms were common in untreated malaria, with a significant increase in the frequency of nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, and abdominal pain after treatment. The study also found that chloroquine can cause side effects or intensify symptoms already present, such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The study recommends that primaquine use should be monitored for hemolytic anemia, which can also occur in people without g6pd deficiency when using primaquine. The study also found that severe hemolysis can occur in patients with g6pd deficiency, which can be associated with weakness and malaise. The study suggests that the use of primaquine in vivax malaria should be monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms and hemolysis, and that patients with g6pd deficiency should be monitored for severe hemolysis.

Various changes occur in the human body with age, including lower urinary tract symptoms (luts), erectile dysfunction (ed), and decreased libido.\n3. Several community-based studies have shown a strong correlation among sexual dysfunction, increasing age, and the severity of luts.\n4. The coexistence of sexual problems with luts and benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) further affects quality of life (qol).\n5. The continuous efforts have been made to disclose the common pathophysiology between luts and ed.\n6. No definite explanations have been given to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of the correlation between luts and ed.\n7. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.\n8. One possible cause is overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.\n9. According to this hypothesis, luts increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which induces the occurrence of urinary storage symptoms due to the contraction of smooth muscles in the prostate gland and urinary bladder.\n10. Ed occurs as the result of smooth muscle contractions in the corpus spongiosum, and the myosin light chain is phosphorylated because of increased rho - kinase activity, which can cause smooth muscle layer contraction.\n11. It has been proposed that endothelial dysfunction in the prostate gland and corpus spongiosum and hormonal imbalance are physiological causes for the correlation between luts and erectile dysfunction.\n12. Changes in lifestyle due to nocturia and rapid eye movement sleep disorder may affect the occurrence of erectile dysfunction.\n13. The result of our preliminary study showed that age, international prostate symptom score (ipss), nocturia, and the uroflow rate correlated significantly with the 5-item version of the international index of erectile function (iief-5).\n14. The prostate gland volume was not significantly correlated with sexual function, implying that erectile function is not affected by subjective luts even with a relatively greater prostate size.\n15. Irwin et al reported that overactive bladder (oab) was significantly associated with increased prevalence of ed and that sexual activity, sexual enjoyment, and sexual satisfaction were reduced as a result of urinary symptoms.\n16. These findings suggest that rudimentary treatments of luts, a risk factor for erectile dysfunction, would be mandatory to effectively improve sexual function in", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_subpoints": 1, "symbol": "*"}}

The double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1 allows for plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal states.\n3. Restoration of mir-200c in cancer cells that do not express it causes a decrease in invasion and migration, even in the absence of e- cadherin.\n4. Restoration of mir-200c in ovarian cancer cells results in a dramatic decrease in migration and invasion, even though e- cadherin is not restored.\n5. The ability of ovarian cancer cells to spread and adhere to the peritoneal cavity is related to the expression of tubb3, which is a direct target of mir-200c.\n6.

The transobturator approach to treating female stress urinary incontinence involves using a midurethral sling (mus) placement to prevent complications associated with the retropubic mus placement originally described by Delorme.\n2. The inside-out approach, which uses an inside-out mus device, was later described by de Leval to further reduce the potential injury to the urethra and bladder.\n3. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence, namely the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator mus procedures.\n4. Multiple studies have discussed the anatomical trajectories of both obturator approaches and confirmed their anatomical safety from a neurovascular perspective.\n5. Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the mus s configuration in relation to the urethra, as a progressive dissection of the entire tape s trajectory would be required, leading to a distortion of relevant anatomy.\n6. The large body of clinical evidence supports these findings.\n7. To date, anatomical studies have focused on the mus s trajectory in relation to the obturator foramen, the muscles, and especially the neurovascular structures.\n8. Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the mus s configuration in relation to the urethra, as a progressive dissection of the entire tape s trajectory would be required, leading to a distortion of relevant anatomy.\n9.
