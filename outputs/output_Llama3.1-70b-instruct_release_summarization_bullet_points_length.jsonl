Logical synchronization requires that the symbol arrives within the writing phase of the receiving machine, and the cycle must offer room for a distinct other phase. This principle is elevated to a principle that defines the logical synchronization necessary for a channel.\n\n* The discipline of logical synchronization is outlined, which involves exploring the patterns of channels that are possible aiming points, as determined by a blackboard calculation that assumes a theory of signal propagation.

This standard defines the physical layer and MAC sub-layer.\n\n\u2022 The main aim of IEEE 802.15.4 is to provide a low-cost, low power, and reliable protocol for wireless monitoring of patient health. The standard supports two types of topologies, star topology and peer-to-peer topology, and two modes of operation, beacon-enabled and non-beacon-enabled. The 2.4 GHz band is the most important frequency range supported by this standard.\n\n\u2022 Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a crucial role in the overall performance of a network, and they are defined in two categories: contention-based and schedule-based MAC protocols.

By detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately, it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products.\n\n* The FP420 collaboration has proposed to install detectors in the region 420 m from the interaction points, which would allow for the detection of central systems in the approximate mass range 70-600 GeV. Proposals also exist to upgrade the capabilities of ATLAS and CMS to detect protons in the 220 m region.\n\n* The acceptance of the forward detectors is governed by the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam and the aperture of the LHC beam elements between the interaction point and the forward detectors. The distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam depends primarily on the beam size at each detector location.\n\n* The backgrounds to central exclusive Higgs production can be broken down into three categories: central exclusive di-jet production, double pomeron exchange, and overlap events. The most difficult backgrounds to deal with are the central exclusive di-jet backgrounds.\n\n* The overlap events are defined as a coincidence between an event that produces a central system of interest and one or more diffractive events which produce protons in the acceptance range of a forward detector in the same bunch crossing.

However, later studies have revisited this issue, and the question of its stability remains unanswered.\n\n* The present study aims to investigate the stability of the trihydrogen dication using two methods: a specialized variational approach and a standard ab initio method.

Inflationary models can lead to a variety of features unavailable in the case of a single field. Multi-field scenarios include the well-known hybrid inflation models.\n\n* The dynamics of multi-field models of inflation involve the coupling of two or more dynamical, interacting scalar fields. An important aspect of such systems is the possibility of mixing between the fields. The problem of renormalization of time evolution equations in single field models was understood several years ago. However, going beyond tree level brings in the issue of renormalization, and the correct choice of the initial condition for the fluctuations guarantees that the theory is renormalizable.\n\n* The authors work in the context of a closed time path formalism, which is appropriate for following the time-dependent evolution of the system. They construct the in-vacuum by diagonalizing the mass matrix of the system at the initial time. However, because of the time-dependent mixing, a system initially diagonalized in this way will generally not be diagonalized at later times.

The torque between two parallel birefringent plates is a result of the anisotropy of the zero-point energy and can be calculated using the dielectric functions of the interacting materials. The torque is proportional to the area of the interacting surfaces and is a function of the angle between the optical axes of the two plates.

This process leaves the cluster far out of equilibrium due to the rapid change in gravitational potential energy.\n\n\u2022 The effects of this process have received little consideration in observational studies of young massive star clusters, which have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters.

The proposed method addresses these challenges by modeling the longitudinal outcome process using a transition model and accounting for correlation within dyads using random effects.\n\n\u2022 The transition model allows a subject's outcome to depend on not only their own characteristics but also the characteristics of the other member in the dyad.

The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, but it is plagued by some difficulties related to the small observational value of dark energy density. Several dark energy models have been proposed, such as quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, Chaplygin gas, and holographic dark energy.\n\n* A possibility to explain the accelerated phase of the universe is to consider a theory of gravity based on the Weitzenb\u00f6ck connection, instead of the Levi-Civita one, which deduces that the gravitational field is described by the torsion instead of the curvature tensor. Teleparallel gravity possesses a number of attractive features related to geometrical and physical aspects. One can start from the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) and construct various gravitational modifications based on torsion.\n\n* The aim of this paper is to explore the implications of f(T) gravity to the formation of light elements in the early universe, i.e., to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). BBN has occurred between the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, around 1 sec, and a few hundred seconds after it, when the universe was hot and dense. The primordial mass fraction of 4He can be estimated by making use of the relation between the neutron abundance and the temperature.\n\n* The authors investigate the bounds that arise from the BBN constraints on the free parameters of three f(T) models, namely the power-law, exponential, and square-root exponential models. Concerning the power-law f(T) model, the obtained constraint on the exponent n is n < 0.18. Concerning the exponential and the square-root exponential models, the authors show that, for realistic regions of free parameters, they always satisfy the BBN bounds.\n\n* The authors conclude that viable f(T) models, namely those that pass the basic observational tests, can also satisfy the BBN constraints. This feature acts as an additional advantage of f(T) gravity, which might be a successful candidate for describing the gravitational interaction.

This phenomenon is intrinsically nonlinear and changes both the spectrum of the particles and the structure of the shock.\n\n\u2022 There are three viable approaches to account for the backreaction of the particles upon the shock: numerical simulations, a fluid approach, and an analytical approach.

The controllable imposition of symmetrically set and globally balanced gain and loss can render optical waveguiding arrays a fertile territory for constructing PT-symmetric complex potentials.\n\n* The authors propose generalizations of one-dimensional PT-symmetric nonlinear oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which can be used as fundamental building blocks for constructing PT-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. They introduce four basic types of plaquettes, three of which are in the form of four-site squares, and the final one is in the form of a five-site cross. The analysis is restricted to modes that can be found in analytical form, while their stability against small perturbations is analyzed by numerical methods. Many effects are found, including the existence of solution branches that terminate at critical points of the respective linear PT-symmetric systems.\n\n* The authors examine the spectral stability of the different configurations and find that most stationary modes are unstable, although stable branches are found in some cases. They also study the perturbed dynamics of the modes and find that the evolution of unstable ones typically leads to the growth of amplitudes at gain-carrying sites and decay at lossy ones. Passive sites without gain or loss might be tipped towards growth or decay, depending on the particular solution and possibly on specific initial conditions. The next relevant step in the analysis may be to search for more sophisticated stationary modes produced by symmetry breaking.\n\n* The authors note that the issue of potential existence of isolated solutions versus branches of solutions in PT-symmetric systems is already being addressed in the literature. They also mention that the present work may pave the way for further considerations of two-dimensional PT-symmetric lattice systems and even three-dimensional ones.

The energetics involved cannot be determined without knowing the degree of beaming.\n\n\u2022 Three methods may help determine the degree of beaming in GRBs. The first method involves analyzing the light curve of optical afterglows from a jetted GRB, which should be characterized by a break in the light curve during the relativistic phase. However, detailed numerical studies show that the break is usually quite smooth, and other factors can also result in light curve breaks. The first method is not conclusive due to these complexities.\n\n\u2022 The second method involves measuring the polarization of optical afterglows from a jet, which can be strongly polarized in principle. Some positive observations have been reported, but polarization can only be observed under specific conditions. The third method involves searching for orphan afterglows, which are not associated with any detectable GRBs. The ratio of the orphan afterglow rate to the GRB rate might allow measurement of the GRB collimation angle.\n\n\u2022 However, the absence of large numbers of orphan afterglows in many surveys has been regarded as evidence that the collimation cannot be extreme.

The detection limit needs to be improved to overcome this problem.\n\n\u2022 Another difficulty associated with the third method is the existence of \"failed gamma-ray bursts\" (FGRBs), which are baryon-contaminated fireballs with initial Lorentz factors much less than 100.

The numerical problem can be formulated as that of solving a system of differential equations with boundary conditions.\n\n\u2022 The code uses two techniques to improve the precision of the computed frequencies: a variational principle and Richardson extrapolation. The variational principle implies that any error in the eigenfunction induces an error in the frequency that is second-order in the error.

The calculations reproduce the analytic result in the low column-density limit but exhibit significant differences for clouds of column-density where the emissivity declines substantially for photon energies. The low emissivity of dense gas means that the baryonic content of the galaxy's dark halo is not so tightly constrained by the gamma-ray data as had previously been thought.\n\n\u2022 The existing gamma-ray data, taken in isolation, do not exclude purely baryonic models for the galactic dark halo. For high column densities, the emissivity falls, and the gamma-ray data on the inner galactic disk thus indicate that all of the galaxy's dark halo could be made of dense clouds of column-density.

The total number of DAE in a real power system can be formidably large, making time-domain simulation over long time intervals expensive.\n\n* To accelerate the simulation of long-term stability models, researchers have proposed using larger time step sizes or automatic adjustment of step sizes according to system behavior. Another approach is to implement the quasi-steady-state (QSS) model in long-term stability analysis, but the QSS model suffers from numerical difficulties when the model gets close to singularities.\n\n* The QSS model requires improvements in both model development and numerical implementation, and this paper contributes to the latter by applying pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) method in power system long-term stability analysis. PTC method can be implemented directly in the long-term stability model to accelerate simulation speed and can also be applied in the QSS model to overcome possible numerical difficulties.\n\n* The PTC method is a physically-motivated method that follows the solution of dynamical systems accurately in early stages until the steady state is approaching, and then increases the time step to gain rapid convergence to steady state. PTC method can avoid converging to nonphysical solutions or stagnating when the Jacobian matrix is singular, making it a better choice than accurate step-by-step integration.\n\n* The PTC method has been applied to the long-term stability model and the QSS model with modifications to overcome numerical difficulties. The proposed algorithm is shown to be effective in providing correct approximations for the long-term stability model and overcoming numerical difficulties in the QSS model.\n\n* Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the PTC method in power system long-term stability analysis, including a 145-bus system and a 14-bus system.

The model is used in its 2D and 3D versions to study the collective behavior of the system and investigate the existence of chimera states. The system contains not only direct and cross-coupling but also cross-coupling between variables. The study considers two cases: direct and cross-coupling of equal strength in both variables and direct coupling in the membrane potential variable only.\n\n* The study shows that chimera states occur in the 2D Hindmarsh-Rose model for certain parameter values, and a new \"mixed oscillatory state\" (MOS) is identified, in which desynchronized neurons are uniformly distributed among those attracted by a stable stationary state.

The model is solved using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) approach, which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the Kondo effect. The DCA is a well-suited approximation for the KLM, as it successfully distills the competition between RKKY-mediated spatial magnetic order and the time-displaced correlations responsible for Kondo screening.\n\n* The single-particle spectral function is calculated along a path of high symmetry in the extended Brillouin zone, and the results are compared to previous lattice QMC simulations. The agreement between the DCA and lattice QMC results is excellent, confirming that the DCA is a reliable method for studying the KLM. The spectral function shows a clear hybridization gap in the paramagnetic phase, and the quasi-particle gap tracks the Kondo scale from weak to strong coupling. The DCA results also show that Kondo screening and the heavy quasi-particles are still present within the magnetically ordered phase.\n\n* The evolution of the Fermi surface across the magnetic order-disorder transition is investigated, and the results show a continuous change in the Fermi surface topology. The transition is associated with the backfolding of the large heavy-fermion Fermi surface, and within the antiferromagnetic metallic phase, there is a Fermi surface topology change from hole pockets centered around the \u0393 point to one centered around the M point. The latter Fermi surface is adiabatically connected to one where the f-spins are frozen and in which Kondo screening is completely absent.

This model describes quarks and gluons that oscillate with a universal frequency, independent of the flavor mass, inside a closed universe. The fields in the model comprise one real scalar field and one complex scalar field. Their dynamical equations were solved for the case that the respective vacuum expectation values satisfy a particular relation.\n\n* The model predicts the existence of a light scalar field associated with confinement, and a very heavy complex field associated with electromagnetism. The light scalar field is a perfect candidate for the quantum associated with the scalar field for confinement. The model also predicts the existence of a symmetric second-order tensor field that serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism. Quarks and gluons are confined to an anti-de Sitter universe having a finite radius in the flat space-time.\n\n* The model was further simplified to compare its properties with the actually measured cross sections and branching ratios. The full anti-de Sitter spectrum is coupled to the channels of two or more hadronic decay products for which scattering amplitudes can be measured. The anti-de Sitter spectrum reveals itself through the structures observed in hadronic mass distributions. However, there exists no simple relation between enhancements in the experimental cross sections and the anti-de Sitter spectrum.\n\n* An apparent interference effect was observed in annihilation data, which may stem from some internal oscillation with a frequency of about 38 MeV. Missing data in certain reactions exhibit maxima at 38 MeV, which could be due to the emission of an as yet unobserved light scalar particle. The corresponding particle has all the right properties to be the scalar boson related to confinement. The data also suggest the existence of two replicas of this particle with masses that are two and three times heavier.\n\n* The light scalar glueball is probably not abundantly present near us, but it may have existed in the early universe and inflated to hadrons under collisions. Interactions with hadrons might have been observed in bubble-chamber experiments, where isolated protons could be the result of collisions with a light scalar particle emerging from one of the interaction vertices.

Thermal transport measurements have shown the predominance of this symmetry for the gap function. The longitudinal thermal conductivity shows a fourfold oscillation when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO planes, which can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles. This oscillation has been resolved up to 20 K, above which no direct evidence for this type of symmetry has been published.\n\n\u2022 The variation of the thermal conductivity as a function of angle between the heat current and the magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO planes depends mainly on the heat transport by quasiparticles, their interaction with the supercurrents, and the symmetry of the order parameter. An angular pattern showing properties of the order parameter symmetry can only be achieved when the temperature is low enough so that the quasiparticle momentum is close to the nodal directions of the gap. The thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature can explain the experimental results in the whole temperature range. The change of symmetry of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature can also be explained by this model.\n\n\u2022 The experimental results have been compared with a model involving Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the two-dimensional BRT expression for the thermal conductivity, assuming a d-wave pairing symmetry.

This approach suggests that the axial anomaly is not solely due to ultraviolet divergences, but also has an infrared origin.\n\n* The axial anomaly can be related to polarized radiative decays, such as the radiative pion decay, where the outgoing lepton undergoes an helicity flip.

The invention finds an application in measuring the effect of products known as \"anti-reflectance\" products for greasy skins.\n\n* Various methods and devices already exist for measuring surface reflectance, but they are not applicable to the measurement of skin reflectance. A first problem to be solved with this particular application is the problem of influence of color. The known devices using relative measurement remain inappropriate for measuring skin reflectance. The apparatuses used in industry generally comprise optical systems with focusing lenses which require an accurate positioning of the measuring apparatus.\n\n* The apparatus according to the invention comprises a probe, a measuring device, and a flexible connection in fiber optics connecting the measuring device to the probe. The probe is designed to be placed in contact with the skin in order to light up the part of the skin surface requiring to be examined. The connection comprises three optical channels, which convey to the probe the light produced from a light-emitting device. The emitting and receiving devices are connected to a control and processing device via an interface circuit.\n\n* The emitting device comprises means of regulating the intensity of the emitted light and is operated by control signals issued by the processing device. The receiving device comprises photo-electrical transducers working out electrical signals representing the normal reflection and the diffuse reflection. The processing device comprises memory circuits, an arithmetical and logical unit, and interface circuits permitting the connection with a display device.\n\n* The resulting reflectance is a relative value worked out from measurements of the specular reflection and of the diffuse reflection. The difference is preferred to the quotient insofar as it introduces less scale distortion with respect to the judgement of the skin reflectance made by eye. A scale of reflectance may be defined from a measurement of a matt surface of reference and of a calibrated mirror. The reflectance value finally retained may be a mean value worked out from the results of a predetermined number of measurement cycles.\n\n* The measuring operation consists in the following phases: initialization of the graph, and tracing of the outline of the screen with a view to displaying the measurement results as a curve representing the variation of the reflectance. The operator can thus correct any incorrect positioning of the probe by observing the position variations in y", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 40, "symbol": "*"}}

Electroplated metal matrix coatings on aluminum components are acceptable under light loads but have several disadvantages when used under high friction loads.

This reduces the vacuum in the washer and prevents the chemicals and water from passing through the mat. The inventors decided to create a small deaeration tank that can be placed on top of the oxygen reactor.\n\n* The deaeration tank is designed to operate at atmospheric pressure or under low pressure or vacuum, and it has no moving parts, eliminating the need for motors. The tank is closed, allowing steam or oxygen to be recovered. The inventors devised a system where the deaerator is a small tank with an inlet pipe, an outlet, and a tangential swirl-inducing inlet pipe. The locations and sizes of these elements provide optimum deaeration.\n\n* The swirl-inducing fluid is the filtrate from the washer after the oxygen bleach. The filtrate is carried by a pump and counterflow line to an earlier washer or decker to be used as wash water. The flow of filtrate is controlled by the height of filtrate in the tank, which must be maintained at a predetermined height to maintain the vacuum in the washer. The filtrate is also used as the swirling fluid in the deaeration tank.\n\n* The deaeration tank is a cylindrical tank with an open top and a flat bottom, and its diameter is normally the same size as the diameter of the oxygen reactor.

The use of cooling fans is a low-cost solution for keeping electronic components within acceptable temperature ranges. Cooling fans are often integrated with an enclosure that houses the electronic components.\n\n\u2022 The traditional method of securing cooling fans to an enclosure using fasteners such as screws, dowel pins, or rivets increases the cost of the product due to labor and tool costs. The present invention discloses a system for eliminating fasteners traditionally used for securing cooling fans to an enclosure. This system can be utilized in various applications, including automotive, computer, and electronic instrumentation industries. The system is designed to reduce the cost of the product.\n\n\u2022 The cooling fan assembly of the present invention includes a motor, a fan blade, and a motor carrier with mounting legs. The motor carrier is coupled to the motor housing, and the mounting legs have resilient leg portions with a compression gap. The panel to which the cooling fan assembly is mounted has recess portions with openings that correspond to the mounting legs. The openings have an enlarged opening region and a residual opening region.\n\n\u2022 The installation of the cooling fan assembly involves bringing the assembly adjacent to the panel and inserting the turned-out portions of the mounting legs into the enlarged opening region. A combined compressive and rotating force is then applied to move the assembly into the partially installed position. The resilient leg portions are then repositioned into the intermediate opening, which is smaller than the enlarged opening. This brings the leg portions together and compresses the spring member.\n\n\u2022 As the cooling fan assembly is further rotated, the resilient leg portions enter the residual opening, which is sized smaller than the enlarged opening but not as small as the intermediate opening. The leg portions then spring outwardly, capturing each pair within its associated residual opening. The spring member remains in a compressed state, urging the turned-out portions against the exterior surface of the panel. This prevents vibrational noise and forces from causing the leg portions to \"back out\" of their respective openings.</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 20, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The valve has two inlets, A and B, and one outlet, with the outlet mixture ranging from 0% inlet A fluid, 100% inlet B fluid to 100% inlet A fluid, 0% inlet B fluid. The valve is designed to provide a constant pressure cleaning solution to each user, with the cleaning agent to water ratio continuously adjustable. This allows multiple users to accomplish specific cleaning tasks without disrupting other team members.\n\n* The present invention meets the objectives by providing a mixing valve with a valve body, a first inlet passage, a second inlet passage, an outlet passage, and a valve means for directing the two fluids toward the outlet passage. The valve means is adjustable to permit the mixture to range between a proportion of about 0% first fluid, 100% second fluid to about 100% second fluid, 0% first fluid. The valve body defines a bore with a predetermined bore diameter, and the valve means is disposed within the body. The valve means includes an elongated valve member with a cylindrical portion and a sealing sleeve.\n\n* The elongated valve member is received within the bore of the valve body and directs the flow of soap solution and water in varying proportions to the outlet passage. The valve member includes a series of consecutive cylindrical spools and channels for retaining fluid seal rings. The fluid seal rings prevent commingling of the two fluid sources within the bore and prevent leakage of the two fluids out of the bore and valve body. The fluid seal rings are capable of forming an acceptable fluid seal and are resistant to chemicals such as detergents and solvents.\n\n* The valve member also includes a cylindrical portion with a bore extending therethrough perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the valve member. The bore is sized identically to another bore, with both bores being preferably 1/8 inch in diameter.

Instruments mounted on precision kinematic mounts (KM) are particularly susceptible to vibration. The need arises to identify additional vibration reduction techniques for instruments.\n\n* Current efforts to modify graphite structures to reduce vibration levels may not be sufficient to meet design requirements. Test and analysis results indicate that existing designs may not provide adequate damping. Additional vibration reduction techniques are needed to protect instruments.\n\n* Conventional kinematic mounts have limited success in reducing vibration loads transmitted to instruments. These mounts are designed to safely carry launch loads but have no provisions to minimize loads transmitted to the instrument. The mounts have very little damping, amplifying flight loads to the instrument.\n\n* The present invention aims to provide kinematic mounts with novel damping features to protect instruments from potentially damaging flight loads. The mounts incorporate a passive energy dissipating mechanism to reduce high energy disturbances. The design preserves the fundamental features of strength, stiffness, and kinematic features.\n\n* The damping mechanism is provided at machined hinge or flexure locations of the mounts, where the most active portion of the mounts occurs. Local dampers are designed at these locations to dissipate vibration energy. Two embodiments of the damper design are depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B.\n\n* The first embodiment uses a spherical damper with a viscoelastic (VEM) damping material that deforms in shear to dissipate vibration energy. The VEM properties are frequency-dependent, allowing for significant levels of damping to be designed into the suspension vibration modes. The damper is composed of two partial shells connected via a soft layer of VEM material.\n\n* An alternate embodiment uses a cylindrical slot damper with a series of o-rings placed within slots disposed about the flexural hinges. The o-rings are subjected to tensile or compressive forces, depending on the vibrational force applied to the instrument. The design induces compression/tension into the VEM, providing similar damping performance to the spherical damper.\n\n* The proposed mounting concept uses six identical strut elements, simplifying manufacturing complexity and costs. The design involves simple machining of standard bar stock, and the struts can be arranged to approximately uncouple the mount suspension modes.

Off-axis illumination can also be used to keep the secondary beam from entering the illuminated optical system.\n\n\u2022 Waveguide hologram illuminators can be used to illuminate spatial light modulators (SLMs) and can provide polarized light for modulation. Polarization analyzers can be used to control or block the unmodulated light.\n\n\u2022 The invention has been disclosed with reference to generic descriptions and specific embodiments, and the examples set forth are not intended to be limiting in any way.

This is achieved by implementing and maintaining a queue by means of a tree-shaped structure in which the nodes have a given maximum size.\n\n* The tree-shaped data structure has two kinds of nodes: internal nodes and leaf nodes, where internal nodes are nodes with pointers to other internal nodes or leaf nodes, and leaf nodes are nodes at the lowest level of the tree with pointers to records. The tree structure is balanced, meaning all leaf nodes are at the same level, and all internal nodes are full except for those on the edges of the tree.

The emergence of practical optical fiber amplifiers has expanded the capabilities of undersea lightwave communications systems, increasing transmission capacities for digital data. However, the focus is shifting to developing more reliable undersea lightwave systems that provide multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity. This requires developing undersea networks where all nodes remain optically connected in the event of an undersea cable cut.\n\n\u2022 A network that combines a trunk and branch structure with a ring geometry exhibits strong survivability features, including maintaining connectivity along the trunk and to all cable stations via their respective branch fiber optic cables. Branch fiber optic cable cuts simply isolate the associated cable station without compromising ring integrity. This aspect is especially important since branch fiber optic cable cuts are more susceptible to failure by severing. The network's trunk and branch structure also respects sovereignty concerns that often arise in undersea communications networks.\n\n\u2022 The present invention is a system for reducing or eliminating undersea optical repeaters in a trunk and branch ring network by replacing repeaters with remotely pumped optical amplifiers. The system remotely supplies energy to those optical amplifiers over the same branch cables that also distribute communications signals. This approach reduces the number of undersea repeaters required, making the system more cost-effective. The system can be applied to other methods of signal multiplexing and can also be used as a terrestrial communications system.\n\n\u2022 The system includes a hub assembly with remote pumping, which consists of a hub coupled to both ends of the optical fiber cable trunk. A light emitting power source is coupled onto the optical fiber cable trunk, either through the hub itself or directly onto the trunk. The light source produces an output light source with a wavelength in the range of 1450-1500 nm, although other light sources and wavelengths may be used. The wavelength of light chosen must be distinct from the band of signal wavelengths contemplated for transmission along the optical fiber cable trunk.\n\n\u2022 The system also includes branch assemblies, which are convenient add/drop locations for telecommunications signals along the optical fiber cable trunk. Each branch assembly consists of a cable station and a light emitting power source, each optically coupled to a branch fiber optic cable. The branch fiber optic cable is coupled at its other end to a branching unit, which maintains optical fiber cable trunk continuity and allows for insertion of new signals and extraction of existing signals.

The foils are held in an evacuated enclosure and a voltage is applied to each foil to accelerate electrons emitted from the back of one foil to an energy level that effectively transmits the electrons through the next foil. The electrons are then accelerated by the voltage between the first and second stages toward the second foil and are transmitted with a probability through the second foil. This process continues at each foil stage, resulting in a growing avalanche of electrons.\n\n* The foil electron multiplier has several advantages over conventional electron multipliers, including a higher gain per multiplication stage, simplicity of fabrication, lower cost of fabrication, ability to cover a larger area, and intrinsic rejection of ion feedback at each stage. The foil electron multiplier can be used for amplification of an incident electron flux or for detection of particles such as photons, ions, and electrons. The multiplier can be used in photomultiplier tubes and particle detectors, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates. The foil electron multiplier can also be used in electron spectrometers, mass spectrometers, and photonic detectors.\n\n* The mean gain of the foil electron multiplier with N stages resulting from impact of a particle with the first stage is given by Equation 2, which takes into account the probability of incident particle transmission through the first foil, the transmission through the support grid, and the mean number of secondary electrons generated at each stage. The gain of the foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, maximizing the transmission through the support grid, and maximizing the secondary electron emission yield.

The adhesive can also be degraded by liquid cleaning procedures, especially in contaminated medical environments.\n\n\u2022 Moisture can migrate through the fracture cracks of the adhesive into the interior of the subminiature lamp, causing the electrical contacts to corrode and leading to early subminiature lamp failures. The combination of these factors causes conventional subminiature lamps to fail at an unacceptably high rate. A solution is needed to combat these mechanisms of bulb degradation.\n\n\u2022 The invention utilizes a high-temperature polymer that directly surrounds and is in compression contact with the glass envelope. The polymer may derive support from a metal base and can be manually handled and used to manipulate the subminiature lamp. A fluoroelastomer is a preferable type of elastomer that has the chemically resistive properties and ability to withstand high temperatures.\n\n\u2022 The polymeric seal support forms a housing around both the glass envelope and the abbreviated height one-piece conductive base, encapsulating the glass envelope and making a liquid-tight seal. The material used for the polymeric seal support should be non-thermally conducting and able to withstand significant subminiature lamp temperatures. The material can be pre-selected to resist permeation and volume increase.\n\n\u2022 The polymeric seal support has the inherent quality to allow much closer tolerance centering of the subminiature lamp glass envelope to the axis of the abbreviated height one-piece conductive base.

The federal role in surface transportation has expanded over the years, but the programs have become complex and inefficient.\n\n* The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified a framework of principles to guide the restructuring of surface transportation programs, including creating well-defined goals, establishing a clear federal role, incorporating performance and accountability, employing the best tools and approaches, and ensuring fiscal sustainability. These principles can help ensure that restructured programs address current challenges and provide a framework for considering levels of investment and funding and financing options. The GAO has also developed illustrative questions to help determine the extent to which proposals align with these principles.\n\n* The GAO has reported that the effectiveness of federal surface transportation programs can be increased by promoting and facilitating the use of the best tools and approaches to improve results and emphasize return on investment. This includes using economic analysis, such as benefit-cost analysis, in project selection, and requiring grantees to conduct post-project evaluations. The GAO has also identified various financing mechanisms, such as bonding, loans, and credit assistance, that can provide flexibility for state and local governments when funding additional infrastructure projects.\n\n* The GAO has also examined the potential of public-private partnerships to help meet the nation's transportation financing challenges, and has identified both benefits and risks associated with these partnerships. The GAO has recommended that the Secretary of Transportation develop and submit objective criteria for identifying national public interests in highway public-private partnerships, and that Congress direct the Secretary to do so. The GAO has also noted that the federal role in transportation provides an opportunity to identify emerging national public interests in highway public-private partnerships.\n\n* The GAO has concluded that the nation's surface transportation programs are no longer producing the desired results, and that a fundamental reexamination of the program is warranted. The GAO has recommended that Congress review the results of surface transportation programs and test their continued relevance and relative priority, and that appropriate funding sources and financing mechanisms be tailored for programs that continue to be relevant in today's environment.

The program's goal is to build a national infrastructure to facilitate the interstate exchange of criminal history and other relevant records.\n\n* NCHIP funds are used by states to support various activities, including improving criminal history records, automating fingerprint identification systems, and enhancing sex offender registries. States are required to provide a 10% match to the federal funds awarded, but many states have invested much more than the required amount. For example, one state that received over $5 million in NCHIP funds estimated that over $20 million of its own funds have been invested in system improvements since 1995.\n\n* The use of NCHIP funds by states is closely coordinated with the federal Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program, which requires states to use at least 5% of their awards for improving criminal history records. NCHIP funds are also used to support the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to conduct presale background checks of persons purchasing firearms. In fiscal years 2000-2003, a majority of NCHIP funds were used for NICS-related purposes.\n\n* Despite progress made in automating criminal history records, some areas still reflect a need for improvements. For example, automated information on the disposition of felony and other potentially disqualifying arrests is not always widely available. Additionally, automated information is not always available to identify other prohibited purchasers, such as persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.\n\n* The demand for background checks is growing, driven by screening requirements for employment and other noncriminal justice purposes.

The requirements for permits can add time and costs to cleanups, with the process of obtaining a permit involving substantial documentation and review.\n\n\u2022 To address these issues, EPA has proposed alternative policies and regulatory changes, including the \"contained-in\" policy, permit waivers, site-specific variances, and the corrective action management unit (CAMU) rule. However, these alternatives have been met with mixed reactions from stakeholders, with some finding them burdensome and others questioning their legal defensibility.\n\n\u2022 In 1996, EPA proposed a comprehensive rule to reform RCRA's requirements for remediation waste, but the proposal was met with significant disagreements from stakeholders, leading EPA to announce plans to withdraw the rule and focus on more narrow regulatory changes. EPA has concluded that comprehensive reform can best be achieved through legislative changes to RCRA.\n\n\u2022 Stakeholders disagree on the extent to which waste should be exempt from RCRA's requirements, as well as on EPA's legal authority to exempt waste from the requirements. Some stakeholders prefer an approach that includes all remediation waste, while others prefer a more limited approach that only exempts certain types of waste.\n\n\u2022 EPA has acknowledged that its treatment standards under RCRA are not generally appropriate for much of the contaminated soil typically found at cleanups, and that the agency lacks research to demonstrate that alternative technologies can attain the stringent treatment levels required by RCRA. EPA has estimated that exempting relatively low-risk contaminated media from the treatment standards could reduce cleanup costs nationwide by 50%.\n\n\u2022 The", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 18, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

However, the estimates may not accurately reflect certain special circumstances that could affect a worker's actual retirement benefit.\n\n* The PEBES does not take into consideration certain special circumstances, such as the reduction in Social Security benefits for federal workers who are eligible for both Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security benefits. SSA officials stated that it would be too difficult and costly to take these circumstances into account. Instead, SSA includes descriptions of these circumstances in the statements. The PEBES benefit estimates may be overstated or understated for certain individuals.\n\n* SSA has conducted surveys and focus groups to assess the public's reaction to receiving an unsolicited PEBES.

Annually, these programs provide more than $50 billion in student aid to approximately 8 million students and their families. FSA oversees or directly manages approximately $200 billion in outstanding loans representing about 100 million borrowers.\n\n\u2022 FSA was established as a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) in October 1998, with the goal of improving service in the student financial assistance programs, reducing costs, increasing accountability, and providing greater flexibility in management. As a PBO, FSA is required to commit to clear management objectives and specific targets for improved performance. FSA's performance plan discusses its three strategic goals: increasing customer and employee satisfaction while decreasing unit cost. The plan includes measures for gauging FSA's progress in meeting each of these strategic goals.\n\n\u2022 FSA uses the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and the Gallup Q12 to measure customer and employee satisfaction, respectively. FSA's scores on both the ACSI and Gallup Q12 increased from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2001, suggesting improvement in both areas. However, FSA's unit cost measure has some limitations, as it does not measure costs per se and does not include obligations FSA sees as beyond its control. FSA's current calculation of unit cost is also a change from the way it calculated it in the past, making it difficult to compare unit cost across years.\n\n\u2022 FSA has taken steps towards developing and implementing a strategic direction, but additional actions are needed. FSA's performance plan could be more useful to congressional decision makers with respect to systems integration and program integrity. FSA has also begun to implement a balanced scorecard, but some employees have found it difficult to make the link between their day-to-day activities and the organization's progress toward its strategic goals.

TODs can range in size and scope, from major urban centers to suburban neighborhoods. They aim to increase access to employment, education, and other opportunities by promoting transportation options. This can lead to increased transit ridership and reduced road congestion.\n\n* A number of stakeholders play important roles in the planning and implementation of TODs, including local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, local governments, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts. Each stakeholder has a unique role, such as building and maintaining transit systems or providing financing for development projects. Local governments have control over land use planning, including zoning policies and growth management policies. Private developers decide on and create developments, while lenders finance these projects.\n\n* The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD, but it does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, the agency has been expanding its role in TOD by funding research, coordinating with other federal agencies, and implementing a TOD planning pilot program. The FTA plans to distribute $19.98 million in grant funding to state and local agencies in 2015. The agency also evaluates proposed projects based on six criteria, including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and land use.\n\n* Market demand for real estate is a key factor in supporting TOD, driven by the strength of the local economy. Available land for development, such as surface parking lots or underutilized industrial land, can also support TOD. Resident support for transit and TOD is crucial, with cities having a high concentration of young residents tend to be more supportive. Efficient access to jobs and centers of activity is also essential for TOD.\n\n* Several challenges can hinder TOD, including higher construction costs, lenders' reluctance to finance TOD projects, lengthy or discretionary local approval processes, and unsupportive local populations. Physical features surrounding a transit station, such as highways or vacant land, can also hinder TOD. Land uses around transit stations that are not supportive of high-density, mixed-use development can also be a challenge.\n\n* Local governments can use various policies to encourage TOD, including zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives.

Both programs use the same definition of disability, but differ in purpose and requirements for entitlement. To be eligible for DI benefits, individuals must have a specified number of recent work credits, while SSI benefits do not require a past work history. DI benefits are financed by payroll taxes, while SSI benefits are paid from general revenues.\n\n\u2022 Concurrent beneficiaries, who receive benefits from both programs, comprise about 14% of SSA's disability population. They are more likely to have mental impairments and be female, with an average age of 45. About 11% of concurrent beneficiaries work, with a median earned income of about $250 per month. More than three-quarters of those who work have mental impairments, including mental illness and mental retardation.\n\n\u2022 The SSA has work incentive provisions in place to encourage beneficiaries to return to work, but the provisions differ significantly between the DI and SSI programs. For example, earnings do not affect a DI beneficiary's cash benefit for a period of time known as the trial work period, while SSI benefits are reduced gradually as earnings increase. Concurrent beneficiaries who work are more likely to have mental retardation and tend to be younger and male. They often earn low wages, with median monthly earnings of about $200.\n\n\u2022 The SSA faces challenges in serving concurrent beneficiaries, including a lack of coordination between the DI and SSI program rules. Field office staff often specialize in one program, making it difficult to serve concurrent beneficiaries effectively. The SSA has not established formal operating procedures to ensure that information about work activity is collected and communicated between programs. This can lead to overpayments of benefits.\n\n\u2022 The SSA has taken steps to improve service to concurrent beneficiaries, including the creation of a new position, the employment support representative.

Initially, Congress appropriated $62.3 billion for the response and recovery effort related to Hurricane Katrina in two emergency supplemental appropriations acts. Of that amount, FEMA received $60 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund.\n\n* FEMA has authority under the Stafford Act to issue mission assignments to other federal agencies, which are taskings that direct other federal agencies to support overall federal operations.

Mission assignments may be issued for a variety of tasks, such as search and rescue missions or debris removal.\n\n* After agencies perform work under a mission assignment, they bill FEMA, and FEMA reimburses them for the work performed using the Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) system. FEMA requires that performing agencies provide documentation supporting the costs incurred while performing the work under the mission assignment. FEMA can also reverse or \"charge-back\" the payment if it believes the agency did not provide sufficient supporting documentation.\n\n* The federal government is not adequately tracking and reporting on the use of the $88 billion in hurricane relief and recovery funds provided thus far to 23 federal agencies.

As a result, FEMA's required weekly reports to Congress have limited usefulness from a governmentwide perspective.\n\n* FEMA's reported obligations and expenditures for mission assignments do not reflect the status from a governmentwide perspective. FEMA records the entire amount of a mission assignment upfront as an obligation, while the agency performing the task does not record an obligation until it has actually obligated funds to carry out its mission. This results in overstated reported governmentwide obligations and understated reported governmentwide expenditures.\n\n* The process FEMA uses for reimbursing performing agencies creates timing differences between FEMA's and the performing agencies' records.

Banks primarily use deposits to make loans or invest in debt securities, while mutual funds invest in securities such as bonds and stocks. The funds from these investments flow to the issuers of securities through primary or secondary markets.\n\n* The importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining since the 1960s, with large businesses replacing bank loans with short-term securities called commercial paper. By 1994, corporations' reliance on bank loans had declined to 20% of their credit market debt, down from 28% in 1970. This shift has been driven by companies tapping into securities markets for their financial needs.\n\n* The household sector has also become less dependent on bank loans, with banks and thrifts selling mortgage portfolios to financial intermediaries who use them as collateral for marketable securities. This process, known as securitization, has allowed banks to provide initial financing for mortgage, credit card, and automobile loans, which are then sold to investors. As a result, the securities market has become the ultimate source of financing for these loans.\n\n* The relative importance of bank loans has been further diminished by the increased provision of direct loans by nonbank financial intermediaries, including securities firms, insurance companies, and finance companies. These intermediaries have reduced the need for households and businesses to rely on bank loans for financing.

This would enable Medicare to offer financial incentives to contractors for high-quality performance.\n\n\u2022 The Social Security Act precludes Medicare from offering financial incentives because it generally stipulates that payments be based on costs.

This lack of annual determinations makes it difficult for FSA to identify estates being kept open primarily to receive payments and ensure that the payments are proper. FSA regulations allow an estate to receive payments for the first 2 years after the death of the individual if the estate meets certain eligibility requirements. However, after 2 years, the estate must meet the active engagement in farming requirement and the local field office must determine that the estate is not being kept open primarily to continue receiving program payments.\n\n\u2022 FSA's review of case file documents found that only 39 of the 181 estates received annual eligibility determinations for each year they were kept open beyond the initial 2 years. In addition, 69 of the 181 estates had at least one annual determination between 1999 and 2005, but not with the frequency required.

Fires can reduce vegetation densities and stimulate seedling regeneration and growth in some species. However, various land use and management practices have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many forest and rangeland ecosystems, making them more susceptible to damage from wildland fires. This has led to abnormally dense, continuous accumulations of vegetation that can fuel uncharacteristically large or severe wildland fires.\n\n\u2022 The development of the Cohesive Strategy in 2014 emphasized the importance of coordination across multiple agencies through an \"all lands approach\" and framed comprehensive goals to mitigate wildland fire risk. The strategy identified three goals: resilient landscapes, human populations and infrastructure that can withstand wildfire without loss of life or property, and all jurisdictions participating in developing and implementing safe, effective, and efficient risk-based wildfire management decisions. However, the implementation of the Cohesive Strategy is not separately funded, and its success depends on monitoring and accountability. The strategy calls for a set of national outcome measures to assess progress in meeting its goals.\n\n\u2022 Federal officials and stakeholders identified several factors that affect federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk, including federal authorities, state and local authorities, initiatives, joint planning, agency resources for collaboration, leadership, education, and community engagement. They also identified factors that indirectly affect collaboration, such as community education, fire prevention messaging, and state and local requirements for private property owners to reduce risk. These factors can either enhance or hinder collaboration efforts. For example, the Good Neighbor Authority and the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 facilitate collaboration, while the time it takes to complete the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process can hamper joint efforts.\n\n\u2022 Joint planning, including prioritizing and developing community plans, has enhanced collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Developing annual operating plans and Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs) has been helpful for collaborating on fire preparedness activities. CWPPs provide a structure for collaboration and building community capacity, and they can help communities identify priority areas for fuel reduction and develop plans to reduce their risk from wildland fire. However, not all communities have CWPPs, and some plans may be outdated or not comprehensive.\n\n\u2022 Dedicated federal agency and community leadership enhances collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities.

The program has faced numerous challenges, including delays in developing the new information management system, known as the Defense Personal Property System (DPS).\n\n\u2022 DOD has taken some initial steps to achieve the goals and benefits of Families First, including establishing a phased approach to implementation and developing a customer satisfaction survey. However, the program has experienced delays and missed milestones, and the original estimated release date for DPS has been pushed back by over two years. DOD has developed a backup plan to provide servicemembers with full replacement value coverage, but this plan does not address the other goals or counseling benefit of Families First. The backup plan relies on a legacy system that is no longer fully supportable and may not meet DOD's technology standards.\n\n\u2022 The Families First program could increase costs to DOD by about $1.4 billion over current program costs through fiscal year 2011. The program's estimated costs have increased significantly since the last assessment, and DOD continues to estimate that the costs to the services of the Families First program will be 13 percent higher than costs under the current program. However, the actual cost of Families First will not be known until moving companies file the rates they will charge DOD to move servicemembers. DOD is relying on features built into DPS to ensure that the costs remain at or below the expected cost increase of 13 percent.\n\n\u2022 DOD faces management challenges for the Families First program, including organizational challenges and staffing shortfalls. The program office continues to experience difficulties in hiring and training personnel, and stakeholders have not agreed on some elements of the program, including business rules and essential DPS functions.

Tobacco is also grown in over 100 countries, with the United States being the second-largest producer of cigarettes in the world. More than 90% of tobacco grown in the United States is used to manufacture cigarettes.\n\n\u2022 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates pesticides in the United States, requiring manufacturers to provide data on pesticide residues remaining on tobacco. EPA assesses the health risks associated with exposure to pesticide residues on tobacco and has adopted a more formal and consistent approach to evaluating these risks. The agency uses a tiered approach to analyzing residues on tobacco, requiring additional residue data only if the combined residue levels exceed 0.1 parts per million (ppm). EPA also requires pyrolysis studies to measure residues in smoke when tobacco treated with a pesticide is burned.\n\n\u2022 EPA's health risk assessments have identified potential adverse health effects associated with pesticides used on tobacco and other crops. The agency has imposed special limitations on the uses of these pesticides, including restrictions on use in residential and commercial settings. EPA has also required manufacturers to provide additional data to address concerns about the potential health effects of certain pesticides. The agency has classified some pesticides as probable carcinogens, requiring mitigation measures to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\n\u2022 The USDA regulates pesticide residues on tobacco, primarily for purposes of trade equity. The agency tests imported and domestic tobacco for residues of 20 pesticides not approved for use on tobacco in the United States. USDA has established maximum allowable concentrations for these pesticides, and any tobacco exceeding these limits is denied entry or destroyed. The agency's testing program helps minimize public exposure to highly toxic pesticides.\n\n\u2022 Several countries, including Germany, Italy, and Spain, have adopted regulations for specific pesticide residues on various forms of tobacco.

They also have expectations about the quality of the related service.\n\n\u2022 The boundaries between fees and taxes are not always clear, and the tradeoffs among design elements can be relevant to both. A user fee is related to some voluntary transaction or request for government goods or services above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\n\n\u2022 Agencies derive their authority to charge fees either from the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) or from specific statutory authority. IOAA provides broad authority to assess user fees or charges on identifiable beneficiaries by administrative regulation.\n\n\u2022 The beneficiary-pays principle is a useful guideline for assigning costs, which states that if a program primarily benefits the general public, it should be supported by general revenue, not user fees. If a program primarily benefits identifiable users, it should be funded by fees.\n\n\u2022 Fees can promote equity and economic efficiency by ensuring that resources are allocated to the most highly valued use, as users make adjustments to their consumption of the service based on their costs and benefits. However, setting a fee too high or too low can have unintended consequences.\n\n\u2022 The design of a fee may consider the ability of a user to pay, for example, by exempting low-income users or scaling fees by some measure of ability to pay. This can help address concerns about the equity of the fee.\n\n\u2022 Fees should be set and adjusted to cover the intended share of costs over time, which means agencies must project and consider future program costs. This can help ensure that the fee remains aligned with program costs.\n\n\u2022 The primary challenge in determining when and how to collect a fee is striking a balance between ensuring compliance and minimizing administrative costs. Fees can be collected at the point of sale, point of service, or after the service has been provided.\n\n\u2022 Reviews of user fees can improve transparency, help ensure that fees remain aligned with program costs and activities, and increase awareness of the costs of the federal program.

The initiative's primary objective is to significantly improve business processes through techniques such as business process reengineering and continuous process improvements. CIM has its origins in the recommendations of the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management.\n\n* The CIM initiative has undergone significant changes since its inception, with a shift in focus from eliminating separate service systems to selecting and implementing standard information systems. The Deputy Secretary of Defense emphasized the importance of accelerating the selection and deployment of migration systems to achieve quick cost savings and form a foundation for major business process improvements. However, industry experts have advised DOD to focus on reengineering its business processes before improving automated information systems.\n\n* The Joint Logistics Systems Center (JLSC) was established to achieve CIM goals for the materiel management and depot maintenance business areas. JLSC identified 20 near-term projects to achieve quick cost savings, but was later directed to focus on selecting and testing migration information systems. The center has selected 32 migration systems for materiel management and depot maintenance, which are expected to result in significant business process improvements.\n\n* Despite progress made by JLSC, several impediments are jeopardizing its ability to successfully implement its strategy for improving business practices. These impediments include a lack of acceptance by some DOD functional and technical managers, the lack of integration of CIM efforts, and unclear program management authority. DOD has taken several actions to address these impediments, including the establishment of a board chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n\n* To overcome the fundamental weaknesses in the management of the CIM initiative, it is recommended that the Secretary revise the CIM management strategy to ensure active participation by functional managers, train DOD employees to promote understanding and acceptance of changes, and consider renaming the initiative to more accurately communicate its primary objective. DOD has taken several actions to address these recommendations, but some differences in interpretation remain. The Secretary's actions will be crucial in ensuring the success of the CIM initiative.</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 15, "symbol": "*"}}

However, some argue that limits on deductions would have adverse economic effects or changes in the distributional burden of the federal income tax code. The report analyzes data from the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) Statistics of Income (SOI) to provide an overview of who claims itemized deductions, what they claim them for, and the amount in deductions claimed.\n\n\u2022 In 2014, 30% of all tax filers chose to itemize their deductions rather than claim the standard deduction, with a greater share of higher-income individuals choosing to itemize their deductions compared with lower-income individuals. Higher-income tax filers chose to itemize their deductions more often than lower-income tax filers, with the share of tax filers who chose to itemize in income ranges above $200,000 remaining virtually the same (over 90%). The average sum of itemized deductions claimed increases substantially as income rises.\n\n\u2022 Tax filers in different income ranges tended to claim specific itemized deductions in different frequencies, with tax filers in higher-income ranges claiming deductions for charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes at higher rates than tax filers in lower-income ranges. The deduction for charitable gifts was claimed by 37% of tax filers with an AGI between $50,000 and $100,000, and more than 86% of tax filers in each of the income ranges over $200,000. Few tax filers claimed the deduction for extraordinary medical and dental expenses, particularly at the highest income ranges.\n\n\u2022 The average tax deduction values indicate which provisions had the largest effects in reducing different tax filers' taxable incomes, with the mortgage interest deduction being the largest single deduction claimed by tax filers with an AGI less than $500,000.

Every session, numerous bills are introduced that would change the way capital gains income is taxed. Congress has also shown a continuing interest in the tax treatment of capital losses. The financial turmoil and the volatile stock market have led to proposals to increase the limit on capital losses that can be deducted against ordinary income.\n\n* The current tax system has an asymmetrical treatment of capital gains and losses, with long-term gains taxed at a maximum rate of 15% and long-term losses deductible without limit against short-term capital gains. Net long-term losses are deductible against $3,000 of ordinary income, while short-term capital gains and ordinary income can be taxed at rates of up to 35%. This differential allows taxpayers to time their gains and losses to minimize income taxes. Increasing the net capital loss deduction would increase the rewards of gaming the system.\n\n* The empirical evidence indicates that capital gains income is heavily concentrated in the upper income ranges, with the top 3% of taxpayers earning 91% of schedule D capital gains in 2006. It is probable that large capital losses are also concentrated in the same income ranges. Taxpayers in the middle income ranges tend to hold capital gains producing assets as part of tax-favored retirement savings plans. The assets in these plans are not affected by the net loss restrictions.\n\n* The benefits of increasing the net loss deduction would tend to accrue to taxpayers in the upper income ranges. It is also unclear whether increasing the net loss deduction would stimulate the economy. Economic analysis suggests that measures to stimulate the economy should focus on spending or on tax cuts likely to be spent, which will directly increase aggregate demand. An expanded deduction for capital losses has a tenuous connection to expanded spending.\n\n* The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed repeatedly over the years, with some legislative changes attempting to reestablish symmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses.

Capital ratios are a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses, and regulators can require banks to hold a minimum level of capital, liquidity, or stable funding.

The program was focused mainly on energy storage, especially to even out the variable power production from rapidly growing use of wind and solar technologies. The advancement of computer capacity, miniaturization, and industrial controls has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows.\n\n* The nation's energy infrastructure is diverse, including a variety of transmission and distribution system network structures, operating models, and hardware and software. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the virtually borderless nature of energy use and the reliance on predominantly privately-owned infrastructure. Key challenges and opportunities facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure, and modernizing and securing communication networks.\n\n* The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is charged with a mission to support more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure. To achieve that mission, OE supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through research and development, demonstration projects, partnerships, facilitation, modeling and analytics, and emergency preparedness and response. OE is the federal government's lead entity for energy sector-specific responses to national energy security emergencies.\n\n* The FY2017 OE request aimed to support the Obama Administration's \"all-of-the-above\" energy strategy and emphasized priorities that increase electric grid resilience, including managing risks, increasing system flexibility and robustness, and deploying advanced control capabilities. The request sought funding changes for several programs and proposed the creation of three new programs for FY2017, including the Grid Institute, State Distribution-Level Reform, and State Energy Assurance. The largest requested increases were for Energy Storage and the three new programs.\n\n* The proposed Grid Institute would have focused on projects that help transfer to industry innovative material processes and production technologies for grid infrastructure application, while the State Distribution-Level Reform program would have aimed to help states identify and address issues involving structural, policy, and/or regulatory reforms. The State Energy Assurance program would have assisted state, local, tribal, and territorial stakeholders in planning, training, and exercising in advance of energy emergencies. The FY2017 request also sought to continue crosscutting programs that coordinate across the department and to employ DOE's full ability to address national energy, environmental, and security challenges.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 15, "symbol": "*"}}

These programs target individuals who have been denied coverage, received high quotes, or had preexisting conditions excluded from coverage. Many states use their high risk pools to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) provisions. HIPAA requires state-licensed health insurers to make coverage available to individuals moving from the group to nongroup market and prohibits exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions.\n\n* High risk pools generally cover people who have sought health coverage in the individual market but have been denied or received unfavorable offers. Many states also use their high risk pools to provide coverage to individuals with costly medical conditions. High risk pools are designed to assist individuals who have few options for private health coverage due to their health conditions. These pools appeal to policymakers who prefer an incremental approach to coverage expansion and reliance on current state oversight of health insurance.\n\n* Supporters of high risk pools contend that states can use their existing regulatory infrastructure and knowledge of health care markets to efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals. High risk pools can also benefit the private, nongroup market by removing high-risk persons and placing them in publicly subsidized insurance pools. This can make coverage in the individual market more affordable and promote competition among insurance carriers. High risk pools function as a safety net for the nongroup market, ensuring access to health insurance for those who are able and willing to pay for it.\n\n* Critics argue that high risk pools are generally too small and underfunded to meet the needs of the majority of persons who cannot access health insurance in the private market. Premiums combined with other cost-sharing requirements can make the coverage offered by these pools unaffordable. Most state high risk pools exclude coverage for preexisting conditions for six months or more, which can be a significant drawback. Some researchers remain skeptical that high risk pools will be able to substantially reduce the number of uninsured, particularly among those with serious medical conditions.\n\n* State high risk pools have existed since the mid-1970s, but congressional support began in the 1990s with the enactment of HIPAA. The Trade Act of 2002 authorized a new federal program to provide grants to state high risk pools and made appropriations for FY2003 and FY2004.

However, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes it difficult to track and regulate transactions.\n\n* The report discusses the potential impact of cryptocurrencies on monetary policy, including the possibility of central banks issuing their own digital currencies. The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could limit central banks' ability to control inflation and affect the availability of credit. However, some central banks are exploring the idea of issuing their own digital currencies to improve the efficiency of payment systems.\n\n* The future role and value of cryptocurrencies remain highly uncertain, with proponents asserting that they will become a widely used payment method and skeptics citing technological challenges and obstacles to widespread adoption. Policymakers will likely face various issues related to cryptocurrency, including concerns about its alleged facilitation of crime and the adequacy of consumer protections. The report concludes that the development of cryptocurrencies is a rapidly evolving field that requires ongoing monitoring and analysis.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21, "symbol": "*"}}

The law was enacted in 1999 and has been reauthorized several times, with the most recent reauthorization extending the program until September 30, 2020. The LMR program is administered by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and provides market information to buyers and sellers. The program has undergone several changes over the years, including the addition of new reporting requirements for wholesale pork cuts.\n\n\u2022 Before the implementation of LMR, the USDA collected livestock and meat price information on a voluntary basis, but this system was found to be inadequate, with an estimated 35-40% of cattle, 75% of hog, and 40% of lamb transactions not being reported. The livestock industry had undergone significant changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, and more vertical integration. This led to a decrease in negotiated sales and an increase in alternative marketing arrangements, making it difficult for producers to determine fair market prices. The LMR program was established to address these issues.\n\n\u2022 The LMR program requires packers to report prices and other information on a daily and weekly basis, including the prices established for steers and heifers, cows and bulls, barrows and gilts, sows and boars, and lambs. Packers must also report premiums and discounts, the type of purchase, and quality characteristics such as Choice grade. The program also requires packers to report sales data for boxed beef, wholesale pork, and carcass and boxed lamb. The reported data is used to provide market information to buyers and sellers.\n\n\u2022 The LMR program has several confidentiality rules in place to protect the identity of packers and contracts and proprietary business information.

The study found that TGM2 is overexpressed by mononuclear leukocytes, predominantly by activated monocytes, in the vascular bed of rat renal allografts during acute rejection. This overexpression is associated with increased levels of activated caspase-3, a key protease involved in apoptosis.\n\n\u2022 The study also found that TGM2 expression is induced in graft tissue upon allogenic transplantation, but no quantitative changes were detected at the protein level. The renal expression pattern of TGM2 was consistent with other publications on rodent and human TGM2 expression.

No patient requested reoperation in either group, and no patient expressed regret after surgery. The dominating indication for sympathetic surgery is hyperhidrosis of the upper limb.\n\n* The study suggests that r4 sympathicotomy decreases the extent of side effects but does not compromise efficacy, making it the method of choice for treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. R3 and r4 have similar success rates in treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. Selective sympathicotomy is an effective surgical method to eliminate compensatory sweating in the treatment of hyperhidrosis.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 15, "symbol": "*"}}

Generally, a relatively low-light reflectivity can be obtained for crystalline silicon solar cells by combining surface texturization with thin-film deposition.\n\n* To further reduce the light reflectivity for the improvement of solar cell efficiency, various nanostructures with sizes comparable to the wavelength of the utilized solar spectrum have been proposed. These nanostructures include photonic crystals, porous structures, plasmonics, and biomimetic nanostructures.\n\n* The subwavelength structures can be nanowires, nanocones, frustum nanorods, and dielectric nanoparticles, which should be based on wide bandgap materials that cannot absorb sunlight. Zinc oxide (ZnO) material has a wide bandgap and has been popularly used in the fields of photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices.\n\n* For photovoltaic application, ZnO nanostructures as antireflective layers can be fabricated by various approaches, including pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and electrochemical deposition technique. A seeding and growth two-step process in zinc salt and amide mixed solutions seems quite acceptable for photovoltaics due to its low cost and good potential for scale-up.\n\n* Experiments have shown that ZnO nanorod arrays can exhibit better antireflective properties than other oxide compounds, achieving a weighted global reflectance of 6.6% in the broadband range from 400 to 1,200 nm. However, most work on ZnO nanorod arrays as antireflective layers is performed on the naked silicon wafer.\n\n* In this work, ZnO nanowhiskers (NWS) with different lengths were grown by the seeding and growth two-step process, and the ZnO NW technique was integrated into the fabrication of Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells.

The patients' median age was 59 years, and the primary tumor was staged as T3 in 63% and T4 in 37% according to the TNM classification. The mean diameter of the primary tumor was 55 mm, and liver metastases were solitary in 29 patients and multiple in 57 patients.\n\n\u2022 Postoperative complications were significantly correlated with the presence of a diverting stoma, duration of operation greater than 8 hours, amount of intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion. Only a greater amount of blood loss had a predictive value for increased occurrence of postoperative complications. Anastomotic leakage was significantly correlated with lateral lymph node dissection, primary site of rectum, duration of operation greater than 8 hours, and amount of intraoperative blood loss.\n\n\u2022 Multivariate analyses revealed operation time greater than 8 hours as the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of SCLM.

Adipose tissue secretes proinflammatory factors like interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and leptin, as well as anti-inflammatory factors like interleukin 10 (IL-10) and adiponectin. A high-fat diet promotes metabolic changes, inducing the production of proinflammatory interleukins and a chronic inflammatory process. The presence of large concentrations of endotoxins and saturated fatty acids in the diet activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), triggering the production of proinflammatory cytokines.\n\n\u2022 Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian function, leading to adverse changes in lipoprotein profiles, glucose and insulin metabolism, body fat distribution, clotting, and vascular endothelium. The loss of estrogen production promotes these changes, placing women at a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Estrogen exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on the vasculature through antioxidant effects, generation of nitric oxide, prevention of apoptosis in vascular cells, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, and modulation of the renin-angiotensin system. However, controversy persists as to whether the effects of estrogens are anti- or proinflammatory.\n\n\u2022 This study evaluated the effects of a high-fat diet with or without ovariectomy on the inflammatory process in rats. The results showed that administration of a hyperlipidic diet for 8 weeks combined with short-term ovariectomy promoted an increase in body weight gain and a decrease in metabolic efficiency, accompanied by hyperleptinemia. The cytokine content of the liver and gastrocnemius muscle was unchanged, but levels of all cytokines analyzed were decreased in mesenteric adipose tissue. Ovariectomy in rats fed a hyperlipidic diet caused hyperleptinemia and increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content.\n\n\u2022 The combination of a high-fat diet and ovariectomy may cause a decrease in energy expenditure and an increase in adipose tissue deposits, probably via enhanced uptake of triglycerides from chylomicrons. Estrogen replacement has been shown to decrease food intake and restore weight in ovariectomized rats, suggesting that estrogen is involved in the modulation of energy homeostasis.

The National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) score improved from baseline to week 12 in two-thirds of the anti-VEGF switch population. The observed positive correlation between improvement in CS and reduction in CRT supports the argument that measurement of CS may provide a more complete understanding of the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment.\n\n* The study results suggest that CS measurement may provide a better understanding of visual performance challenges faced by individuals with vision impairment. An extended study duration involving a larger patient population would allow for further investigation and potential validation of results with regard to improvement in CS and other visual functioning parameters. Further analyses exploring multiple measures of visual function as efficacy end points in treatment studies of diabetic macular edema and other retinal diseases are warranted.

Researchers are trying to improve symptoms of MS by altering the behavior of MS patients, including exercise.\n\n\u2022 The study aimed to evaluate the association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in an Iranian population. IL-25 is a cytokine that plays a key role in stimulating and developing T helper 2 (Th2) responses, which can regulate Th1 and Th17 responses involved in the pathogenesis of MS. The study used a case-control design, recruiting 80 patients with MS and 75 healthy controls. The occurrence of MS was confirmed based on McDonald's criteria and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results.\n\n\u2022 The study found that the frequency distribution of the genotypes was not statistically different between patients with MS and the controls. The logistic regression model revealed that the odds ratio (OR) of MS development in patients with the AC and AA genotypes compared to patients with the CC genotype was not statistically significant. The study also found that the frequencies of A and C alleles were not statistically different between the two groups. The OR of MS development in patients with the A allele versus patients with the C allele was not statistically significant.\n\n\u2022 The study's results suggest that the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene is not associated with MS in the Iranian population. This is consistent with a previous study that found no association between this polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Peter Vitousek described impacts at the ecosystem level, affecting nutrient cycles and other ecosystem-level processes.

This has led to a greater understanding of the complex interactions between introduced and native species.\n\n* Molecular genetic research has revealed a great number of cases of the \"stealth\" impact of invaders, hybridization, and introgression with native species. This phenomenon was previously detected almost exclusively phenotypically, but many phenotypic responses are subtle and hidden amidst normal variation. Introgression can cause substantial evolution of native species, and hybridization between native and introduced species can produce new, more invasive species.

The National Institute of Health convened a consensus development conference in 1992 to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The panel concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no apparent increase in morbidity or mortality. This reduction in pain and disability led to the conclusion that treatment costs would be equal to or slightly less than the cost of open cholecystectomy.\n\n\u2022 The disability and loss of income following standard open cholecystectomy further increase costs, but these items are generally not measured by traditional appraisal methods. This convalescent period and, consequently, costs have been greatly reduced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This example of cost analysis should be requested by business and possibly patients, as they are impacted the most. Indeed, charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often surpass those of open cholecystectomy.\n\n\u2022 Surgeons at Maricopa Medical Center identified excessive length-of-stay and charges by comparing the cholecystectomy DRG with 16 other hospitals in the region. The remainder were either old patients with complications or young patients with advanced disease and complicated courses. Little could be done to reduce charges except to either lessen the conversion rates or costs for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In order to get a precise estimate of laparoscopic charges, match pair comparisons from the same data base of charges between open cholecystectomy and converted laparoscopic cholecystectomy were accomplished.\n\n\u2022 Since the comparisons matched age, sex, and similar diagnosis, many confounding variables could be eliminated. This suggested that the only reasons for the increased charges were the charges for laparoscopy. Other reasons for conversion, such as intraoperative complications, were eliminated because none of the matched pairs had serious complications or concomitant disease. Therefore, this comparison provided a relatively straightforward technique for statistical comparison to determine the charges for laparoscopy.\n\n\u2022 A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients was conducted from a four-year data base of 633 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy.

Nonnursing decision-makers emphasized the limitation of nurse leaders' singular focus on nursing issues, while nurse leaders described the problem of inadequate representation of nurses on national policy committees. The Public Health Act, which allows doctors to be the heads of ministerial departments, affords doctors a dominant role in policy-making.\n\n* The findings revealed that nurse leaders' participation in policy meetings was uneven, and many final policy decisions were made without nurse leaders being present.

Nurse leaders concurred that nurses did not generally understand the broader issues outside nursing that were necessary to influence policies. The nursing profession was blamed for its tradition of being a \"closed\" professional group, concerning themselves only with professional issues and not broader issues affecting the health care system. Nurses were also perceived as being isolated from other professionals.\n\n* The study suggested several ways to enhance nurses' participation in policy processes, including creating more opportunities for nurses to contribute to policy processes, increasing nurses' representation on policy-related structures, and reviewing the Public Health Law to allow nurses to compete for leadership positions. National policy-makers should consult frontline nurses when developing national policies, and nurse leaders should come to the ground more often and get views from frontline nurses to include in policies.

To achieve this, biologists need to adopt universal vocabularies to communicate effectively across different communities. The concept of homology is crucial in annotating genes, as it allows for the prediction of protein functions based on evolutionary relationships.\n\n\u2022 There are two common ways of annotating genes: empirical observations and predicted evolutionary relationships. Empirical annotations are essential but currently restricted to a minority of human genes, while homology-based annotations can provide approximate directions for future empirical determination of function. However, homology assignment should be treated with caution, as it may not always indicate similarities in molecular mechanism.\n\n\u2022 Domains are homologous portions of sequences that have survived the evolutionary tests of time without fragmentation. They represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution and can be used to annotate genes based on their component parts. Resources such as Pfam, Smart, and InterPro provide domain lexicons that can be used to annotate genes.\n\n\u2022 The annotation of individual proteins or complete proteomes using domains is achieved automatically rather than by manual curation. This is relevant, as a newly sequenced genome's proteome is generally in a high state of flux. Automatic annotation allows for the rapid identification of domain architectures and their associated functions.\n\n\u2022 The contribution of domain identification to gene-function prediction will remain significant until reliable results from high-throughput studies on closely related organisms are available. Comparative proteomics has played a major role in understanding the evolution of chordates, and domain architectures have been used to study the evolution of human proteins. However, the question of whether the number of representatives of a domain family is directly related to its contribution to cellular and organismal function remains open.\n\n\u2022 Web-based resources such as LocusLink, GeneCards, and Ensembl provide views of genomes from multiple vantage points, from protein tertiary structure to human disease. These resources often fail to distinguish between experimentally derived and predicted annotations, but they are a significant boon to biologists. As biological sciences progress, the cartography of the human genome will become more complex, with numerous different functional characteristics being assigned to a growing fraction of human genes.\n\n\u2022 The Gene Ontology project has created an initial hierarchy of defined terms that encompasses many of the flavors of 'function' commonly described in biology.

These characteristics support the hypothesis that a specific population of cells is responsible for propagation and sustained growth in a hierarchical manner. This theory was first proposed by Virchow in the 19th century.\n\n* Stem cells have the ability to make identical copies of themselves, and their ability to proliferate extensively and self-renew requires the induction of these behaviors. To classify a cell as a stem cell, it must be isolated and the behaviors induced in vitro. Cell surface proteins unique to stem cells can be used to isolate and track them.\n\n* Advances in stem cell biology have provided insight into the role of stem cells in the lung, despite the relative quiescence of the lung epithelia. Populations of stem cells have been identified throughout the lung by their role in responding to injury of the airway. The functional characteristics of stem cell behavior have been observed in these populations.\n\n* A growing body of evidence suggests that the earliest stages of lung malignancies may be related to a deregulation of the stem cell-based repair mechanism. The epithelial lining of the adult airway progresses from proximal to distal in a stereotyped fashion, with different types of epithelium in different regions. Multiple studies indicate that cells capable of stem-like behavior are present throughout the airway.\n\n* In proximal airways, studies have identified populations of tracheal basal cells that are pluripotent and express specific markers such as keratin-5 (K5) and keratin-14 (K14). These cells are capable of proliferating to give rise to cells of multiple phenotypes in response to airway injury. Squamous cell carcinoma frequently arises from the more proximal tracheobronchial airways.\n\n* In middle airways, a rat model of nitrogen dioxide/ozone inhalation injury revealed that mature rat Clara cells could proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny. These cells are capable of but not limited to behavior indicative of a stem cell, and are therefore referred to as facultative progenitor cells. Small cell lung carcinomas have been shown to contain fractions of cells expressing cell surface markers associated with mid-airway stem cell subpopulations.\n\n* In the most distal airway, there is no consensus on the cell surface marker phenotype of representative lung stem cells.

The most important complication of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which directly relates to a lack of immunity during pregnancy. By vaccinating all susceptible people or women in reproductive age, it is possible to prevent the disease in mothers and its possible serious complications in their fetus. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital infection with the rubella virus and CRS.\n\n\u2022 The disease is spread globally, and before the vaccination era, the maximum of its attacks had been between February and April in countries without effective policies for childhood vaccination. In closed populations such as military camps or prisons, however, in those who had suffered from this disease or vaccinated before, the possibility of infection is minimized. The disease is usually rare in infants born from IgG-positive mothers due to antibody transfer, and they will be immune for the first 46 months of their life. In general, the spread of the disease among children has been seriously decreased by extensive vaccination.\n\n\u2022 The most commonly used vaccine globally is derived from the RA27/3 virus strain, which makes more immunity in comparison with other vaccines, and the immune response is more similar to the immunity after natural infection. One dose induces seroconversion in 95% of vaccinated persons. A variety of seroepidemiological studies have been done globally to evaluate the situation of protective antibodies and need assessment to vaccinate against the rubella virus.

QDs have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission and resistance to photobleaching. However, commercially available QDs are quite large and may encounter penetration issues in embryos. To overcome this, proteinase K treatment was used to render Xenopus embryos permeable to QDs.\n\n\u2022 The QD-based WISH protocol was tested using various RNA probes, including those specific for Xenopus latent transforming growth factor binding protein 1 (LTBP1), amylase, endodermin (EDD), xbra, and myod. The results showed that QDs can penetrate deep into the embryo and stain structures independently of their proximity to the free QDs in solution. The use of QDs for in situ staining could result in more accurate determination of transcript expression patterns. The QD labeling survives the clearing protocol used to render Xenopus and other embryos transparent.\n\n\u2022 The QD-based WISH protocol was also used to detect two or more transcripts simultaneously, which is a time-consuming and stepwise process using chromogenic protocols. The results showed that QDs can be used to detect two or more transcripts simultaneously, with high resolution and strong signal intensities. The resolving ability of this method is substantially better than that of amplified protocols. The QD labeling of transcripts is of extremely high resolution and enables distinction of intracellular localization patterns of mRNA.\n\n\u2022 The QD-based WISH protocol has several advantages over traditional methods, including the ability to provide macroscopic and intracellular data regarding the distribution of mRNAs in vertebrate embryos. The ideal optical properties of QDs provide unprecedented resolution and strong signal intensities that have not been possible to attain using traditional fluorophores.

The needs, from bottom to top, are physiological needs, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiological needs are the physical requirements for survival, such as food and sex, while safety needs are personal security, financial security, and health and well-being. Safety needs are more fundamental than physiological needs and can block them.\n\n\u2022 Maslow proposed that if physiological needs are relatively satisfied, a new set of needs emerges, which can be categorized as safety needs. The organism may be dominated by safety needs, which can serve as the exclusive organizers of behavior. Safety needs are personal security, financial security, and health and well-being, which are more fundamental than physiological needs. For example, a deer cannot eat when wolves chase it, as safety needs take precedence over physiological needs.\n\n\u2022 The safety value has nothing to do with the hedonic value, as both liked and disliked things can induce unsafety. When something unexpected occurs, individuals first evaluate its threat and then its hedonic value. The emotional flow of fear-anger-happiness-sadness-calm constitutes everyday emotions. This kind of emotional flow happens in life all the time, with everything normally calm as expected, but fear and anger emerging when something unexpected occurs.\n\n\u2022 The amygdala has been proved to be the neural basis for fear and is recognized as the neural basis for stress-elicited fear and anxiety. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala promotes autonomous reactions and stress-like behavioral responses. Amygdala ablation induces a marked tameness increase, motivation loss, and fear decrease to aversive stimuli. The amygdala is one of the most important limbic structures that link to fear.\n\n\u2022 The process model of appraisal theory proposes two main appraisal processes: perceptual stimuli and associative processing and reasoning. Perceptual stimuli are what individuals pick up from their surroundings, such as sensations of pain or pleasure. Associative processing is memory-based, and reasoning is a slower and more deliberate process that involves logical thinking about the stimulus. The fast-acting thalamus-amygdala circuit is important for rapidly recognizing dangers to help with survival.\n\n\u2022 The ne/lc system is important for directing behaviors to cope with the dangerous environment, and its well-known function is to induce fight or flight behaviors.

This study aimed to describe the periprostatic nerve distribution and create a 3D model of nerve distribution.\n\n\u2022 The study used five adult male human cadavers and removed the prostate, seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum en bloc.

The stained sections were then analyzed to count the number of nerve fibers, measure the distance from the nerve fibers to the true prostate capsule, and measure the nerve fiber diameter.\n\n\u2022 The results showed that the number of nerve fibers was distributed evenly around the prostatic capsule, with no significant difference between the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts. However, the number of nerve fibers in the ventral part was significantly lower than in the other parts. The average distance from the prostatic capsule to the nerve fibers was also similar in all parts.\n\n\u2022 The study found that the traditional concept of a cord-like neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate was not supported by the results.

It has since been known from many salt deposits, including those in Austria and southern Germany. Polyhalite is often associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.\n\n\u2022 The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria and later confirmed. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by a reaction of gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70\u00b0C. At lower temperatures, the dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255\u00b0C to a maximum of 343\u00b0C. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements like Zn, Cu, Ni significantly changes dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures.\n\n\u2022 Polyhalite most commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite. The formation of polyhalite in marginal marine shallow water sedimentary environments is only suspected.

The difference in blood half-life is not fully understood and may be due to differences in particle size distribution or coating.\n\n* The study highlights the need for a dedicated MPI tracer with a prolonged blood half-life and ideal MPI characteristics, such as a homogenously distributed iron core diameter of around 30 nm. Resovist serves as an international standard of reference for the performance of MPI using new tracers. The development of a standardized physicochemical testing protocol is desirable to enable cooperation and dissemination of knowledge in the MPI community. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the differences in blood half-life between different batches and distributions of Resovist.</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 8, "symbol": "*"}}

This technique aims to achieve pulpal anesthesia from the central incisor to the second premolar without causing lip numbness or facial muscle anesthesia. The injection site is located palatally, halfway between the midpalatine raphe and the gingival margin of the first and second premolars.\n\n\u2022 The study evaluated the efficacy of the AMSA nerve block technique using a conventional syringe in 30 adult patients. The results showed that the anesthetic success rates ranged from 16.7 to 66.6%, with a mean anesthetic induction time of 6-12 minutes and a mean anesthetic duration time of 23-40 minutes. The technique did not cause lip numbness or facial muscle anesthesia in any of the patients.\n\n\u2022 The low success rates of the AMSA nerve block technique may be due to the variability in the presence of the Middle Superior Alveolar (MSA) nerve, which is responsible for the pulpal innervation of the premolars and the mesiobuccal root of the first molar. Anatomical studies have found that the MSA nerve is present in only 30-72% of cases, and its absence may affect the success of the technique. The technique may be more suitable for patients with a specific anatomical configuration.\n\n\u2022 The AMSA nerve block technique has some advantages, including the reduction of multiple injections and the quantity of anesthetic solution administered, which may be beneficial for cardiovascular-compromised patients. The technique also provides excellent hemostasis and reduces the need for multiple re-injections to obtain hemostatic control during periodontal procedures or graft harvest. However, the technique is generally considered painful, although the use of topical anesthetic and slow injection may minimize discomfort.\n\n\u2022 The Infraorbital Nerve Block (IONB) is an alternative technique that can provide pulpal anesthesia from the central incisor to the second premolar with a single injection. Although the IONB has better success rates of pulpal anesthetic, it causes facial numbness, which may be a disadvantage. The AMSA nerve block technique may be clinically useful in restorative dentistry and periodontal surgery due to its ability to anesthetize palatine tissue without causing facial numbness.</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 15, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The dynamic folding of chromatin is fundamental in regulating gene expression and DNA replication. The genome is folded in a hierarchical manner into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs). Each of these structures can be dynamically regulated during development, and perturbations in these folding units are associated with multiple diseases and cancer.\n\n\u2022 TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions. They have been shown to be stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions. The replication timing, the presence of different histone modifications, and the expression of the genes inside a TAD are highly correlated. However, the underlying features that generate invariant TAD boundaries remain unknown.\n\n\u2022 TAD boundaries have been associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and the timing of replication domains. In Drosophila, the combinatorial binding of different types of insulators is associated with the strength of the TAD boundary. The boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences. A strong TAD boundary limits interactions between the two adjacent TAD domains, whereas a weak TAD boundary allows a higher frequency of inter-TAD interactions.\n\n\u2022 The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions as well as for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions. BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength and its loss affects nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization. To delineate the role of BRG1 in genome architecture, RNA-seq and Hi-C were performed in control and BRG1 knockdown mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. BRG1 regulates the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix and lipid synthesis.\n\n\u2022 BRG1 knockdown resulted in the differential expression of many long non-coding RNAs, which are thought to be involved in genome organization. ChIP-seq analysis of BRG1 demonstrated binding primarily at genic regions.

The inflammatory response is driven by the complement cascade, coagulation pathway, and acute phase response, which affect phagocyte function. This response is difficult to distinguish from pathogen-specific responses using conventional experimental approaches.\n\n\u2022 To address this challenge, the authors hypothesized that the transcriptomic response of uninfected cells exposed to inflammation could serve as a baseline for the normal in vivo response to insult. They tested this hypothesis in a model of Leishmania infection, a pathogen associated with a significant global health burden. The authors discovered that expression of an RXRA-centered transcriptomic pathway was downregulated in response to inflammation but aberrantly maintained in infected cells.\n\n\u2022 The authors used a tractable experimental model of Leishmania infection and discovered that infected cells had a distinct transcriptional response compared to uninfected cells exposed to inflammatory signals.

Early theoretical approaches focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids or proteins, or adipose tissue, forming the glucostatic, aminostatic, and lipostatic hypotheses. More recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, along with sensory features of food.\n\n\u2022 The major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYy, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the GI tract or associated organs. These models account for the regulation of appetite and contribute to the regulation of body weight through the identification of specific molecular signals. The hypothalamus is a key player in this process, receiving information from the periphery.\n\n\u2022 The major task facing any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat, along with the intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signaling and tonic inhibition. A new formulation is proposed, based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects. This formulation aims to contribute to understanding the relative impact of biological and environmental cues on body weight.\n\n\u2022 An alternative approach to appetite control has arisen from the study of energy balance, focusing on the inter-relationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI). The idea is that any increase in EE will be met with an equivalent increase in EI, but this relationship is not always straightforward. Daily EE can fluctuate markedly from day to day, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of total daily EE.\n\n\u2022 RMR is a stable and uniform factor that could provide a tonic signal of energy demand, acting as a driver of daily EI. Exercise can raise RMR, but its effect on appetite is complex, involving both a compensatory response and a counteractive meal-related episodic inhibition. The effect of exercise on appetite is likely to be different from the effect of RMR.\n\n\u2022 The proposed formulation for appetite control involves a tonic drive for food arising from the physiological demand for energy, mainly from fat-free mass (FFM) and RMR. This drive is under tonic inhibition from leptin, whose action reflects the amount of stored energy reserves in the body.

These polymorphisms have been studied extensively in relation to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.\n\n\u2022 A meta-analysis of case-control studies was conducted to investigate the association between the 2AR polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk. The analysis included three studies with a total of 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls.\n\n\u2022 The results of the meta-analysis showed no significant association between the Arg16Gly polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk.

Chronic exposure to opioid drugs, including methadone, can impair cognitive abilities such as psychomotor performance, information processing, and memory. Methadone maintenance programs have shown impaired cognitive abilities in patients.\n\n*Methadone can induce changes in cytosolic free-calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt), which is involved in controlling various cellular and physiological processes, including neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. However, a dramatic increase in [Ca]cyt can lead to cell death. Mitochondria play a crucial role in buffering variations in calcium concentrations.\n\n*The study investigated the mechanisms underlying methadone-induced rises in [Ca]cyt in SH-SY5Y cells, a suitable model for studying opioid-mediated responses in neurons. The results showed that methadone induced a rise in [Ca]cyt in most cells, and four different types of calcium recordings were observed. The relative abundance of these types was affected by methadone.\n\n*Pharmacological surveys were conducted to study the possible contribution of different calcium-related mechanisms to the response to methadone. The results suggested that methadone-induced changes in [Ca]cyt were independent of opioid receptors and plasma membrane calcium channels. However, mitochondrial handling of calcium was found to play a crucial role in methadone-induced delayed calcium deregulation.\n\n*Mitochondrial morphology was studied in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pDSRed2-Mito, and the results showed that methadone induced mitochondrial fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was contradictory to earlier observations that methadone failed to induce mitochondrial swelling in isolated rat liver mitochondria. The study suggests that delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) plays a role in methadone-induced toxicity.\n\n*The study also investigated the effect of methadone on mitochondrial calcium uptake and found that it was dependent on the respiratory substrates used.

The CNS immune system is more complex and dynamic than previously envisioned.\n\n* Microglia are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac that enter the brain during different developmental stages. These progenitors express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and develop into CD45+ C-KIT+ CX3CR1+ immature cells and mature into CD45+ C-KIT+ CX3CR1+ cells. Microglial maturation is accompanied by a reduction in CD31 expression and upregulation of the macrophage marker F4/80.\n\n* Microglia form an autonomous population of cells within the brain that demonstrate activities independent of circulating monocyte activity. Resident microglia are distributed in the brain parenchyma and use motile processes to survey the microenvironment. The brain parenchyma is equipped with the glymphatic system, which clears interstitial solutes through the exchange of interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n* Microglia have multiple functions in the postnatal brain, including immune surveillance, phagocytosis, and secretion of humoral substances.

A fixed-effects meta-analysis of pooled results from 10 published reports of RRSO and the risks of breast and/or ovarian or fallopian tube cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was conducted. The analysis found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.\n\n* The summary risk reduction estimates should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies. Data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO. The clinical management of cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers is complex and should consider patient preferences.

These diseases have high societal costs and lead to a dramatic loss in life expectancy and quality of life. They are characterized by the aggregation of misfolded proteins, which can amplify and propagate from one cell to another.\n\n\u2022 The aggregation of misfolded proteins is a self-sustaining process that creates a vicious circle leading to disease. Molecular chaperones play a central role in maintaining normal cellular proteostasis by opposing protein misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation. However, upon cellular stress, the amounts of misfolded proteins increase, triggering a heat shock response.\n\n\u2022 The heat shock response is a partial correction of misfolding and unfolding, but sustained activation is detrimental, leading to an imbalance in normal cellular proteostasis. Misfolded proteins aggregate into intra- or extracellular protein deposits, depending on their location. The ubiquitin proteasome system degrades misfolded proteins, but high molecular weight assemblies are cleared by autophagy.\n\n\u2022 The aggregation of misfolded proteins can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function. This is due to the permeabilization of plasma membranes, perturbation of membrane protein dynamics, and the formation of novel pathogenic signaling platforms. Protein aggregates can also recruit molecular chaperones and other partner proteins, leading to their depletion.\n\n\u2022 The spread and transmission of disease via misfolded protein aggregates were thought to be restricted to prion proteins, but recent evidence suggests that other protein aggregates can spread in a prion-like manner. This is supported by the observation that protein aggregates associated with pathology initiate in specific areas of the brain and progress in a predictable manner. The transmission of misfolded protein aggregates has been demonstrated in various studies using animal models.\n\n\u2022 The existence of distinct strains of misfolded proteins, such as alpha-synuclein and tau, has been established.

IL-23 is a heterodimeric proinflammatory cytokine composed of a unique p19 subunit and a common p40 subunit shared with IL-12.

The coexistence of depression and pain has been shown to be a major risk factor for opioid misuse.\n\n* The Dolotest is a validated pain- and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment tool that integrates measurement of the intensity of pain with assessment of the impact of pain on eight 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS). The test results are also available as a Dolotest-score, ranging from 0 to 800. The study aimed to determine the usefulness of Dolotest as a screening tool for depression in primary care for adult patients seeking primary care. The study included a population of 715 patients, with a response rate of 68.5%.\n\n* The study found that 16.1% of all patients met criteria for depression, and 26.8% of patients whose visit was due to pain met depression criteria. The prevalence of patients with depression in the study group was statistically significantly higher than in the control group. The Dolotest domain \"low spirits\" was associated with depression, and a cut-off value of 65 was found to be optimal for detecting persons meeting criteria for depression. The Dolotest had a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 95% for detecting depression.\n\n* The study concludes that Dolotest is a useful screening tool for patients' experienced pain and the impact of pain on HRQOL, as well as a screening tool for patients meeting criteria for depression. The visual Dolotest profiles can facilitate awareness and communication about depression and pain, a coexistence leading to increased risk of reduced function, reduced work capacity, and increased healthcare costs. Treating both pain and depression when co-existing is very important, and healthcare providers are encouraged to be aware of pain symptoms in patients with depression. The Dolotest can ease the process of identifying patients with the important coexistence, enabling easy identification of this large group of patients needing individualized treatment.</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 16, "symbol": "*"}}

The virus has a genome of approximately 13 kb in length, with a gene composition similar to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). HMPV has two main genetic lineages, subtype A and B, with the A2 sublineage exhibiting the greatest diversity. The genetic diversity of HMPV suggests that it is a major concern in child respiratory tract viral infections.\n\n\u2022 The study analyzed the synonymous codon usage pattern in HMPV genomes and found that all preferred codons are ended with A/U nucleotides, which occupy the majority of nucleotide composition in the HMPV genome. The effective number of codons (ENC) was used to quantify the codon usage bias, and the results showed that ENC values fluctuated from 45.13 to 48.28 with a mean of 45.78 \u00b1 0.85. The ENC value of HMPV is consistent with other previously reported RNA viruses in the same family Paramyxoviridae. The study suggests that mutation pressure is the main force in shaping the synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV.\n\n\u2022 The study also found that HMPV showed a complementary trend with human cells by comparing the codon usage, which may benefit the survival of the virus by allowing it to replicate using non-preferred codons in the host cell without competition. The phylogenetic difference and host factors are also discussed, and the information can provide a better understanding of the molecular evolution and pathogenicity of HMPV. The study suggests that the difference in codon usage bias may influence the virulence of different genotypes. The results of the study can help understand the cell-host interaction and viral evolution of HMPV. The study provides new insights into the pathogenicity and evolution history of HMPV. The findings of the study can be used to develop new strategies for the prevention and treatment of HMPV infections. The study highlights the importance of synonymous codon usage analysis in understanding the molecular evolution of viruses. The results of the study can be used to develop new diagnostic tools for HMPV infections. The study provides a new perspective on the molecular evolution of HMPV and its interaction with the host cell.

Her theory focuses on men's economic position, rather than women's, and suggests that men's uncertainty and instability in their careers can deter union formation.\n\n\u2022 Oppenheimer's theory was developed in response to two dominant perspectives on demographic change: the economic perspective, which argued that women's economic independence led to a decline in marriage, and the cultural perspective, which emphasized the role of value change and individualism. Oppenheimer criticized both perspectives, arguing that they were pessimistic about the future of marriage and failed to account for the complexities of men's economic position.\n\n\u2022 Research in the United States has generally supported Oppenheimer's theory, showing that poor economic prospects for men are associated with delayed marriage. However, there is less evidence on the effects of men's income and earnings on union formation in Europe.\n\n\u2022 This study uses panel data from the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) to examine the effects of men's economic position on union formation in 13 European countries. The study finds that employment, income, and work history are all important factors in union formation, and that men who are not yet settled in their careers postpone union formation.\n\n\u2022 The study also finds that cohabitation is less sensitive to economic insecurity than marriage, and that men who are not employed or have temporary jobs are more likely to choose cohabitation rather than marriage. Additionally, the study finds that income effects are weaker in more egalitarian countries, where gender roles are more symmetrical.\n\n\u2022 The effects of men's economic position on union formation vary across societal contexts, with stronger effects in more traditional societies and weaker effects in more egalitarian ones. The study suggests that in egalitarian settings, the costs of setting up a household are more often shared between men and women, allowing men to experiment with their careers.\n\n\u2022 The study concludes that Oppenheimer's theory is relevant to the European context, but that the effects of men's economic position on union formation are more complex and nuanced than previously thought.

The condition reflects the integration of bone mass and quality, which depends on macro- and microarchitecture and intrinsic properties of bone materials. Bone quality is maintained through bone remodeling, a process that removes damaged bone and replaces it with new bone.\n\n* Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease that affects the myelin sheath covering of nerve fibers, leading to functional impairments such as visual impairment, abnormal walking mechanics, and muscle weakness. The disease mainly affects young adults, with a higher incidence in women. Impaired mobility or lack of weight-bearing physical activity reduces mechanical stress on bone, causing an imbalance in bone remodeling.\n\n* Secondary osteoporosis may develop in patients with MS, and low-trauma fractures occur more frequently than in healthy controls. Fractures and their sequelae can have significant personal and economic implications for society. The attention on bone health among patients with MS is warranted, and understanding the causes of decreased bone strength will help in optimal therapeutic intervention.\n\n* The analysis of a registry of 9029 patients with MS found that 27.2% reported low bone mass, and more than 15% reported a history of fracture. Most studies in patients with MS evaluated bone mineral density (BMD) in comparison with healthy subjects and showed significantly lower BMD in patients with MS. Vertebral BMD is affected to a lesser degree than femoral BMD.\n\n* The degree of disability measured by the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score significantly correlated with BMD in patients with MS. Site-specific effects of motor disability were documented in MS patients, and EDSS correlated mainly with BMD in the hip but not in the lumbar spine. Higher total body bone mineral content was documented in ambulatory patients compared with nonambulatory patients.\n\n* Glucocorticoids (GCs) are frequently used to control MS relapses, and oral GC treatment may increase the risk of osteoporosis. Epidemiological studies showed that fracture risk is increased rapidly after starting oral GC treatment and is related to the dose and duration of GC exposure. Bone loss due to GC treatment is steep during the first 12 months and more gradual but continuous in subsequent years.\n\n* Vitamin D plays a crucial role in bone homeostasis, and its deficiency is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis.

Professor B also mentions the idea of adding noise to the training data to make it more uniform.\n\n\u2022 The team discusses the idea of modifying the variance of the Gaussian models to adjust the importance of different features. Professor B suggests that this can be done by multiplying the standard deviation of the model by a constant, which would effectively make the feature more or less important.

The approach is being evaluated by Cardiff Metropolitan University and Swansea University.\n\n\u2022 The Minister acknowledges that 11% of secondary schools inspected in the last two academic years were judged as unsatisfactory, needing urgent improvement, which is not acceptable.
