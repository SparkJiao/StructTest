1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so that leaves 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins, so that leaves 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
4. She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

White fiber = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber}$
White fiber = $\frac{1}{2} \times 2$
White fiber = 1 bolt

Now, to find the total bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt

150% of $80,000 is calculated as:
150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000

So, the increase in value is $120,000. Now, let's add this to the original value to find the new value of the house:
$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we know the house is worth $200,000 after the repairs. Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair costs) from the new value of the house:

Profit = New value - (Purchase price + Repair costs)
Profit = $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000)

   \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \)
3. Carla has already downloaded 80 GB, so she has 120 GB left to download (200 GB - 80 GB).
4. The restart takes 20 minutes, during which no data is downloaded.
5. After the restart, Carla continues downloading at the same rate of 2 GB/minute. To find out how long it takes to download the remaining 120 GB, we divide the remaining data by the download rate:

   John has been driving for a total of 3 hours (first leg) + 2 hours (traffic) + 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 5.5 hours. He has 4 hours to get home, so he has 4 - 5.5 = -1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph. Since he can't drive for a negative time, this means he has already used up all his time and is not able to drive at 80 mph for the remaining time.

Since John has already used up all his time and has not been able to drive at 80 mph for the remaining time, he is still at the point where he was driving at 30 mph. Therefore, he is 15 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

2. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount spent on video games is:
   8 video games * $20/video game = $160

3. After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the amount he had after selling the Lego sets and before buying the video games was:
   $160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $165

4. Since he had $195 from selling the Lego sets and $165 after buying the video games, the difference must have been spent on something else. However, the problem doesn't mention any other expenses, so we can assume he didn't spend any additional money. Therefore, the amount he had after selling the Lego sets and before buying the video games should be equal to the amount he got from selling them, which is $195.

Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties as follows:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Now, let's find out the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the additional cost and add it to the cost of a blue tie:

Additional cost for red ties = 50% of cost of blue tie
Additional cost for red ties = 0.5 * $40
Additional cost for red ties = $20

Cost of each red tie = Cost of blue tie + Additional cost for red ties
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20

                         = 0.25 * $40.00
                         = $10.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the final bill:
Total with delivery fee = Final bill + Delivery fee
                         = $40.00 + $3.00
                         = $43.00

Next, we add the tip Stephen added to the total:
Total with tip = Total with delivery fee + Tip
               = $43.00 + $4.00
               = $47.00

1. There are 25 oranges in total.
2. 1 orange is bad.
3. 20% of the oranges are unripe.
4. 2 oranges are sour.

First, we need to find out how many oranges are unripe. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we calculate this as:

Unripe oranges = 20% of 25
                 = 0.20 * 25
                 = 5 oranges

Now, we know the following:
- 1 orange is bad.
- 5 oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges)
             = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
             = 25 - 8

2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. Ja = 10 (James is 10 years old)

97,"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that the volume of the tomatoes is halved when they are cooked into sauce. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce after cooking.

Given that Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, we can calculate the volume of the tomatoes before cooking as follows:

Volume of tomatoes before cooking = Volume of sauce after cooking × 2
= 32 ounces × 2
= 64 ounces

Now, we know that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:

Number of cans used = Total volume of tomatoes / Volume of one can
= 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can
= 4 cans

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

Since these 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, they must have been part of the original 25 cars that were left after the 5 took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that could have driven through minus the 20 that drove through in the last 15 minutes.

The dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. However, since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (we subtract 2 inches because the thickness of the walls is on both sides of the inner space).

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:

Volume = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches
Volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:

   2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

2. On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. We already know that there were 10 vehicles from the first day, so the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
   30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles

3. Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
   20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

1. **Adrien's salary four years ago**: We are given that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

2. **Adrien's salary increase**: Four years later, his salary had increased by 40%. To find the new salary, we calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to the original salary:
   Increase = 40% of $40,000 = 0.40 * $40,000 = $16,000
   New salary = Original salary + Increase = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

3. **Adrien's total salary four years ago**: We know that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as L. So, Adrien's salary four years ago was L + 30% of L:
   Adrien's salary = L + 0.30L = 1.30L
   We know Adrien's salary was $40,000, so:
   1.30L = $40,000
   L = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately)

4. **Lylah's salary four years later**: Since Lylah's salary also increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we need to find out by what percentage it increased. We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so we can assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (since it's not specified otherwise). So, Lylah's new salary is:
   Lylah's new salary = L + 40% of L = $30,769.23 + 0.40 * $30,769.23 = $30,769.23 + $12,307.70 = $43,076.93 (approximately)

5. **Total salary four years later**: To find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary:
   Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary = $56,000 + $43,076.93 = $99,076.93 (approximately)

3. For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each of those days.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 6 hours each day, so 6 + 6 = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 7 hours each day, so 7 * 4 = 28 hours

3. Brittany's mom buys one of each, so the total cost is $12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22.
4. She receives $8 in change after paying for the tickets.

To find out how much money she gave the cashier, we add the change she received to the total cost of the tickets:

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change received) = $30.

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

150,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then determine who wins and how long the winner has to wait.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet to match the units of speed given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

For Tim:
- Distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For Steve:
\[ \text{Time}_\text{Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Time}_\text{Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Tim takes 40 minutes and Steve takes 36 minutes, Tim is the winner. To find out how long Steve has to wait for Tim, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time:
\[ \text{Waiting Time} = \text{Time}_\text{Tim} - \text{Time}_\text{Steve} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Steve will be waiting for 4 minutes at his house before Tim finishes the race.

The final result, without any extra units or LaTeX expressions, is $\boxed{4 \text{ minutes}}$.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
151,"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to consider the number of tires on each type of vehicle and the cost per tire.

1. Bicycles have 2 tires each. On the first day, 5 people came by with bicycles, so the total number of bicycle tires is:
\[5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires}\]

2. Tricycles have 3 tires each. There were 3 people with tricycles, so the total number of tricycle tires is:
\[3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires}\]

3. Unicycles have 1 tire each. There was 1 person with a unicycle, so the total number of unicycle tires is:
\[1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire}\]

Adding these up gives the total number of tires Shawnda inflated:
\[10 \text{ tires (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ tires (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ tire (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount Shawnda made is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

153,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is $\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7$ fries.
3. After the seagull, there were $14 - 7 = 7$ fries left.
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so together they ate $3 \times 3 = 9$ fries.
5. After the pigeons, there were $7 - 9 = -2$ fries left, which means the pigeons ate more than what was left after the seagull.
6. Since the pigeons can't eat more than what's available, we need to correct the calculation. The seagull actually ate 7 fries, leaving 7 fries. The pigeons then ate 6 fries (since 9 is not possible), leaving 1 fry.
7. A raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries, which is $\frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3}$ of a fry. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we round down to 0 fries stolen by the raccoon.
8. Finally, ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 0 fries.

However, the problem states that there are 5 fries left at the end, which contradicts our calculations. This means there must have been more fries initially. Let's correct the calculation:

- The seagull ate 7 fries, leaving 7 fries.
- The pigeons ate 6 fries, leaving 1 fry.
- The raccoon stole $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining 1 fry, which is $\frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3}$ of a fry. Again, we can't have a fraction of a fry, so we round down to 0 fries stolen by the raccoon.
- The ants then carried off 1 fry, leaving 0 fries.

This still doesn't match the final count of 5 fries. The mistake is in the calculation of the raccoon stealing fries. The raccoon can't steal a fraction of a fry, so it must steal 0 or 1 fry. Since we know there are 5 fries left after the ants, the raccoon must have stolen 1 fry, leaving 1 fry for the ants to carry off.

So, the correct calculation is:

- The seagull ate 7 fries, leaving 7 fries.
- The pigeons ate 6 fries, leaving 1 fry.

162,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the compound interest effect of the price increase every two months for a total of 36 months.

1. First, let's determine how many times the price increases in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

2. Each price increase is by 20% of the original price. To find the new price after each increase, we multiply the current price by 1 plus the percentage increase (expressed as a decimal):
   \[
   \text{New price} = \text{Current price} \times (1 + \text{Percentage increase})
   \]
   In this case, the percentage increase is 20%, or 0.20 as a decimal.

3. We apply this formula repeatedly for each of the 18 price increases. The initial price is $20. After the first increase, the price becomes:
   \[
   \text{Price after 1st increase} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \times 1.20 = 24
   \]
   After the second increase, the price becomes:
   \[
   \text{Price after 2nd increase} = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.80
   \]
   And so on, until the 18th increase.

4. However, calculating this step by step for 18 times is cumbersome. Instead, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \text{Initial amount} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of periods}}
   \]
   In this case, the initial amount is $20, the rate is 20% or 0.20, and the number of periods is 18.

5. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:
   \[
   \text{Final price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   Calculating this gives us:
   \[
   \text{Final price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \approx 20 \times 10.68 \approx 213.60

For one Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. So for 15 flans, she would need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we know that Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting session}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express S in terms of B:
S = 2B

Now, let's substitute S in the second equation with 2B:
(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:
3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

1. **Initial Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Planting and Chopping Down Trees Each Year**:
   - Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
   - Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}\).

3. **Total Trees After 10 Years**:
   - Adding the increase to the initial number of trees, Tom has \(50 \text{ trees} + 80 \text{ trees} = 130 \text{ trees}\).

4. **Trees Dying**:
   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 \text{ trees} = 39 \text{ trees}\).

5. **Final Number of Trees**:
   - Subtracting the trees that died from the total number of trees, Tom is left with \(130 \text{ trees} - 39 \text{ trees} = 91 \text{ trees}\).

1. **Initial Setup**: On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. So, we start with 18 pink flamingos.

2. **Saturday's Event**: On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put them back. To find out how many flamingos were taken back and painted white, we calculate one third of 18:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6

   So, 6 flamingos were taken back, painted white, and returned to the yard.

3. **Sunday's Event**: On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. This means the total number of pink flamingos now is:
   \[
   18 + 18 = 36
   \]
   Since 6 white flamingos were already in the yard from Saturday's event, the total number of flamingos in the yard at this point is:
   \[
   36 + 6 = 42
   \]

4. **Comparison**: To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:
   \[
   36 - 6 = 30
   \]

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were $\boxed{30}$ more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( x + 16 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( 2x + 16 \) gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2x + 16 = 4x + 64 \]

However, it doesn't make sense to have a negative amount of water in the pool. This indicates that we made a mistake in our setup. The correct approach is to consider the water that was lost due to the leaks. Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation as:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

Adding 16 to both sides, we get:

\[ 2x = 4x - 48 \]

Subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides, we get:

Adding 48 to both sides, we get:

2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, let's find out how many points Yuri scored. Since Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, we calculate half of Naomi's points and then add 10:

Half of Naomi's points = 68 / 2 = 34
Yuri's points = 34 + 10 = 44

Next, let's find out how many points Brianna scored. Since Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, we add 17 to Naomi's points:

Brianna's points = 68 + 17 = 85

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:

Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197

Finally, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the overall total points:

Total cost for 12 cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we calculate the tax on the total cost of the cars:
Tax rate = 10%
Total tax = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Registration fee per car = $1,000
Total registration fee = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000

Finally, we add the total cost of the cars, the total tax, and the total registration fee to find the total amount Mark pays:

2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
3. Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.

From point 2, we can express the number of wolves Rick killed today as 3 times the number of cougars he killed today. Let's call the number of cougars he killed today ""C"". So, the number of wolves he killed today is 3C.

From point 3, we know that the number of cougars he killed today is 3 fewer than the 15 cougars he killed last night. So, C = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now we can find out how many wolves he killed today: 3C = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the animals killed last night to the animals killed today:

Wolves last night: 10

   100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1.00

2. Nickels: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is equal to $0.05, we multiply 40 by $0.05 to get the total value in dollars.
   40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2.00

3. Dimes: Brady has 20 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to $0.10, we multiply 20 by $0.10 to get the total value in dollars.

Weight per foot = 400 pounds / 10 feet = 40 pounds/foot

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate into it by multiplying the weight per foot by the total height of the tree:

Total weight before termites = 40 pounds/foot * 200 feet = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to calculate how much wood the termites ate. Since they ate 30% of the wood, we can find the weight of the wood they ate by calculating 30% of the total weight before termites:

Weight of wood eaten = 30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Finally, to find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate into it, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten from the total weight before termites:

1. **Find the number of spots on a mamba**: Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:
   \[
   \text{Spots on a mamba} = \frac{\text{Spots on a cobra}}{2} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras**: There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for all cobras is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas**: There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for all mambas is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots}
   \]

4. **Find the combined total number of spots**: To find the total number of spots for all snakes, we add the total spots for cobras and mambas:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for all snakes} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots}
   \]

5. **Calculate half the total number of spots**: Finally, to find half the total number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2:
   \[
   \text{Half the total number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \text{ spots}

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

Each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches. So, the space left for the silver beads is:
25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (length of topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Now, we need to find out how many sterling silver beads can fit into the remaining 17 inches of space. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads that can fit is:
17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 inches * 4 beads/inch = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stories they wrote in the first week:

- Alani: 20 stories
- Braylen: 40 stories

Now, we add the stars from the 8-star and 6-star rows together:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Now, we divide the number of 5-star rows by the number of stars in each row to find out how many rows there are:

First, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
Ali's medals + Izzy's medals = 22 + 17 = 39 medals

Since this is 1/10th of the total medals given out, we can find the total by multiplying by 10:

2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike after 3 rounds, so he has:
   21 (Mike's points) - 3 = 18 points
   In the fourth round, Jim does not get an extra point because he does not have over 20 points. So, Jim's total points are:

- Taxes = Gross pay * Tax rate

Since the total number of students in the class is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[2x + (x - 10) = 200\]

Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms:

\[3x - 10 = 200\]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with $x$:

\[3x = 210\]

Dividing both sides by 3 to solve for $x$:

\[x = 70\]

Now that we know $x$, which is the number of students in each of the two equal groups, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from $x$:

First, let's calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. Since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs of the trip, we have:

Distance from third to first city = (75 miles + 100 miles) - 50 miles

So, the total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for the collie beds. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we first find the average:

Number of boys = 12

Now that we know there are 12 boys in the park, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of girls and boys together:

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of kids = 6 + 12
Total number of kids = 18

2. A number equal to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, for shoplifting, the number is 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 people.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, for physical violence, the number is 3 * 7 = 21 people.

Now, let's add up the people kicked out for the reasons we know:
Mask refusal: 3 people
Shoplifting: 7 people
Physical violence: 21 people

2. **Etching Cost:**
   - The etching adds an additional 20% to the cost of each frame.
   - The additional cost per frame is 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - So, the total etching cost is 44 * $4 = $176.

First, let's find out how much more money Mark needs to save to buy the bike:
Cost of the bike - Money Mark already has = Additional money needed
$300 - $50 = $250

Now, we'll divide the additional money needed by the amount Mark earns per day to find out how many days he needs to save:
Additional money needed / Daily earnings = Number of days to save

2. She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. So, the number of millipedes is:
   Millipedes = (1/3) * Spiders
   Millipedes = (1/3) * 90
   Millipedes = 30

3. She saw a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is:
   Stink bugs = 2 * Millipedes - 12
   Stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
   Stink bugs = 60 - 12
   Stink bugs = 48

4. To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

For flour:
The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups of flour.

For milk:
The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Now, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

For milk:
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs to buy 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, we know that each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Next, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost will be:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00 for meat

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost will be:

2. Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

   New Cannolis = 40 + 60
   New Cannolis = 100

3. Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the new total number of cannolis, so the new total number of corns is:

Now, let's calculate the savings from the jogger jeans:
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

Since the total savings are $6, the savings from the tattered jeans would be:
\[ S_t = 6 - S_j \]
\[ S_t = 6 - 2 \]
\[ S_t = 4 \]

Now, we know that the savings from the tattered jeans ($4) is the difference between the original price and the sale price of the tattered jeans. So, the original price of the tattered jeans would be:
\[ 28 + 4 = 32 \]

Finally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans:
\[ J - 32 \]
\[ 22 - 32 \]
\[ -10 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $10 less than the tattered jeans, which means the tattered jeans originally cost $10 more than the jogger jeans.

Each of the store-bought feeders attracts 20 birds throughout the day. Since there are 3 of them, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Each of the homemade feeders attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Since there are 3 of these as well, they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted by the homemade and store-bought feeders, which is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

1. **Calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed:**
   The volume of one raised bed is given by the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: length × width × height.
   So, for one bed, the volume is:
   8 feet (length) × 2 feet (width) × 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

2. **Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds:**
   Since there are 10 beds, the total volume needed is:
   32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

3. **Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed:**
   Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
   320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

4. Add up the number of red, green, and yellow cards to find the total number of cards.

Let's break it down:

1. **Green Cards Calculation:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - Green cards are 60% more than red cards, so we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - $60\% \times 15 = 0.6 \times 15 = 9$
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is $15 + 9 = 24$.

2. **Total Red and Green Cards:**
   - The total number of red and green cards is $15 + 24 = 39$.

3. **Yellow Cards Calculation:**
   - Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards, so there are also 39 yellow cards.

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.
   - Total cards = Red cards + Green cards + Yellow cards
   - Total cards = $15 + 24 + 39 = 78$.

- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip

When we divide 4500 by 2250, we get 2 with a remainder of 0. This means the farmer can make exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed without needing to make a third trip.

- The 4 cheerleaders on the bottom are 64"" tall each. In feet, this is $64 \div 12 = 5.333$ feet.
- The 3 cheerleaders on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. In feet, this is $64 \div 12 = 5.333$ feet.

For the second venue, the total cost \( C_2 \) is the cost per person times the number of guests:

We want to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs are equal, so we set \( C_1 \) equal to \( C_2 \) and solve for \( x \):

Together, they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:

B + B/2 + (B/2 + 7) = 43

Combining like terms, we get:

- So, the total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags.
- Each pack costs $4, so the total cost for the packs is 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue:
- She sold each bag for $8.
- So, the total revenue from selling 40 bags is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Number of rows for red tulips = Total red tulips / Tulips per row
Number of rows for red tulips = 36 / 6
Number of rows for red tulips = 6 rows

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips. Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, and he has 24 blue tulips. To find out how many rows he can plant with the blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

Ada's daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour

Now, let's calculate her daily consumption after adding the new device:

New daily consumption = Ada's daily consumption + Device's daily consumption
New daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour
New daily consumption = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, we'll calculate her weekly consumption before and after adding the new device. Since there are 7 days in a week:

Weekly consumption before = Daily consumption * 7 days
Weekly consumption before = 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days
Weekly consumption before = 84 kilowatts per week

Weekly consumption after = New daily consumption * 7 days
Weekly consumption after = 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days
Weekly consumption after = 98 kilowatts per week

Now, let's calculate the cost of her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device. The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50:

Weekly bill before = Weekly consumption before * Cost per kilowatt per hour
Weekly bill before = 84 kilowatts per week * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour
Weekly bill before = $126.00 per week

1. Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20.
2. The starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. This can be written as: (20 + 20/2) / 5
3. The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. This can be written as: (20 + 20/2) / 5 * (20 - 12)

Now, let's solve it:

First, calculate half of the starting value:
20 / 2 = 10

Then, add this to the starting value:
20 + 10 = 30

Now, divide this sum by 5:
30 / 5 = 6

Next, subtract 12 from the starting value:

580,"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, which is 18 degrees more than the set temperature.

The percentage error can be calculated as follows:

Percentage Error = (Error / Set Temperature) * 100
Percentage Error = (18 / 450) * 100
Percentage Error = 0.04 * 100
Percentage Error = 4%

This means that the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find out what temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to calculate the temperature that would result in a 4% increase to 520 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set the oven to as T.

T + (T * 0.04) = 520

Now, we solve for T:

1.04T = 520
T = 520 / 1.04
T = 500

Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is consistently running 4% hotter than the set temperature.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:

So, the discounted price for one box is:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount amount
                 = $100.00 - $10.00
                 = $90.00

Now, let's find out how much Pete will pay for 2 boxes at the discounted price:

Total cost for 2 boxes = 2 * Discounted price
                       = 2 * $90.00
                       = $180.00

Since 90 single use contacts come in one box, 2 boxes will contain:

Total contacts = 2 * 90
               = 180 contacts

Now, we need to find the cost per pair of contacts. Since Pete uses one pair per day, we can calculate the cost per pair by dividing the total cost by the number of days the contacts will last:

Cost per pair = Total cost for 2 boxes / Number of days
              = $180.00 / 45 days

\[500 \text{ calories/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 1000 \text{ calories}\]

For running:
She burns 600 calories/hour and spends 1 hour running, so the total calories burned from running is:

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combining like terms, we get:

3B = 4500

Now, we can solve for B:

B = 4500 / 3
B = 1500

Now that we know there are 1500 blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

Earnings from the next two hours = Number of cups sold per hour * Price per cup * Number of hours
= 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours
= $12

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings from the first four hours + Earnings from the next two hours

606,"First, let's calculate how many rotations the tires make in a month. Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can set up the following calculation:

Rotations per month = (Miles driven per month) * (Rotations per mile)
                   = 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles)
                   = 400 * 362.5
                   = 145,000 rotations

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach this limit, we divide the total number of rotations a tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

Months before replacement = Total rotations per tire / Rotations per month
                         = 10,440,000 / 145,000
                         = 72 months

Finally, to find out how many years it takes for the tires to need replacement, we divide the number of months by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / Months per year
                        = 72 / 12

607,"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine how many pumps are in the jumbo bottle. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash and the bottle gives 120 washings, we can calculate the number of pumps as follows:

Number of pumps = Number of washings
Number of pumps = 120

Now, we know the total cost of the jumbo bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump in cents, we need to convert the total cost to cents and then divide by the number of pumps:

Total cost in cents = Total cost in dollars * 100 (since $1 = 100 cents)
Total cost in cents = $24.00 * 100
Total cost in cents = 2400 cents

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of pumps to find the cost per pump:

Cost per pump in cents = Total cost in cents / Number of pumps
Cost per pump in cents = 2400 cents / 120 pumps
Cost per pump in cents = 20 cents

Discount amount = 30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18

Subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to get the total cost after discount:

Total cost after discount = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the total cost. Now, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase:

Money Joe has = $50

611,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John initially has $100,000 for the first 5 months.
2. The research takes 10 times longer than initially planned, so it takes 50 months in total.
3. After the first 5 months, the funding required increases by 50% each month.

First, we calculate the cost for the initial 5 months:
Cost for initial 5 months = $100,000

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months (50 total months - 5 initial months). Since the funding increases by 50% each month, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to calculate this:

Sum of a geometric series = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:
- a is the first term (funding for the 6th month, which is 1.5 times the initial monthly funding),
- r is the common ratio (1.5, since the funding increases by 50% each month),
- n is the number of terms (45 months).

First, we find the funding for the 6th month:
Funding for 6th month = $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000

Now, we can calculate the sum for the remaining 45 months:
Sum for remaining 45 months = $150,000 * (1 - (1.5)^45) / (1 - 1.5)

Calculating this gives us:
Sum for remaining 45 months ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.5 ≈ $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / -0.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

Now, let's calculate the total cost price for the 10 cars the company acquired.

Total cost price for 10 cars = $7,500 * 10

This $40 is the amount that can be spent on the remaining classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. Since there are 10 classes in total, we can calculate the number of classes that can be paid for with the remaining $40:
$40 / $10/class = 4 classes

First, let's find out how many deviled egg halves Lori will need for her 16 guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, we multiply the number of guests by the number of halves per guest:

Number of halves needed = Number of guests × Halves per guest
Number of halves needed = 16 guests × 3 halves/guest
Number of halves needed = 48 halves

Now, we know that Lori needs 48 deviled egg halves in total. Since each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find out how many whole eggs Lori will need by dividing the total number of halves by 2:

Number of eggs needed = Total halves needed ÷ Halves per egg
Number of eggs needed = 48 halves ÷ 2 halves/egg
Number of eggs needed = 24 eggs

Finally, since a dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, we need to find out how many dozens Lori will need. We do this by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extended part is \( 0.5L \). She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is the sum of the original length, the extended part, and the lace trim, which is 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation as:

Rate of chocolate ice cream = Quarts made / Time taken
                           = 100 quarts / 2 hours
                           = 50 quarts per hour

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours:

Total chocolate ice cream = Rate of chocolate ice cream * Time
                          = 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours

First, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal. With $6.00, she can buy $6.00 / $1.50 per scoop = 4 scoops.

Now, let's apply the deal. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for the first 2 scoops, she only pays for 1 (since the second one is free). This leaves her with 3 scoops paid for (2 scoops + 1 free scoop).

With the remaining $3.00 (since she spent $3.00 on the first 2 scoops), she can buy another 2 scoops (because $3.00 / $1.50 per scoop = 2 scoops). Again, with the deal, she only pays for 1 of these 2 scoops, so she gets the second one free.

So, in total, Erin gets 3 scoops paid for (from the first 2 scoops) + 1 scoop paid for (from the second 2 scoops) + 1 free scoop (from the first 2 scoops) + 1 free scoop (from the second 2 scoops) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 scoops of ice cream.

Area to be covered = 36 sq ft * (2/3)
Area to be covered = 24 sq ft

Next, we need to determine how many mosaic tiles are required to cover this area. Since each mosaic tile covers 1 sq ft, we simply need to divide the area to be covered by the area covered by one tile:

Now, add the fixed cost to get the total cost of picking:

Total cost = Fixed cost + Cost of blueberries
Total cost = $20 + $45 = $65

Next, let's calculate how much it would have cost James to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store for $2.5 per pound:

Cost at the store = Price per pound * Number of pounds
Cost at the store = $2.5 * 30 = $75

Now, we can find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store:

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as $x$. According to the problem, the first house needs half the amount of the second house, and the third house needs double the amount of the first house.

1. The first house needs half the amount of the second house, so we can express this as:
\[ \text{First house} = \frac{1}{2}x \]

2. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we can express this as:
\[ \text{Third house} = 2 \times \text{First house} = 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \]

3. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250, so we can write the equation:
\[ \text{First house} + \text{Second house} + \text{Third house} = 250 \]
Substituting the expressions we found for the first and third houses into this equation gives us:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

4. Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x \]

5. To find the value of $x$, we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2}{5}$ to isolate $x$, we get:
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

6. Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find out how many the third house needs by doubling the amount for the first house:
\[ \text{Third house} = 2 \times \text{First house} = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

1. Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour.
2. Ezra read 300 books this hour.
3. Ezra decided to read 150 more books.

First, we need to find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we divide the number of books Ezra read by 2:

Ahmed's books = Ezra's books / 2
Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now, we know that Ezra plans to read 150 more books after the initial 300, so we add those to his total:

Ezra's total books = Ezra's books + Additional books
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

Finally, we add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read to find the total number of books they read altogether:

Total books = Ezra's total books + Ahmed's books

Now, we know that she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. So, let's calculate that:

Video game time = 1/3 * Remaining time
Video game time = 1/3 * 9 hours
Video game time = 3 hours

3. **Hiking Time**: It took them 1.5 hours to hike.

4. **Distance Hiked**: To find the distance they hiked, we multiply their hiking speed by the time they spent hiking. Distance = Speed × Time, so the distance hiked is 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish as O. We know that O + W = 17 (since he bought 17 fish in total).

We also know that after adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So, the equation for the total number of orange fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + O = 2 * (4 (initial white fish) + W).

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) O + W = 17
2) 3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)

Let's solve the second equation for O:

3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)
3 + O = 8 + 2W
O - 2W = 5

Now we have a new equation:

3) O - 2W = 5

We can use equations 1 and 3 to solve for W:

From equation 1: O = 17 - W

Substitute O in equation 3:

17 - W - 2W = 5
17 - 3W = 5
3W = 17 - 5

   The jeans are advertised at 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of the original price of $40.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 10

2. Find the sale price:
   Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price.
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30

1. **Initial workforce payment:**
   The company starts with 200 employees, and each is paid $4000 per month. So, the initial monthly payment is:
   \[
   200 \text{ employees} \times \$4000/\text{employee} = \$800,000

2. **New employees hired each month:**
   The company hires 20 new employees every month. Each new employee is also paid $4000 per month. So, the monthly payment for new employees is:
   \[
   20 \text{ employees} \times \$4000/\text{employee} = \$80,000
   \]

3. **Total monthly payment after three months:**
   After three months, the total monthly payment includes the initial workforce and the new employees hired over the three months. The number of new employees hired over three months is:
   \[
   20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees}

1. The amount of citrus zest (Z) is equal to the amount of fragrance.
2. The amount of salt (S) is equal to the amount of sugar.
3. The amount of oil (O) is twice the amount of salt (S), so O = 2S.
4. The amount of salt (S) is twice the amount of zest (Z), so S = 2Z.

Since Tanya makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar, we can write the total amount of ingredients as:

The total number of cards is given as 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

2. Distance-based charge:
The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the distance-based charge is:

Now, we convert these fractions to have a common denominator to make it easier to add them together. The common denominator for 6, 3, and 2 is 6. So we convert the fractions:

- \(\frac{5}{6}\) remains the same.
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{6}\) (since \(\frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{6}\)).

1. Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade.
2. Julie sold 14 glasses.
3. The boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses.

First, we need to find out how many glasses the boys sold together. Since the total number of glasses sold is 32 and Julie sold 14, we subtract Julie's sales from the total:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie) = 18 glasses (boys)

Now, since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' total by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys) / 2 = 9 glasses each (Micah and Mitchell)

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 glasses (Julie) - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

Cost of rope = Length of rope × Price per meter
Cost of rope = 20 meters × $2/meter

Next, we'll determine Sarah's profit from selling the rope:

Profit = Selling price - Cost of rope
Since Sarah's friend is willing to buy the rope for $2 a meter, the selling price would be:
Selling price = Length of rope × Price per meter
Selling price = 20 meters × $2/meter

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can write this as an equation:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

Now we can substitute D with 60:

60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 60 / 2
A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we simply add 8 to his current age:

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 acres to that.

Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Twice Farmer Brown's farm: $2 \times 200 = 400$ acres
Adding 100 acres to twice Farmer Brown's farm: $400 + 100 = 500$ acres

Now that we know Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres, we can find the total number of acres for both farms by adding Farmer Brown's farm to Farmer Smith's farm.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and there were 20 red balloons. So, the total pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40 pieces.

He threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. So, the total pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * Y.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

2 * 20 (for red balloons) + 3 * Y (for yellow balloons) = 58

Now, let's solve for Y:

40 + 3Y = 58

- There are 30 students.

Total revenue = Number of lollipops sold per student × Price per lollipop × Number of students
Total revenue = 10 lollipops/student × $0.8/lollipop × 30 students

1. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total.
2. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has 27 / 3 = 9 cups.
3. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that half of the cups in each row are mint tea. So, each row has 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea.

However, since Lana can't have half a cup of tea, we need to re-evaluate our approach. The problem states that she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups, which implies that the number of cups must be divisible by 2. Since 27 is not divisible by 2, we need to find the largest even number of cups that can be divided into 3 equal rows.

The largest even number less than 27 that is divisible by 3 is 24. So, Lana actually has 24 cups of tea, not 27. This means each row has 24 / 3 = 8 cups. With equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, each row has 8 / 2 = 4 cups of mint tea.

Cost of pencils = Number of pencils × Cost per pencil
Cost of pencils = 5 × $10
Cost of pencils = $50

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money gives us the amount he has left for pens:

Money for pens = Remaining money - Cost of pencils
Money for pens = $150 - $50
Money for pens = $100

Finally, we'll divide the money he has left by the cost of each pen to find out how many pens he can buy:

Number of pens = Money for pens / Cost per pen
Number of pens = $100 / $25
Number of pens = 4

2. On the day in question, she started sleepwalking at 2:15 a.m. and stopped at 2:38 a.m. The duration of her sleepwalking is 23 minutes (from 2:15 to 2:38).

3. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, which means she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she was awake for 5 minutes before her usual wake-up time.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of beds occupied by new patients over the 2-week period. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

Since each patient occupies one bed, the total number of beds occupied by new patients is also 700.

Now, let's calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks. We subtract the number of beds occupied by new patients from the initial number of unoccupied beds.

Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = Initial unoccupied beds - Beds occupied by new patients

First, we need to find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we subtract 10 from Robert's amount to find Richard's amount:

Robert's cherries - 10 = Richard's cherries
30 - 10 = 20 cherries

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know the total number of cherries (60) and the number of cherries Richard and Robert have (20 and 30 respectively). To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

Total cherries - (Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries) = Jerry's cherries
60 - (20 + 30) = Jerry's cherries
60 - 50 = 10 cherries

Jerry has 10 cherries.

3. On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, which is 10 * $6 = $60.
- On Saturday, he sold x - 4 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, which is (x - 4) * $15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, which is 15 * $6 = $90.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, which is 15 * $15 = $225.

Now, let's add up the earnings for both days:

Total earnings = (Saturday gingerbread + Saturday apple pie) + (Sunday gingerbread + Sunday apple pie)
Total earnings = ($60 + (x - 4) * $15) + ($90 + $225)

Since we know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, we can find the value of x:

x - 4 = 15
x = 15 + 4
x = 19

Now we can calculate the total earnings:

Since the flower bed is 111 feet long and each plant grows 12 inches wide, we need to convert the width of the plants to feet to match the units. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each plant is 12/12 = 1 foot wide.

   Now, we divide the length of the flower bed by the width of one plant to find out how many plants can fit in a row:
   111 feet / 1 foot per plant = 111 plants

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine how many times Comet Halley has orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it for the first time. Since the comet orbits every 75 years, we divide the time since Bill's dad saw it by the orbital period:

Time since Bill's dad saw the comet = 75 years * (number of orbits)
Let's assume Bill saw the comet for the first time after 'n' orbits. So, the time since Bill's dad saw the comet is 75n years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits every 75 years, the time between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet is also 75 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:

75n - 75 = 90 - 30

Solving for 'n':

75n - 75 = 60
75n = 135
n = 135 / 75
n = 1.8

Since 'n' must be a whole number (as you can't have a fraction of an orbit), we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1. This means that one full orbit has passed since Bill's dad saw the comet until Bill saw it for the first time.

Now, we know that Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and one orbit has passed since his first sighting. So, the time between Bill's first and second sightings is 75 years. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. First, we know the total age of the four children is 20 years. We can represent this as an equation:
   \[
   \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20
   \]

2. We are given Akbar's age (3 years) and Alessandro's age (4 years), so we can substitute these values into the equation:
   \[
   3 + 4 + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20
   \]

3. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   7 + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20
   \]

4. We are also told that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group can be calculated by dividing the total age by the number of children:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

5. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, her age is:
   \[
   \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. Now, we can substitute Helene's age back into the equation to find Wilfred's age:
   \[
   7 + 10 + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20
   \]
   \[
   17 + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20

2. He collects $1500 from an online fund.
3. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
4. Walter's friend gives him $200.

First, we need to find out how much everyone else has donated in total before Walter's friend gives him $200. This includes the money from neighbors and the online fund:

Total donated by others = $500 (neighbors) + $1500 (online fund) = $2000

Now, Walter's friend gives him an additional $200, so the total amount donated by others including Walter's friend is:

Total donated by others including friend = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated, so:

1. **Total Slices**: The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, making a total of 6 people. Therefore, the watermelon will be divided into 6 slices.

2. **Slice Size Ratio**: Each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice. This means the ratio of the size of an adult's slice to a kid's slice is 2:1.

3. **Total Slice Size**: Since the total number of slices is 6 and the ratio of adult to kid slices is 2:1, we can divide the total slices into 2 parts for the adults and 4 parts for the kids. This gives us a total of 6 parts (2 for adults + 4 for kids).

4. **Adult's Share**: Each adult gets 2 parts of the total 6 parts. Therefore, each adult gets $\frac{2}{6}$ of the watermelon.

5. **Percentage Calculation**: To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we multiply the fraction by 100%. So, each adult gets $\frac{2}{6} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{3} \times 100\% = 33\frac{1}{3}\%$ of the watermelon.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes. So, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ \text{Time on appointments} = 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's convert the minutes spent on rounds and appointments into hours, since the total time at the clinic is given in hours:

\[ \text{Time on rounds in hours} = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50
Number of female porcupines = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born in a month is:

Total babies per month = Number of female porcupines * Babies per female
Total babies per month = 30 * 4
Total babies per month = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Total babies per year = Total babies per month * Months per year
Total babies per year = 120 * 12
Total babies per year = 1440

Volume = 14 feet × 25 feet × 4 feet
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons because the cost is given in gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48052 gallons. So, the volume in gallons is:

Volume in gallons = Volume in cubic feet × Conversion factor

According to the problem, Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \( S = 2L \)
2. The total earnings from the sales were $120: \( 4S + 12L = 120 \)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( L \):

\( 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \)
\( 8L + 12L = 120 \)
\( 20L = 120 \)
\( L = 6 \)

Now that we know Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals, we can find out how many small stuffed animals she sold by using the first equation:

1. **Base mining rate with bare hands**: One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.

2. **Mining rate with an iron pickaxe**: With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands. So, the mining rate with an iron pickaxe is:
   12 pounds/day * 2 = 24 pounds/day

3. **Mining rate with a steel pickaxe**: With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the additional amount is:

2. For the package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich should be the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches:

   - So, she was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

2. **Yellow balloons**: Sally accidentally released half of the 12 yellow balloons.
   - Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6 balloons.
   - So, she was left with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

1. The probability that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework is 50% or 0.5.
2. The probability that the normal teacher will give everyone an extension is 40% or 0.4.
3. The probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension is 20% or 0.2.

However, these events are not mutually exclusive, meaning they can overlap. For example, even if Marcus has a substitute teacher, he could still try to convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment. Therefore, we cannot simply add these probabilities together.

Instead, we need to calculate the probability that at least one of these events will occur, which is the complement of the probability that none of these events will occur.

The probability that none of these events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities, assuming they are independent events:

P(None of these events) = P(No substitute) * P(No extension from normal teacher) * P(No personal extension)
= (1 - 0.5) * (1 - 0.4) * (1 - 0.2)

1048,"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3-year period from 2007 to 2010. Since the depreciation rate is constant at 21% per year, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

where:
- \( P(t) \) is the price of the car at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = $20000 \),
- \( r = 21\% = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years (from 2007 to 2010).

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[ P(3) = $20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = $20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = $20000 \times 0.4930392156862745 \]
\[ P(3) = $9860.78431372549 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9861.

Number of big coupons = 2 * Number of small coupons
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700
Number of big coupons = 1400

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

Cost for small coupons = Number of small coupons * Cost per small coupon
Cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents
Cost for small coupons = 3500 cents

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}\]

Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total. She already has 120, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

Total bananas = 40

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny had bought the bananas individually at $0.80 each:

The total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths that Sam and Harry get, which can be expressed as:

Simplifying this equation, we combine like terms:
\[2x + 60 = 100\]

Subtracting 60 from both sides to isolate the terms with $x$ gives us:
\[2x = 100 - 60\]
\[2x = 40\]

Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for $x$:
\[x = \frac{40}{2}\]
\[x = 20\]

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the length of the fence Sam gets from the total length of the fence:

Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate per year = 2 inches per year

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches each year, we can calculate how much it will grow in 13 years by multiplying the annual growth rate by the number of years:

1. **Regular School Hours:**
   - John has 6 periods a day, each 40 minutes long.
   - So, in one day, he spends 6 * 40 = 240 minutes in class.
   - Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes a week in regular classes.

2. **Extra Classes:**
   - John has 2 extra classes each day.
   - Each extra class is also 40 minutes long.
   - So, he spends an additional 2 * 40 = 80 minutes a day on extra classes.
   - Over 5 days, this adds up to 80 * 5 = 400 minutes a week on extra classes.

3. **Extra Learning Time on Weekends:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Since we don't know his total weekly minutes yet, let's call it 'T'.
   - So, he spends (1/16)T on Saturday and (1/16)T on Sunday, which totals (1/16)T + (1/16)T = (1/8)T.

4. **Total Weekly Learning Time:**
   - To find the total weekly learning time, we add the regular classes, extra classes, and extra learning time.
   - Total = Regular classes + Extra classes + Extra learning time
   - Total = 1200 minutes + 400 minutes + (1/8)T

5. **Solving for T:**
   - We know that the total weekly learning time (T) includes the regular classes and extra classes.

Since the velociraptors and the Allosaurus each ate a quarter of the original amount of meat, and their combined consumption is half of the original amount (because 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2), we can deduce that the original amount of meat was twice what the Allosaurus ate.

1105,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Lauren needs to save for her retirement and then determine how many years it will take her to save that amount at her current savings rate.

First, let's find out how much Lauren plans to live on during her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000.

Retirement living expenses = 40% of $100,000
                           = 0.40 * $100,000
                           = $40,000 per year

Now, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for her 20-year retirement period.

Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement living expenses * Number of retirement years
                                = $40,000 * 20
                                = $800,000

Lauren is currently saving 20% of her paycheck, which is $100,000.

Amount saved per year = 20% of $100,000
                      = 0.20 * $100,000
                      = $20,000

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take Lauren to save $800,000 at the rate of $20,000 per year.

Number of years needed = Total retirement savings needed / Amount saved per year
                       = $800,000 / $20,000

   Length of each part = Total length / Number of parts
   Length of each part = 100 cm / 4
   Length of each part = 25 cm

2. Now, we have 4 parts, each 25 cm long. Next, we divide each of these parts into 5 equal parts:
   Number of final cuts per part = 5

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
2. She walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
3. She spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

First, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can calculate the time for 1 mile as follows:

Time for 1 mile on the beach = Total beach time / Distance on the beach
= 40 minutes / 2 miles
= 20 minutes/mile

Now, we know she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, so the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is half the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach:

Time for 1 mile on the sidewalk = Time for 1 mile on the beach / 2
= 20 minutes / 2
= 10 minutes/mile

Now we can calculate the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
= (Time for 1 mile on the beach * Distance on the beach) + (Time for 1 mile on the sidewalk * Distance on the sidewalk)
= (20 minutes/mile * 2 miles) + (10 minutes/mile * 1 mile)

Amount saved = $4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, let's find out how much more she needs to reach her goal of $60:

Amount needed = Total goal - Amount already saved
              = $60 - $32
              = $28

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks she needs to save to reach her goal:

Additional weeks needed = Amount needed / Savings per week
                         = $28 / $4/week

To find the number of marbles Bob currently has, we solve for $x$:

\[x = 60 - 24\]
\[x = 36\]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

According to the second statement, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from his current number of marbles:

Total cost without discount = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the discount Russell receives:

Discount = 10% of total cost without discount
Discount = 0.10 * $40.00
Discount = $4.00

Next, we'll subtract the discount from the total cost without discount to find the total cost with the discount:

Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount
Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00

M / W = 5 / 9

We also know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, so:

M + W = 84

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we can express M in terms of W:

M = (5/9) * W

Substitute this expression for M into the second equation:

(5/9) * W + W = 84

To solve for W, we first find a common denominator for the terms on the left side of the equation:

(5W + 9W) / 9 = 84

Combine the terms:

14W / 9 = 84

Multiply both sides by 9 to get rid of the denominator:

2. Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets of sunflowers at $8 each. To find out how many bouquets he sells in a day, we divide the total earnings from bouquets by the price per bouquet:
   Bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets

3. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so to find out how many sunflowers are sold in bouquets per day, we multiply the number of bouquets sold by the number of sunflowers per bouquet:

   - Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
   - So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is $200 + 200 = 400$ apartments.

2. **Determine the size of the third complex:**
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined.
   - To find 60% of 400, we calculate $0.60 \times 400 = 240$ apartments.
   - Therefore, the third complex has $400 + 240 = 640$ apartments.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as \(F_{10}\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(F_{10} - 200\) fruits.
5. During the ninth year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so we can set up the following equation:

\[F_{10} - 200 = 350\]

Solving for \(F_{10}\), we get:

\[F_{10} = 350 + 200\]
\[F_{10} = 550\]

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 550 fruits. Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced during the 10 years:

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as \( R \), \( W \), and \( P \) respectively. Since the amounts are equal, we can say that \( R = W = P \).

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints. This total is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. Since half the mural is yellow, the yellow paint is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

Now, we can express the total amount of paint as the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
\[ R + W + P + \text{yellow} = 12 \]

Substituting the known values and the fact that \( R = W = P \), we get:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find the amount of red paint, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = \frac{6}{3} \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk piece. To find out how much chalk that is, we calculate:
45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. This means he has:
5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day for the rest of the week. To find out how much chalk that is, we calculate:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.

2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. After using these, they would have had 12 - 28 = -16 bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, we know they must have had more than 12 bandages left from the first day. Let's call the number of bandages they started with on the first day ""B"". So, after the second day, they had B - 38 bandages left.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. After using these, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the new packs. Adding this to the bandages they had left from the second day, they had (B - 38) + 75 bandages.

4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, we can set up the equation: (B - 38) + 75 = 78.

5. Solving for B, we get B - 38 + 75 = 78, which simplifies to B + 37 = 78, and finally B = 78 - 37, which means B = 41.

1. After the first stop:
The bus started with 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus.
So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop = 20 (initial) + 40 (entered) = 60 people.

2. After the second stop:
At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus.
So, the number of people who entered at the second stop = 3/4 * 40 = 30 people.
Now, the total number of people on the bus = 60 (after the first stop) + 30 (entered at the second stop) = 90 people.

3. After the third stop:
The number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station.

2. **Annual Visits**: Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

3. **Cost for the First 5 Years**: For the first 5 years, she visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the annual cost is 3 visits * $2/visit = $6. Over 5 years, she spends 5 years * $6/year = $30.

4. **Increase in Cost per Visit**: After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost is the initial cost plus 150% of the initial cost. So, the increase is 1.5 * $2 = $3. Therefore, the new cost per visit is $2 + $3 = $5.

5. **Cost for the Next 3 Years**: For the next 3 years, she visits the museum 3 times a year at the new cost. So, the annual cost is 3 visits * $5/visit = $15. Over 3 years, she spends 3 years * $15/year = $45.

\[ \text{Total students} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students. Since 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Students per group}} = \frac{40}{8} = 5 \]

Now, we know there will be 5 groups trying the escape room. Each group gets 45 minutes, so the total time needed is:

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:
S + B = 116

Now we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:
S + (5S - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:
6S - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:
6S = 120

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 20

Now that we know Mary made 20 strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting S back into the first equation:
B = 5(20) - 4
B = 100 - 4
B = 96

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes. ### 96",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, there are 4 flashlights in total.

2. There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights. So, there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms. However, since each person also has a flashlight, we've already accounted for 4 of these. So, the rooms have an additional 16 - 4 = 12 flashlights.

3. For candles, half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. So, for the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. For the 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the candles and flashlights:

- Small candles: 16

1. Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. So, the total number of holes dug is:
   6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

2. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:
   9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day (net filled)

3. To find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:
   84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

4. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks it takes:
   28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

1304,"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000 students

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in average enrollment = 1000 students

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. ###1000",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}

2. He was supposed to gather 14 Petri dishes, but he gathered two more than that, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
3. He gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
4. The total number of items he placed on the lab bench is 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items he should have placed on the lab bench if he hadn't lost any beakers:

\( 8 \text{ test tubes} + 16 \text{ Petri dishes} + 7 \text{ beakers} = 31 \text{ items} \)

Since the total number of items he actually placed on the lab bench is 29, we can find out how many beakers he lost by subtracting the actual total from the expected total:

First, let's calculate the profit amount:
Profit = Total cost × Profit percentage
Profit = $80 × 25%
Profit = $80 × 0.25
Profit = $20

Now, let's add the profit to the total cost to find the total selling price:
Total selling price = Total cost + Profit
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Finally, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

1. John had a son James when he was 19. So, James is currently 19 + (current age of James) years old.
2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
3. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, John's youngest son is currently 32 - (current age of John) years old.
5. To find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years, we need to know John's current age. However, we don't have that information directly. But we can find it out by knowing James's current age and the age difference between John and James.
6. James is currently 18 years old, and he was born when John was 19. So, the age difference between John and James is 19 - 18 = 1 year.
7. Therefore, John is currently 18 + 1 = 19 years old.
8. John's youngest son is currently 32 - 19 = 13 years old.

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   C + K = 20

2. The total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write:
   2C + 4K = 70

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations. First, let's isolate K from the first equation:
   K = 20 - C

Next, substitute this expression for K into the second equation:
