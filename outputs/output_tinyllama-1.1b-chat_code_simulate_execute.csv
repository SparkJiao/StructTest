4. Initialize `curr_score` to `max_score`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 12`.
5. Iterate over the range of `k`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Update `curr_score` by subtracting the first element of `init_hand` and adding the first element of `cardPoints`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 12 - 5 + 1 = 8`.
    - Check if `curr_score` is greater than `max_score`. Since `8` is not greater than `12`, we don't update `max_score`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Update `curr_score` by subtracting the second element of `init_hand` and adding the second element of `cardPoints`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 8 - 6 + 2 =",0,{}

2. Iterate over the range of `n`:

Let's think step by step.

2. Initialize `init_hand` to the last `k` elements of `card_points`. As a result, we have `init_hand = [5,6,1]`.
3. Initialize `max_score` to the sum of `init_hand`. As a result, we have `max_score = 12`.
4. Initialize `curr_score` to `max_score`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 12`.
5. Iterate over the range of `k`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Update `curr_score` by subtracting the first element of `init_hand` and adding the first element of `card_points`. As a result, we have `curr_score = 12 - 5 + 1 = 8`.
    - Check if `curr_score` is greater than `max_score`. Since `8` is not greater than `12`, we don't update `max_score`.

    - Update the value of `result` by subtracting the value of `dict[key]` from `190`. As a result, we have `result['Alden Cantrell'] = 180`.
    - Check if `result['Alden Cantrell']` is greater than `190`. Since `180` is not greater than `190`, we don't update `result`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `key = 'Kierra Gentry'`.
    - Update the value of `result` by subtracting the value of `dict[key]` from `190`. As a result, we have `result['Kierra Gentry'] = 165`.

Explanation:

1. Initialize `result` to an empty dictionary.
2. Iterate over the list `l1` and the list `l2`.
3. For each pair `(x, y)` in the list `l1`, we create a dictionary `{x: {y: z}}`.
4. For each pair `(x, y)` in the list `l2`, we create a dictionary `{y: z}` with the corresponding value `z`.
5. For each pair `(x, y)` in the list `l3`, we create a dictionary `{x: y}` with the corresponding value `y`.
6. For each pair `(x, y)` in the list `l3`, we update the value of the corresponding dictionary in `result` by adding the corresponding value to the corresponding key.
7. Return `result`.

```python
def Find_Max(lst):
    maxList = max((x) for x in lst)
    return maxList
```

The `Find_Max` function takes a list as input and returns the maximum element in the list.

The `maxList` variable is initialized to the first element of the list.

The `maxList` variable is iterated over using a comprehension expression.

For each iteration, the `maxList` variable is updated by subtracting the first element of the list and adding the second element of the list.

The `maxList` variable is then returned.

The `Find_Max` function returns the maximum element in the list.

The final result is the maximum element in the list.

So the final result is:

```
12
```

The output is the maximum element in the list, which is 12.",0,{}
