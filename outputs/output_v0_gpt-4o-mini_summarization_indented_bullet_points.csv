* The discovery of over 200 extrasolar planets has revealed a wide range of orbital eccentricities.
	* 15 of these planets exhibit high eccentricities, leading to various theories about their origins.

	• • RCRA aims to minimize threats to human health and the environment from hazardous waste.
	• • It regulates hazardous waste from generation to disposal, including remediation waste.

• RCRA identifies hazardous waste based on source or characteristics.
	• • The EPA has established criteria for classifying waste as hazardous.
	• • Regulations apply to both current and historical waste management.

• Cleanup managers cite RCRA requirements as barriers to effective remediation.
	• • Key requirements include land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and permit requirements.
	• • These requirements can increase costs and discourage cleanups.

• Land disposal restrictions require stringent treatment standards for hazardous waste.
	• • Compliance can be costly, especially for large volumes of lightly contaminated waste.
	• • Exempting low-risk contaminated media could significantly reduce cleanup costs.

• Minimum technological requirements for waste facilities may be overly stringent for remediation waste.
	• • Facilities must meet expensive design and operating specifications.
	• • These requirements can lead to unnecessary costs for temporary waste management.

• The permitting process under RCRA can cause delays and increase costs.
	• • Obtaining a permit can take months or years and cost up to $1 million.
	• • Cleanup parties may avoid triggering permit requirements, leading to less effective remediation.

• Stakeholders have proposed legislative reforms to address RCRA's disincentives for cleanups.
	• • Proposals include exempting certain remediation waste from RCRA requirements.
	• • EPA has acknowledged the need for comprehensive reform through legislation.

* DOD establishes a standard price for fuel annually.
	* The price is set by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) in coordination with DLA.
	* It aims to approximate actual fuel costs during budget execution, which occurs nearly a year later.
  
* The standard price consists of three components: crude oil price, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs.
	* Crude oil prices are based on forecasts from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
	* Refinement markup accounts for the cost of refining crude oil into usable products.

* The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund is used to purchase bulk fuel for military services.
	* This fund operates on a businesslike buyer-and-seller approach to manage recurring DOD requirements.
	* The standard price remains unchanged until the next budget year to mitigate market price volatility.

* DOD has faced significant discrepancies between estimated and actual fuel costs from 2009 to 2013.
	* Fluctuations in fuel prices and differences in estimated versus actual consumption contributed to these discrepancies.
	* DOD underestimated fuel costs by approximately $3 billion in several fiscal years.

* Adjustments to the standard price are made to manage cash balance fluctuations in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund.
	* DOD may increase the standard price to recover losses or decrease it to reimburse services.
	* Transfers of funds into or out of the fund have been used to address cash shortfalls.

* DOD has not reevaluated its approach to setting the standard price since 2007.
	* The current methodology does not reflect recent market conditions or document the rationale for assumptions.

• The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) has a broader tax base than the regular tax system.  
    • Individuals must add back various deductions and exemptions to calculate AMT.  
    • The AMT tax rates are 26% on the first $175,000 and 28% on the remainder after exemptions.  

• The number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has significantly increased over the years.  
    • In 1987, only 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but projections for 2009 estimate over 9 million taxpayers will be affected.  
    • The lack of inflation indexing for AMT exemptions has contributed to this growth.  

• The AMT disproportionately affects higher-income individuals and is gradually reaching middle-income taxpayers.  
    • In 1998, nearly half of AMT taxpayers had incomes over $200,000, while by 2008, less than 15% fell into this category.  
    • The share of AMT taxpayers in the $75,000 to $100,000 income bracket increased from 1% to 20%.  

• Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities without altering the AMT can increase the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT.  
    • Married couples are particularly affected due to higher incomes and more dependents, increasing their likelihood of being under the AMT.  
    • The interaction between tax cuts and the AMT can lead to significant revenue losses for the government.

• Congressional interest in import barriers for milk protein concentrates (MPCs) has increased due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes.
    • Advocates argue that stricter controls would support domestic protein use and raise milk prices.
    • Opponents claim that such measures would increase costs and retail food prices.
    • Major foreign suppliers may seek compensation under WTO rules if new restrictions are imposed.
    • U.S. imports of MPCs have been relatively stable since a peak in 2000, with significant drops in 2009.

• MPCs are derived from raw milk and have various applications in food and industrial products.
    • They contain both casein and whey protein, with different protein levels used for specific products.
    • The U.S. produces little casein or MPCs, with federal policies favoring nonfat dry milk production.
    • Imports of dairy products, including MPCs, were valued at over $3 billion in 2008.
    • The U.S. dairy program supports prices and provides subsidies to farmers when prices fall.

• Proposed legislation (S. 1542 and H.R. 3674) aims to limit MPC imports through tariff-rate quotas (TRQs).
    • The legislation would introduce higher duties on imports exceeding specified quotas.
    • More than half of the annual trade in MPCs and casein/caseinates would be affected by these duties.
    • Enactment would likely lead to compensation negotiations with major suppliers under WTO rules.
    • The potential compensation could be estimated at around $500 million.

• The impact of TRQs on farm prices depends on the relationship between dairy product prices and government support levels.
    • If prices are low, additional imports primarily affect government purchases rather than farm prices.
    • Conversely, if prices are high, the impact shifts to the market, potentially lowering farm prices.
    • Proposed TRQ levels could equate to about 0.7% of average U.S. milk production.
    • Some view TRQs as part of broader policies to improve the financial situation for U.S. dairy farmers.
