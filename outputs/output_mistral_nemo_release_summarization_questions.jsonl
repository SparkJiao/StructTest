The authors determine the shower parton distributions by solving integral equations that relate them to the known fragmentation functions.

The act requires state and local governments that receive at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance in a fiscal year to have a single audit conducted for that year. The single audit is an organization-wide financial statement audit that includes the audit of the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and focuses on internal control and the recipient's compliance with laws and regulations governing the federal financial assistance received. The act also requires grantees to address material noncompliance and internal control weaknesses in a corrective action plan. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the act and established uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients. The act is important because it provides a key accountability mechanism over billions of dollars each year in federal funds provided to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations. However, the quality of single audits conducted under this legislation has been a longstanding area of concern since the passage of the act. The PCIE report, released in 2006, estimated that approximately 49 percent of the universe of single audits fell into the acceptable group, while the remaining 51 percent had deficiencies that were severe enough to cause the audits to be classified as having limited reliability or being unacceptable. The report recommended a three-pronged approach to reduce the types of deficiencies noted and improve the quality of single audits: revise and improve single audit standards, criteria, and guidance; establish minimum continuing professional education (CPE) as a prerequisite for auditors to be eligible to conduct and continue to perform single audits; and review and enhance the disciplinary processes to address unacceptable audits and for not meeting training and CPE requirements. The PCIE report also recommended that OMB, with federal cognizant and oversight agencies, should review the process of suspension and debarment to identify whether (and if so, how) it can be more efficiently and effectively applied to address unacceptable audits, and based on that review, pursue appropriate changes to the process. The report further recommended that OMB, with federal cognizant agencies, should also identify, review, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of other ways (both existing and new) to address unacceptable audits, including revising Circular No. A-133 to include sanctions to be applied to auditors for unacceptable work or for not meeting", "format_properties": {}}

This support is designed to help farmers manage the cyclical nature of commodity prices and production. The main features of this support include target prices and deficiency payments, similar to those used before the 1996 farm bill, but with some modifications. These payments are not linked to current production or prices, but rather to historical production and target prices. The new law also maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments, with changes in most loan rates. The counter-cyclical payments are expected to cost around $23.6 billion over 6 years, with additional costs for peanut and dairy support. However, the actual costs may vary depending on future market conditions. The new counter-cyclical aid focuses on major commodities, raising questions of equity among commodities and potential production distortions. Some groups argue that such aid should be based on economic need rather than past or current production.

{"idx": 737, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nThe main point of the text is that a body of studies spanning over three decades has elucidated the involvement of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in a wide array of critical physiological functions, including blood pressure regulation, nociception, adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory activity, organ regeneration, insulin potentiation, podocyte integrity, and cellular responses to bacterial infection. The most prominent regioisomer, 14,15-EET, along with other members of this autacoid family, arise via metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, especially members of the 2c and 2j families. The ratio of EET isomers and their stereocomposition are CYP P450 isoform-dependent and, thus, species- and tissue-specific. Numerous chemical and metabolic factors conspire to complicate investigations into the roles of 14,15-EET and restrain its potential therapeutic utility. Its susceptibility toward aerial oxidation or auto-oxidation, i.e., a nonenzymatic, free radical process involving the 1,4-dienyl substructures characteristic of polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessitates handling and/or storage under strict conditions that minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals. A precis of inactivating enzymatic processes includes esterification, metabolism by other pathways of the arachidonate cascade, conjugation, -oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide. In biological milieu, hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) is a major determinant in maintaining the steady state levels of 14,15-EET, whose half-life has been estimated at no more than seconds to minutes. The pioneering studies of Hammock and others confirmed inhibition of SEH can elevate EET levels both in vitro and in vivo, thus offering an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes. However, this strategy might prove less efficacious than an agonist replacement therapy whenever endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised, for instance, as a consequence of disease, inflammation, radiotherapy, aging, and/or exposure to xenobiotics and drugs that inhibit cytochromes P450. To address some of the stability limitations of natural EETs, the laboratories previously prepared several iterations of EET surrogates with improved stability. Advanced versions were evaluated for relaxation of precontracted bovine coronary artery rings and for in vitro inhibition of recombinant human SEH.

{"idx": 769, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nThe central nervous system (CNS) was previously considered an immune-privileged site, but recent findings suggest it is more constitutively active than previously thought. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, play a pivotal role in innate immunity and are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. They are involved in immune surveillance, phagocytosis, synaptic refinement, and angiogenesis. The glymphatic system facilitates immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid. Microglia are maintained through cellular division or expansion of progenitors and form an autonomous population within the brain. They are multifunctional and protect the postnatal brain from infection by acting as a front-line defense system. However, excessive inflammatory response may result in bystander tissue damage. Microglia also play a role in synaptic pruning, which is dependent on regional neuronal activity and involves the expression of CR3 and the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a phenomenon that can be elicited by various stimuli and is characterized by a wave of rapid, near-complete depolarization of neurons and astrocytes followed by electrical suppression. CSD can initiate inflammatory activation of microglia, which can in turn lower the threshold for CSD induction, forming a positive feedback mechanism. However, TNF and IL-1 can also reduce CSD amplitudes in a dose-dependent manner. Microglial depletion leads to a perturbation of neuronal calcium response and resistance to CSD induction. CSD contributes to the expansion of infarct volume by several mechanisms, including a limited supply of ATP due to ischemia. Igf-1 treatment and environmental enrichment can ameliorate secondary brain damage resulting from cerebral ischemia by promoting M2-polarization of microglia. Multiple CSD inductions are likely to activate microglia, leading to morphological changes and the release of HMGB1 from neurons. HMGB1 acts on TLR2/4 on the surface of microglia, followed by microglial activation. Activated microglia may contribute to neuroprotection through synaptic repair on the dendritic spines of multiple CSD-affected cortical neurons.
