- The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
- The first stop was at 20 miles.
- The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162 years.
- We need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

<step-2. Set up the equation>
- Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a variable.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162 years, so we can write the equation:
  7x + 11x = 162

**Step 3** Calculate the amount of water lost in 4 minutes
- Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons/minute
- In 4 minutes, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons
- In 4 minutes, the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons

**Step 4** Calculate the current amount of water in the small pool

* Therefore, the amount of protein in 100 grams of mushrooms is 3 grams.

<step-2. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms>
* John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
* To calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms, we can use the following proportion:
* 100 grams of mushrooms = 3 grams of protein
* 200 grams of mushrooms = x grams of protein
* Solving for x, we get: x = (200 * 3) / 100 = 6 grams of protein.

<step-3. Calculate the amount of protein John gets per week>
* John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
* There are 7 days in a week.

- The growth rate of the bamboo is given in inches per day, but the current height is given in feet.
- We need to convert the current height of 20 feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 20 feet = 20 × 12 = 240 inches

**Step 2** Calculation of the remaining height to reach 600 inches
- The remaining height to reach 600 inches is 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

**Step 3** Calculation of the number of days required
- The bamboo grows 30 inches per day.
- To find the number of days required to reach 600 inches, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate.

- There is one set of twins and one set of triplets.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of all the children are 44.

### 2. Let's define the variables
- Let's call the ages of the twins as `x` and `x + 7`, where `x` is the age of one of the twins.
- Let's call the ages of the triplets as `y`, `y + 7`, and `y + 14`, where `y` is the age of one of the triplets.

### 3. Set up the equation
- The combined ages of all the children are 44, so we can write the equation:
  `x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 7) + (y + 14) = 44`

### 4. Simplify the equation
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
  `2x + 3y + 28 = 44`

### 5. Solve for `y`
- Subtracting 28 from both sides, we get:
  `2x + 3y = 16`
- Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
  `2x/3 + y = 16/3`
- Subtracting 2x/3 from both sides, we get:
  `y = 16/3 - 2x/3`

### 6. Substitute `y` in the original equation
- Substituting `y = 16/3 - 2x/3` in the original equation, we get:
  `x + (x + 7) + (16/3 - 2x/3) + (16/3 - 2x/3 + 7) + (16/3 - 2x/3 + 14) = 44`

### 7. Simplify the equation and solve for `x`
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
  `2x + 48 = 44`
- Subtracting 48 from both sides, we get:
  `2x = -4`
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
  `x = -2`

### 8. Interpret the result
- Since the age of a person cannot be negative, we can conclude that the problem statement is not valid or there is an error in the given information.

- Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar.
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

<step-2. Represent the amounts of each ingredient using variables>
Let's represent the amounts of each ingredient as follows:
- Zest = x
- Fragrance = x
- Salt = y
- Sugar = y
- Oil = 2y

<step-3. Set up equations based on the given information>
1. The total volume of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write:
   x + x + y + y + 2y = 10
2. The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, so we can write:
   y = y
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so we can write:
   y = 2x

<step-4. Solve the equations to find the amount of oil>
1. Substituting y = 2x into the first equation, we get:
   x + x + 2x + 2x + 2(2x) = 10
   6x + 4x = 10
   10x = 10
   x = 1
2. Substituting x = 1 into the second equation, we get:
   y = 2x
   y = 2(1)
   y = 2
3. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so:
   Oil = 2y
   Oil = 2(2)
   Oil = 4

- Let's call the number of cards PJ has as `x`.
- Then, the number of cards Smendrick has is `3x`.
- And the number of cards Becca has is `3x + 12`.

### 3. Set up an equation to find the total number of cards:

- Kelly said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%.
- We need to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

<step-2. Calculate the actual number of people>
- If Courtney's number was overstated by 20%, then the actual number is 80% of 48.
- 80% of 48 = 0.8 × 48 = 38.4

- Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 easter eggs
- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah

**Step 2** Let's represent the number of eggs painted by each person as follows:
- Arnold painted x eggs
- Madeline painted x eggs
- Camden painted y eggs
- Sarah painted (y - 12) eggs

**Step 3** We know that the total number of eggs painted is 56, so we can write the equation:
x + x + y + (y - 12) = 56

**Step 4** Simplify the equation:
2x + 2y - 12 = 56
2x + 2y = 68
x + y = 34

**Step 5** We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can write the equation:
y + (y - 12) = 30
2y - 12 = 30
2y = 42
y = 21

**Step 6** Now that we know the number of eggs painted by Camden, we can find the number of eggs painted by Arnold:
x + 21 = 34
x = 13

**Step 7** Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs
Arnold painted 13 eggs
The difference is 21 - 13 = 8 eggs

Final result: Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints11MathFormat'}

- The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.

### 2
Let's define the variables:
- Let `x` be the amount of red, white, and purple paint used.
- The amount of yellow paint is `6` pints (half the mural).

### 3
We can set up an equation to represent the total amount of paint used:
- Total paint used = red + white + purple + yellow
- 12 = x + x + x + 6
- 12 = 3x + 6

### 4
Solving for `x`:
- 12 - 6 = 3x
- 6 = 3x
- 2 = x

### 2
- When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes per day
- The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night

### 3
- To calculate the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to consider the net change in the number of holes per day:
