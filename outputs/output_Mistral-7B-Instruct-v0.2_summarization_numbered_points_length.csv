1. The text discusses the transport properties of non-equilibrium dynamical systems, specifically ratchet systems with asymmetric periodic potentials, focusing on chaotic and hamiltonian ratchets.
2. Chaotic systems are defined by their sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters, leading to complex phase space structures with stability islands and co-existing attractors.
3. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and found that the ensemble average velocity could be positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.
4. Mateos conjectured a connection between current reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior, but this was later challenged by Barbi and Salerno.
5. Barbi and Salerno proposed an alternative explanation for current reversals based on the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits and the dependence on ensemble statistics.
6. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the ensemble dependence of transport properties in chaotic systems, especially when considering experimental validation.
7. The authors investigate the current in the same system as considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno, showing that it depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and the importance of discarding transients.
8. The authors find evidence for a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture, that bifurcations for trajectory dynamics are associated with abrupt changes in the current, but not all such changes result in current reversals.

1. The text discusses the results of observations and simulations of six extrasolar planetary systems, each hosting a planet with high eccentricity.
2. The planet-planet scattering method is proposed to explain the architecture of some of these systems, where multiple jovian planets form and interact, leaving one in an eccentric orbit and potentially ejecting another.
3. The Kozai mechanism is suggested to explain the high eccentricity of certain planets, which can induce large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of a planet if the inclination angle between its orbit and a stellar companion is large.
4. Six of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity also have stellar-mass companions in wide binary orbits.
5. The Kozai mechanism has been proposed to explain the high eccentricity of two specific planets, 16 Cyg bb and hd 80606b.
6. The text presents updated orbital fits, dynamical simulations, and detection limit computations for the six systems.
7. The simulations show that there are regions in which additional objects can exist, and combining these simulations with detection limits computed using new high-precision HET data can rule out additional short-period planets down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions.

1. The Large Electron-Positron (LEP) experiments have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the decay of the @xmath1-boson into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand. The agreement of the LEP data with SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the @xmath1-pole.
2. The physics of the @xmath1-boson is expected to play a central role in particle physics again if the next generation @xmath1 factory comes true, generating @xmath16 @xmath1 events in an operational year of gigaz, which implies an expected sensitivity improvement from @xmath18 to @xmath19 for the branching ratio of @xmath1-decay.
3. Among the rare @xmath1-decays, the flavor changing (fc) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics. The branching ratios of these processes in new physics models can be greatly enhanced for lepton flavor violation decays and quark flavor violation decays.
4. The decay of the @xmath1-boson into light higgs bosons is another type of rare process that was widely studied. The rates of these decays can be as large as @xmath18 in new physics models, which lie within the expected sensitivity of the gigaz.
5. The study extends previous studies of these decays to some new models and investigates them altogether. The motivation comes from recent studies on the singlet extension of the MSSM, where a light cp-odd higgs boson with singlet-dominant component may naturally arise. These non-minimal supersymmetric models can avoid the hierarchy problem and alleviate the little hierarchy.
6. The study examines the constraints on the light @xmath0 from many latest experimental results, including theoretical constraints from perturbativity, unitarity, and requirements that the scalar potential be finite at large field values and contain no flat directions. The study also considers constraints from the lep search for neutral higgs bosons, the LEP search for a light higgs boson via the yukawa process, and the cleo-iii limit on @xmath161 and the latest babar limits on @xmath162.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. SUSY particles, whose masses should be below the TeV range, will be discovered at the Tevatron or Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector is an important problem in SUSY phenomenology.
2. In the no-scale type Kähler potential, the hidden sector and observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings (a-terms) vanish when the cosmological constant vanishes. The only source of SUSY breaking is gaugino masses, making this scenario highly predictive. The no-scale structure is obtained in various models and is interesting from the viewpoint of the SUSY flavor problem.
3. The minimal scenario is the case where universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale, and the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) is taken as the theory above the gut scale. The minimal scenario is severely constrained by the cosmological bound and direct search limits at LEP 2, excluding most of the parameter region. However, the other two scenarios, where universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale or non-universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale, are not as severely constrained.
4. The paper discusses the implications of the current higgs mass bound and the LEP 2 constraint on SUSY models with the no-scale boundary condition. The minimal scenario is almost entirely excluded, leaving only a narrow allowed region for the parameter space. The case where the boundary condition is given above the gut scale allows for a wide region of the parameter space, with the possibility of susy signatures being observed at the Tevatron or explored by measuring the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the LHC. The case where non-universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale allows for lighter masses for the lsp, but the mass difference between the lsp and parent particles produced at the collider may require unusual acceptance cuts.

1. Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but these singularities can be weakened by endowing the waves with cross polarization or an electromagnetic (EM) field.
2. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) gave a solution with a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity, initiating a literature on CH stability.
3. Yurtsever showed that the CH formed in CPW was unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and CX's linear perturbation analysis confirmed this result.
4. Cross polarization and the EM field both play roles in the nature of resulting singularities, so it's worth pursuing these features together.
5. The cpbs solution, a cross-polarized version of the Bell-Szekeres (BS) solution, was found long ago and has the nice feature that the weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region.
6. Cross polarization does not remove singularities formed on the null boundaries, but the stability conjecture proposed by Helliwell and Konkowski (HK) seems economical for testing the validity of untested solutions in CPW.
7. The paper investigates the stability of quasiregular (qr) singularities in the incoming region of the cpbs spacetime using three types of test fields: em field, scalar field, and null dusts.
8. The results show that qr singularities in the incoming region become unstable according to the conjecture and transform into nsc singularities when an em field is applied. However, the exact back-reaction solution reveals quasiregular singularities in the incoming regions.
9. The paper also shows that the addition of a scalar field to the cpbs spacetime results in a singular solution, as predicted by the HK stability conjecture.

1. Deep X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N), have detected normal galaxies with X-ray emission at cosmologically interesting distances, contributing up to 51% of the diffuse X-ray background flux in the 0.52 keV band.
2. The CDF-N survey has reached the depths necessary to detect many normal galaxies at 0.52 keV fluxes, enabling the study of their X-ray properties and the evolution of star formation.
3. The ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity of normal spiral galaxies is an indicator of the current level of star formation. This ratio is higher in the past due to the increased energy output of X-ray binary populations during epochs of heightened star formation.
4. Statistical methods, such as stacking, are used to estimate the X-ray emission of normal galaxies at their extremely faint flux levels. This technique has been successfully applied to the CDF-N survey data in several previous studies.
5. The study presented here focuses on galaxies at redshifts 0.25 to 0.75, using both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for redshift determination. The spectroscopic sample is used to filter sources by optical luminosity and morphology, while the photometric sample is used to study galaxies with comparable optical luminosities at different redshifts. The results show that the average X-ray luminosity of galaxies has not evolved significantly by z = 0.75, regardless of exclusion or inclusion of X-ray detected objects.

1. Quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical descriptions, with degrees of non-classicality ranging from non-separable to bell-nonlocal states.
2. Non-separable states are those whose quantum states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents, and they allow for a local hidden state (LHS) model for any measurements by Alice and Bob.
3. Bell-nonlocal states, on the other hand, violate a Bell inequality and demonstrate the violation of local causality, allowing two spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement if either of them or their detectors cannot be trusted.
4. EPR-steerability is a weaker form of non-classical correlation than Bell-nonlocality, but it is more robust to detection inefficiencies and enables the use of untrusted devices in quantum key distribution, albeit only on one side.
5. EPR-steerability is a special case of the more general phenomenon of steering, which is the dependence of one party's state on the measurement choices of the other party, even for separable states.
6. The steering ellipsoid formalism is a mathematical tool used to study the phenomenon of steering in quantum systems, and it can be used to develop a deterministic LHS model for projective measurements on two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, called t-states.
7. T-states are a special class of quantum states that have maximally mixed reduced states and are equivalent to mixtures of Bell states. They form a tetrahedron in the space parameterized by their Bloch vectors.
8. The t-state steering ellipsoid is a sphere centered at the origin with a diagonal spin correlation matrix, and it is a necessary condition for a t-state to be EPR-steerable by Alice that it corresponds to a point above the sandwiched surface defined by the equation of the ellipsoid and the condition that the inverse harmonic mean radius of the ""inverse"" ellipsoid is equal to the semiaxis length.

1. In 1994, a scheme was proposed to realize a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field.
2. The ground state of the array has the spin configuration shown in the figure, with upspin and downspin states encoded as logic 1 and 0, respectively.
3. When two inputs are logic 1, the output is logic 0 due to anti-ferromagnetic ordering. When two inputs are logic 0, the output must be logic 1 to maintain anti-ferromagnetic ordering.
4. However, the system may get stuck in a metastable state (Fig. 1(b)), which is not the ground state, due to the weak magnetic field.
5. Decay to the ground state (Fig. 1(a)) may take a long time due to the phonon bottleneck effect, weak coupling of phonons to spin, and the energy barrier between the metastable and ground states.
6. When one input is logic 1 and the other is logic 0 (Fig. 1(c)), the magnetic field breaks the tie, and the output is logic 1.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary systems consisting of a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors exhibits a lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have not been able to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
2. The minimum period of CV evolution is reached when the mass transfer time and thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time are approximately equal. The probability of finding a CV within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region. Theoretical calculations suggest an accumulation of systems (a spike) at the minimum period, while no such spike is observed in the data. The mass transfer rate is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum (AM) losses.
3. The long-term evolution of CVs is investigated by calculating the evolution of individual systems subject to AM loss via mass loss that is axis-symmetrical with respect to an axis fixed at the WD centre but perpendicular to the orbital plane. The calculations show that the minimum period increases with increasing caml efficiency to a maximum of around 70 minutes. The tidal deformation of the secondary may also affect the period minimum. The statistical significance of the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the period minimum is tested by calculating the period distributions of model populations for various assumptions about evolutionary parameters. The results suggest that the observed CV period distribution cannot be distinguished from a flat parent distribution based on a flat caml efficiency spectrum.

3. The high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318b, with the IGM of the group is believed to be responsible for the shock heating of the x-ray emitting gas.
4. Optical emission line ratios and observed broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is powered by strong shocks and not star formation.

4. The nature of dark energy is currently unknown, and there is a great scientific effort to understand its properties.
5. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of dark energy, along with a dark matter component giving rise to galaxies and their large scale structures.

8. Cosmological models where dark matter and dark energy do not evolve separately but interact with each other have been introduced to address these issues.

1. Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) exhibit diverse broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into their structure and kinematics. Broad emission lines, like Hαx, arise in or near an accretion disk and show a range of widths and shifts. Two populations of Type 1 AGNs have emerged: population A with smaller broad-line widths (1000-4000) and population B with larger broad-line widths (4000-12000).
2. Population A sources have best-fit Hαx profiles described by a single Lorentz function, while population B sources require two Gaussians for a reasonable description. Broad Hαx profiles range from as narrow as 500 to as broad as 40,000. Population A is predominantly radio-quiet, while population B involves a mix of radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars.
3. Narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are considered reliable measures of the local quasar rest frame, except for ""blue outliers"" found in sources with fwhm Hαx=1500-3500 and weak [OIII]. Blue outliers show [OIII] blueshifts as large as 100,000 km/s. Careful use of [OIII] and Hαx narrow lines as rest frame measures suggests that broad Hαx in population B arises from a region with complex line shift properties.
4. Broad FeII emission has been observed in Type 1 quasars since the era of photographic spectroscopy in the 60s. FeII emission blends are ubiquitous in bright SDSS quasars and are believed to arise in or near the emitting clouds that produce other low ionization lines. The feII line width correlates with the Hαx line width over the full range where feII can be detected. The shape of the feII 4450-4700 blue blend near [OIII]5007 can reveal information about the underlying structure of the broad line region in population B sources.

2. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the ALADIN group, revealing a wide plateau-like region at around 5 MeV temperature and 3-10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy.
3. Theoretical calculations concerning this problem started in the 1980s, and the discrepancies between different experimental results are attributed to the precision of measurements and finite-size effects.
4. Recent reevaluations of the ALADIN group's data have brought corrections to the kinetic energies of emitted neutrons and the energies of spectator parts, which grow with approximately 30 MeV in the bombarding energy interval 600-1000 MeV/nucleon.

The present paper describes refinements and improvements to the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation model proposed in [@xcite], including the replacement of level density functions with degeneracies of discrete levels and the modification of the level density formula for fragments with short excited states life-times.

3. Debate continues on whether magnetic energy is derived from dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves or numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events (nanoflares).
4. Two types of magnetic disturbances in coronal structures are generated by the interaction of magnetic fields with convective flows: MHD waves and field-aligned currents.
5. MHD waves are produced by the buffeting of magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere and propagate into magnetic flux tubes, dissipating their energy in the chromosphere or corona.
6. Field-aligned currents are generated by the random motions of magnetic loop foot-points and can be dissipated resistively.

Water vapor is an important molecule in interstellar and circumstellar clouds, and the 6@xmath8 - 5@xmath9 masing transition of H2O at 22 GHz has been used to trace high excitation gas around star forming regions and evolved stars. However, no information has been obtained on its role at large spatial scales due to the small size of the emitting regions.

Among these lines, only the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition at 183 GHz has been used to map the emission of H2O at very large spatial scales.

1. The text discusses the study of superfluid current response in superconductors, focusing on the case of two-band superconductors and comparing it to the one-band case. The authors find that for nearly decoupled bands, a strong signature of the small gap in the second band appears in the nonlinear coefficients, but this signature disappears with increased interband coupling or scattering. Intraband impurities in the second band wash out the temperature variation of the second band, while intraband impurities in the first band mainly affect the nonlinearity at higher temperatures. The authors also provide predictions for the nonlinear coefficient in the two-band superconductor MgB2 using band structure calculations.
2. The authors discuss the importance of studying nonlinear current response for device applications and understanding fundamental signatures of order parameter symmetry. They examine two nonlinear coefficients defined in the literature and find that for MgB2, the nonlinear coefficient is monotonically increasing in contrast to a previous prediction based on approximations. They also find that adding impurities to the second band is the best way to reduce the increased nonlinearity due to the second band.

1. The text discusses the study of superfluid current response in superconductors, focusing on the case of two-band superconductors and comparing it to the one-band case. The authors find that for nearly decoupled bands, a strong signature of the small gap in the second band appears in the nonlinear coefficients, but this signature disappears with increased interband coupling or scattering. Intraband impurities in the second band wash out the temperature variation of the second band, while intraband impurities in the first band mainly affect the nonlinearity at higher temperatures. The authors also provide predictions for the nonlinear coefficient in the two-band superconductor MgB2 using band structure calculations.
2. The authors discuss the importance of studying nonlinear current response for device applications and understanding fundamental signatures of order parameter symmetry. They examine two nonlinear coefficients defined in the literature and find that for M",0

1. The classification of time series data is an essential task in data mining, and dynamic time warping (DTW) with 1-nearest neighbor (1-nn) is an effective method for this task.
2. DTW uses a dynamic programming technique to find the optimal warping path between two time series with the minimum cumulative distance.
3. However, DTW may not always provide the best mapping, as it tries to find the minimum distance without considering the global context.
4. Global constraints, such as Sakoe-Chiba band and Itakura parallelogram, have been proposed to limit the permissible warping paths.
5. Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (r-k band) is a recent representation of a global constraint that allows adjusting the constraint according to each class's warping path.
6. To select the best r-k band, two learning algorithms, band boundary extraction and iterative learning, are proposed in this work.
7. The band boundary extraction algorithm obtains the maximum, mean, and mode of the paths' positions on the DTW distance matrix and adjusts the band structures accordingly.
8. The iterative learning algorithm adjusts the band structures based on the silhouette index, which measures the separation between clusters.
9. The lb_keogh lower bound is used in the prediction step to speed up the computation by eliminating the need to compare all possible warping paths.
10. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on various datasets, and the results show that it outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

1. The Standard Model of Elementary Particles (SM) has been successful in describing nature at the electroweak scale. The discovery of a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations strengthens the model. No explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM has been reported from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), but an anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) has been observed.
2. The muon g-2 anomaly, which is more than 3.6 standard deviations from SM predictions, is a hint of new physics beyond the SM. Researchers in this paper explore the possibility of a new gauge interaction for the muon beyond the SM. The lepton symmetry is broken by the anomaly against the U(1) gauge interaction, and the washout of the baryon asymmetry can be avoided if the interaction rate is smaller than the Hubble scale.
3. The most efficient interaction for inducing symmetry violation by the majorana masses is shown in Figure [fig : m], and its rate is given by equation ([eq : rate - m]). The condition for the washout not to occur is that the rate is smaller than the Hubble scale for 100 GeV, which is less severe than the condition for the mass terms in equation ([eq : mass terms]). The right-handed neutrinos might be long-lived and could over-close the universe or destroy the success of big-bang nucleosynthesis if they are not decayed efficiently. The most important decay channel for the right-handed neutrinos is shown in Figure [fig : decay of n], and the decay rate is given by equation ([eq : decay rate]). The right-handed neutrinos decay before the beginning of big-bang nucleosynthesis and do not affect it.

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems, specifically qubits, plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.
2. The study of entanglement's essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence has attracted significant attention due to the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD).
3. ESD, where entanglement between qubits is terminated, can be observed experimentally and is detrimental to quantum information processing.
4. However, not all qubit entanglement experiences ESD; some can revive after a period of ESD, and finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit.
5. This revived entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.
6. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD is always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.
7. Similar results have been observed for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom for one particle interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.
8. The entanglement dynamics and its distribution in the bipartite partitions are determined by the time-dependent factor of single-qubit excited-state population.
9. Population trapping, a phenomenon responsible for the suppression of spontaneous emission in a photonic band gap (PBG) reservoir, can lead to the formation of bound states between qubits and their reservoirs, preventing complete transfer of entanglement.
10. The condition for ESD of qubits and the accompanying ESB of reservoirs is not always satisfied, and the presence of bound states can prevent ESD and ESB in certain cases.

1. GRBs are powerful astrophysical phenomena with isotropic distribution in the sky, lasting from less than one second to tens of seconds, and observed above the terrestrial atmosphere with x-gamma ray detectors. They are believed to occur at cosmological distances, with measured redshifts up to 4.5.
2. The most likely explanations for GRBs involve huge energy releases, such as the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) or the coalescence of one compact binary system. In both cases, emission of gravitational waves (GWs) is expected.
3. The duration of a GW burst is predicted to be of the order of a few milliseconds for various sources, including coalescing and merging black holes and neutron star binaries. Present resonant detectors, designed to detect GWs through the excitation of the quadrupole modes of massive cylinders, can detect signals with amplitudes of the order of 10^-20.
4. The present sensitivity for 1 ms GW pulses of the best GW antennas with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equal to unity requires a total conversion of one million solar masses at 1 gpc. However, detection of a single GW signal associated with a single GRB appears hopeless, but detection of a signal associated with the sum of many events could be more realistic.
5. The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, which have been used to search for correlations between GRB events detected with BEPPOSAX and the output signals from the gravitational antennas. An algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors was used to cope with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts and unmodelled noise.
6. The results of the analysis showed that no significant correlation was found between GRB and GW signals, and new experimental upper limits for the burst intensity causing correlations of GWs with GRBs were determined. The method can be applied for any expected delay between GRB and GW, with appropriate time shifting of the integration window with respect to the GRB arrival time, according to the prediction of the chosen model.

The analysis reveals that the total in-degree distribution follows a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of nodes.
3. The distribution of the average number of nodes with intra-links in one network is analyzed, reducing to a simpler recurrence relation for large intra-links. The distribution has a power-law form that depends on the attachment rate and the initial attractiveness.
4. The distribution of the average number of nodes with cross-links in one network is analyzed by summing over the joint distribution for all its intra-links. The distribution is linear in time and has a power-law form with exponents that are inversely proportional to the coupled parameters.
5. The model is applied to the analysis of citation networks and the web of human sexual contacts. In the weak coupling case, the power-law exponent of the intra-link distribution is equal to the total link distribution. The exponent of the cross-link distribution decreases as the coupling parameter increases, and the model has the flexibility to represent various complex systems.

1. The text discusses the investigation of collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints in cognitive radio networks. The authors characterize the secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (AF) cognitive relay channel and formulate the beamforming optimization as a quasiconvex optimization problem. They propose two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes to reduce computational complexity. The channel model consists of a source, a primary user, a secondary user destination, an eavesdropper, and relays, with the source trying to transmit confidential messages to the destination while keeping interference on the primary user below a predefined limit and keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the information.
2. The authors assume that relays work synchronously and perform beamforming by multiplying the signals to be transmitted with complex weights. They derive expressions for the received signals at the destination and eavesdropper, and write the objective function of the optimization problem as the secrecy rate. They use semidefinite programming to solve the problem and propose suboptimal null space beamforming techniques to simplify the analysis. The authors also discuss the extension of their results to the case of more than one primary user and multiple eavesdroppers, under certain conditions. The paper provides numerical results to illustrate the performances of different beamforming schemes.

1. The text discusses the benefits of maintaining the @xmath0-invariance during the quantization of the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS). The authors argue that a classical @xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFS, so it is logical to maintain this symmetry during quantization. They demonstrate that the corresponding Wightman two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts.
2. The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism and realize all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. They introduce auxiliary fields and use the Gribov-Bleuler quantization scheme to deal with gauge freedom. They also use a well-suited coordinate system to get @xmath0-invariant CFS formulas in a minkowskian form.
3. The main result is a set of Wightman two-point functions for Maxwell and auxiliary fields. The authors solve the dynamical system, construct the quantum field, and determine the subspace of physical states. They also compute the two-point functions and demonstrate that the resulting theory is equivalent to a covariant free field theory in Minkowski space. The paper also discusses the infinitesimal @xmath0 action on the fields and their @xmath0-invariant scalar product.

3. During the first second after the trigger, Fermi-LAT detected over 50 events with an energy above 100 MeV and more than 150 events within the first minute. The observations led to the determination of a redshift and a spectroscopically determined value.
4. The average cbm density was found to be low, typical of galactic halo environments, and consistent with the large offset from the center of the host and the interpretation of grb 090510 as a short GRB originating in a binary neutron star (ns) merger.

1. The text discusses the use of precision measurements at LEP, SLD, and the Tevatron to infer information about new models beyond the Standard Model (SM) by performing global fits. The simplest example is the prediction of the Higgs boson mass, which is strongly correlated with the top quark mass and increases quadratically as the top quark mass is increased.
2. In models with Higgs particles in representations other than doublets and singlets, there are more parameters in the gauge/higgs sector than in the SM. The SM tree level relation no longer holds, and when the theory is renormalized at one loop, models of this type require extra input parameters.
3. The text discusses two examples where the new physics does not decouple from the SM at one loop, specifically a real scalar triplet and a left-right symmetric model. In these models, the dependence of the W boson mass on the top quark mass is quadratic and the triplet is non-decoupling.
4. The text also discusses the possibility of a heavy Higgs boson that is consistent with precision electroweak data, which can be offset by large contributions to isospin violation from new physics. The oblique parameter formulation neglects contributions to observables from vertex and box diagrams, which are numerically important in the example discussed.

The text discusses the development of a new interpolative approach for calculating self-energies in strongly correlated electronic systems using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and realistic local density approximation (LDA) based electronic structure calculations. The method aims to explore all parameter space where neither doping nor degeneracy is fixed, allowing the calculation of properties of realistic solid state systems.
2. The authors propose an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation, which is not an alternative method for solving the impurity problem but follows the ideology of LDA theory. They use the slave boson mean field (SBMF) approach and the Hubbard I approximation to determine the functional dependence of the interpolating coefficients upon doping, degeneracy, and the strength of the interaction.
3. The authors compare the trends produced by this interpolative procedure with known analytical limits and against calculations using the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. They find that the SBMF approach can predict the parameters of interpolation with good accuracy, while the Hubbard I method fails in some regimes. The functional form of the atomic green function within the Hubbard I approximation is used to determine positions of atomic satellites, which helps to impose additional constraints on the procedure. The method is shown to be computationally efficient and generally finds a satisfactory accuracy in comparisons with the numerically more accurate QMC calculations.

1. The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is a crucial measure for understanding the hierarchical build-up of the universe.
2. Large-scale simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high mass galaxies, necessitating processes to quench star formation.
3. Supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the centers of galaxies are the likely solution to this problem, as they grow through accretion of cold material and emit radiation that can heat or remove gas from the interstellar medium.
4. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) manifest themselves as bright point sources in the nucleus of galaxies and can deposit energy into the interstellar medium through jets or powerful outflows.
5. Indirect evidence of AGN feedback includes scaling relationships between the mass of the SMBH and different properties of the host galaxy, suggesting a strong coevolution of the host galaxy and SMBH.
6. Much debate remains about the exact mechanism of AGN feedback and its role in the overall evolution of galaxies, especially in light of new observations that deviate from established relationships.
7. The starburst-AGN connection is another area of focus, as evidence for AGN feedback should also manifest itself in the SFR of its host galaxy.

1. Organic molecular crystals, composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces, are emerging as candidates for nanoscale devices in electronics and optoelectronics.
2. These devices consist of both organic and inorganic components, where the organic part forms the active part and the inorganic part provides electrical contact to external circuitry.
3. The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the device performance.
4. Charge transfer between the organic and inorganic components and the energies at which transfer takes place need to be understood.
5. Upon adsorption on a substrate, electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change due to the polarization of the substrate and the formation of image charges.
6. Quasiparticle (qp) description is a common way to calculate addition and removal energies, but its adequacy depends on the level of theory used to calculate energy levels of the homo and lumo.
7. Density functional theory (DFT) is a popular choice for calculating energy levels, but it fails to capture the image charge effect due to its non-local nature.
8. GW approximation is a possible solution to this problem, but it is computationally demanding and can only be applied to small systems.

2. The authors consider two spherical colloids of the same size with different boundary conditions (bcs) facing the substrate and investigate the normal and lateral CCFs.
3. The normal CCF acting on one colloid changes sign for a fixed value of the distance to the substrate, indicating an unstable mechanical equilibrium configuration.
4. The lateral CCF for certain bcs turns attractive for large lateral distances, which is a pure many-body effect.
5. The text also explores the preferred arrangement of the colloids by assessing the direction of the total CCF for various spatial configurations and bcs.
6. For symmetric bcs, the many-body normal CCF acting on one colloid is negative, while for non-symmetric bcs, it is positive.
7. The relative contribution of the many-body ccf to the total force is between 10% and 15%.
8. The authors find that colloids with symmetric bcs tend to aggregate laterally, forming a monolayer on the substrate, while those with non-symmetric bcs aggregate on top of each other, forming three-dimensional clusters.
9. The substrate-induced changes are more pronounced if the two spheres are close to the substrate.

The study focuses on the hydrogenation of coronene cations in the gas phase and the presence of barriers for odd hydrogenation states.

The results suggest that PAH cations can also be highly hydrogenated in the ISM and act as catalysts for h@xmath2 formation.

1. Atomic clocks require both atoms and an active oscillator to function.
2. Two problems arise in defining the second as a unit of measurement in the International System of Units (SI): the resonance of atoms varies with clock construction and operation, and the oscillator drifts in relation to its control knob.
3. To address problem (a), a wave function parametrized by radiation intensity and other factors is introduced, and the SI second is defined as the resonance that would be found at absolute zero temperature.
4. Problem (b) is addressed by computer-mediated feedback that adjusts the oscillator based on detections of scattering of the oscillator's radiation by the clock's atoms.
5. The wave function used in an atomic clock can never be unconditionally known, and the distinction between explanation and evidence in quantum theory implies a gap between any explanation and the evidence explained.
6. Clocks that generate Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) are steered toward aiming points that depend on both a chosen wave function and an hypothesized metric tensor field of a curved spacetime.
7. The hypothesis of a metric tensor is constrained by measured data but not determined by it, and guesses enter the operations of clocks through the computational machinery that steers them.

1. MOPED (Multiple Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data Compression) is a patented algorithm for compressing data and speeding up likelihood evaluations in astronomical data analysis. It is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the model parameters.
2. MOPED eliminates the need for matrix inversion by compressing data points into independent, unit variance values, simplifying likelihood calculations. A single compression is done on the data, and then for each point in parameter space.
3. The weighting vectors for compression are generated from the theoretical model and data, with the first vector being the most sensitive to the first parameter. Subsequent vectors are made orthogonal to previous ones.
4. The noise covariance matrix of the compressed values is the identity, simplifying likelihood calculations. The new likelihood function is given by the compressed data and signal.
5. MOPED assumes the covariance matrix is independent of the parameters, allowing for faster likelihood calculations. However, this assumption may not hold for all cases.
6. In a one-dimensional case with only the central frequency of an oscillation as an unknown parameter, MOPED creates a second peak of equal height at an incorrect frequency due to a many-to-one mapping between the original and compressed parameters.
7. Adding a second parameter, such as the width of the burst, can rectify the problem by creating two orthogonal moped weighting vectors and two compressed parameters. However, degeneracies in these parameters may still create unphysical modes of equal likelihood to the true peak.
8. In some cases, such as varying the polarization of the burst, MOPED creates a second mode of equal likelihood to the true peak, which is not a mode of the original likelihood function.
9. For more complex scenarios, such as varying the time of arrival of the burst, MOPED creates many alternative modes of likelihood equal to that of the original peak, which is problematic for parameter estimation. To determine if MOPED has accurately portrayed the likelihood function, it is important to identify any erroneous peaks before using the results it provides.

2. The method involves two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapor. One laser is modulated, and the absorption of the pump laser is monitored as a function of probe laser detuning.
3. The non-linear interaction of the lasers generates sub-doppler peaks (Lamb-Dicke dips) in the atomic ground state population, which correspond to atomic resonances with sidebands at their sides.
4. The text presents two ladder systems (Rb D1 and D2 lines) to illustrate the main features of the technique and two different applications of the modulation (amplitude and frequency).
5. The amplitude of the probe laser is modulated for the first system, while the second system has its pump frequency modulated. The frequency modulation of the pump laser allows for locking the probe laser to the excited atomic resonance.
6. The theoretical model uses a three-level atom in ladder configuration interacting with two lasers, one of which has sidebands. The system is treated as doppler-free to keep it tractable, but the experimental situation is more complex for quantitative analysis.
7. The equations for the slowly varying elements of the density matrix are solved using a Floquet basis expansion to obtain the absorption terms proportional to the absorption of the first laser carrier and sidebands.
8. The experimental setup includes a coherent 899-01 Ti:sapphire laser for the pump and an sdl diode laser for the probe, both operating at room temperature in a rubidium vapor cell. The probe laser is scanned over the hyperfine manifold, and the absorption of the pump laser is observed as a function of probe laser detuning using a fast photodetector.
9. The results show resonant features of the hyperfine manifold with little as 100 µW of probe power, and higher probe power increases the signal size and the width of the features. The method has been used to lock the frequency of a laser to an excited transition",0

2. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are crucial in both two and three dimensions, reducing the zero-temperature order parameter to nearly 0.4 of the classical value in two dimensions and 0.8 of the mean-field result in three dimensions for the equivalent quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet (QHAF).
3. Recent interest includes spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet. In the random-AF model, the lattice-averaged order parameter appears to be enhanced for small fractions of vacancies, while spin fluctuations are enhanced by strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies.
4. A new method is presented for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the hf-level broken-symmetry state using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
5. The method is applicable in the whole interaction strength range and is illustrated with three applications: the pure model in the strong coupling limit, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-impurity concentrations in the strong coupling limit.
6. The method for obtaining quantum correction to sublattice magnetization solely in terms of transverse spin correlations is parallel to the spin-wave theory (SWT) approach but differs from the method involving self-energy corrections.

2. The WIMP DM candidate can be stabilized by imposing a parity symmetry, which ensures the stability of the lightest odd particle in the model, as long as it is electrically neutral.
3. Neutrinos have been confirmed to have nonzero but tiny masses, which may indicate Majorana type masses. The seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) are two simple ways to explain tiny neutrino masses, but they do not contain a DM candidate.
4. In models where tiny neutrino masses are generated by higher orders of perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained. In these models, the yukawa couplings of neutrinos with the SM Higgs boson are forbidden at the tree level by imposing a parity, and the stability of the lightest odd particle is guaranteed.
5. The HTM introduces a triplet scalar field with large majorana masses, which generates Majorana neutrino masses via the yukawa interaction. The scalar potential in the HTM can be written in terms of the Higgs doublet field and the triplet field, and the lepton number conservation is broken by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the triplet field.
6. The small triplet VEV is generated by an explicit breaking parameter of the lepton number conservation, and the small neutrino masses are obtained in the HTM by assuming at least one of the yukawa couplings or the breaking parameter to be tiny.
7. In the HTM, the scalar sector can contribute to lepton flavor violation (LFV) in decays of charged leptons, and the relation between these LFV decays and neutrino mass matrix is constrained by oscillation data. To explain the small neutrino masses with a detectable light doubly charged component of the triplet field, the @xmath14 parameter has to be taken to be unnaturally much lower than the electroweak scale.

1. The study of magnetic and electric dipole moments of elementary particles, including electrons and muons, has led to significant advancements in subatomic physics, from the discovery of spin and radiative corrections to the development of QED and QCD.
2. The magnetic moment of a charged particle is given by the Dirac equation, with the anomaly arising from radiative corrections for point particles. The situation for baryons is different due to their internal quark structure, which gives them large anomalies.
3. Measurements of magnetic and electric dipole moments have placed serious restrictions on physics beyond the Standard Model. With the development of supersymmetric theories, interest in the experimental and theoretical value of the muon's magnetic moment has grown substantially. Susy contributions to the magnetic and electric dipole moments could be at a measurable level in a broad range of models.
4. Experiments, such as E821 and BNL, have been conducted to measure the muon's magnetic moment with high precision. These experiments are based on the fact that the spin precesses faster than the momentum vector when a muon travels transversely to a magnetic field. The spin precession frequency is given by Eq. (ef{eq : omeganoe}), and the experimental signal is the decay positrons detected by lead-scintillating fiber calorimeters. The latest results from E821 show a discrepancy of 2.7 standard deviations between the experimental value and the Standard Model prediction, indicating sensitivity to physics at the 100 GeV scale.

1. A new design for an optomechanical system was presented in a recent paper by Li et al., consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide.
2. The system has several attractive features, including universality and the ability to study reactive effects in optomechanical coupling.
3. The origin of the reactive coupling lies in the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator and further phase-dependent gradient forces.
4. The design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, but other possibilities for investigating reactive coupling effects without cooling were also examined.
5. The system is modeled using a Hamiltonian that includes the energy of the cavity field, waveguide, interactions between the waveguide and incident fields, and damping terms.
6. The time evolutions of the expectation values for the system were solved using the Heisenberg equation of motion and the mean field assumption.
7. The steady-state solution of the equations of motion was found to have three oscillating expectation values at frequencies of the pump, stokes, and anti-stokes fields.
8. Normal mode splitting was observed in the output fields due to the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity, resulting in larger peak separations with increasing pump power.
9. The system can also generate an anti-stokes field due to the reactive coupling, and the maximum gain for the anti-stokes field was found to be about 0.1 for a pump power of 1.3 µW.

1. The text discusses the dynamics of transverse magnetization in a quantum Ising chain, which is put into nonequilibrium by preparing an initial state with inhomogeneity in transverse magnetization.
2. The system is studied under the influence of a homogeneous and constant transverse field to examine whether the transport properties make the magnetization homogeneous and how it relaxes with time.
3. The study reveals that the magnetization at different sites does not attain the same value, and the underlying dynamics at each site possess two different timescales of oscillation.
4. The smaller timescale contributes insignificant undulations, while the oscillations of larger timescales exhibit generic power-law decay, and the exponent of the decay is independent of the strength of the external field. Additionally, the study shows that the system exhibits quantum phase transition in the dynamics in two ways: the frequency of the characteristic oscillation is a monotonic function of the external field in the ordered phase and becomes independent of the field when it crosses the critical value to the disordered phase, and the transverse magnetization after infinite time at each site shows different functional behavior in the ordered and disordered phase, thus producing nonanalyticity at the critical point. The phenomena observed are valid for arbitrary values of the parameters in the initial configuration.

1. The Kepler mission discovered over 4100 planetary candidates in 3200 systems, revealing that small planets are common and some have sizes between Earth and Neptune. The transition from rocky to non-rocky planets occurs near a planet radius of approximately 1.5 Earth radii.
2. Understanding planetary radii accurately is crucial for comprehending the distribution of planetary structures and the relationship between radius, mass, and bulk density. However, approximately half of the Kepler candidate stars have not been observed, and those that have been observed are mostly for false positive elimination and stellar parameter determination.
3. Recent work suggests that a significant fraction of Kepler host stars may be multiple stars, which can change the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii. Assuming all stars are single can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions.
4. The presence of a stellar companion does not necessarily invalidate a planetary candidate, but it does change the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii. The fraction of multiple stars in the Kepler candidate list is not yet determined but is likely not zero.
5. The mean correction factor for the planetary radii underestimation depends on the primary star's effective temperature. Radial velocity and high resolution imaging vetting can significantly reduce the fraction of undetected companions and the mean correction factors for stars that are vetted.
6. The effectiveness of radial velocity and high resolution imaging vetting is even more significant for missions like K2 and TESS, where the stars are closer and the imaging can detect companions within a smaller distance. Single epoch high resolution imaging may be the most effective means of reducing the mean planetary radius correction factor for a large number of candidates.

1. The range of Hi column densities in nearby galaxy neutral gas disks is similar to those in damped Lyman-@x alpha systems (DLAs). An attractive experiment would be to map the Hi gas of DLAs in 21-cm emission and measure their total gas mass, extent, and dynamics.
2. However, present technology cannot observe DLAs in 21-cm emission due to the weak line and the redshift number density decrease toward lower redshifts, limiting the number of DLAs whose 21-cm emission is within reach.
3. Most observers study DLAs in the optical wavelengths, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been unsuccessful. There are now hundreds of DLAs known at intermediate and high redshifts, but little possibility to bridge the information gap with local galaxies.
4. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe have resulted in accurate Hi mass measurements, which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLAs studies. The Hi mass function of galaxies can be calculated by integrating over Hi mass surveys such as HIPASS.
5. The column density distribution function can be calculated using the area function and Hi mass function, which describes the area in Hi column densities for galaxies with a certain Hi mass. The resulting plot shows the Hi mass density per decade of column density.

1. Stars are primarily formed in star clusters during the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds (Lada & Lada, 2003). Only a modest percentage of the gas is turned into stars, leaving the initial cluster with a combination of gas and stars.
2. During the onset of stellar winds and after the first supernovae explosions, enough energy is injected into the gas within the embedded cluster to remove it on timescales shorter than a crossing time (Hills, 1980; Lada et al., 1984; Goodwin, 1997a).
3. The resulting cluster, now devoid of gas, is far out of equilibrium due to the rapid change in gravitational potential energy caused by the loss of a significant fraction of its mass.
4. Recent studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in young clusters by studying the internal dynamics, but results have been discrepant, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard Kroupa (2002) or Salpeter (1955) type IMFs.
5. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, suggesting that the youngest clusters (tens of Myr) may not be in virial equilibrium.
6. Observations of the surface brightness profiles of massive young clusters m82-f, ngc 1569-a, and ngc 1705-1 show a significant excess of light at large radii compared to King (1962) or Elson, Fall, & Freeman (1987) profiles.
7. Simulations of the effects of gas expulsion on massive young clusters produce the same excess of light at large radii due to stars escaping during a period of violent relaxation. Gas expulsion can also cause virial mass estimates to be significantly wrong for several tens of Myr.
8. These signatures are also seen in many other young star clusters and suggest that gas expulsion is an important phase in the evolution of young clusters that cannot be ignored. Claims of unusual IMFs for young star clusters are probably in error as these clusters are not in virial equilibrium as assumed.

2. At the theoretical level, it is proposed that the glass transition is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic transition at the Kauzmann temperature, where only one minimum-energy basin of attraction is accessible to the system.
3. Simulations of hard-disk and soft-sphere systems have shown discrepancies, leading to questions about whether these differences are due to fundamental model differences or inappropriate sampling at low temperatures and high densities.

The results showed that the system exhibits a structural relaxation in three successive steps as predicted by the idealized schematic MCT, with the first step being a fast initial decay on the time scale of atomic vibrations and the second and third steps being the α-relaxation regime and the β-relaxation, respectively. The system also showed aging effects, with the nonergodicity parameters decreasing sharply at large times and temperatures below Tc.

According to quantum electrodynamics, electric and magnetic field fluctuations in vacuum result in a zero-point energy that never vanishes, leading to the Casimir effect, where two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates attract each other with a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation.

The authors begin by explaining how deforming a CFT with a marginal or irrelevant operator introduces new divergences in the renormalized operators, which can be cancelled by renormalizing the operators and are determined by the couplings. They show that for planar N=4 SYM, finding the action of the matrix on operators diagonalized by the Bethe ansatz is a new method to compute these couplings.

5. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
6. A trace formula was developed for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators and successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and polymer microlasers.
7. However, there is no investigation of the trace formula for three-dimensional (3D) dielectric resonators due to the difficulty of solving the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities. Flat microlasers are treated as 2D systems using an effective index of refraction, but this approximation introduces uncontrolled errors, and no a priori estimates of these errors are known even when the cavity height is much smaller than the wavelength. The present work aims to compare the experimental length spectra with the 2D @xmath0 approximation and investigate the effect of dispersion and the need for higher-order corrections.

1. The text discusses the simulation of double neutron star (DNS) coalescences using Monte Carlo methods to estimate the gravitational stochastic background produced by these events. The coalescence timescale obeys a well-defined probability distribution, leading to a time lag between the formation of the progenitors and the gravitational wave emission.
2. The maximum probability to form a massive binary occurs at a redshift of z = 2.5, while the maximum probability to occur a coalescence is around z = 0.1. A truly continuous background is formed when sources located beyond z = 10 (z = 9.4 for sfr1) are considered, including 96% (94% for sfr1) of all events.
3. The density parameter Ωgw has a maximum around 670 Hz (630 Hz for sfr1), attaining an amplitude of about 1.0e-8 (5.5e-9 for sfr1). The low frequency cutoff around 1.2 kHz corresponds essentially to the gravitational redshifted wave frequency associated to the last stable orbit of sources located near the maximum of the coalescence rate.
4. The computed signal is below the sensitivity of the first and the second generation of detectors, but using the planned sensitivity of third generation interferometers, the cross-correlation of two ego-like coincident antennas gives an optimized signal-to-noise ratio of 1.0e-15 (1.0e-16 for sfr1) after one year of integration.
5. The popcorn contribution is one order of magnitude higher with a maximum of 1.0e-8 (5.5e-9 for sfr1) at 1.5 kHz (1.1 kHz for sfr1). This signal, which is characterized by the spatial and temporal evolution of the events as well as by its signature, can be distinguished from the instrumental noise background, and adequate data analysis strategies for its detection are currently under investigation.

1. Shock acceleration of particles in the presence of pre-existing seed particles and their nonlinear backreaction is a complex phenomenon extensively studied in astrophysics.
2. The most important issue is the violation of the test particle approximation when the acceleration process generates pressures of the accelerated particles comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure.
3. Three approaches to account for the backreaction of particles on the shock exist: numerical simulations, fluid models, and analytical methods.
4. The fluid models treat cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, allowing for the thermodynamics of the modified shocks to be obtained but not providing information about the spectrum of accelerated particles.

1. The text discusses the evidence from type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large scale structure that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase.
2. This result is attributed to the existence of a dark energy sector with negative pressure, which eventually dominates over cold dark matter and drives the universe's accelerating expansion.
3. The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, but it faces difficulties such as the cosmological constant problem and the age problem.
4. Several dark energy models have been proposed, including quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic dark energy, new agegraphic dark energy, and ricci dark energy.
5. Teleparallel gravity, a theory based on the Weitzenbäck connection instead of the Levi-Civita connection, is a possibility for explaining the accelerated phase of the universe.
6. Teleparallel gravity is closely related to general relativity but differs in boundary terms involving total derivatives in the action.
7. The paper aims to explore the implications of teleparallel gravity on the formation of light elements during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and to constrain its free parameters using BBN observational data.
8. BBN occurred between the first fractions of a second and a few hundred seconds after the Big Bang and describes the sequence of nuclear reactions that yielded the synthesis of light elements.
9. The paper confronts various teleparallel gravity models with BBN calculations based on current observational data on primordial abundance and extracts constraints on their free parameters.

1. The text describes a research study on maximizing the sum rate in a three-node half-duplex bidirectional relay network with fading using adaptive mode selection and power allocation. The study aims to find a policy that selects the optimal transmission mode and allocates the optimal powers to the nodes in each time slot based on the instantaneous channel state information.
2. The study compares the proposed protocol with existing protocols and shows that it outperforms them in terms of sum rate. However, it comes at the expense of increased end-to-end delay, which can be bounded to cause only a small loss in the achieved rate. The delay analysis is left for future research.

1. The acoustic oscillations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have a standard ruler scale that can be accurately calculated based on CMB anisotropy power spectrum measurements.
2. This standard ruler can be used to measure the matter and energy content of the universe at low redshifts by comparing it to large galaxy redshift surveys.
3. However, if the CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as undetected relativistic particles, the misinterpretation could potentially spread to low-redshift applications and bias inferences.
4. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, which are robustly measured in the CMB.
5. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality.
6. The epoch of recombination is very insensitive to cosmology and is controlled by atomic physics, making any shift in the baryon-to-photon ratio negligible.
7. The baryon-to-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum by both the ratios of the odd and even acoustic peaks and by the silk damping tail.
8. The potential envelope, which encodes information about matter-radiation equality, can be measured robustly and constrains equality.
9. The sound horizon can be translated into knowledge of the wavelength of the baryonic features in the mass power spectrum up to the same normalization uncertainty.
10. Measuring the acoustic oscillation scale at low redshifts in galaxy surveys can isolate the cosmology between the survey redshift and the epoch of recombination, allowing for the detection of dynamical shenanigans.

3. The LSND experiment at Los Alamos reported evidence for @xmath2 oscillation, which may help determine neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles.
4. The true answer to the neutrino mass question is essentially unknown, but investigating plausible ansatze for the neutrino mass matrix, such as the one proposed here, may lead to progress.
5. The proposed ansatz for the 3 generation neutrino mass matrix is eq. ( 1.1 ) with @xmath4, which can be motivated from an SO(10) grand unified model.
6. In an SO(10) model, each generation contains one light massive two component neutrino and a heavy one, which is ""integrated out"" using the seesaw mechanism.

3. The depolarizing channel is a good model for quantum information encoded in photon polarization and is described by a single parameter.

1. The family of iron pnictides is a well-established system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with several sub-families and a wide structural variety.
2. The magnetic behavior of iron pnictides is interesting and puzzling, with a phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic crystal symmetry typically accompanied by long-range antiferromagnetic order.
3. Understanding the magnetic fluctuations in iron pnictides is crucial for unveiling the physics underlying the superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated.
4. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an important experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides, but it is difficult to get accurate information on the magnetic anisotropy due to twinned crystals and mixed magnetic domains.
5. The Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-Green function (KKR-GF) approach and the coherent potential approximation (CPA) were used to study the magnetic phase of iron pnictides and the corresponding ARPES spectra, allowing for a direct comparison to experimental data on detwinned crystals.
6. The results showed good agreement with experimental data, including the anisotropy in the Fermi surface, and provided insights into the impact of disorder and substitution on the magnetic moments and the evolution of the band structure.

1. The M31 globular cluster GC B158 contains an X-ray source named XB158, which exhibits strong intensity modulation on a 10017 second period.
2. Previous observations by XMM-Newton and ROSAT revealed similar variation in the folded lightcurves, with the amplitude of modulation decreasing with increasing source intensity.
3. The source is likely a neutron star binary with a low mass donor based on the X-ray data and analysis of the unfolded XMM-Newton lightcurve.
4. However, the unfolded lightcurve from the 2000 June XMM-Newton observation revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, with no evidence for dips in the previous orbital cycles.
5. Further analysis of XMM-Newton observations in 2004 revealed 1100% dipping for one orbital cycle and zero evidence for dips in other cycles, indicating that the disk was precessing.
6. Such behavior is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon observed in accreting binaries where the mass ratio is smaller than 10.3.
7. The authors modeled the 2004 July 17 XMM-Newton PN spectrum of XB158 with a blackbody and a power law, finding a photon index of 2.0 and a luminosity of 1.5 erg s-1.
8. The authors conducted 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamical modeling, estimating the disk precession period to be 29 times the orbital period, i.e., 81 hours.
9. The authors analyzed 30 Swift observations of M31 globular cluster X-ray sources spanning 112 years, observing 0.310 keV luminosities and proposing that this is due to varying accretion rates over the disk precession cycle. They found evidence for a super-orbital period of 16 days.

1. The text discusses methods for calculating the energy and lifetime of resonance states in quantum systems. The complex scaling method reveals resonances by the appearance of isolated complex eigenvalues in the non-hermitian complex scaled Hamiltonian. However, the choice of numerical results to consider as accurate is not straightforward due to the complex nature of the eigenvalues and the use of finite variational expansions. The complex virial theorem and graphical methods are used to determine the best numerical solution.
2. The density of states (DOS) method is another approach for calculating resonance energies and widths. It relies on the possibility of calculating Ritz variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter. The DOS can be expressed as a sum of eigenfunctions and their energies. The maxima of the DOS provide approximate values for the resonance energy and width, which can be scaled to obtain more accurate results. However, the method relies on the availability of a known value of the lifetime and may not converge for small or moderate non-linear parameters.

1. The text discusses the study of nonlinear Schrödinger equations in two-dimensional (2D) plaquettes, which are proposed as building blocks for constructing 2D lattices with parity-time (PT) symmetry. The analysis focuses on stationary modes and their stability against small perturbations. The plaquettes are inspired by earlier works on 2D Hamiltonian lattices and are expected to be accessible with current experimental techniques in nonlinear optics.
2. The text introduces four basic types of plaquettes, three of which are four-site squares and one is a five-site cross. The analysis is restricted to modes that can be found in an analytical form, while their stability is studied numerically. Effects such as termination of branches at critical points of linear symmetric systems, complex degenerate bifurcations, and continuation of branches past critical points due to nonlinearity are identified.
3. The text also discusses the difference between continuous families of solutions in conservative models and isolated attractors in their dissipative counterparts, and the potential existence of isolated solutions versus branches of solutions in PT-symmetric systems. The work may pave the way for further considerations of 2D and 3D PT-symmetric lattice systems.

1. The cataclysmic variable HU Aqr consists of a 0.80 white dwarf that accretes from a 0.18 main-sequence companion star. Irregularities in the observed variations led to the discovery of two planets: a 5.7 planet in a 0.013 orbit with an eccentricity of 0.25, and a 7.6 planet in a wider and more eccentric orbit.
2. The two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year timescale, but some numerical simulations exhibit long-term dynamical stability. The presence of planets around a cataclysmic variable is peculiar, but planets may be a natural consequence of binary formation.
3. The inner planet allows the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and core mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) to be broken, enabling the rate of mass loss during the common-envelope phase to be derived. The outer planet validates this calculation and provides information on the conditions under which the CV was born.
4. The initial binary must have been dynamically stable, which further constrains the masses of the two stars and their orbital separation. During the CV phase, little mass is lost from the binary system, and the current total binary mass was not affected by the past (and current) CV evolution.
5. The observed white dwarf mass provides an upper limit to the mass of the core of the primary star at the moment of RLOF, which in turn provides a minimum to the companion mass. The mass of the companion is not affected by the common envelope phase, allowing the orbital parameters at the moment of RLOF to be calculated.
6. During the common envelope phase, the primary's mantle is blown away beyond the orbit of the planets, causing the planets to migrate to their currently observed orbits. The response of the orbit to mass loss depends on the total amount of mass lost and the rate at which it is lost.
7. The text describes a theoretical exercise to calculate the effect of mass loss on the orbital parameters of the inner and outer planets in the HU Aqr system, using numerical integration and assuming a constant mass-loss rate.

1. The layered organic material AI3, which was first studied in the 1980s, has recently gained renewed interest due to the discovery of low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure.
2. AI3 is different from graphene, the most popular material with low-energy Dirac fermions, in several ways, including the tilt of the Dirac cones, anisotropy in the Fermi surface, smaller average fermi velocity, and the presence of additional massive carriers.
3. The smaller fermi velocity in AI3 leads to a larger effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions, making it an exciting prospect for studying strongly-correlated Dirac fermions beyond the scope of graphene electrons.
4. Recent ab-initio band-structure calculations have identified the presence of massive carriers in the vicinity of the Fermi level in AI3, but the interplay between massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers has not yet been proven experimentally.
5. The authors present magneto-transport measurements of AI3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure larger than 3 GPa, where Dirac carriers are present. They show the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes, and investigate the interplay between both carrier types at low energy.
6. The measured mobilities for the two carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.
7. The analysis of the data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity and is similar to the one presented in ref. for multi-carrier semiconductor systems. The magneto-conductivity is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor by means of a standard formula.
8. The authors find that the carrier density strongly depends on temperature for both carrier types, indicating the absence of charge inhomogeneities that prevent the approach of the Dirac point in graphene on SiO2 substrates. They also present thermopower measurements to corroborate the two-carrier scenario.

2. FEBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides, both having a square lattice of iron as the basic element with orthorhombic distortions in lightly doped materials.
3. The Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe 3d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the M point and two electron sheets around the X and Y points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ), excluding cases of extreme hole and electron dopings.
4. In the 2-Fe BZ, electron pockets are centered at the Γ point. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations with maximal scattering near the wave vector equal to X or Y in the 1-Fe BZ or to Z in the 2-Fe BZ.
5. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetries and structures. The RPA-SF approach gives the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets, while orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have sign-preserving d-wave symmetry.
6. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool to probe the gap structure and elucidate the underlying mechanism. There have been reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems appearing only for Tc or around Tc.

2. Correlated impurities can lead to delocalized states in the spectrum, even in two dimensions where the effect is almost unexplored. The random dimer model (RDM) and its dual version (DRDM) have been used to study the effects of correlated disorder in one dimension.
3. The RDM introduces a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2d lattices, as in one dimension, but the decay of the correlation function is algebraic for the first and exponential for the second.
4. In this work, a 2d extension of the DRDM is studied to understand the localization properties of a bose gas confined on a 2d square lattice. The effective hamiltonian for a single impurity is schematically illustrated in figure 1(d), and it is transparent to the subspace of all sites except the impurity site if the condition ([condition]) is satisfied.
5. The 2d extension of the DRDM provides the same condition ([condition]) independently from the dimensionality of the system, but it is fully 2d and cannot be mapped onto two 1d DRDMs as opposed to a previous reference.
6. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) is used to analyze the localization properties of the model. For extended states, the IPR decreases as a function of the system size, while for localized states, it does not depend on the system size if the size is larger than the localization length.

1. Massive stars play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, but their formation process remains unclear. Observations have revealed keplerian disks around four massive young stellar objects and a Salpeter-like mass function for protostellar dust clumps, suggesting an accretion formation scenario.
2. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared window have provided new insights into the environment surrounding massive protostellar systems. Class II methanol masers exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are associated with deeply embedded, massive, luminous cores.
3. Recent observations with the Gemini North Telescope have uncovered the embedded sources inside three of these cores, revealing multiple point sources at close angular separations. The methanol masers are found closest to the brightest mid-infrared point source, which has sufficient temperature and luminosity to evaporate methanol ice and pump the masing transition.
4. The simple-harmonic model of ballistic motion suggests that sources within the cores could migrate from the edge to the center, but the time required for migration is comparable to the predicted hot molecular core lifetime, making it unclear whether massive stars form in place or migrate in.
5. Monte Carlo simulations show that it is difficult to generate the observed mass distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the core using a standard form of the initial mass function (IMF), suggesting that the mass distribution of the most massive stars cannot be produced by sampling a standard IMF from the reservoir of gas available for star formation.
6. Future high spatial and spectral resolution observations may determine whether the multiple point sources are physically bound, and further studies of a larger sample of young, massive protoclusters are required to draw general conclusions about the formation of massive stars.

Significant progress has been made in this model, particularly with the inclusion of a stellar wind from the WD during accretion.
3. There are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. The accreting WD model predicts which companion stars lead to SNe Ia.
4. The companion star of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) was proposed to have been identified by measuring velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the SNR. However, confirmation of this identification is still needed.
5. A star called S-M star, discovered near a Type Ia SNR 1006, was initially thought to be the companion but was later proven not to be by investigating features of Fe II absorption lines in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum.
6. To identify companion stars of SNe Ia, we propose observing absorption lines in the visible range with Fe I, as most Fe ions in the ejecta are expected to be in the ground state. The amount of Fe I in the ejecta of Tycho's SNR is estimated and spectra of a star located at the center of a SNR are calculated to discuss the potential identification of Fe I absorption lines in the companion star's spectrum.
7. Factors such as the number of ionizing photons emitted from the shocked ejecta and the ionization state of ions in the shocked region may affect the distinct absorption features of the companion star. The uncertainty in the explosion model makes it not conclusive if the companion star of Tycho's SNR will exhibit the unique Fe I absorption features discussed in the paper.

However, the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear when systems interact with their environment and become mixed.
2. Various measures have been proposed to quantify entanglement in mixed states, such as entanglement of formation and entanglement of distillation. These measures satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure and give the value zero for some states, such as the equal mixture of Bell states, which might seem counterintuitive but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state.
3. Quantum trajectory theory can provide insight into the behavior of open quantum systems and help characterize the long-term behavior or find perfect entanglement after a finite time by making measurements on the environment. At resonance, the system may exhibit distinct bimodal behavior, where it either evolves into a maximally entangled bell state without emitting photons or an entangled-state cycle between orthogonal bell states while emitting a continual stream of photons.
4. The choice between the two cycles is random and depends on the number of photon counts occurring at detector 1 over a given interval of time. The same decision mechanism is observed in other examples, and counts at detector 2 are not directly involved but figure indirectly as a mechanism reducing the average number of counts at detector 1. To completely characterize the entanglement of an open system, one must consider the entanglement between all subsystems, not just the subsystems of interest, and the information contained in the environment.

1. The text discusses the differences in infrared emission between Type 1 and Type 2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies.
2. The authors improve the analysis by using host-galaxy subtraction for radio galaxies and clumpy torus models for interpretation.
3. The results show that the average infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Type 1 and Type 2 AGN differ significantly, with Type 1 AGN showing stronger infrared emission than Type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity.
4. The authors find that the silicate feature in the average radio galaxy SED shows absorption while quasars display a weak silicate emission feature, and the silicate absorption feature center is found to be at 9.7μm and the peak of the silicate emission feature at 10.5μm.
5. The authors suggest that the observed anisotropy in the mid-infrared can be explained by a single absorber and emitter (the dust torus) rather than a cold dust screen, and the clumpy torus model reproduces the observed anisotropy reasonably well over most of the wavelength range.

Additionally, the text mentions that the sample comprises all 3CRR radio galaxies and quasars with redshifts less than 0.3, and the data used have been presented previously in various papers. The authors obtained mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy using the Spitzer Space Telescope and performed standard data reduction and averaging of the individual source SEDs into mean sed for each class of objects. They also applied additional corrections to the radio galaxy data to isolate the emission coming from the active nucleus by subtracting the estimated host galaxy contribution. The authors found that the quasars have notably hotter temperatures for the hot dust emission than radio galaxies, and the fraction of host galaxy light contributing to the flux measured at observed frame wavelengths varies for each wavelength. The authors also note that the individual seds and averages showed no polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, indicating that any contribution from star formation to the mid-infrared is probably negligible.

1. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems, such as fiber-based Gaussian-modulated and coherent-state protocols, have achieved significant advancements in theory and experiment. However, the security analysis of these systems has not considered the local oscillator (LO), an auxiliary light beam used for balanced homodyne detection, leaving potential security loopholes.
2. The necessity of monitoring LO intensity for security proofs in discrete QKD protocols has been discussed, and the excess noise caused by imperfect subtraction of balanced homodyne detector (BHD) in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations has been quantified. However, the assumption of constant shot noise scaling with LO power in practical CVQKD systems may give Eve advantages in exploiting LO intensity fluctuations.
3. In this paper, the authors describe an attacking scheme exploiting LO intensity fluctuations and analyze its impact on the secret key rate for a practical CVQKD system with homodyne protocol. They find that if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values, Eve could compromise the secret keys severely.
4. The authors also discuss the accurate monitoring of LO intensity to confirm the security of practical CVQKD systems and find that even with monitoring, the effects of LO intensity fluctuations on the secret key rate are not yet fully understood. They suggest that future research should focus on developing methods for accurately monitoring LO intensity and quantifying its impact on the secret key rate.

2. The text describes two main classes of explanations for the formation of HI supershells: internal and external sources. The internal source model involves starbursts, stellar winds, and subsequent supernova explosions. The external source model suggests infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane.
3. The text presents evidence for and against the starburst model for HI supershells, including the energy requirements for the largest shells and the lack of optical evidence for recent star formation in some lower energy HI holes.
4. The text introduces the chimney model, which suggests that stellar winds and supernovae are responsible for the HI supershells if they are found to correlate with other halo gas.
5. The text discusses the difficulties with the starburst model for HI supershells, including the required input energies for the largest shells and the lack of evidence for star formation processes creating the shells.

1. The first color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of the dwarf spheroidal (dsph) companions of the Milky Way, including Draco, showed features similar to those of globular clusters and led to the interpretation that dsph galaxies are pure population II systems.
2. However, differences in the stellar populations of dsph galaxies, such as extreme red horizontal branches and distinct variable stars, were later recognized to be due to the presence of an intermediate-age population.
3. The intermediate-age population has been observed in the CMDs of several dsph galaxies, including Carina, Fornax, Leo I, and Leo IV.
4. Leo I is a peculiar dsph galaxy with unique characteristics, such as a large galactocentric radial velocity and a lack of a conspicuous old population, suggesting that its first substantial amount of star formation may have been delayed.
5. The new HST observations presented in this paper provide deeper and more accurate data for studying the stellar populations and metallicity of Leo I.
6. The CMD of Leo I shows a well-defined red clump and a broad range of ages, indicating that star formation in Leo I has extended over a long period.
7. The absence of a prominent horizontal branch in Leo I suggests that the fraction of very old stars is small, and the presence of bright yellow stars in the CMD may indicate the presence of classical cepheids in the lower extreme of mass, luminosity, and period.
8. The width of the Leo I rgb can be accounted for by the dispersion of the age of its stellar population, implying that the metallicity dispersion could be negligible.
9. The star formation in Leo I appears to have proceeded continuously, with possible intensity variations over time, but no big time gaps between successive bursts.
10. Further observations and analysis are needed to address remaining questions about Leo I, such as the existence of a very old stellar population, variations of the star formation across the galaxy, and the presence or absence of a horizontal branch in the outer parts.

1. The text discusses a result from Berestycki et al. about the principal eigenvalue of the Laplacian perturbed by a divergence-free drift in dimensions 10.
2. Let @xmath11 be a bounded regular open set and let @xmath13 be a bounded vector field that satisfies certain conditions. The theorem asserts that the principal eigenvalue remains bounded as @xmath9 increases if and only if there exists a first integral @xmath20 of the flow @xmath6 that satisfies certain conditions.
3. Intuitively, functions satisfying these conditions are constant along the flow of the vector field, and the existence of non-trivial first integrals allows for flow lines that are contained in @xmath2.
4. The result has been extended and applied to various problems describing the influence of a fluid flow on a diffusion.
5. The purpose of the paper is to verify that a similar property holds when the classical Laplacian is replaced by the fractional Laplacian with @xmath28.
6. The main difficulty is the roughness and non-locality of the quadratic forms, which prevent a direct application of differential calculus.
7. The authors use conditioning suggested by Bogdan and Dyda, approximation techniques for flows given by Diperna and Lions, and properties of the green function and heat kernel of gradient perturbations of the fractional Laplacian obtained by Bogdan, Jakubowski, and Chen et al.
8. The main result states that if @xmath35 is a bounded domain with a regular boundary that is simply connected, and @xmath28 is of zero divergence, then the principal eigenvalue and infimum are attained.

1. Inferring macroscopic properties of physical systems from their microscopic description is a significant challenge in various fields of physics, including condensed matter, ultra cold atoms, and quantum chromo dynamics.
2. Phase transitions, which often involve symmetry breaking processes, result in the most drastic changes in macroscopic properties. Landau formulated a phenomenological model for phase transitions, which was later derived from microscopic principles using the renormalization group.
3. Identifying phases requires knowledge of an order parameter, which is zero in the disordered phase and nonzero in the ordered phase. While many models have order parameters that can be determined by symmetry considerations of the underlying Hamiltonian, some systems, such as topological states, require more complicated methods.
4. Machine learning techniques, particularly unsupervised learning algorithms, have emerged as promising methods for identifying parameters capable of describing phase transitions in such systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) are two such methods.
5. PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system, sorted by their variance. It is widely used in physics, but it has limitations, such as the inability to handle nonlinear data and the lack of interpretability of the results.
6. VAEs are a modern version of autoencoders that impose additional constraints on the encoded representations, transforming them into an algorithm that learns a latent variable model for its input data. They have shown promising results in encoding and reconstructing data in various fields, including computer vision.
7. In this work, the authors use unsupervised learning to determine phase transitions in the Ising model without any information about the microscopic theory or the order parameter. They transition from PCA to VAEs and test the latter's ability to handle different physical models.
8. The authors find that VAEs are able to find a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system that coincides with the correct order parameter. The decoder network reconstructs the encoded configuration from its latent representation, and the reconstruction is more accurate in the ordered phase, suggesting the use of the reconstruction error as a universal identifier for phase transitions.

1. The main laws of quantum mechanics prevent perfect cloning of quantum states, but approximate copying is possible using quantum cloning machines (QCM).
2. QCMs can produce identical or nonidentical copies, with varying quality and dependence on the initial state.
3. One application of QCM is eavesdropping on quantum channels, with the goal of copying specific parts of the transmitted quantum information.
4. This paper discusses ""partial"" QCMs, which copy one constituent of two-partite states, allowing consideration of mixed states.
5. Any mixed state can be considered as a reduction of a pure state, making cloning of mixed states a form of ""partial"" cloning of the corresponding purification.
6. To construct a QCM, we need a tensor product of three qubit spaces, with the first and third components carrying information and the second as a blank state for copying.
7. The goal is to produce a state in the second component that is symmetric with the first, and the QCM is defined by a unitary operator that maps the initial state to this symmetric state.
8. The choice of the unitary operator is broad, but certain conditions ensure its unitarity and the production of a specific state.
9. The quality of the cloning is measured by the fidelity between the initial and produced states, which is state-dependent and can be calculated using the Bloch sphere representation of the density matrix.

2. The inventory of observable baryons falls short of the total inferred from cosmic microwave background fluctuations, leaving room for a significant baryonic component of dark matter.
3. The cold dark matter model is successful in describing large-scale structure growth, but a direct detection of any candidate dark matter particles is still lacking.
4. Some authors propose models featuring dense gas clouds as a major component of dark matter due to their high column densities and potential gamma-ray emission.
5. The gamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray interactions within dense gas clouds can yield a diffuse flux comparable to known sources, making these models testable with high-quality data.
6. Previous investigations have neglected self-shielding and cascade phenomena, which can significantly alter the emergent gamma-ray spectrum.
7. Our calculations using Geant4 show substantial differences between high and low column-density clouds, with implications for interpreting observed galactic gamma-ray emission.
8. The results depend primarily on the column density and fractional contribution of individual clouds to the galaxy's dark matter halo.
9. The gamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds can potentially account for many unidentified discrete sources detected by EGRET.

1. The text discusses the study of colloidal crystals, which exhibit iridescent colors and can be used to produce photonic crystals. Colloidal crystals have well-defined thermodynamic temperatures and can be viewed as mesoscopic model atoms. Recent advances allow for the tuning of colloid-colloid interactions, leading to exotic crystal structures and direct observation of phase transitions.
2. The study focuses on a model system of charged colloids in a rotating electric field, where electrostatic repulsions and dipolar attractions are considered. The electrostatic repulsions are described using a hard core Yukawa potential, while the dipolar attractions are treated as a first-order dipolar interaction. The renormalized charge of the colloids is calculated using the Clausius-Mosotti factor and the effective potential at contact is determined.
3. The experimental methodology involves the use of anionic sulphate stabilized polystyrene latex particles, which are synthesized using a standard technique or purchased from a supplier. Particle sizes are determined using scanning electron microscopy and particle electrophoretic mobility is measured using a Brookhaven Zetaplus light scattering instrument. The system is treated as a 2D system, and the lattice parameter is taken as the average of typically ten crystalline rafts, measured across the raft, of around ten lattice spacings. The response to changing electric field strength is determined to be less than 100 ms, and the lattice constant is taken as the pair correlation function and the minimum between the first and second peaks of the pair correlation function. Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the system and the lattice constant is found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

1. Aql X-1 is the most active soft X-ray transient (SXT) known, with more than 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts detected. Its companion star is identified as the K1v variable star V1333 Aql, with an orbital period of 19 hours. The outbursts of Aql X-1 are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with a sharp flux decrease leading to the quiescent state.
2. During the decay phase, the X-ray spectrum is soft and dominated by a black body component, while in quiescence, the spectrum is much softer and consistent with a black body temperature of 0.42-0.45 keV. The sharp flux decay is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts but differs in terms of X-ray luminosities and spectra.
3. The outburst evolution of SXTs hosting an old neutron star or a black hole is built in analogy with dwarf novae outbursts. However, the steepening in the X-ray flux decrease of Aql X-1 has no clear parallel in low mass X-ray transients containing black hole candidates. The best-sampled light curves of these sources show an exponential-like decay with no indication of a sudden steepening.
4. The discovery of a nearly coherent modulation at 1.1 Hz (1.1 ms) during a type I X-ray burst and a single QPO peak at two different flux levels suggests that accretion onto the neutron star surface may take place even in the quiescent state. However, the low magnetic field required to explain the observed luminosity ratio raises serious difficulties for the interpretation of Aql X-1 and LMXBs with kHz QPOS as progenitors of recycled millisecond pulsars. The most appealing mechanism for the marked steepening in the outburst decay is a transition to the propeller regime, where most of the inflowing matter is stopped at the magnetospheric boundary.

2. An optical transient had been observed in 2004 near the position of SN 2006jc, which was as faint and short-lived as a luminous blue variable (LBV)-like event. The spatial coincidence between the LBV-like event and SN 2006jc was confirmed by @xcite.

4. Spectroscopic observations showed many broad features and strong narrow emission lines, and SN 2006jc was classified as type Ib. However, strange spectral features and their evolutions were reported.
5. A bright blue continuum was prominent in the optical spectrum at early epochs, which had also been observed in type II SN 1988z. The origin of this feature is still unclear.
6. As the blue continuum declined, the red wing brightened, and the optical spectra showed ""u""-like shapes, which is a distinguishing feature of SN 2006jc.

The authors find that while GRS 1915+105 is known for its extreme variability and high spin, IGR J170913624 exhibits similar variability patterns but with a much lower luminosity. They suggest that the low luminosity is due to a low or negative spin of the black hole in IGR J170913624.

They find that the best-fit value of the disk normalization suggests a lower limit on the inclination angle of 76.3 degrees and a minimum inclination angle of 53.3 degrees. They also exclude the possibility of a high spin for the black hole in IGR J170913624 based on the data. The authors suggest that the low luminosity of IGR J170913624 may be due to its low or negative spin, in contrast to the high spin of GRS 1915+105.

3. A new detection method for reading out the qubit state has been proposed, based on a doublet blockade effect that manifests itself in currents for a special configuration of local potential gates.
4. The doublet blockade is related to an asymmetry of tunnel rates from source and drain electrodes to the tQD and the inter-channel Coulomb blockade.

2. The 1984-1986 event was marked by two maxima in the visual magnitude, leading to ambiguous interpretation as a double or disturbed single outburst.
3. Sokolowski et al. (2006) suggested that outbursts sometimes come in pairs or series with decreasing maximum brightness and different shapes, separated by periods slightly shorter than the orbital one.
4. The main characteristics of the 1984-1986 event include two maxima, a drop in white dwarf (WD) radiation flux, and ejection of shells during each outburst.
5. The stellar wind of the cool giant has a velocity of 25 km/s, and varying the wind velocity changes the accretion regime and hydrogen burning rate.
6. An optical thick wind forms from the WD, revealed by UV and optical spectra during the 2000-2002 outburst. Shocks from WD and red giant (RG) wind collision increase the luminosity of the system.
7. Collision of winds leads to two shock fronts between the stars, with the strong one propagating in reverse towards the WD and the weakest one propagating towards the RG.
8. The nebula downstream of the reverse shock is heated and ionized by both the shock and photoionization flux from the hot star.
9. The ionization parameter drops by more than two orders of magnitude after June 1985, accompanied by the simultaneous variation of dynamical parameters and magnetic field, suggesting the shock front has suddenly shifted farther from the WD.
10. The whole picture is most likely explained by an unexpected disturbing episode such as the ejection of a new shell from the RG atmosphere and its collision with the WD wind at a relatively large distance from the WD.

1. Swcnt networks, which are two-dimensional networks of conducting one-dimensional rods, exhibit interesting electrical properties due to their large length-to-diameter ratio. The networks can be viewed as systems with randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport, and their resistance shows percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence for sub-monolayer networks.
2. For swcnt networks with thickness in the tens of nanometers, the conductance through metallic tubes dominates the conduction, leading to metallic behavior of the overall resistance. The frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity have been investigated for individual swcnts and some types of swcnt networks.
3. In this study, the frequency- and electric-field-dependent conductivity for swcnt networks with systematically varying densities was investigated. The results showed that the onset frequency extracted from the frequency dependence measurement increases with the film thickness, while the length scale extracted from the electric field dependent measurement decreases at the same time. An empirical relation was developed between the two transport measurement methods.
4. Swcnt networks on pet substrate were prepared by the spraying method and characterized by their sheet conductance rather than conductivity due to the inhomogeneous nature of the conducting pathways. The conductance vs. frequency data fit well to the extended pair approximation model, and the onset frequency changes with the sheet conductance in a linear relationship. The electric field-dependent conductance was also measured for ultra-thin sub-monolayer nanotube networks, and the results showed a universal relationship between onset frequency and dc conductance.

2. The conduction band (CB) electrons can have various effects on the XPS peak from the core level, with the screening of the core hole leading to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy if the excitation is adiabatic.
3. However, the excitation is not adiabatic, and the CB electrons are left in a nonequilibrium state, resulting in shake-up effects that show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum.
4. The main peak corresponds to the system left in quasi-equilibrium, while the replicas represent states where one, two, or more plasmons are excited.
5. The plasmon curve shows dispersion, and the replicas are not identical smaller versions of the main peak due to the different energies of the plasmons.
6. In addition to plasmon excitations, single-particle excitations (electron-hole pair excitations) also contribute to the tail and deform both the main peak and the plasmon replicas.
7. Several parameters were introduced by Doniach and Sunji to characterize XPS line shapes, but they are not feasible for graphene due to its unique 2D character and the absence of a well-defined Fermi surface.
8. In this work, the authors address pristine and doped graphene, focusing on the derivation and comparison of the core-hole spectra for a 2D system.
9. The results show that pristine graphene exhibits a low-energy tailing, despite not being a metal, and the tailing increases with doping for doping concentrations exceeding a certain value. The peak shape changes with further increase of the doping concentration, offering a complementary way to estimate the degree of doping of a sample.

1. The text discusses a two-genotype system in a population evolving under the Moran process, considering nonlinear fitness functions and asymmetric mutation probabilities.
2. The Moran process is a well-established model for understanding selection, mutation, and genetic drift in evolutionary dynamics.
3. The text argues that mutation probabilities need not be symmetric and that interaction effects cannot always be described by linear functions.
4. The authors derive the Fokker-Planck equation for the dynamics of the number of individuals of genotype 1 in the limit of large population sizes.
5. They find that the difference between simulation data and the theoretical solution becomes almost undetectable for population sizes larger than a certain value.
6. The text notes that the Fokker-Planck method is not suitable for studying quasi-stationary distributions in systems with absorbing states.
7. The authors find that asymmetries in mutation probabilities can lead to the shifting of existing stable points and the emergence of new stable points.
8. They show an example of a system with three stable points, two caused by selection and one by genetic drift.
9. The authors conclude that frequency-dependent fitness and asymmetric mutation rates can lead to complex evolutionary dynamics, particularly when interactions imply nonlinear fitness functions.

1. The phase-field method is a popular approach for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity and ability to describe geometry in terms of phase fields.
2. The method uses partial differential equations for phase fields that can be easily coded using standard numerical methods. The foundations and applications of the phase-field method to solidification have been extensively studied.
3. This paper discusses open questions where robust phase-field modelling tools are not yet available, including the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models, orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification, and the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in phase-field equations.
4. The thin-interface limit analysis shows that currently available approaches cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness.
5. Orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification have a standard equation of motion that is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
6. The inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in phase-field equations cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
7. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been significantly enhanced in the last decade by controlling their properties.
8. Phase-field models are based on the mean-field description of spatially diffuse interfaces but need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of physical solid-liquid interfaces and typical microstructure scales.
9. The use of the thin-interface limit procedure helps guarantee precise simulations by eliminating effects due to the diffuseness of the interface.

1. The text discusses the importance of determining accurate stellar parameters, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, for studying the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group. Spectroscopic methods are used to infer the characteristics of different stellar populations, with the most reliable method being the balmer line method. However, the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in spectroscopic analyses has been shown to have systematic biases, particularly for low-metallicity and/or low-surface gravity stars.
2. The authors present a new method to derive accurate atmospheric parameters for FGK stars using the RAVE survey sample. They utilize the balmer line method for effective temperature estimation and apply on-the-fly non-LTE (NLTE) corrections to Fe lines using the grid described in [xcite]. They verify their method using a sample of standard stars and find significant systematic biases when comparing to standard 1D, LTE techniques. NLTE effects in iron are most prominent in low-metallicity stars, and the authors choose a metal-poor sample from the RAVE survey for their study. The initial LTE-FE stellar parameters for their sample stars are listed in the text, with typical internal errors of 0.1 dex in temperature and 0.05 dex in metallicity. However, these errors are not representative of the actual accuracy of stellar parameter estimates, and the authors show that estimates of effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity can be significantly lower than other, more accurate data for metal-poor stars.

1. Weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structures has been detected in various high redshift quasars, intermediate redshift galaxies, and BATSE gamma-ray bursts. The effect is manifested as angular correlations between sources and foreground inhomogeneously distributed mass.
2. The coherent shear effect is used to detect weak lensing in galaxies. A more direct way to detect weak lensing is by using fluxes of standard candles, such as Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), and observing how their magnitudes are affected by the lensing effect.
3. The analysis presented in the text uses the largest homogeneous compilation of SN Ia, which contains 74 sources, and uses four different light curve fitting methods to estimate their distances. The final distance is the median of the estimates, and the uncertainty is the median of the error of the contributing methods.
4. The analysis yields values of the global cosmological parameters, assuming a flat model, with H0 = 62.2 km/s/Mpc and Omega\_m = 0.317. The authors use apm galaxies as tracers of foreground mass density, which provide near full coverage of the sky in the northern and southern hemispheres.
5. The analysis finds that the observed fluxes of the cosmologically distant SN Ia have suffered from lensing-induced amplifications, with brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess and fainter ones having mass deficits in their foregrounds. The results are consistent with weak gravitational lensing and are significant at the 99.8% confidence level.

Additionally, the text discusses the potential impact of nuisance effects such as evolution, variations in individual SN Ia, and gray dust extinction, which have been studied theoretically and observationally and have either been corrected for or shown to be small. The authors also explore the dependence of the results on the choice of the optimal lens redshift and the use of different lens samples. The analysis is significant for understanding the distribution of mass in the universe and for determining the global geometry of the universe.",1

1. Lanthanide-based heavy fermion (hf) metals exhibit distinct physical properties due to strong spin-flip scattering from localized 3-levels, leading to large effective masses and low-energy scales.
2. The low-temperature state is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened spins, which crosses over to essentially incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering.
3. Physical properties of hf metals are typically anomalous, with non-monotonic temperature-dependence of resistivity and rich optical structure from the microwave to the near infrared, evolving on low temperature scales.
4. Theoretical treatments of hf focus on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.
5. The absence of exact results has led to the search for suitable approximation schemes, with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) being a major recent impact.
6. DMFT is formally exact in the large-dimensional limit, but requires a method to solve the PAM, which DMFT does not provide directly.
7. The LMA approach, which we employ here, is a non-perturbative theory that introduces the notion of local moments from the outset, leading to a two-self-energy description.
8. The LMA has been extended to handle the generic asymmetric PAM and hence hf metals, providing a description of transport and optical properties of kondo insulators, and making direct quantitative comparison with experiment.
9. Results include the thermal evolution of single-particle dynamics and scattering rates, DC resistivity, and optical conductivities on all relevant scales.

1. The text discusses the effects of static and fluctuating tension on semiflexible polymer looping. The looping time dramatically changes as tension varies, with short chains exhibiting exponential increases in looping time with tension. The mean first-passage time (mfpt) model using the mean-field wormlike chain (mf-wlc) provides a useful analytical framework for understanding these effects.
2. The text also explores the impact of dichotomic tension, which fluctuates between two levels of force with a mean flipping time, on the looping time. The looping time shows a minimum at an optimal flipping time, and the probability of the dichotomic tension being negative at the instant of looping has a maximum near the mean flipping time.
3. The study finds that the minimum looping time occurs when the flipping time is comparable to the diffusion time of a Brownian particle in the free energy landscape, which is an extension of the resonant activation (RA) phenomenon. The longer the chain, the more susceptible it is to tension and the lower its relative looping time.
4. The results of the study are consistent with recent experiments for both static and fluctuating tension cases. The study suggests that a biopolymer can self-organize optimally utilizing ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations and calls for further experiments using dichotomically fluctuating tension with various tension amplitudes to establish the RA phenomena in polymer loop formation. The study also observes small differences between looping times with and without hydrodynamic interaction as the chain gets shorter.

3. The authors consider three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses, and investigate the evolution of their overlap integrals and the change in the planet's orbital period with time.
4. The star of one solar mass, which closely corresponds to our sun, has a radiative core and a convective envelope on the main sequence.
5. The other two stars have a more complex structure, with a convective core and a radiative envelope.
6. The problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star-planet system.
7. The low-frequency g-modes of the stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides.
8. The tidal interactions are most intense at small periastron distances of the planet, and the dimensionless excitation frequency corresponds to g-modes.
9. The authors apply the results of this study to some hot Jupiter systems, such as the system YBP1194, where a planet with a short orbital period revolves around a solar twin star.

4. Speckle patterns result from the superposition of multiple fields arising from different scattering sequences in the medium.
5. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is a technique to measure distances between fluorescent markers, but it is limited to specific ranges and is not effective in scattering media.
6. The proposed method in this paper captures the interaction between two identical sources in a scattering environment using intensity fluctuations.
7. The method is based on the analysis of the intensity-intensity correlation function and the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources.
8. This approach permits monitoring the relative distance between the sources in the range 10-500 nm, with a precision not limited by diffraction but by the microstructure of the scattering medium.
9. Multiple scattering, which was previously considered a nuisance, can actually enhance the performance of sensing, imaging, and communication techniques.

1. The text discusses a theoretical framework for understanding the inelastic nonlinear mechanical behavior of sticky biopolymer networks using the glassy wormlike chain (GWLC) model. The model goes beyond the equilibrium statistical fluctuations captured by the original GWLC model by allowing for a dynamically evolving thermodynamic state variable characterizing the network of thermo-reversible sticky bonds.
2. The theory predicts a pronounced fluidization response, which develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers. After cessation of loading, the system slowly recovers its initial state. These observations are in qualitative agreement with recently published experimental results obtained for living cells.
3. The yield force for the onset of fluidization is sensitive to the deformation rate, and the fluidization response is accompanied by a cyclic softening or shake-down effect. Taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of biopolymer solutions by a distribution of entanglement lengths leads to a smoothing of the force-displacement curves without affecting their qualitative characteristics.

1. The text discusses the study of topological mott insulators (TMIs) in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. The authors found that the long-period charge density wave (CDW) state is more stable than the previously estimated CDW with smaller unit cells. To stabilize the TMI, the fermi velocity at the dirac point needs to be suppressed, which is achieved by introducing third neighbor hopping in the honeycomb lattice.
2. The authors also examined the effect of on-site coulomb repulsion on the TMI stability using the many-variable Monte Carlo (MVMCC) method. They found that increasing the on-site coulomb repulsion decreases the TMI order parameter but does not destroy its stability. It also suppresses the emergence of the CDW.
3. The study also proposes possible routes towards the realization of TMIs in real materials, such as twisted bilayer graphene, by suppressing the fermi velocities and screening the coulomb repulsions using dielectric substrates and adatoms. The estimated single-particle excitation gap induced by the TMI is crucial for its applications as a spintronics platform and is found to be substantially larger than room temperatures.

The realization of a gate-induced band gap in Bernal stacked bi-layer graphene brought the dream of a graphene-based transistor closer to reality.
2. However, the sub-gap conductance measured by the researchers had a weak temperature dependence and was larger than the optically measured gap, which introduced a new puzzle and obstacle. The gapped bilayer was not as insulating as it should be.
3. The dominant transport along the physical edge of the samples proposed earlier was ruled out by Corbino geometry measurements, which observed two-dimensional variable range hopping type temperature dependence, independent of geometry.
4. The researchers predicted the existence of a topological gapless channel of transport along recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary networks, which solved the puzzle and held the promise of the first realization of topological surface (edge) states hosted by structural topological defects.
5. No such topological gapless mode has been observed so far, but the tilt boundaries have recently been observed and can host gapless modes of topological origin, forming the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states.

The article also introduces new vacuum diquark condensates to parameterize the nonperturbative QCD vacuum and performs the standard procedure of the QCD sum rules to study the nonet scalar mesons below the energy.
2. The article presents numerical results and discussions based on the new QCD sum rules, taking the isospin limit for the quarks and denoting the fields as scalar diquark fields. The article also discusses the structures of pseudoscalar mesons and scalar diquarks using the coupled rainbow Schwinger-Dyson equation and ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation, and observes that the dominant Dirac spinor structure of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes of the scalar diquarks is proportional to the dimension-3 scalar two-quark currents. The article also mentions the attractive interaction of one-gluon exchange favoring the formation of diquarks in color antitriplet, flavor antitriplet, and spin singlet quark-quark channels, and the strong attraction in the scalar diquark channels favoring the formation of good diquarks, while the weaker attraction in the axial-vector diquark channels may form bad diquarks. The article also mentions the studies based on lattice QCD and the random instanton liquid model indicating that the quark-quark interactions are weakly repulsive in the vector and axial-vector channels, strongly repulsive in the pseudoscalar channel, and strongly attractive in the scalar and tensor channels, making it sensible to use scalar diquark fields to construct tetraquark currents.

1. The Kauffman model is a disordered dynamical system proposed by Kauffman in 1969 to model genetic regulatory systems. It attracted interest in the 1980s due to its analogy with disordered systems in statistical mechanics. The model consists of elements with binary variables representing their states, and each element is controlled by other elements and responds to their signals through a response function. The control elements and response functions are chosen randomly, and the system exhibits a dynamical phase transition.
2. The paper introduces the concept of relevant elements, which are subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules. The modular organization of random boolean networks was already suggested by Kauffman and used to study attractors analytically. The study describes how to describe the phase transition in terms of the scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size or a percolation transition in the set of relevant elements. The approach allows for the derivation of consequences about the statistical properties of attractors. The annealed approximation, which was previously used to compute attractor properties, is shown to be reliable only in chaotic enough systems, and the study proposes a new approximation scheme that works better in the frozen phase and on the critical line.

1. Turbulence in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) exhibits both velocity and spin fields, leading to novel turbulence called spin-superflow turbulence (SST). The velocity and spin fields interact, resulting in a Kolmogorov spectrum for the superflow kinetic energy and a different power law for the spin-dependent interaction energy.
2. The Kolmogorov spectrum, a power law in the kinetic energy spectrum, is significant for understanding turbulence in SST. It is related to vortex dynamics and is sustained when the spin and velocity fields are much disturbed.
3. The numerical calculation of SST shows that the superflow kinetic energy and spin-dependent interaction energy exhibit the Kolmogorov spectrum and a different power law, respectively. The results confirm the importance of the nonlinear spin term in generating the Kolmogorov spectrum in SST.
4. The dependence of the spectra on the relative velocity @xmath112 shows that the period sustaining the Kolmogorov spectrum in the superflow kinetic energy becomes shorter when the total density is easily fluctuated or when the most unstable wave number is high. In contrast, the inverse energy cascade may occur in the spin-dependent interaction energy due to the ferromagnetic interaction, but the direction of energy cascade is not yet fully understood.

2. The accretion is often explained by the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model, which predicts a ""submillimetre bump"" in the spectral energy distribution (SED), while the standard disc is responsible for a ""big-blue bump"" in the SED of luminous AGNs.
3. The first imaging investigations for accretion discs must be promising with future very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) instruments due to the high brightness temperature expected from the ADAF model.
4. However, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands, indicating the presence of additional unknown emission.
5. Millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs are reported in the present paper to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF.
6. High-frequency observations are promising to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF because they are less affected by non-thermal jets and predict larger flux densities at higher frequencies.
7. The present paper reports millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for 20 out of 25 all-known LLAGN radio sources that have been detected with VLBI, making it a moderately good distance-limited and radio-flux-limited sample for LLAGNs with a compact radio core.

2. Studies of these processes have provided insights into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains, and it is important to disentangle the effects of intervening dust from various astronomical observations.
3. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and the normalized dust extinction law (or reddening law) quantifies the extinction as the sum of absorption and scattering.
4. The ratio of total to selective extinction, Rv, is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law, and studies along many different galactic sight lines have found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and the slope Rv.
5. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with an average Rv of 3.1, but significant deviations from this canonical value and corresponding differences in the overall shape of the extinction/reddening law exist for various interstellar dust clouds.
6. The variations in Rv appear to be generally correlated with environment, with more diffuse, high-latitude cirrus clouds having smaller Rv values and dense molecular clouds having larger Rv values.
7. The study proposes three methods for measuring the Rv of dust in the foreground of differentially-reddened globular clusters using accurate three-band optical photometry and a map of the dust thermal emission. The methods are based on the premise that the width of the blue horizontal branch (HB) is minimized when the appropriate Rv value is used to correct the photometry for extinction and reddening.

1. The text discusses the results of a study on heavy-fermion systems using the Kondo lattice model (KLM) and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) method. The study investigates the magnetic phase diagram and the evolution of the single-particle spectral function as a function of doping and coupling.
2. The study finds that the KLM exhibits a topology change of the fermi surface within the magnetically ordered phase, which can be understood through a mean-field model. The transition from a large to a small fermi surface is continuous and is associated with an enhanced effective mass on both sides of the transition.
3. The study also finds that the KLM does not show kondo breakdown throughout the phase diagram, even in the antiferromagnetic ordered state where the staggered magnetization takes large values. The absence of kondo breakdown is confirmed by the single-particle spectral function, which always shows a feature reminiscent of the heavy-fermion band.
4. The study concludes that the DCA+QMC approach provides a very good approximation of the underlying physics, allowing for the investigation of spectral functions across magnetic transitions and in magnetically ordered phases. The approach is particularly useful for studying systems away from particle-hole symmetry, where exact lattice QMC simulations fail due to the negative sign problem.

Explanation:
The text summarizes the results of a study on heavy-fermion systems using the Kondo lattice model (KLM) and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) method. The study investigates the magnetic phase diagram and the evolution of the single-particle spectral function as a function of doping and coupling. The main findings of the study are:

1. The study finds that the KLM exhibits a topology change of the fermi surface within the magnetically ordered phase, which can be understood through a mean-field model. The transition from a large to a small fermi surface is continuous and is associated with an enhanced effective mass on both sides of the transition.
2. The study also finds that the KLM does not show kondo breakdown throughout the phase diagram, even in the antiferromagnetic ordered state where the staggered magnetization takes large values. The absence of kondo breakdown is confirmed by the single-particle spectral function, which always shows a feature reminiscent of the heavy-fermion band",1

1. The discovery of a resonance at 125 GeV compatible with the expectations for the Higgs particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles.
2. This discovery should also affect the subfield of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
3. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature may be beneficial for having the Higgs responsible for inflation and as a suppression mechanism for the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields.
4. Upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons from LHC experiments have been discussed, as well as bounds obtained by considering strong-gravity astrophysical objects like active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and primordial black holes.
5. The presence of strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore the mass of fundamental particles, such as the electron.
6. Nucleons, however, should be minimally affected by strong curvature since most of their mass arises from gluonic fields that are not coupled to the Higgs field at tree level.
7. Peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions and strongly suppressed for molecular transitions, due to the vanishing of the Ricci scalar for spherically symmetric objects.
8. The Kreschmann invariant, a non-null curvature invariant, plays an important role in quadratic theories of gravity and modified theories of gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models of gravity.
9. White dwarfs, which have had a prominent role in fundamental physics since the early 20th century, can be used to obtain limits on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant by means of spectroscopic observations.

1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into distinct phases: hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium. Star formation is restricted to cold, dense gas, with a star formation rate strongly correlated with the molecular gas content. The link between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution relies on understanding the pathways and conditions for cold, molecular gas development. The gas temperature sets the size and mass of prestellar cores in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity far below its mean.
2. The atomic-to-molecular transition in the ISM, occurring in photodissociation regions (PDRs), has been studied extensively. The outer, unshielded layers of a PDR are composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon, while deeper layers are dominated by the presence of deep-penetrating cosmic rays and the freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains. Simulations of the atomic-to-molecular transition within large-scale, three-dimensional simulations have received less attention. Some studies have attempted to simulate the conversion of the atomic ISM to molecular form, but have neglected self-gravity and supernova feedback or relied on untested approximations for radiative transfer. The goal is to perform a detailed study on the chemical state of gas in a self-consistently simulated ISM, focusing on accurately computing the molecular content with a rigorous treatment of the generation and attenuation of photodissociating far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation.

The text discusses the discovery of an overdensity of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the same color as the red clump of core he-burning stars but extending 10.9 mag brighter. This feature, labeled the vertical extension of the red clump (VRC), has been interpreted as an intervening population of stars or tidal debris. However, the authors argue against this interpretation and suggest that the feature is likely due to stellar evolution, specifically the blue loops experienced by intermediate-mass core he-burning stars. They provide evidence from observations and theoretical models to support their conclusion. For example, they find that the VRC is present in all their LMC fields, has a constant relative position to the red clump, and agrees with the time-averaged locus of the blue loops. They also find that the spatial coincidence of the red and asymptotic giant branches with the supra-clump seen in the composite cmd of the macho database suggests that this second substructure may be associated with giant evolution. The authors conclude that the VRC is due to younger clump stars with ages between 300 myr and 1 gyr.",0

1. The text discusses a study using data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to investigate star formation in 69 local galaxy clusters. The study aims to understand how star formation depends on cluster mass and location within a cluster.
2. The authors find that the fraction of star-forming galaxies and the mean specific star formation rate (mssfr) of cluster galaxies increase with projected distance from the cluster center. However, the fraction of star-forming galaxies remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.
3. One possible explanation for the suppressed demi-lirg fraction at 3 is that even galaxies that reside significantly beyond the virial radius have already been quenched in their previous environments, such as small groups or filaments. The authors also investigate the impact of cluster mass on star formation by presenting the total cluster star formation rate normalized by the cluster mass as a function of mass.
4. The study finds no evidence of a correlation between the cluster specific star formation rate and cluster mass. The authors suggest that cluster mechanisms which scale with cluster mass, such as ram pressure or harassment, are not likely to play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in local clusters.

The BPP states that every bounded linear functional can be approximated by norm-attaining functionals, while the SBPP requires that the functional almost attaining its norm at some point is the same one that attains its norm at a new vector close to it.

1. The text discusses the importance of accurately modeling two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) events in neutrino oscillation experiments, specifically in the context of charge-changing quasielastic cross sections. The text highlights the need for good control over intermediate energy neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections and the growing interest in incorporating 2p-2h models into Monte Carlo event generators. The only 2p-2h model currently implemented in some generators is the ICF-Valencia model, with plans to incorporate the Lyon model and effective transverse enhancement model. However, the high computational time required for these models is a challenge.
2. To address the computational challenge, the text introduces the frozen nucleon approximation, which reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 to 1. This approximation assumes that the momenta of the initial nucleons can be neglected for high enough momentum transfer, and it works well for all diagrams except for the forward diagram, which shows a sharp maximum for kinematics around the pion emission peak. The text validates the frozen nucleon approximation by comparing the shapes of the response functions evaluated in the frozen approximation with the exact results, and adjusting the parameters to obtain the best approximation. The effective frozen parameters are given by equations ([averaged\_denom]) and are considered tunable parameters depending on the momentum transfer. The text also discusses the physical interpretation of the frozen approximation and its implications for the inclusive responses for two-particle emission.

1. The text describes the optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of a new low luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), h 0507 + 164, using a reverberation mapping campaign that lasted for about a month. The authors obtained the broad line region (BLR) radius and estimated the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the source. The observations were carried out at the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) using a CCD, Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (HFOS), and a grism. The spectra were reduced using standard procedures and inter-calibrated relative to the spectra of one night, assuming the flux of the narrow line [O III] 5007 Å is constant. The r-band images were also obtained with the HFOS, but some observations were contaminated by the light of an extremely bright star near the source, resulting in limited r-band photometry coverage.

2. The authors obtained the continuum and hα fluxes for the source and obtained the lightcurves using the final inter-calibrated spectra. The continuum and hα fluxes were observed to vary, while the [O III] 5007 Å line was nearly constant. The time lag between the continuum and hα variations was determined by cross-correlating the two lightcurves using both the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) and the discrete correlation function (DCF) methods. The results showed a statistically significant time lag of about 4 days using the DCF method, while the ICCF method gave a mean value of about 3 days. The authors used the time lag to estimate the BLR radius and the SMBH mass, which was in agreement with the known relationship between the BLR size and the optical continuum luminosity. The authors also discussed the challenges and improvements in the analysis, including the effects of flux randomization (FR) and random subset selection (RSS) procedures, and the limitations of the analysis due to the short duration of the observations and the relative flux calibration procedure using the [O III] 5007 Å line.

1. The broad emission iron lines in active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries are believed to originate close to the black hole due to the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc. The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in determining the line shape, particularly the position of the marginally stable orbit.
2. The innermost stable orbit occurs closer to a black hole with a higher spin value, and the spin affects the overall shape of the line. For about two decades, the LAOR model has been the most widely used relativistic disc spectral line model, but it sets the dimensionless angular momentum to a canonical value and cannot be subject to data fitting.
3. Recent studies have relaxed this limitation and allowed the dimensionless angular momentum to be fitted in the suite of Ky models. Other numerical codes have also been developed with similar functionality. The LAOR model can still be used for spin estimation if the inner edge of the disc is identified with the marginally stable orbit.
4. The authors aim to compare the LAOR and model for the current XMM-Newton data and artificial data generated for the upcoming X-ray mission. They have chosen two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit an extremely skewed iron line.
5. The authors used the SAS software and standard tools to reduce the XMM-Newton data and prepared and fitted the data. MCG-6-30-15 is a nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy, and the XMM-Newton observed it for a long exposure time. GX 339-4 is a black hole binary that exhibited a strong broadened line when in the very high state.
6. The authors find that the LAOR model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, which affects the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line. The discrepancies in the overall shape of the line are more visible for lower spin values. The correct re-binning of the data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution is crucial to obtain statistically relevant results.

The resulting space has a singularity that is a delta function with support on the surface.

The mission consists of two instruments: the atomic clock and the atom interferometer. The atomic clock, which benefits from extensive heritage from the Aces mission, measures the gravitational red shift experienced by highly accurate clocks in the gravitational fields of Earth or the Sun. The atom interferometer tests the universality of free fall by measuring differential accelerations of microscopic quantum particles.

The space segment encompasses the satellite, two instruments, science link equipment, and precise orbit determination equipment. The ground segment is composed of three ground terminals that are connected to the highly accurate ground clocks.

2. Experiments in 1970 at Platteville, Colorado, and in 1971 at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation of ionosonde records, and excitation of spread F2 radiation after the hf transmitter was turned on. These experiments showed the triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionosphere.
3. In the 1980s, strong, systematic, structured, wide-band secondary hf radiation was observed escaping from the interaction region in Troms, Norway, under similar experimental conditions as in Arecibo. Complex interactions, including weak and strong em turbulence and harmonic generation, were found to be excited in these experiments.
4. Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence. Analytical and numerical studies of Langmuir turbulence and upper-hybrid/lower-hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas have been conducted.

In this study, a full-scale simulation of the propagation of an hf em wave into the ionosphere is presented, using ionospheric parameters typical for the high-latitude EISCAT heating facility in Troms, Norway. The results suggest that such simulations will be a powerful tool to study hf-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level for direct comparison with experimental data.

The simulation shows that the em pulse propagates without changing shape through the neutral atmosphere until it reaches the ionospheric layer, where it undergoes Faraday rotation due to the different dispersion properties of the l-o and r-x modes. The l-o mode oscillations at a certain altitude are now radiating em waves with significant magnetic field components. The em pulse returns to the initial location with the leading (lower altitude) part primarily r-x mode polarized and the trailing (higher altitude) part l-o mode polarized",0

This model is attractive due to the ability to directly manipulate and test the many-body behavior of a system of trapped bosonic atoms.
2. The Mott-Hubbard transition is driven by the interplay of the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy. The ratio of the onsite energy and the bandwidth is the key parameter in the system, which can be easily controlled and varied in optical lattices.

The model can be studied using various approximation schemes, including perturbation theory, Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz, density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), exact diagonalization (ED), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC).

Perturbation theory is used to study short-range correlations not included by the Gutzwiller ansatz, which are important for experimentally observable expansion patterns and determining the location of the insulator-superfluid transition. The results show important modifications to single-site observables and the correlation function, with deviations from the mean-field picture being strongest near the Mott insulator-superfluid transition.

The authors are interested in expanding cosmologies and note that hyperbolic universes obtained by compactification have been shown to exhibit transient acceleration. They propose a model of a flat expanding universe undergoing a transient period of accelerating expansion by compactifying on a compact hyperbolic manifold with a time-dependent volume modulus. Subsequent studies have confirmed that such solutions are typical in all compactifications involving compact hyperbolic spaces or non-vanishing flux.
2. The authors develop a method to visualize cosmological solutions in terms of geodesics in an augmented target space, which applies to any potential and is a simple reference for determining the late-time behavior of cosmologies arising from a large class of models with other potentials. They show that flat cosmological solutions are geodesics in the augmented target space but with respect to a conformally rescaled metric, while null geodesics are unaffected by the conformal rescaling and continue to correspond to (14) cosmologies for (5). The analysis of acceleration is also simple in this framework, as within the lightcone, a geodesic entering the acceleration cone corresponds to an accelerating universe. The paper aims to generalize this analysis to the multi-scalar case.

The star was first identified as a magnitude 17 object with a large proper motion by Luyten in 1967.
2. New photometry and trigonometric parallax astrometry were obtained for HIP 115147, its known visual companion HIP 115147b, and LSPM J2322+7847. The results suggest that LSPM J2322+7847 is an M-dwarf at approximately the same distance as HIP 115147.
3. HIP 115147 was initially thought to be an RS CVn-type variable, but later studies showed it to be a very young, naked post-T Tauri dwarf. It is one of the most powerful X-ray emitters in the solar neighborhood and is a member of the local young stream or association.

1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a hypothetical state of matter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where quarks and gluons are mostly liberated from hadrons. The study of hot and dense nuclear matter in the form of QGP has been ongoing for about thirty years, with experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) providing hints of its formation.
2. The Landau Fermi liquid theory is used to describe the relativistic systems such as quark matter, quark-gluon plasma, and other relativistic plasmas. In this framework, the energy density of weakly interacting quarks in QGP can be evaluated using equations (1), (2), (3), and (7). The interaction between quarks is described by the Landau-Fermi interaction function, which is related to the two-particle forward scattering amplitude.
3. The thermodynamic properties of QGP, including the energy density, entropy, and free energy, are calculated using the partition function. The results show that the energy density and free energy of QGP are larger than those of strange quark matter, while the entropy is smaller and has a similar density dependence at fixed temperature. The equation of state for QGP is much harder than that of strange quark matter at the same baryon density and temperature.
4. The one-gluon exchange interaction, which is repulsive, facilitates the quarks' transition to the deconfined phase at lower densities and temperatures. The interaction strength and bag pressure play a role in the quarks' transition to the deconfined phase, with the interaction strength reducing the transition density and the increase in bag pressure improving the results towards lattice QCD calculations. Future works include adjusting the phase diagram to get the relation between the bag constant and the coupling constant, generalizing the method for non-constant coupling and bag pressure, and adding the interaction between gluons to the present calculations.

A conformally symmetric model was proposed for strong interactions at low energies, based on the observation that gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form under conformally-flat metrical fields. Quarks and gluons are confined to an anti-de Sitter (AdS) universe with a finite radius, while photons freely travel through flat space-time.
2. The model comprises one real scalar field and one complex scalar field, whose dynamical equations were solved for vacuum expectation values that satisfy a specific relation, leading to AdS confinement and a conformally flat metric. The only quadratic term in the Lagrangian is proportional to a mass term, resulting in a light scalar field associated with confinement and a very heavy complex field associated with electromagnetism.
3. The model was simplified to allow for interactions between hadrons and the study of the AdS spectrum, which reveals itself through structures observed in hadronic mass distributions. The strategy was reinforced by empirical evidence of an AdS oscillation frequency that agrees well with observed results for meson-meson scattering and meson-pair production in various flavor sectors.",0

1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the 1980s to describe the improvement of signal transmission through the addition of noise in a system with a periodic input and nonmonotone response to noise.
2. The phenomenon occurs when a signal, which is below the detection threshold without noise, becomes observable with the addition of optimal noise levels.
3. The optimal noise level can be determined by maximizing the Fisher information quantity, which can have one or multiple maxima, leading to stochastic resonance or stochastic multi-resonance, respectively.
4. The paper focuses on estimating a constant signal and testing hypotheses using two observation schemes: observing the proportion of time spent above a threshold and measuring the energy of the signal above the threshold.
5. The noise is modeled as a diffusion process, and the observable part of the trajectory is used for estimation and testing.
6. The paper shows that the proposed estimators are asymptotically equivalent to maximum likelihood estimators and provides an example of stochastic resonance in the model.
7. The study also includes the problem of testing two simple hypotheses using the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion, revealing a nonmonotonic dependence of the overall probability of error on the noise level and the presence of stochastic resonance.

1. The text discusses the experimental results of thermal conductivity measurements on two single crystals of YBa2Cu3Ox high-temperature superconductors (HTS) at different temperatures and magnetic fields. The measurements reveal a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity below a critical temperature (Tc) due to the presence of a predominant d-wave gap symmetry.
2. The text also explains that the thermal conductivity patterns are not free of phononic contribution, but it is constant under variations of magnetic field orientations due to the unlikely presence of Josephson vortices and the lack of experimental evidence for substantial phonon-electron scattering.
3. The text proposes a model involving a doppler shift (ds) in the energy spectrum of quasiparticles and accurate inclusion of impurity scattering or assuming Andreev scattering (as) of quasiparticles by vortices to explain the variation of thermal conductivity. The model suggests that the ds affects both the carrier density and scattering rate, and the as gives rise to a fourfold oscillation in the thermal conductivity as the magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO6 planes.
4. The text concludes that both as and ds can explain the angle profiles observed at low temperatures, but neither alone can explain the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation amplitude in the whole field range. Therefore, a more realistic picture of thermal transport should take both mechanisms into account, producing different regimes influenced by the predominance of either ds or as in the magnetic field dependence.

1. The text discusses the cosmetic surgery conjecture in knot theory, which states that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes of a knot are never purely cosmetic.
2. The authors focus on purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere and present a result that gives a sufficient condition for a knot to admit no purely cosmetic surgery in terms of its Jones polynomial.
3. The authors show that if a knot has either one or two, the second and third order derivatives of its Jones polynomial evaluated at a certain point are nonzero, then any two distinct slopes result in non-isomorphic manifolds.
4. The authors relate their result to a similar result obtained by Boyer and Lines using the normalized Alexander polynomial.
5. The authors use Lescop's surgery formula and a knot invariant called @xmath30 to prove their main result.
6. The authors also prove the nonexistence of purely cosmetic surgery on certain families of two-bridge knots and whitehead doubles.

9. They show that a genus 83 two-bridge knot not of the form @xmath183 for some integers does not admit purely cosmetic surgeries, and the same holds for a genus 5 two-bridge knot. Additionally, they prove that there is no purely cosmetic surgery for the positive 79-twisted whitehead double of a knot for certain conditions and for the untwisted whitehead double if the knot is not the unknot.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have received attention due to their calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariant soft terms. However, they suffer from negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be solved by adding a universal mass term.
2. Hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMSB) is a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB but localizes supersymmetry breaking at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region. The warping suppresses contributions from tree-level gravity mediation and anomaly mediation can become the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector.
3. The mass spectra of various sparticles in AMSB and HCAMSB models differ significantly. In AMSB, the sleptons have negative mass-squared values, while in HCAMSB, the stops and sbottoms have negative mass-squared values. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.
4. The hcamsb model should be easily distinguishable from the mamsb model at the LHC if the mass splitting between the wino-like and bino-like neutralinos is not too large. The presence of chargino and neutralino candidates in cascade decay events reflects the mass ordering in the hcamsb model, while in the mamsb model, the mass ordering is reversed.
5. The mass spectra of various sparticles in HCAMSB models vary with the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms relative to the anomaly contribution. The large increase in the bino mass feeds into the renormalization group equations, causing many of the scalar masses to increase with the hypercharge contribution.
6. The hcamsb model predicts a reach of up to 105 TeV at the LHC for low values of the hypercharge contribution, and up to 2.2 TeV for large values. The reach for large values of the hypercharge contribution is lower than for mamsb models due to the severe left-right splitting of scalar masses.
7. The hcamsb model gives rise to multi-jet plus multi-lepton plus missing energy events, with occasional hits of length a few cm ar",0

1. The Zero Range Potential (ZRP) approach is a theory developed to expand the limits of traditional treatments in quantum mechanics. It allows for the exact solution of scattering problems and can be represented as a boundary condition or pseudopotential. Darboux transformations (DT) can be used to construct exactly solvable potentials and correct the ZRP model.
2. The ZRP is represented as the boundary condition on the wavefunction at the origin and can be expressed in terms of spherical functions. The bound states of the ZRP are determined by the poles of the @xmath11-matrix, which lie on the imaginary positive semi-axis of the complex plane. The DT modifies the boundary condition and creates a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.
3. The ZRP can be used to study electron scattering by non-spherical potentials, such as those with multiple centers and interactions. The partial waves can be expressed as a superposition of green functions, and the scattering amplitude can be calculated by imposing boundary conditions. The DT can be used to add or remove poles of the @xmath11-matrix to build a zero-range potential eigenfunction in the multi-center problem.

1. The text discusses the numerical solution of initial value systems of two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations using modified exponential cubic b-splines differential quadrature method (mexp-dqm), modified trigonometric cubic b-splines differential quadrature method (mtb-dqm), and mecdq method. These methods transform the convection-diffusion equation into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in time, which is then solved using ssp-rk54 scheme.
2. The methods are shown to be stable for two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations using matrix stability analysis. The proposed solutions are more accurate and in good agreement with the exact solutions compared to various existing schemes. The order of accuracy for the convection-diffusion problem with dirichlet boundary conditions is cubic in space, while the order of accuracy for the convection-diffusion problem with neumann boundary conditions is quadratic with respect to error norms.
3. The text also includes numerical computations for three test problems of two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations and compares the results with the exact solutions and other schemes. The eigenvalues of the matrices used in the methods are computed and found to have identical nature, confirming the stability of the proposed methods.

1. The text describes the results of a study on submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) using data from the Lockman Hole region. The study aimed to create a robust sample of SMGs by combining independent submillimeter and millimeter maps and applying a dual-survey extraction technique. The sample consisted of 19 SMGs, 15 of which were detected securely by deep radio imaging. Of these, 10 were identified with robust redshifts. The resulting redshift distribution was consistent with that determined by a larger sample by Chapman et al. (2005), supporting their conclusions.
2. The study also investigated the properties of individual SMGs through spectroscopic observations. For example, LH1200.001 was found to have a complex field with two central radio components, likely at a redshift of 3.036. LH1200.002 had two galaxies targeted spectroscopically, with one being an AGN at a redshift of 2.35. LH1200.003 was a blend of multiple SMGs, with the most probable identification being a starburst at a redshift of 2.33. The study encountered challenges in determining redshifts for some SMGs due to their faint optical counterparts and complex environments.

1. The text discusses the results of a redshift survey of the Corona Borealis supercluster, which reveals the evolution and environmental dependence of the galaxy luminosity function (LF). The survey found that the local LF of field galaxies, when normalized to high galactic latitude counts, agrees well with the Large Area Redshift Survey (LAS) and the Autofib survey. However, the normalization of the local LF is higher than that of the Stromlo/APM survey, suggesting a systematic error in one of the surveys.
2. The study also found that the field galaxy LF evolves with redshift, with the population of blue, star-forming galaxies becoming more luminous and the fraction of galaxies exhibiting spectral signatures of ongoing star formation increasing. The star formation is found to be long-lived and not short-term bursts. The LF of the two superclusters in the survey shows significant differences from the field galaxy LF, indicating environmental effects. </summary>",0

1. Rapidity gaps, i.e., pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron. These gaps are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons.
2. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies above 100 GeV and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps. This observation demonstrates the relevance of color singlet exchange effects in QCD events at momentum transfers of order 1,000 GeV.
3. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent for dijet events due to 0-channel color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps of order 10%. However, recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations do not show the expected decrease in gap fraction with increasing average transverse momentum of the observed jets.
4. The two-gluon exchange model, which is based on the imaginary part of the two-gluon 0-channel exchange amplitude, is limited by unitarity constraints. Phase shift unitarization leads to more realistic color singlet exchange fractions.
5. The unitarized model summarizes non-perturbative effects in terms of the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift. The implications for the formation of gaps at the Tevatron are analyzed, including the variation of the gap fraction with jet transverse energies and pseudorapidity separation.
6. The elastic scattering of two arbitrary partons is dominated by the forward region, where the Rutherford scattering amplitude provides an excellent approximation. Unitarity constraints are studied by diagonalizing the amplitude in both momentum/coordinate space and color space.
7. The formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence and requires a theoretical explanation within QCD. The unitarization of hard elastic quark and gluon scattering is not unique, but any acceptable method must preserve the successful description of hard dijet events by perturbative QCD.

2. The optical counterpart of LMCX-2 was identified as a B-type star, but little is known about its system parameters, including the orbital period, which ranges from 6.4 hours to 12 days based on previous observations.
3. A new technique called bowen fluorescence was used to detect a periodic signal in the spectroscopic dataset and identify the system parameters of LMCX-2. Narrow emission lines were detected in the bowen region, which are likely coming from the irradiated side of the companion.
4. The bowen emission is much weaker compared to heii in LMCX-2, possibly due to the lower metal abundances in the Large Magellanic Cloud where LMCX-2 is located.
5. The most prominent emission lines, heii and hα, showed significant changes in equivalent width and line flux between the two nights of observation. The heii emission is dominated by a bright spot that appears to have moved over night, suggesting the presence of an irradiated region that shows movement on a much longer time scale.
6. The radial velocity curve of the heii emission line shows a sine-like variation, which is interpreted as orbital motion of a region that is co-rotating with the binary. During the second night, either the semi-amplitude or the offset of the radial velocity has increased.
7. The Lomb-Scargle technique was used to search for periodic signals in the radial velocity curve, and two significant peaks were found at periods of 0.32 days and 0.45 days. The 0.32-day period is similar to the photometric period detected by Callanan et al. (1990), suggesting that it is the orbital period.

1. The packaging machine described in the text is a deep-drawing machine with multiple work stations arranged in succession, each including at least one movable tool member. The tool members are synchronized with one another through a rotationally driven shaft and transfer mechanisms that convert the rotational movement into the movement required to operate the respective tool member. This design ensures smooth operation and eliminates the need for separate drives for each work station.
2. The transfer mechanisms can be implemented using toggle levers or cam mechanisms, which are robust and independent of high wear components. The shaft can be driven in a continuous 360° rotation or alternately in different directions of rotation depending on the desired tool-member lifting movements. Work stations whose tool members are driven by the shaft include a forming station, an evacuating and sealing station, and a separating or cutting station.
3. The packaging machine can have a compact design due to the arrangement of work stations on different vertical levels and the use of a frame to support the shaft.

The present invention provides organic polymers suitable for use in anti-reflective coatings on semiconductor devices, specifically for use in photolithography processes using 193 nm (ArF) and 248 nm (KrF) light beams. These polymers absorb light strongly at specific wavelengths to prevent the standing wave effect and light reflection, and eliminate rear diffraction and reflected light from lower layers. The polymers are designed to form a cross-linked structure and can be prepared from polyhydroxystyrene resin, poly(styrene-acrylate) resin, or novolac resin using diazonaphthoquinone halide and an amine in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, benzene, methylethylketone, or dioxane. The polymers have proven to be excellent organic anti-reflective coating materials during the formation of submicro-patterns in photolithographic processes.
2. The present invention also provides anti-reflective coating compositions containing these polymers and preparation methods thereof. The compositions can be prepared by dissolving a polymer in an organic solvent and adding one or more light-absorbing compounds selected from anthracene and its derivatives, fluorenone derivatives, fluorene and its derivatives, fluorenol, xanthone, quinizarin, and fluorescein. The organic solvent used for the preparation can be any suitable conventional organic solvent, and the amount of solvent used is preferably 200-5000% (w/w) with respect to the weight of the polymer used. An anti-reflective coating can be provided on a semiconductor silicon wafer by filtering a solution of a polymer or composition, coating the filtered solution or composition on a wafer, and hard-baking the coating to cross-link the anti-reflective coating polymer.

1. The present invention is a sewing machine detector that detects the position of a sewing needle and the speed of a sewing machine. It is integral with the drive and control elements of the sewing machine.
2. The conventional sewing machine detector, as shown in FIG. 8, includes a sewing machine, motor, belt for transmission of rotation, needle section, control circuit section, detector, and power indicating light.
3. The conventional detector uses an optical fiber type needle position detector, as shown in FIGS. 9-12, which includes a detecting section, optical fiber cable, photoelectric translation processing module section, and electrical connectors.
4. The conventional detector uses reflective discs installed on the shaft of the detecting section to reflect light from the needle UP and needle DOWN position detecting optical fibers, respectively.
5. The conventional detector eliminates the influence of static noise by using optical fibers solely for detection purposes and employing a photoelectric translation processing module section connected to the control circuit section.
6. However, the reflective discs must withstand constant vibration during sewing machine operation and maintain precise optical axes with the optical fibers to ensure accurate detection.
7. The present invention addresses these issues by using flat, sheet-shaped light shielding discs that detect sewing machine speed and needle positions, and are free to rotate relative to the shaft.
8. The optical fiber supporter includes linear optical fiber fixing holes for locking the ends of the light sending and receiving optical fibers, and first and second reflecting portions opposite the end faces of the fibers.
9. The first and second reflecting portions are in opposition, and light transmitted from the light sending optical fibers and reflected by the first reflecting portions passes through the light shielding discs and is reflected by the second reflecting portions to enter the light receiving optical fibers.
10. The present invention provides accurate optical axes, eliminates the need for curved reflecting portions, reduces stress on optical fibers, and simplifies construction by allowing the optical fiber power indicating cable to be run simultaneously with the detection optical fibers.

1. The text describes an invention for a mechanism to install and remove objects in wells, particularly for objects that might be stuck or lost. It improves upon existing mechanisms by promoting effective connection and disconnection of a pull tool to and from a down hole object.
2. During drilling and well servicing operations, objects can become lost or stuck in a well bore, referred to as ""fish."" Many types of pull tools and grappling devices have been developed for fishing operations. Down hole devices, such as those within casing and tubing strings, often have API Standard fishing necks with undercut shoulders for grappling. However, these necks can wear down, leaving only a stub pipe without the usual undercut shoulder.
3. Connection between a wire line controlled fishing tool and a worn fishing neck can be achieved using an overshot type grappling device with a collet structure. However, disconnection can be difficult if not impossible, especially if the pulling tool or wire line is inadequate for the pulling operation. Application of shocks to the pulling tool or down hole equipment can cause failure or excessive wear.
4. The invention provides a mechanism for a wire line controlled pulling tool to effectively connect and disconnect from down hole objects. It takes the form of an external overshot or an internal spear, depending on the service operation. The tool structure includes an outer tubular body with an inner body structure that moves inside it. Telescoping movement of the inner and outer body structures causes the overshot or spear to selectively move into gripping relationship with the object. A catch mechanism with a locking position and an unlocking position ensures secure connection and easy disconnection.

1. The present invention relates to an air intake device for an internal combustion engine that includes a tank, two pipes, and a control valve to improve engine performance and reduce noise. The tank provides a constant volume and is connected to the intake pipe by two pipes, one with a larger cross-sectional area and one with a smaller cross-sectional area and located upstream of the larger pipe.
2. The larger pipe opens to the intake passage at a location farther from the air cleaner than the smaller pipe, and the ratio of their cross-sectional areas is about one tenth. A control valve is disposed at the tank-side opening of the larger pipe and is actuated by a vacuum diaphragm actuator.
3. The valve opening improves engine performance by creating a new compound curve of volumetric efficiency, which is best obtained by decreasing the length of the air inlet pipe upstream of the air cleaner. The smaller pipe and the volume of the tank act as a resonator to absorb intake noise, reducing it to permissible levels.

The valve is turned on or off at specific engine speeds based on the intersection of the two curves, and the valve is preferably closed at engine loads below a certain point and opened only when the load is above that point and the engine speed is above a certain RPM. The valve operating conditions can be stored as a map in the control circuit to produce a control signal for the solenoid valve and thus the control valve.

1. The present invention is a method of minimizing steam boiler pressure changes or turbine power changes during turbine control valve operational safety testing. It uses control valve positions as feedback to minimize flow disturbance caused by the closure and reopening of turbine control valves.
2. The method calculates total mass flow for N parallel flow valves as a function of control valve position (valve stem lift). When one valve is closed for testing, the remaining valves require additional lift to maintain a constant flow. The flow difference between N and N-1 valves is determined during design and used to calculate the required lift for the remaining valves.
3. The test compensation circuit uses a look-up table (Test Comp Array) to determine the flow compensation required for the three input control valves not under test based on the mass flow demanded by the TCV Reference signal. The flow compensation is then passed to a multiplier circuit, which multiplies it by the position of the valve being controlled by the circuit.
4. The Lift Flow Array is another look-up table that provides a translation to a total flow demand value for the three input control valves not being tested based on the stem lift of the tested valve. The flow demand value and the varying flow demand signal for the other three valves are input into a divider circuit, which produces a fraction that starts at 1 and gets progressively closer to 0 as the tested valve is closed.
5. The output of the divider circuit is then fed into a summing circuit, which subtracts the constant reference signal ""K One"" from it to produce an output signal (CVm Comp Reference) that indicates the amount of flow compensation needed for the three valves not under test. This signal is then multiplied by a compensation factor to move the lift for the other valves and compensate for the mass flow lost by the closed valve.

1. The text describes a system for minimizing power consumption in home networks by transferring network administrative functions from a master device to a slave device.
2. A network master node, which performs network administrative functions, receives instructions to enter a power management mode and sends data to a network slave node to enable it to perform the administrative functions.
3. The master node then enters the power management mode, and the slave node becomes the new network master node.
4. The text outlines a detailed operation of a network master node, including determining if there is traffic on the network before entering power save mode and sending a transfer request to network slave nodes.
5. If only one network slave node responds, the master node sends data enabling the administrative functions to be performed and enters power save mode.
6. If more than one network slave node responds, the master node selects the most qualified slave node based on visibility or intelligence/functional capabilities to transfer the administrative functions.
7. A network slave node receives a request to transfer administrative functions and sends a reply indicating acceptance. After receiving the transferred functions, the slave node becomes the new network master node.

1. The text describes an invention for measuring the elevation angle of radio waves using an antenna array with at least four antennae arranged in two equi-spaced linear triplets perpendicular to a ground plane. Each triplet has spaced elements and a height above the ground plane, and the information signals from the outermost antennae are combined vectorially to provide a first derived signal, while the information signal from the center antenna provides a second derived signal. The quotient of the first and second derived signals is a function of the elevation angle but not the ground reflection coefficient, and is used to measure the elevation angle.
2. The antenna array can operate in both receive and transmit modes. In the receive mode, the signal processing circuits in the antenna receivers provide unambiguous angle measurement. In the transmit mode, the transmitted signal from each antenna must be coded for identification in a remote receiver. A common coherent carrier is required for transmissions from each triplet element, but coherence between triplets is not necessary.
3. The design aims for this invention include providing unambiguous angle measurements up to about 7 degrees with measurement accuracy and resolution of the order +/-0.05 degrees, using the smallest number of antenna elements possible, and choosing the spacing (d) and height (h) of the antenna elements based on the relationships (4) and (5) to optimize measurement sensitivity and accuracy. The highest antenna element is kept at an acceptable height above the ground, and a suitably weighted average of the three readings from the triplets is used to determine the optimum measurement.

The anodized layer is sealed and overlaid with a porous vacuum-deposited nickel second electrode. The sensor is mounted in a bracket and electrically connected to a solid state electronic measurement circuit through its aluminum body. The impedance between the electrodes varies linearly with the relative humidity of the surrounding gaseous atmosphere when excited by a ten Hertz sine wave alternating current voltage.
2. The anodized layer is formed by oxalic acid anodizing the aluminum to a thickness of about 0.02 to 0.08 millimeters. Nickel particles are deposited in the porosity of the anodized layer by vacuum deposition from a hot nickel-plated filament. The anodized layer is then hydrolized and sealed, and a thin, water vapor pervious nickel second electrode is deposited on the sealed anodized layer by vacuum deposition.
3. The sensor functions by combining capacitance and resistance in a suitable manner, resulting in an impedance that varies inversely proportionally to the relative humidity of the atmosphere. The impedance changes almost instantly in response to humidity changes due to the thin and molecularly porous dielectric and second electrode. The sensor is self-contained and forms its own protection, while the surrounding atmosphere can circulate freely for free exchange of atmospheric molecules with the dielectric layer. The impedance relation is linear in a suitable range of temperatures and humidities, and the sensor is most effective when excited by a ten Hertz alternating current voltage.

1. The invention is a multiorifice structure made by fusing concentric layers of solid rods and cylindrical members, where each layer of rods is disposed at a progressively larger angle with respect to the axis of the fused assembly. The interstices between the rods and cylindrical members form a plurality of angularly disposed passageways, which increase in angle as they move away from the center of the structure. The structure is used as a flat multiorifice spray plate for a fuel injector valve, allowing fuel to be ejected at an angle that is a function of its distance from the center of the structure.
2. The structure's advantages include the formation of triangular-shaped orifices, which are more effective in atomizing the exiting fluid than circular orifices due to the greater distortion from the natural spherical configuration of a free fluid. The method also results in more uniform apertures than conventional drilling and photoetching techniques, as the rods have precise tolerances on their diameter.
3. A simple and economical method for fabricating the multiorifice structure involves twisting rods about a core rod and sheathing them in cylindrical members, then repeating the process with each subsequent layer. The rods and cylindrical members may be coated with a lower melting temperature material to facilitate fusion. The fused assembly is then sliced to produce multiple thin multiorifice structures, which can be further processed to achieve the desired surface finish and uniformity of thickness. The invention is not limited to the described configuration or method of manufacture, as alternate embodiments are possible.

The mechanism consists of a tool, a tool frame, a tool holder, and clamps. The tool frame and holder have curved connecting surfaces that allow the tool and its frame to be easily mounted and secured by the clamps.
2. The curved connecting surfaces are designed to ensure compatibility between the tool frame and holder, with the radius of curvature and the distance between the center of the radius and the contact surface fulfilling a specific formula. The diameter of the inlay of the connecting element in the tool frame is also designed to be substantially equal to twice the radius of curvature.
3. The tool frame is mounted in the tool holder by moving it in an inclined position, with one edge passing the second connecting surface and drawing the tool frame towards the holder by means of clamps. The clamps effect a pressure force between the surfaces, transmitting both radial and axial forces.

1. The text describes a method for charging and balancing the voltage of cells in a battery pack to support a desired drive range. The controller determines the maximum capacity of each cell, the common voltage needed for all cells, and the charge time for the battery pack. If the pack charge time is less than the maximum resistive circuitry activation time, the cells are balanced and then charged. If not, the resistive circuitry is activated for each cell, and once all resistive circuitry has been deactivated, the battery charger is disabled.
2. The battery pack may include a plurality of cells, each with a different capacity due to manufacturing tolerances or age. Charging all cells to the same voltage results in some cells contributing less power and energy than others, which can limit the overall performance of the battery pack. To address this, the cells are charged to a voltage based on the minimum and maximum Amp-hr cell capacities to ensure all cells contribute optimally to the battery pack's energy output.
3. The text also discusses the calculation of a cell's energy content and the relationship between cell voltage, capacity, and state of charge. These calculations are used to determine the required cell voltage and state of charge for a given drive range, ensuring the battery pack can meet the vehicle's energy requirements.

1. The current surface transportation programs are not effectively addressing the nation's transportation challenges due to a lack of clear goals, inflexible funding structures, and insufficient performance measures. The federal role in transportation has expanded over the years, leading to a complex web of programs with varying goals and funding structures. Many programs lack links to needs or performance, and some goals conflict with each other. For example, only one federal program is specifically directed at intermodal infrastructure, and most funding is distributed through formulas that have only an indirect relationship to needs and performance.
2. The fiscal sustainability of surface transportation programs is at risk due to increased spending from the Highway Trust Fund without commensurate increases in revenues. The federal government does not possess adequate data to assess outcomes or implement performance measures, and some funds cannot be transferred between highway and transit programs, impeding efficient planning and project selection. Additionally, tools to make better use of existing infrastructure, such as intelligent transportation systems and congestion pricing, have not been deployed to their full potential. The solvency of the federal surface transportation program is at risk, with the Highway Trust Fund projected to face a shortfall in 2009 and the Transit Account in 2012. To address these challenges, a reexamination of the federal approach to surface transportation is needed, focusing on creating well-defined goals, establishing clear roles for the federal government, incorporating performance and accountability, employing the best tools and approaches, and ensuring fiscal sustainability.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reported material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, and 2006. SEC's financial statements were fairly presented, but misstatements may still occur due to these control deficiencies. The weaknesses included period-end financial reporting processes, disgorgements and penalties accounts receivable, accounting for transaction fee revenue, and preparing financial statement disclosures. SEC's financial management system did not conform to OMB Circular No. A-127 requirements, leading to extensive manual and labor-intensive accounting procedures and increased risk of errors.
2. SEC identified significant deficiencies in its internal control over information security, property and equipment, and accounting for budgetary resources. Information security weaknesses included inadequate protection against malicious code attacks, unauthorized network access, and lack of an effective intrusion detection system. Property and equipment controls lacked a formalized process for comparing received items against orders and insufficient oversight of recording acquisition dates and values. Budgetary resources had ineffective controls over recording and reporting of obligations, resulting in errors and misstatements in the Statement of Budgetary Resources.

The EAS workforce consisted primarily of employees in EAS 11 through 26 positions, including management-level positions such as postmasters and managers of customer services and postal operations. The Service's diversity development program was established in 1992 to foster an inclusive business environment and promote equal employment opportunities.
2. A study commissioned by the Postal Service Board of Governators in 1997 found that women and minorities were underrepresented in management-level positions (EAS 17 and above) compared to their representation in the 1990 Census Labor Force (CLF). The study also identified issues with the representation of women and minorities in these positions and recommended actions to address these issues.
3. The Service developed an action plan in response to the study's findings and briefed the Board of Governators in April 1998. The analysis in this report focused on promotions to EAS 16 and above positions at four selected performance clusters and found that the Service's required promotion procedures were followed. However, the representation of women and minorities in these positions was lower than their representation in the overall workforce.
4. The Service collects diversity-related data and has initiatives underway to improve its data collection methods and use. However, it lacks reliable data on the flow of applicants through its promotion processes, which makes it difficult to identify and remove barriers to the promotion of women and minorities.
5. The Service has implemented 23 initiatives in response to the Aguirre report, including initiatives to improve data collection and use, expand supplier diversity, and establish accountability for complying with the Supplier Diversity Program. The Service is also in the process of establishing targets and measures to assess its progress in meeting its diversity goals and objectives.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) defines Military Working Dogs (MWDs) as canines used to support military operations, including explosive and illegal narcotic detection, patrol, and tracking. MWDs can be adopted after their military service through Robby's Law.
2. Robby's Law, enacted in 2000, requires the military to make MWDs available for adoption when they are no longer needed, and gives priority to former handlers and those capable of humanely caring for the dogs. The law also states that the military is not liable for veterinary expenses associated with adopted MWDs.
3. The Air Force and Army use different systems to track information on MWDs, including WDMS, the Central Repository, and ROVR. WDMS documents the MWD's status when it is removed from service, while ROVR provides medical information for consideration of removal and documents euthanization.
4. Prevalent medical conditions among adopted MWDs include skin conditions or ear infections, dental disease or injury, arthritis or degenerative joint disease, and degenerative lumbo-sacral stenosis. The costs for treating these conditions vary based on factors such as treatment course and underlying cause.
5. Preventative care is necessary for adopted MWDs, regardless of their medical conditions. The average age of most adopted MWDs is about 9 years old, and recommended preventative care includes dental cleanings, vaccinations, and heartworm prevention.
6. Assistance with veterinary care for adopted MWDs is available through nonprofit organizations such as the U.S. War Dogs Association and the American Humane organization. The U.S. War Dogs Association offers free prescription drugs, free specialty care, and financial assistance for emergency care and euthanasia.

2. From 1997 to 2005, total MIP expenditures increased about 63 percent, with provider education receiving the largest percentage increase in funds and audit and medical review receiving the largest amounts overall. CMS generally increased funding for each of its five program integrity activities, but the amount and percentage increase varied.
3. CMS spent the largest share of MIP funds on audit (about 31 percent) and medical review (about 27 percent), while spending the smallest percentage on provider education (about 6 percent). However, CMS did not allocate funds based on the effectiveness of each activity or contractor vulnerabilities.
4. Medicare's increasing vulnerability to fraud, especially with the addition of the prescription drug benefit, requires CMS to modify its approach for deciding on funding allocations for and within the five program integrity activities. CMS is developing new measures to evaluate the relative effectiveness of provider education and audit activities, which should assist in making more prudent management and funding allocation decisions.
</summary>

Point 1:
Before 1996, Medicare program integrity activities were subsumed under Medicare’s general administrative budget and performed by insurance companies under contract with CMS. Funding for these activities was constrained due to the need to fund ongoing Medicare program operations and budget procedures imposed under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. In the early and mid-1990s, HHS advocated for a dedicated and stable amount of program integrity funding outside of the annual appropriations process.

Point 2:
In 1997, HIPAA established MIP and provided CMS with dedicated funding to conduct program integrity activities.

The Internet, which relies on the domain name system to ensure the uniqueness of email and website addresses, has grown significantly in importance for American businesses and consumers, as well as for vital services such as power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense. The domain name system functions by translating domain names into Internet addresses, and the rules governing this system determine which top-level domains (TLDs) are recognized by most computers connected to the Internet. The system is managed by a set of 13 root servers, which coordinate the translation of domain names into addresses.
2. The U.S. government supported the development of the Internet and played a key role in the implementation of the domain name system. However, following a 1997 presidential directive, the Department of Commerce began a process to transition the technical responsibility for the domain name system to the private sector. In 1998, the Department issued a White Paper outlining the principles for this transition, including stability, competition, representation, and private, bottom-up coordination. ICANN, a private, nonprofit organization, was established to manage the domain name system under these principles.
3. ICANN has made progress in implementing the transition, particularly in increasing competition by allowing multiple companies to register domain names. However, progress has been slower on activities designed to address other guiding principles, such as increasing stability and security, ensuring representation of the Internet community in policy-making, and using private, bottom-up coordination. In response to these challenges, ICANN's president called for fundamental reform in early 2002.

1. Large financial companies may reorganize or terminate under bankruptcy or special resolution regimes. Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure aimed at eliminating or restructuring debts, providing equitable treatment to creditors, and stopping collection activities.
2. Equitable treatment means similar treatment for creditors with similar claims, such as secured creditors receiving the same treatment for their secured claims. Business debtors may opt for liquidation (Chapter 7) or reorganization (Chapter 11).
3. Proceedings can be voluntary or involuntary, with involuntary proceedings initiated by creditors. Involuntary proceedings allow the debtor to defend against the request and present objections.
4. Chapter 7 involves a trustee taking over the debtor's assets, reducing them to cash, and distributing to creditors, subject to secured creditors' rights to collateral.
5. Chapter 11 allows debtors to continue operations under court supervision, with the debtor typically remaining in control (debtor-in-possession).
6. Proceedings under Chapters 7 and 11 include several stages, such as first-day motions, disclosure, plan of reorganization, and reorganization.
7. First-day motions involve requests for continued business operation and financing. Disclosure statements provide information on assets, liabilities, and business affairs for creditor judgments.
8. The plan of reorganization outlines how the debtor intends to reorganize and treat creditors, with classes of claims receiving similar treatment.

2. Social Security policies have been changed to encourage older workers to continue working. The practice of reducing benefits for those who earn income while receiving benefits was eliminated, and the delayed retirement credit for those who delay taking benefits was increased.
3. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) promote the employment of older persons based on ability and prohibit age discrimination. However, ADEA applies only to firms with 20 or more employees, and some states have their own laws protecting older workers in small businesses.
4. Pension laws encourage employers to establish and maintain pension plans for their employees, which can influence the work decisions of older individuals. Many pension plans have features that encourage early retirement, but some employers are experimenting with phased retirement programs to retain older workers.

The Trust Fund also provides funding for FAA's capital accounts, including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account. The administration's reauthorization proposal aims to change FAA's financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges.
2. The proposal suggests funding for Air Traffic Organization (ATO) through user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft, while funding for AIP, Safety and Operations, and part of the Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account would come from equal fuel taxes on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers. The proposal also includes creating an advisory board and giving FAA limited borrowing authority.

The current funding structure, with some modifications, has successfully funded a growing FAA budget, but FAA has expressed concerns about the long-term revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency of its funding. The administration's proposed changes, such as establishing direct user charges for commercial aviation and substantially increasing fuel taxes for general aviation, are intended to link FAA's revenues more closely with its costs. However, the effectiveness of the proposed funding structure in linking costs with revenues depends on the soundness of FAA's cost allocation methodology and how closely it adheres to the principle of cost-based funding.

It uses the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and Gallup Q12 to measure customer and employee satisfaction, respectively, and both scores have increased since fiscal year 1999. However, FSA's unit cost measure, which divides budget obligations by the number of people who received aid, has limitations. It does not measure total obligations per person or explain the basis of the calculation, making it less useful to congressional decision makers.

1. Transit-oriented development (TOD) refers to compact, mixed-use neighborhoods located near transit systems, typically within a half-mile radius of a transit station. TOD can range from major urban centers to suburban neighborhoods and can increase access to employment, educational, and cultural opportunities.
2. Local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, metropolitan-planning organizations, city and county governments, regional councils, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts all play important roles in TOD planning and implementation.
3. FTA provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD but does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, FTA has expanded its role in TOD through research, partnerships, and a transit-oriented development planning pilot program.
4. Capital Investment Grant projects, which are typically led by local transit agencies, undergo a rigorous evaluation process that includes consideration of mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, cost-effectiveness, economic development, and land use.
5. Market demand for real estate, availability of large parcels of land, supportive local residents, and efficient access to jobs and activity centers are key conditions that support TOD. Market demand is driven by a strong local economy and can be hindered by high construction costs, lender reluctance, lengthy approval processes, unsupportive local populations, and undesirable physical features surrounding transit stations.
6. Local governments can encourage TOD through zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. Effective TOD policies align with local residents' preferences and market demand, create certainty for developers, and address challenges such as high construction costs, lender reluctance, and lengthy approval processes.

1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) introduced the Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) in 1988 to enable workers to review their earnings records and obtain benefit estimates.
2. Fewer than 2 percent of workers request these statements each year, but SSA plans to send them automatically to over 70 million workers by fiscal year 2000.
3. The goals of the PEBES initiative are to inform the public about benefits, assist in financial planning, and ensure accurate earnings records.
4. The estimated cost of producing and mailing the statements in fiscal year 2000 is $80 million, with $56 million for production costs and $24 million for personnel costs.
5. The PEBES provides estimated retirement benefits based on assumptions about future employment and earnings, but may not reflect special circumstances that could affect actual retirement benefits.
6. The statement has been revised based on public feedback, including the addition of estimates for retirement at age 62 and simplification of the design and organization.
7. The current statement contains too much information and is too complex, making it difficult for readers to understand and use effectively.

1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) manages two programs, Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provide benefits for individuals unable to work due to disability. Both programs use the same definition of disability, requiring a medically determinable impairment preventing substantial gainful activity for a year or resulting in death. DI, established in 1956, is an insurance program financed by payroll taxes, while SSI, established in 1972, is a needs-based program funded by general revenues. Concurrent beneficiaries, who receive benefits from both programs, comprised about 14% of SSA's disability population in 2002.
2. Concurrent beneficiaries face challenges in navigating the complex interaction of the two programs, particularly when it comes to work incentives and reporting work activity. SSA's guidance for administering the programs is voluminous and not always integrated, making it difficult for staff to effectively serve concurrent beneficiaries. Additionally, there is a lack of formal operating procedures and monitoring systems to ensure that information about work activity is collected and communicated between the two programs, potentially leading to overpayments or underpayments. SSA has taken steps to address these challenges, including the creation of the employment support representative position and the development of a new computer system to collect information about the monthly earnings of all DI beneficiaries who are working. However, more needs to be done to ensure that concurrent beneficiaries receive accurate and timely information about the effects of work on their benefits and to minimize overpayments.

2. FEMA, a DHS component, received $42.6 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and issued mission assignments to other federal agencies to perform relief work.
3. Mission assignments provide reimbursable budgetary authority to performing agencies, but FEMA does not adequately track and report on their use of funds.
4. Reporting problems include overstated obligations due to differences between FEMA's and agencies' internal tracking systems and understated expenditures due to timing issues.
5. The government lacks a framework to collect and consolidate information on hurricane relief and recovery spending from the 23 federal agencies involved.
6. FEMA is required to report weekly to the Appropriations Committees but does not have mechanisms to collect information from other agencies performing work on its behalf.
7. To improve reporting, the Secretary of Homeland Security should direct FEMA to request and include actual obligation and expenditure data from agencies, and reiterate billing policies.
8. OMB should establish a framework for governmentwide reporting on hurricane-related funding, either by collecting and consolidating information itself or designating another agency to do so.
9. The lack of timely and useful reporting makes it difficult for decision makers to determine how much has been spent, what for, and whether more or less funding is needed.
10. The rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast area require clear accountability and transparency, as billions of dollars have already been invested with more likely to come.

1. Program evaluations are systematic studies that assess a program's effectiveness and other aspects of performance in the context in which it operates. They provide valuable supplements to ongoing performance reporting by measuring results that are difficult or expensive to assess annually, explaining why performance goals were not met, or determining the effectiveness of one approach over another.
2. In a 2017 survey, 40% of federal managers reported having recent evaluations of their programs, with most of these evaluations conducted by the agency itself or its Inspector General. Evaluations contributed to improving program management or performance and assessing program effectiveness for most managers. However, fewer managers reported that evaluations contributed to allocating resources or informing the public.
3. Factors that facilitate evaluation use include leadership support, evaluation relevance to decision makers, and staff involvement. Lack of resources to implement evaluation findings is the most commonly reported barrier to evaluation use. Other barriers include difficulty distinguishing between program and external factors, concern about the relevance of evaluation issues to decision makers, and lack of staff knowledgeable in evaluation.

Eighty-one percent of respondents modified the formulas of one or more of their DB plans, with fifty-eight percent of those reporting on plans for collective-bargaining employees indicating an increase in plan formula generosity. In contrast, forty-eight percent of respondents reporting on plans for nonbargaining employees reported a decrease in plan formula generosity. Unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements was the primary reason for changes to nonbargaining plans, while global or domestic competitive pressures were the main reason for changes to bargaining unit plans.
2. With regard to plan design changes, fifty-two percent of respondents who reported on plans for nonbargaining unit employees had converted one or more traditional plans to a cash balance or other hybrid arrangement, citing trends in employee demographics as the top reason. Among respondents who answered the cash balance conversion question for their collectively bargained plans, twenty-one percent reported converting one or more traditional plans to a cash balance plan. Sixty-two percent of the responding firms reported a freeze, or a plan amendment to limit future pension accruals for some or all plan participants.
3. The survey also found that health benefits are a significant component of employer-offered benefits, representing fifteen percent of base pay. All respondents offered health insurance to active employees and contributed to the cost, and all provided health benefits to some current retirees. However, forty-six percent of responding firms reported that retiree health benefits were no longer offered to employees hired after a certain date. Among those firms offering retiree health benefits, large increases in the cost of health insurance for retirees and active employees were the primary reasons for decreasing or eliminating the employer's share of the cost for future retirees.

3. NFIP has mapped flood risks across the country and offers two types of premiums: subsidized and full risk. FEMA manages and oversees NFIP.
4. NFIP has faced financial challenges, including the need to charge premium rates that reflect actual risks, limit costs to taxpayers, encourage broad participation, and reduce the federal role in providing natural catastrophe insurance.
5. To address these challenges, actions such as eliminating or phasing out subsidized and grandfathered rates, increasing mitigation efforts, expanding NFIP participation, and encouraging private market participation have been proposed.
6. Mitigation efforts, such as elevation, relocation, and demolition, can reduce the risk of flood damage and help put NFIP on a firmer financial footing, but they can also impose up-front costs on homeowners and communities.

4. TVA's board of directors, nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, sets TVA's goals and policies, appoints the CEO, develops long-range plans, approves the budget, and sets wholesale and retail electric power rates.
5. TVA's most recent strategic plan covers fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and aims to maintain low rates, manage assets to meet reliability expectations, provide a balanced portfolio, and be responsible stewards of the region's natural resources.
6. TVA's debt has remained relatively flat, but unfunded pension liabilities have steadily increased over the past 10 years. Unfunded pension liabilities are similar to other kinds of debt because they constitute a promise to make a future payment or provide a benefit. However, TVA uses revenue from the rates it charges customers to fund the pension, not debt, and defers pension costs as ""regulatory assets"" in accordance with accounting standards and TVA board approval.

1. In the early 1980s, Congress passed the Single Audit Act to address concerns about inadequate oversight and accountability of federal assistance to state and local governments. The act required entities receiving over $100,000 in federal financial assistance to undergo a single audit instead of multiple grant audits.
2. The objectives of the Single Audit Act include promoting sound financial management, reducing burdens on grantees, and ensuring federal departments rely on audit work done under the act. The act covers entities with federal awards exceeding $300,000 and requires submission of financial reports and related audit reports to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse within 9 months of the recipient's year-end.
3. The Single Audit Act of 1984 was amended in 1996 to extend the law to cover all recipients of federal financial assistance, improve audit quality, and streamline the audit process. The amendments established a Federal Audit Clearinghouse, increased the audit threshold to $300,000, and required recipients to submit financial reports and audit reports to the clearinghouse.
4. The Single Audit Act assigns responsibilities to various entities, including OMB, federal agencies, and their respective Offices of Inspector General. OMB is responsible for prescribing policies, procedures, and guidelines, while federal agencies are responsible for ensuring recipient compliance with federal laws, regulations, and grant agreements.
5. The Single Audit Act requires a single audit consisting of an audit and opinions on financial statements, internal control, and compliance with laws and regulations for major programs. Auditors are required to report on significant deficiencies and material noncompliance, and recipients must address these issues in a corrective action plan.

1. From 1993 to 1996, federal employment levels were reduced through executive orders, legislation, and agency efforts to streamline operations and improve performance. Agencies were required to measure their performance and report to Congress and the President.
2. The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 mandated government-wide reductions of 272,900 FTE positions, and the National Performance Review recommended streamlining operations, reducing management control and headquarters positions, and improving government operations through reinvention and quality management techniques.
3. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 required agencies to develop strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual reports on program performance. Over 70 federal organizations participated in pilot projects for performance planning and reporting.
4. The text focuses on the downsizing experiences of five federal organizations: HUD, DOI, GSA, NASA, and OPM. Each organization underwent significant reductions in workforce and restructuring efforts to maintain performance. HUD's Office of Housing and GSA's Public Buildings Service were the most affected components, accounting for the largest percentage of their parent agencies' staffing reductions.

Actions taken to maintain performance during downsizing included refocusing missions, reengineering work processes, and taking steps to build and maintain employee skills. For example, HUD refocused its mission to help people create communities of opportunities and consolidated single family housing activities into fewer offices. GSA's Public Buildings Service reengineered its work processes to align with private sector business practices and fill gaps left by downsizing.

Performance was generally maintained during downsizing, but some concerns were raised about the sufficiency of current or future workforces for some components. For instance, the HUD Inspector General reported staffing shortages and skill mismatches in the Office of Housing, which could prevent the component from placing adequate resources on multifamily loss mitigation functions and properly managing troubled multifamily assets.

Officials, employee representatives, and employees believed that efforts to maintain performance had generally been successful, but some expressed concern about whether performance could be maintained with additional downsizing. Customers remained satisfied with performance in most cases, but some expressed dissatisfaction due to major losses of staff with adequate technical expertise.

Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists play a role in meeting the MHSS medical readiness mission by providing mental health care to active-duty personnel.
2. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who can diagnose and treat mental disorders medically, while clinical psychologists practice psychology and diagnose and treat mental disorders through psychotherapy. The Army, Navy, and Air Force all maintain uniformed health care providers to meet their MHSS medical readiness needs.
3. The PDP was established in response to a 1988 conference report that recommended military psychologists be trained to issue psychotropic medications under certain circumstances. The project was designed and implemented by the Army Surgeon General, with training provided at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences (USUHS).
4. The PDP faced several challenges during implementation, including a lack of a clearly defined purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, unspecified participant selection criteria, repeated changes in the curriculum, delays in granting prescribing privileges, and unresolved issues involving supervision.
5. The cost of the PDP was substantial, with an estimated total cost of $6.1 million through the completion of the proctored year for those currently in the program. The cost per graduate was about $94,000 less if the project had progressed beyond the developmental stage and external evaluations could have been discontinued. The cost-effectiveness of the PDP is unclear, as it depends on various assumptions and the proportion of time prescribing psychologists spend performing functions that psychiatrists would normally perform.

2. JWST's scientific instruments require extremely cold temperatures to observe very faint infrared sources, so a tennis-court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. The observatory segment includes the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), spacecraft, sunshield, and major subsystems like the cryocooler.
3. The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. The project is complex and relies on software to deploy and control various components and collect and transmit data back to Earth.
4. The project faces risks and unforeseen technical challenges during integration and testing, which is why schedule and cost reserves are allocated to specific activities, elements, and major subsystems. Each element and major subsystem has been allocated schedule reserve, and when an element or major subsystem exhausts its reserve, it may affect the schedule of other elements or major subsystems.
5. The project is currently on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining, but all elements and major subsystems are close to moving onto the critical path, potentially reducing schedule reserve further.

6. DHS has initiated actions to identify vulnerabilities, develop protective programs, exchange information with the private sector, and coordinate efforts with EPA and other federal agencies.
7. Industry associations have encouraged security improvements among members, but the extent of participation in voluntary initiatives is unclear.

Challenges for chemical companies include the cost of security improvements, lack of threat information, and difficulty conducting vulnerability assessments and employee background checks.

1. Existing laws give DHS limited authority to address chemical sector security, and DHS cannot ensure that all high-risk facilities are assessing their vulnerability and taking corrective action.
2. DHS and EPA have called for legislation to give the federal government greater authority over chemical facility security.
3. Legislation has been introduced in every Congress since September 11, 2001, but none has been successful.
4. Granting DHS the authority to require high-risk chemical facilities to take security actions would better ensure the preparedness of the chemical sector.

1. Wildland fires play an important role in shaping ecosystems across the United States, but human activities have reduced their frequency and increased the risk of severe fires. Factors contributing to this include fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting. The challenge is to balance the benefits of periodic fires with their negative effects on communities, particularly in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI).
2. Federal and nonfederal entities collaborate to reduce wildland fire risk through various activities such as fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education. Federal agencies have assisted local communities in developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs) and have funded landscape-scale fuel reduction projects. State and local governments can also adopt laws requiring homeowners to take measures to protect structures from wildland fires.
3. Collaborative planning, including the development of annual operating plans and CWPPs, has enhanced federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk. Community engagement, dedicated leadership, and the availability of resources also play important roles. For example, community members in California created a multiagency fire council after a major wildfire in 1993, which has helped provide wildland fire education and implement fuel reduction projects.
4. Improving the implementation of the Cohesive Strategy, increasing collaborative planning, expanding education, and increasing prevention efforts are some actions that could help reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Additionally, increasing state and local adoption of laws and ordinances that encourage fire-resistant building and the removal of potentially flammable vegetation around structures could also help.

1. The Battle of Normandy Foundation, a nonprofit organization, received $3 million from the U.S. Treasury in 1993 under the World War II 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coins Act to create and dedicate a Normandy memorial and encourage visits to the memorial. The Foundation used these funds, along with interest earned, to construct the Memorial Garden in Caen, France, adjacent to a World War II museum. The Memorial Garden, which opened in 1994, is a 2.5-acre site featuring a granite fountain, a ""Wall of States,"" and a waterfall. The Foundation's audited financial statements for 1993 and 1994 showed that it spent approximately 63% to 83% of its revenues on program activities related to its stated purpose.
2. Allegations were made against the Foundation regarding its financial management, including spending most of its revenues on non-program activities before 1993, inappropriately promoting tours to Normandy in 1993, and altering records related to rent payments to a related party. The Foundation denied these allegations and stated that it had taken steps to address any identified issues, such as requiring formal Board approval of related party transactions and adopting formal written travel and expense reimbursement policies. The Foundation's financial condition was precarious, with liabilities exceeding assets, and it was uncertain whether it would be able to meet its financial and operational responsibilities related to the Memorial Garden and other projects.

1. According to survey data from Greenwich Associates, Pensions & Investments, and Pyramis Global Advisors, a considerable number of pension plans invest in hedge funds or private equity, with about 21-27% of all plans surveyed holding investments in hedge funds and 41-43% in private equity. Private sector plans were more likely to invest in hedge funds than public sector plans, and collectively bargained plans had the highest percentage of hedge fund investments. Private equity investment was more prevalent than hedge fund investment among all plans surveyed.
2. Pension plans invest in hedge funds and private equity to achieve various goals, including reducing volatility, obtaining returns greater than the stock market, and diversifying the portfolio. However, these investments pose challenges, including reliance on manager skill, use of leverage, higher fees, limited transparency and liquidity, and operational risks. Plans mitigate these risks through due diligence, negotiating important investment terms, and investing through funds of funds. Some plans may lack the resources to address the demands of hedge fund and private equity investing, making these investments inappropriate for them.

The report focuses on the most important predictors of occupant injury in a collision: crash type and crash severity, automobile size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender.
2. The number of traffic fatalities and the fatality rate per registered vehicle have decreased sharply in the United States since the mid-1960s. However, in 1991, automobiles were associated with nearly 29,000 traffic deaths.
3. One-car crashes are more dangerous than multivehicle collisions, with one-car rollover crashes being particularly hazardous. Single-car crashes account for about 45% of all automobile occupant fatalities and about 20% of occupant fatalities that did not occur in single-car rollovers.
4. The risk of injury to drivers is significantly affected by impact point. Two-vehicle collisions involving head-on impacts between vehicles moving in opposite directions are much more dangerous than other two-vehicle crashes. The risk of driver injury or death is about five times as great in head-on collisions as in other two-vehicle collisions.
5. Heavier and larger cars are both more crashworthy and more aggressive than lighter and smaller automobiles. However, there is disagreement in the literature about which dimension, weight or exterior size, is more important for occupant safety.
6. The risk of injury to drivers is significantly reduced as car weight and wheelbase increase. The risk of driver hospitalization or death decreases about 14% for every additional 500 pounds of automobile weight and about 13% for each additional 5 inches of wheelbase. The benefits of increasing weight and wheelbase are roughly equivalent in reducing injuries, and there is no statistically significant difference between the injury reduction effects of curb weight and wheelbase.

1. In the mid-1970s, major structural changes in the American economy led to job losses and unemployment. In response, the Clinton administration proposed worker profiling legislation in 1993, which was enacted as the Unemployment Compensation Amendments. This law required states to establish profiling systems to identify claimants most likely to exhaust benefits and refer them to reemployment services. States were required to collect information on services provided and subsequent employment outcomes.
2. The profiling systems use statistical models or characteristic screens to identify claimants. Statistical models consider the combined quantitative influence of various personal and labor market characteristics to produce a claimant's likelihood to exhaust. Characteristic screens treat factors as yes-or-no decision points, and claimants must have each of the screening criteria. Labor encourages the use of statistical models over screens because they are more efficient and precise. Reemployment services can be funded through various sources, including UI administrative funds and Wagner-Peyser Employment Services grants. From 2001 to 2005, Labor provided Reemployment Services grants to all states to enhance and target services.

Medicare is a separate federally financed health insurance program for the elderly, disabled, and those with end-stage kidney disease.
3. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare, but TRICARE covers prescription drugs and offers additional benefits. TRICARE Prime, Extra, and Standard are used by about 1.5 million older military retirees, dependents, and survivors.
4. In 2001, the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act expanded TRICARE benefits for older retirees. They gained access to prescription drugs through TRICARE's National Mail Order Pharmacy and Medicare Part D, and became eligible for TRICARE For Life, which made TRICARE the secondary payer for Medicare-covered services.
5. The Medicare subvention demonstration, established in 1998, allowed DOD to create managed care organizations that participate in the Medicare+Choice program and enroll older retirees. Medicare paid DOD for enrollees' care, but only after DOD spent an equal amount historically on care for all older retirees.
6. The demonstration aimed to test the feasibility of using TRICARE to provide Medicare-covered benefits to older retirees. It was initially expected to cost $50 million in 1998, $60 million in 1999, and $65 million in 2000. However, DOD's costs for Senior Prime enrollees were much higher than the capitation rate, leading to no Medicare payments in 1999.
7. The demonstration ended on December 31, 2001, as the new TRICARE For Life program provided expanded health care coverage to older military retirees",0

2. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the Department of the Treasury to analyze exchange rate policies of major trading partners that have a significant bilateral trade surplus, material current account surplus, and engage in persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market.
3. East Asian exchange rate policies range from fixed or pegged, managed float, to free float. Hong Kong has a linked exchange rate with the US dollar, while Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea have allowed their currencies to float freely. Most East Asian governments adopt managed float policies.
4. A free float policy allows a nation to have more autonomy in its domestic monetary policy but comes with disadvantages such as greater exchange-rate risk, potentially destabilizing balance sheet effects, and possible rapid shifts in capital flows.
5. Pegged exchange rate policies can take several forms, including a currency board system, where a monetary authority holds sufficient reserves to convert the domestic currency into the designated reserve currency at a predetermined exchange rate. Pegged exchange rates eliminate exchange-rate risk but come with disadvantages such as loss of autonomy in domestic monetary policy, potentially rapid changes in domestic prices, and exposure to speculative attacks.

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of endangered or threatened species, resulting in limitations on activities that could affect them and penalties for taking listed species. Federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to determine if their projects might jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify their critical habitat.
2. If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is issued along with reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to avoid jeopardy. To excuse incidental taking of listed species, the Services issue an incidental take statement with reasonable and prudent measures (RPMs) to minimize project effects. When federal actions cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species, exemptions may be sought.
3. The exemption process offers the opportunity to consider economic circumstances and provides a chance for economic factors to override jeopardy to the species. However, exemptions apply to federal projects, not species, and require that affected species be conserved in their remaining habitat.
4. The exemption process was created in response to the Tellico Dam controversy in Tennessee, where the Supreme Court mandated that the dam gates not be closed due to the impact on the snail darter, a small fish. Congress amended the ESA to include a process for balancing national interests in protecting listed species against important federal projects.
5. The exemption process is complex and time-consuming, involving multiple steps, including application submission, Secretary review, formal hearings, and ESC decision-making. Even with a successful exemption, other underlying issues related to natural resources and conflicting laws may still exist.

1. The net capital loss limitation was enacted to prevent taxpayers from minimizing their income taxes by selectively realizing capital losses and deferring gains. The current system allows taxpayers to deduct up to $3,000 of net capital losses against ordinary income annually, with excess losses carried forward. However, this rule introduces inconsistencies because net long-term losses can be deducted against short-term gains, which can be taxed at higher rates, and against up to $3,000 of ordinary income, while the maximum tax rate on long-term gains is 15%.
2. The tax treatment of capital losses has undergone significant changes throughout history, with the current system featuring asymmetrical treatment of long-term gains and losses. Some argue that increasing the net capital loss limitation could stimulate the economy by restoring confidence in the stock market or providing an economic stimulus. However, the empirical evidence suggests that the benefits would primarily accrue to higher income individuals, and the short-term incentive to sell stocks could depress stock prices further. To achieve symmetry in the system, the tax rate differential between short and long-term gains and losses should be accounted for during the netting process. Alternatively, a tax credit for capital losses could be implemented to benefit lower-income taxpayers who mostly do not report capital gains and losses.

1. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) recognizes the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through their chosen representatives.
2. The NLRA aims to mitigate labor-related obstructions to commerce by encouraging collective bargaining.
3. The NLRA applies to ""employees,"" but not to individuals employed as supervisors.
4. The term ""supervisor"" is defined as an individual with authority to perform certain functions requiring independent judgment.
5. In Kentucky River Community Care, the U.S. Supreme Court established a three-part test for determining supervisory status: holding the authority to engage in a supervisory function, exercising independent judgment, and acting in the employer's interest.
6. The Court in Kentucky River disagreed with the NLRB's characterization of ""ordinary professional or technical judgment"" as failing to be independent judgment, as it would eliminate most supervisors from the Act.
7. In Oakwood Healthcare, the NLRB clarified the terms ""assign,"" ""responsibly to direct,"" and ""independent judgment"" as they apply to supervisors under the NLRA.
8. Section 8(a)(1) and 8(b)(1)(A) of the NLRA prohibit employers and unions from interfering with employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining, including through threats, coercion, or violence.
9. Employers and unions are generally allowed to express their views about unionization, but cannot make threats or promises that infringe on employees' rights.
10. The NLRB considers several factors when determining if an employer's interrogation of employees reasonably tends to restrain or interfere with their rights under the NLRA.
11. Unions have been found to violate section 8(b)(1)(A) for engaging in coercive conduct, such as encouraging employees to quit or threatening job security.
12. Employers are generally allowed to make anti-union speeches on their premises, but last-minute speeches and distribution of union literature on company property are prohibited.

Established in 1967, ASEAN has grown into one of the world's largest regional forums, representing a strategically and economically important region.
2. The Obama Administration aims to expand and upgrade U.S. relations with Southeast Asia and ASEAN, addressing past criticisms of neglect and insufficient commitment to multilateral dialogue. The United States has deep-seated interests in the region, including maritime security, democracy and human rights, trade, and counterterrorism.
3. China's growing economic and cultural ties in Southeast Asia have led to increased competition with the United States, making the region a site of ""soft power"" rivalry. Other external powers, such as Japan, the EU, and India, have also shown renewed interest in the region.
4. Engagement with ASEAN is a foreign policy dilemma for the United States, as strong bilateral ties with individual nations do not necessarily offset the perception of insufficient commitment to the organization as a whole. The United States has taken symbolic steps to engage more with ASEAN, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visits and accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.
5. ASEAN was founded in 1967 to promote economic growth, regional peace and security, collaboration, and multilateralism. It has since expanded to include 10 members and has created the ASEAN Secretariat to administer its activities. The organization operates on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members.
6. ASEAN faces challenges in maintaining its strategic role in the region, including the emergence of China and India as great powers, the evolving correlates of power in Asia, and the need to balance external actors while avoiding antagonizing great powers. The United States and ASEAN share a mutual interest in preventing conflict and maintaining the independence of regional states.

1. In 2009, there was renewed interest in imposing new import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs) due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes. Advocates argue that stricter import controls would prevent unlimited importation of milk protein, encourage domestic production, and raise milk prices for farmers. Opponents contend that these measures would increase costs for food manufacturers and result in higher retail food prices.
2. The United States imports a significant amount of MPCs, with New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union being major suppliers. Imports are classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and are subject to very low tariffs. In the early 2000s, attempts were made to change the tariff treatment of MPCs, but these efforts were unsuccessful. More recent legislative proposals aim to establish tariff rate quotas (TRQs) and impose duties on excess imports. Enactment of such legislation would likely require compensation negotiations with affected WTO member countries.

High risk health insurance pools (HRPs) are state-established programs designed to provide health coverage for individuals who cannot obtain or afford insurance in the private market due to preexisting health conditions. These pools were first established in the mid-1970s and have been expanding since the 1990s.
2. HRPs target individuals who have been denied coverage or received quotes with exclusions or higher premiums in the individual market. They also help states comply with HIPAA provisions that require insurance coverage for individuals moving from the group to individual market, and prohibit exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions.
3. State-established HRPs generally enroll a small percentage of the uninsured population, with approximately 200,000 individuals enrolled in 2008, but potentially eligible for enrollment was nearly 4 million. HRPs function as a safety net for the nongroup market by ensuring access to health insurance for those able and willing to pay.
4. HRPs operate at a loss and rely on various funding sources, including assessments on insurers, general revenue, and federal grants. Premiums are capped, and benefits offered reflect coverage available in the private nongroup market. Eligibility criteria vary, but generally include HIPAA-eligible individuals and those with costly medical conditions.

1. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a program established in 1951 that allows the Departments of Defense and Transportation to work together to manage civilian aircraft for military airlift needs during emergencies. CRAF participants must be U.S. carriers fully certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and commit at least 30% of their passenger fleet and 15% of their cargo fleet to the program. Aircraft committed must be U.S. registered and carriers must maintain crews for each aircraft.
2. The CRAF program has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. Commercial airliners capable of transoceanic operations make up the long-range international section, while medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft support near offshore airlift requirements in the short-range international section. The domestic segment is designed for increased DOD airlift requirements in the United States during an emergency, and the aeromedical evacuation segment assists in the evacuation of casualties from operational theaters to hospitals in the continental United States.
3. The benefits of CRAF for DOD include its relatively low cost compared to maintaining a larger organic fleet, as it provides up to half of the nation's strategic airlift capability without the government having to buy additional aircraft or pay for personnel and maintenance costs during peacetime. However, commercial aircraft have operational limitations, such as shorter range and lack of roll on/roll off capability, and potential hostile fire can deter civilian crews from entering combat zones. The cost-effectiveness of CRAF is illustrated by the use of CRAF aircraft during Operation Desert Storm, which cost $1.5 billion compared to the estimated $15-50 billion cost of acquiring and maintaining additional military aircraft.

2. The poverty rate tends to follow the economic cycle, rising during economic downturns and falling during economic growth. The most recent recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, resulted in high poverty rates that have yet to return to pre-recession levels.
3. Non-aged adults and children were disproportionately affected by the recession. The poverty rate for non-aged adults reached a record high of 13.8% in 2010 and remained statistically unchanged at 13.6% in 2013. The poverty rate for children fell slightly from 21.3% in 2012 to 19.5% in 2013, but remains above its pre-recession low of 16.9%.
4. The poverty rate for the aged (9.5%) was statistically unchanged from 2012, but the number of poor aged persons grew by an estimated 305,000. Despite the recession, the aged poverty rate remains near a historic low.

3. Federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, own and manage large water infrastructure projects, while most of the nation's water infrastructure is privately owned or owned by non-federal units of government.
4. Since 9/11, federal dam operators have been on high-alert, and security threats are under constant review, with coordination efforts with the National Guard and local law enforcement officials ongoing.
5. Drinking water and wastewater utilities have primary responsibility to assess their vulnerabilities and prioritize security improvements, with most having emergency preparedness plans that address issues such as redundancy, public notification, and coordination with law enforcement and emergency response officials.
6. Water infrastructure was identified as one of eight critical infrastructure systems in President Clinton's 1998 PDD-63, and efforts to safeguard water supplies from terrorist acts began in 2000 with partnerships between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), American Metropolitan Water Association (AMWA), and American Water Works Association (AWWA).

President Clinton proposed a National Fire Plan in 2000, which was largely enacted, and President Bush proposed the Healthy Forests Initiative in 2002, leading to the Healthy Forests Restoration Act in 2003.
2. Federal funding for wildfire protection has risen significantly since 2000, with a substantial portion going towards protecting federal lands managed by the USDA Forest Service (FS) and the Department of the Interior (DOI).
3. The FS was created in 1905 and initially focused on halting wildfires in national forests following large fires in Montana and Idaho. Its policies prioritized fast, aggressive control to prevent large, destructive fires.
4. In the 1970s, concerns about the ecological benefits of wildfires led to challenges to the FS's aggressive fire control policies, and the Office of Management and Budget questioned proposed budget increases based on these policies.

1. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (LMR) requires federally inspected packers to report prices and other information on livestock and meat purchases to the USDA. The act was first enacted in 1999 and has been reauthorized several times since then. The goal is to provide accurate and objective market information for all buyers and sellers. Before LMR, USDA collected livestock and meat price information on a voluntary basis. However, as the livestock industry underwent changes in the 1990s, fewer animals were sold through negotiated sales, and more were sold under alternative marketing arrangements, making it difficult for producers to determine fair market prices.

1. Approximately 766 million acres of forests in the United States are owned privately (58%), and the federal government supports forest management on these lands through various programs. The Forest Service (FS) in the USDA primarily administers these programs, with assistance from state partners. Forestry assistance programs have been in place for over a century, with the first efforts beginning in 1881.
2. To be eligible for funding, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, which includes a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term strategy for addressing threats. The programs provide technical and financial assistance, with technical assistance including guidance, skills training, and technological innovations, and financial assistance through grants or cost-sharing.
3. Most forestry assistance programs are funded through the FS's State and Private Forestry (SPF) account, with some programs funded from other accounts or programs. The average annual appropriation for these programs from FY2004 to FY2018 was $362.7 million, but funding has declined in recent years, with $355.1 million appropriated in FY2018. The Administration requested $197.4 million in FY2019, and some programs have been repealed or unfunded by Congress.
4. Other agencies, such as the USDA Farm Services Agency and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, also administer programs with forest conservation or protection benefits. These programs include the Emergency Forest Restoration program and the Healthy Forest Reserve program, respectively. The Department of the Interior administers a community assistance program to mitigate wildfire risk.

1. Transnational organized crime groups, including those involved in drug trafficking, human trafficking, gun trafficking, wildlife trafficking, and gem and timber smuggling, thrive in Burma, generating several billion dollars annually.
2. The country's large extra-legal economy and illicit border trade make it difficult to assess the size and structure of Burma's economy. Corruption among officials in the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), facilitates trafficking and provides criminal groups with immunity from law enforcement and judicial action.
3. The United States has long been interested in U.S. policy toward Burma due to issues related to transnational crime. Burma is listed as a major drug-producing state and a source of international trafficking in persons and illicit goods, making it ineligible for U.S. foreign assistance under several legislative provisions.
4. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions against Burma, including the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, which imposes further sanctions on SPDC officials and prohibits the indirect import of Burmese gems. The 111th Congress may continue to show interest in oversight of U.S. policy toward Burma.
5. The United Wa State Army (UWSA), Shan State Army-South (SSA-S), Shan State Army-North (SSA-N), Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DBKA), ethnic Chinese criminal groups, and other armed groups have criminal networks that stretch from India to Malaysia and up into China. Many of these groups are linked to past or ongoing ethnic insurgencies.
6. Corruption is rampant in Burma, with officials, especially army and police personnel in the border areas, believed to be involved in smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of corruption. Burma is the third-most corrupt country in the world according to Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index. The weak implementation of anti-money laundering controls remains a significant issue, allowing narcotics traffickers and other criminal elements to use Burmese financial institutions.

2. In a business reorganization under chapter 11, the debtor generally remains in possession, and no trustee is appointed, allowing those most familiar with the business to continue managing it.
3. The Bankruptcy Code provides debtors the opportunity to assume or reject executory contracts, including collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), but the process for rejecting CBAs is more complex.
4. Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code outlines the requirements for rejecting a CBA and applies only to chapter 11 bankruptcies.
5. The section was added in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in National Labor Relations Board v. Bildisco and Bildisco, which established a standard for CBA rejection.

3. Gross job loss and gains each average around 20 times the net job loss (or gains) in any given quarter.
4. Small businesses accounted for a disproportionate share of both gross job gains and losses, but had a net gain of 46.3% of total employment between 1992 and 2005.
5. Trade liberalization has not caused net job loss historically, as shown in Figure 3, despite the increase in imports as a percentage of GDP.
6. Mass layoffs tend to be cyclical and are an important but not primary cause of unemployment.
7. Economic downturns are characterized by insufficient aggregate spending, leading to capital idleness and worker layoffs until spending revives.
8. Policymakers can use expansionary fiscal or monetary policy to stimulate aggregate spending and offset net job loss.
9. Gross job loss poses no market failure in and of itself, but market failures in unemployment insurance may prevent individuals from efficiently insuring against the risks of job loss.
10. Government provision of unemployment insurance solves the adverse selection problem by making participation universal and mitigates moral hazard by making insurance temporary and imposing eligibility restrictions.

1. The study compared the effects of two commonly used strategies, gelc-ms/ms with repetitive injections and additional protein prefractionation using microsol IEF, on depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates. Both strategies were found to have excellent reproducibility and substantially improved proteome coverage using the 3-d method compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.
2. Microsol IEF was evaluated for its utility in prefractionating cell lysates prior to gelc-ms/ms as it is orthogonal to sds-page and does not suffer from many of the limitations of 2-d gels. The 3-d method using microsol IEF, sds-page, and lc-ms/ms identified 3486 proteins with two or more peptides, which is 22.3% more than the 2-d/repetitive method using equal amounts of mass spectrometer time. Additionally, the 3-d method identified nearly 2.5 times more high-confidence, nonredundant peptides and more unique peptides for most low-abundance proteins compared with the cumulative 2-d method data.
</summary>

Explanation:
The first point summarizes the main findings of the study, which were that both strategies, gelc-ms/ms with repetitive injections and additional protein prefractionation using microsol IEF, had excellent reproducibility and substantially improved proteome coverage using the 3-d method compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.

The second point explains why the 3-d method using microsol IEF, sds-page, and lc-ms/ms identified more proteins and peptides than the 2-d/repetitive method. Microsol IEF separates proteins that would normally be in a single gel slice into four gel slices, which decreases ion suppression effects and reduces dynamic range within each digest. Additionally, the 3-d method probably had lower probability of interfering ions being isolated with the target ion for fragmentation. While the repetitive analysis strategy also improved proteome coverage, it had no built-in mechanism to reduce",0

1. The study compared the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage after tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (SMUPPP) at a medical institution. The study found that the incidence of delayed hemorrhage was significantly lower in the SMUPPP group (1.45%) compared to the tonsillectomy group (5.05%).
2. The study also noted that the SMUPPP technique, which includes submucosal tonsillectomy, has a lower incidence of postoperative delayed hemorrhage compared to tonsillectomy using unipolar cautery in adult patients. The authors suggest the routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.
</summary>

The study reviewed medical records of 404 patients who underwent tonsillectomy or SMUPPP between 2001 and 2010. The incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was 5.05% in the tonsillectomy group and 1.45% in the SMUPPP group, showing a statistically significant difference. The study also noted that the rate of postoperative bleeding after SMUPPP falls within the range reported in the literature (0.6%-14.0%). When electrocautery tonsillectomy and SMUPP groups were compared, a significant difference in the rate of hemorrhage was apparent. The increased rate of hemorrhage in the tonsillectomy group could not be attributed to any factor other than the operative techniques used. Suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPP seemed to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Bipolar cauterization followed by tacking with 3-0 vicryl sutures may also have decreased the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Suturing of the tonsillar pillars is the only influencing factor detected that may have lowered the bleeding incidence. Double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence. Submuc",0

2. miRNAs, such as mir-125a, mir-206, mir-145, mir-21, and mir-10b, have been identified as playing important roles in breast cancer invasion and development due to their functions similar to oncogenes or anti-oncogenes.
3. Some miRNAs, like mir-125a and mir-206, act as anti-oncogenes and inhibit the metastatic and invasive abilities of breast cancer cells by targeting specific mRNAs. For instance, mir-125a inhibits the protein levels of her-2 and her-3, while mir-206 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells by lowering the expression levels of er and er co-regulatory proteins.
4. Other miRNAs, such as mir-21 and mir-10b, act as oncogenes and promote the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. For example, eliminating mir-21 gene fragments can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells, and mir-10b can effectively inhibit the metastasis of malignant breast cancer cells with high specificity.

2. Mononuclear leukocytes isolated from renal blood vessels of control animals and isogenic and allogenic renal transplants were analyzed for tgm2 mRNA expression using real-time RT-PCR. An elevated level of tgm2 mRNA was detected in cells collected from allografts on day 9 and day 42 after transplantation compared to respective isografts.
3. Protein expression of tgm2 was investigated by immunoblotting of lysates of mononuclear intravascular leukocytes isolated from control animals and isogenic or allogenic renal transplants, as well as of total tissue lysates. Elevated levels of tgm2 expression were detected in blood mononuclear leukocytes isolated from isografts on day 9 compared to cells from control kidneys and in perfusates from allografts on day 9 compared to respective isograft samples.
4. Immunohistochemical staining on paraffin sections from control kidneys, isografts, and allografts explanted on day 9 after transplantation revealed that tgm2-positive cells were most abundant in the vasculature of day 9 allografts. Double staining experiments with mab ed1 detecting cd68-like antigen identified graft monocytes as strongly tgm2-immunopositive.
5. The increase in tgm2 expression in mononuclear blood leukocytes from day 9 allografts is not solely due to the increase in the proportion of monocytes, as isograft blood leukocytes contain about 50% monocytes and allografts about 70%, whereas tgm2 mRNA expression levels increase by about 10-fold.

1. Endothelial cells were grown and stimulated to produce extracellular microvesicles (EMPs), which were collected and characterized using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
2. Counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical CVVH filter removed EMPs from a model patient's circulation, supporting the idea of CVVH as a therapeutic intervention for ali.
3. The experimental conditions achieved plasma levels of EMPs similar to those seen in human clinical disease (110 per ml).
4. The observed EMP clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon, with relatively constant EMP concentration from 40 to 70 minutes and low dialysate EMP levels.
5. The low dialysate EMP level and plateauing circulation EMP level beyond 40 minutes suggest that EMP sequestration occurs within the CVVH filter or tubing.
6. Frequent filter changes or conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to commercially available specialty CVVH filters could overcome these limitations and improve EMP clearance.
7. Clinical data support the protective role of CVVH in ali management, including improved outcomes from ali and prevention of volume overload.
8. Standard dialysis alone was effective in removing EMPs due to their small size in an in vitro model.

4. Recent studies have found kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb during performance of specific motor tasks.
5. Possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits include disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, or different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.

The clinical diagnosis of PD can be challenging, especially in mild or uncertain cases, and it is important for accurate management and prognostication.
2. Molecular imaging techniques using PET or SPECT have improved diagnostic accuracy for PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and sympathetic innervation of the heart have become popular tools in clinical practice.

1. The text describes a case of a 73-year-old Korean man who presented with a perianal nodule caused by a tick belonging to the genus Amblyomma, specifically Amblyomma testudinarium. The patient had visited a water reservoir in a rural area of South Korea before the onset of symptoms.
2. The tick was identified through histopathological examination and was found to be a female adult, 25 mm in length and 18 mm in width, with a small ornate scutum and long pedipalps. The tick was deeply embedded in the skin, causing an intense skin reaction and a characteristic feeding lesion.
3. Amblyomma testudinarium is known to infest a wide variety of vertebrates and has been reported to bite humans in Asian countries, including Malaysia and Korea. The tick is more common in tropical and subtropical areas, including South East Asia and the Indian peninsula. In Korea, it is distributed in the southern coastal areas and Jeju Island.
4. The text discusses the anatomy and behavior of ticks, explaining how they embed their anterior part into the skin and lacerate the epidermis using their chelicerae. The cement material secreted by the salivary glands helps the tick attach to the host during feeding. The distribution of cement within the host tissue varies among tick species, with Amblyomma and Hyalomma having a perirostral secretion of cement.

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by left and right ventricular hypertrophy, predominantly involving the interventricular septum, and caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins, with cardiac troponin T (Tnnt2) being one of the major genes implicated.
2. Tnnt2 mutations are associated with a severe form of HCM, characterized by a poor overall prognosis and a high incidence of sudden death despite only mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Most Tnnt2 mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle, specifically the calcium sensitivity of force development and ATPase activity.
3. Previous studies suggested that certain genetic mutations are predictive of a benign or malignant clinical outcome in HCM, but recent research indicates that the specific gene mutation is not the sole factor determining clinical phenotype. Sudden death in youth is observed in all families with Tnnt2 mutations, regardless of the type of mutation.
4. Genetic testing and risk stratification based on specific mutations are clinically informative, but more attention should be paid to observing patients in detail from birth in each lineage and searching for modifier and environmental factors, including diet, lifestyle, exercise, and modification genes and polymorphisms, to improve treatment and outcomes for individuals with HCM.

1. Schistosomatidae, a family of digenean trematodes, includes parasites with complex life cycles that alternate between intermediate (freshwater gastropods) and definitive hosts (birds, reptiles, fishes, and mammals). Schistosoma species, the avian and mammalian blood flukes, are the most studied genus, with six human-infecting species: S. haematobium, S. intercalatum, S. japonicum, S. malayensis, S. mansoni, and S. mekongi. Schistosomiasis, caused by these parasites, is a chronic and debilitating disease and a major public health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide.
2. Genomic and transcriptomic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of schistosome biology and evolution. The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of several schistosoma species have been sequenced, revealing important insights into their genetic makeup and evolutionary relationships. Comparative genomics and transcriptomics have identified conserved features and unique gene order rearrangements, providing valuable information for phylogenetic studies. Mitochondrial genes have been used as molecular markers for species identification and population genetics studies.
3. Transcriptomic analyses have been essential for studying gene expression and identifying splicing variants, which are crucial for parasite adaptation to diverse environments and evading the immune system. Alternative splicing and transsplicing have been shown to generate protein variation and impact gene function, especially in sexual dimorphism and transcriptional control. RNA interference (RNAi) techniques have been used to study gene function and identify potential drug targets, such as peroxiredoxins and thioredoxin glutathione reductases. New tools, such as lentiviruses and transposons, are being developed for gene expression studies and potential gene therapy applications.

1. The text discusses a study conducted to determine predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sclm). The study analyzed medical records of 86 patients who underwent simultaneous resection of primary colorectal and hepatic tumors, and compared their complications with those of 167 patients who underwent hepatectomy for metachronous liver metastases and 1,728 patients who underwent only resection for colorectal cancer. The study found that operation time greater than 8 hours was the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sclm.
2. The text also discusses the controversy surrounding the optimal surgical strategy for treating resectable sclm, with simultaneous resection and staged resections being the two main options. Simultaneous resection can simplify and shorten the treatment schedule, while staged resections offer a chance to evaluate liver or extrahepatic metastases between the two operations. The text suggests that recent advances in colorectal and hepatic surgery have made simultaneous resection safer, and that the overall complication rate has been reduced with no change in operative mortality. However, staged resections are still frequently performed due to perceived lower perioperative risk and the potential to identify patients for whom hepatic resection would offer no survival benefit.

2. Wheeler and Edmonson introduced the term CHFC and identified its specific characteristics, including a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule.
3. Approximately 103 cases of CHFC have been reported worldwide, with only four describing laparoscopic excision.
4. A 32-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of right upper quadrant pain and underwent successful laparoscopic excision of a CHFC.
5. The cyst was found adherent to the liver by a small pedicle, leading to a complete excision instead of deroofing.
6. CHFCs are rare, with most reported cases in the last 25 years due to improved imaging techniques. They are most commonly found in segment iv of the left lobe, are usually unilocular and solitary, and have a mean greatest dimension of 4 cm and a median of 3 cm.
7. CHFCs are most frequently located superficially in the median segments of the liver, are rarely multi-loculated or septated, and are mostly asymptomatic. They can be differentiated from other hepatic cysts by their specific histological features.
8. The recommended treatment for CHFCs varies from observation to surgical excision, with most agreeing that larger, symptomatic, or enlarging lesions should be excised. Laparoscopic excision is best suited for lesions in segments ii to vi, and minimally invasive approaches can be effective for stopping cyst growth.

The text discusses the histological features of these conditions, specifically focusing on the presence of increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in both CD and HP infection.
2. The text reports that CD patients without HP infection had the highest proportion of lymphocytic gastritis (LG), followed by CD patients with HP infection, HP positive patients without CD, and none in the control group. HP infected patients had the highest number of lymphoid aggregates in the antrum, irrespective of CD status. CD patients with or without HP infection had increased mean numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ IELs compared to controls.
3. The text also investigates the differential contribution of HP infection to LG in an inflammatory condition like CD by examining the gastric tissue inflammatory subpopulation profile. CD patients with associated HP infection showed a lower rate of LG, which might be explained by HP converting the immune response towards a Th2 response and suppressing the Th1 immune response.
4. The text suggests that in undiagnosed patients with histological features compatible with LG, higher counts of CD8+ IELs may imply a diagnosis of CD rather than HP gastritis, and the number of lymphoid follicles may direct toward the diagnosis of HP infection. The study confirms the published results that CD8+/CD4 IELs are involved significantly in the pathogenesis of CD, and nk cells may play a negligible role in these two pathologies.

6. The findings showed that group I patients had higher total and LDL cholesterol levels before surgery and enhanced oxidative stress, as indicated by elevated MDA levels [1]. However, no significant decrease in LOOH and MDA concentrations was observed after surgery. The total antioxidant capacity (expressed as Frap) and thiol group concentrations were similar in both groups before surgery. A decrease in Frap level and thiol group concentrations was observed in group I patients 35 days and 710 days after surgery, respectively. Simvastatin therapy led to a higher ceruloplasmin oxidase activity in group II patients 710 days after surgery.

4. The oral administration of fijk to rats did not significantly change their average body weights or relative organ weights, but it caused a significant reduction in rat plasma protein levels at double and triple doses.
5. The lipid profile revealed that oral exposure to fijk at the highest dosage caused a significant elevation in rat plasma triglyceride levels and a significant depletion of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), leading to an elevated atherogenic index.
6. The rat plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were significantly elevated by exposure to repeated administration of fijk mixture, indicating liver toxicity. Additionally, the rat plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was significantly reduced in the group that received the highest dose of fijk, possibly due to inactivation or decreased protein synthesis.
</summary>

The study also found that oral and repeated exposure to fijk herbal mixture caused lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by a significant elevation in rat plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and a depleted level of reduced glutathione (GSH), a nonenzymatic antioxidant. The histopathological examination of rat liver sections revealed hepatic alterations, including hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, hyperemia, and inflammation. These findings support the biochemical alterations caused by oral and repeated exposure to fijk herbal mixture and are consistent with previous reports of organ toxicity caused by herbal formulations.",0

1. Preconceptional carrier screening allows couples to identify genetic risks before pregnancy and consider reproductive options. This can include prenatal diagnosis, termination, adoption, or refraining from having children.
2. Carrier screening and testing are two approaches to identifying carriers. Carrier screening is for individuals without an increased risk, while carrier testing is for those with a higher a priori risk based on personal or family history.
3. Preconceptional carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been studied extensively and received positive attitudes from healthcare providers, patients, and the public. It was recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) over a decade ago.
4. However, traditional healthcare systems have hesitated to implement population-wide carrier screening due to concerns such as psychological impact, stigmatization, impairment of freedom of choice, medicalization, difficulty in reaching couples before conception, and provider-related barriers.
5. Commercial companies now offer direct-to-consumer (DTC) preconceptional carrier tests for autosomal recessive disorders, which do not make a distinction between individuals with low or high a priori probability of having an affected child.
6. The Health Council of the Netherlands emphasized the need for responsible criteria for offering genetic DTC screening, extending the original genetic screening criteria to include a wider population and the opportunity to be tested through advertising or promotion.
7. DTC genetic testing companies offer large panels of disorders, challenging the established specifications of a significant health problem and a suitable test with known predictive value. The clinical validity and utility of testing for some disorders are debatable, and companies may base inclusion criteria on technical and economic aspects rather than policy considerations.
8. It is crucial for individuals to receive necessary information about the purpose, reproductive choices, reliability, limitations, psychological impact, and potential consequences of the test. Privacy and confidentiality, as well as informed decision-making, should be discussed. A non-directive approach is necessary with potential users.

1. The most common reasons for implant removal were pain or discomfort (39.75%), infection (28.91%), and patient insistence (12.04%). The mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher than those with pain or implant failure.
2. Implant removal due to infection was often necessary when non-operative treatments were unsuccessful or when the infection had progressed to the point where removal was the only logical option. Infections were typically late, caused by hematogenous seeding of the implant from various sources.
3. The surgical procedures for implant removal carry risks of fracture, neurovascular injury, and infection. While there are arguments for removal due to metal allergy, corrosion, carcinogenesis, and metal ion toxicity, concrete proof has not been produced for any of these reasons. Despite the risks, implant removal is necessary for a significant subset of patients.

Explanation:

1. The text states that the most common reasons for implant removal were pain or discomfort (39.75%), infection (28.91%), and patient insistence (12.04%). The mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher than those with pain or implant failure.
2. The text explains that some patients with implant infections had been treated non-operatively for varying lengths of time to control the infection but without success, while others presented for the first time at a stage where removing the implant was the only logical option. Infections were typically late, caused by hematogenous seeding of the implant from various sources such as skin, respiratory, dental, and urogenital infections.
3. The text mentions that the surgical procedures for implant removal carry risks of fracture, neurovascular injury, and infection. While there are arguments for removal due to metal allergy, corrosion, carcinogenesis, and metal ion toxicity, concrete proof has not been produced for any of these reasons. Despite the risks, implant removal is necessary for a significant subset of patients.",0

1. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve atrophy. Factors contributing to glaucoma include high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
2. Müller cells, the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina, support and nourish RGCs, maintain extracellular ion homeostasis, and interact in synaptic transmission.
3. Müller cells are involved in multiple pathological retinal diseases, including glaucoma, and can aggravate retinal damage by releasing inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
4. Increased TNF-α production by Müller cells contributes to neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
5. In a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH), aoh induced RGC apoptosis and decreased RGC number, while aaa treatment attenuated RGC apoptosis and rescued the reduced RGC number, demonstrating protective effects on AOH retinas.
6. Müller cells were activated in the AOH model, as indicated by increased gfap immunoreactivity, and aaa treatment attenuated gfap immunoreactivity and reduced retinal TNF-α levels, suggesting that aaa promoted RGC survival through the inhibition of aoh-induced Müller cell gliosis and downregulation of TNF-α protein production.
7. Aminoacidic acid (aaa) could be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
8. The study aimed to determine if aaa treatment inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of AOH.

1. Five patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFTR-L) for nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms between June 2015 and September 2015.
2. The procedure involves identifying the target lesion using a forward-viewing endoscope, ligation of the tumor with a ligation device, temporary laparoscopic suturing, and endoscopic resection under the ligation band.
3. Despite the lack of a seromuscular layer, provisional and additional sutures prevent exposure of the abdominal cavity to malignant cells, and vessels are ligated during the closure of the defect in the duodenal wall.
4. The mean operative time was 173 minutes, and the mean diameter of the resected specimen was 24 mm, with a mean tumor size of 9 mm.
5. Complete resection was achieved in all cases, and full-thickness resection was histologically confirmed.
6. Conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) could be a curative strategy for superficial duodenal neoplasms, but complete resection is challenging, especially for flat or non-lifting lesions.
7. Delayed perforation in the duodenum can cause potentially fatal complications, making duodenal ESD not a standard clinical procedure.
8. LAPFTR-L has two advantages: the resected specimen can be collected intraluminally, avoiding peritoneal exposure of tumor cells, and it does not require proficient experience in ESD.

1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic condition caused by defects in enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases being caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). In patients with 21-OHD, some precursors are shunted into the androgen synthetic pathway, leading to signs and symptoms of androgen excess. CAH has been effectively managed since the discovery of cortisone in the 1950s.
2. The typical medical treatment for CAH consists of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. However, adrenal masses have been found in some patients with CAH, and two of the four reported cases in the text underwent adrenalectomy due to increasing adrenal mass size and virilization.
3. CAH is a group of autosomal recessive conditions caused by deletions or mutations of the cytochrome p450 21-hydroxylase gene. The pathophysiology of CAH due to 21-OHD is closely linked to the degree of enzyme deficiency, leading to a state of hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism combined with catecholamine deficiency and several metabolic disturbances.
4. CAH is classified into classic, non-classic, salt-losing, and non-salt-losing forms based on the severity and presentation of symptoms. Classic CAH is characterized by a congenital decrease of cortisol and aldosterone secretion and an increase in androgen biosynthesis, leading to ambiguous genitalia in females and varying signs of androgen excess in males. Non-classic CAH may be asymptomatic or manifest later in childhood or early adulthood with signs of hyperandrogenism.

1. Self-rated health (SRH) has been shown to predict mortality and is a valid tool to assess health status and functional ability. SRH is often measured using a single question asking participants to rate their overall health on a five-point scale.
2. Poor SRH is associated with poor management of chronic diseases, such as tiredness/weakness, depression, and musculoskeletal pains. Lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases.
3. Dietary patterns, such as high consumption of fruits and vegetables, have been linked to a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and improved quality of life. Physical activity guidelines recommend being active most days of the week to attain 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week.
4. The relationship between SRH and lifestyle behaviors, including diet and physical activity, has been extensively studied and shown to be significant. Females, older adults, obese individuals, non-Hispanic blacks, and those with comorbidities are more likely to report poor SRH. Low fruits and vegetable intake, high fat intake, and low physical activity are associated with poor SRH in both males and females.

1. Endoscopic injection of Dextranomer / hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA) using the Deflux product has expanded as a treatment option for pediatric Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) with success rates ranging from 55-89%. The technique is popular due to its ease, short procedure time, and repeatability.
2. Pic cystography, a positional instillation of contrast, has been developed to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent UTIs and has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystograms. Intraoperative pic cystograms can predict a successful surgical outcome by correlating the results with a standard 2-month postprocedure vcug.
3. The study compared two different pic cystography techniques and evaluated their usefulness in detecting de novo contralateral VUR in the case of preoperative unilateral VUR and in predicting a successful surgical outcome after Dx/HA injection. The results showed an 80% correlation between a negative intraoperative cystogram and postoperative cystogram, and the success rate of 75% for patients and 80% for renal units could not be significantly improved.

1. Ventriculomegaly, a condition characterized by an enlargement of the fetal ventricles, can be detected using ultrasound but has limitations such as maternal obesity, oligohydramnios, and skull bone ossification affecting sensitivity. Fetal MRI has emerged as an adjunct to ultrasound, particularly in cases of ventriculomegaly, due to its excellent contrast resolution and ability to directly visualize the cortical region. MRI can detect additional cerebral anomalies, such as intraventricular hemorrhage, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and cortical malformations, which are important for prognosis and parental counseling.
2. MRI is a sensitive technique for detecting small intraventricular blood deposits, which may indicate an intraventricular hemorrhage as a cause of hydrocephaly. It is also useful for morpho- and volumetric assessment of the fossa posterior and for detecting developmental anomalies such as vermis hypoplasia, Dandy-Walker malformations, and Chiari malformations. MRI is ideal for cortical evaluation due to its excellent tissue contrast and absence of bony interference. In the second trimester, MRI can detect small foci of brain hemorrhage or callosal anomalies in fetuses diagnosed with cerebral ventriculomegaly. Later in pregnancy, MRI adds information about normal and pathological cortical development and maturation and is a more sensitive imaging modality to detect white matter pathology.

2. Early-stage disease is often asymptomatic, and lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, with 56% of cases having distant metastasis at diagnosis.
3. Bone is a common site of metastasis in lung cancer patients, and these bone metastases can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain.
4. The present study aimed to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and SREs on mortality among older lung cancer patients using a combined population-based cancer registry and Medicare claims database.
5. The study identified a cohort of patients aged 65 and older with a new diagnosis of lung cancer between July 1, 1999, and December 31, 2005, and used SEER and Medicare data to determine possible occurrence of bone metastasis, SREs, and deaths through December 31, 2006.
6. The study found that having a bone metastasis, as indicated by Medicare claims, was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer. However, there was no difference in mortality between patients with bone metastasis complicated by SREs and those with bone metastasis but without SREs.

1. The text discusses a study comparing the effect of different smear layer removal methods on the bond strength of self-adhesive cement using fiber posts. The null hypothesis was that no significant differences would be found among the groups.
2. The study used 55 extracted maxillary central incisors, which were cleaned and prepared using a rotary system and irrigated with various solutions or a photodynamic diode laser. The post spaces were treated with saline, sodium hypochlorite, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, or the laser.
3. The results showed that the higher bond strength values were obtained for the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups. The smear layer removal methods affected the bond strength of the fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin (p<.05). The smear layer should be removed to increase antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness, but in the photodynamic diode laser group, bond strength was higher than the other groups except for the h3po4 group without smear layer removal. This may be due to the fact that collagen fibrils are more stable and less affected by dehydration, allowing for better infiltration of the luting agent. Sodium hypochlorite and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid were not as effective in removing the smear layer as orthophosphoric acid. The use of laser devices in root canal treatment has been slow due to concerns about thermal damage, but lower irradiation power was used in this study to improve bonding effectiveness at the cement-dentin interface without causing temperature rise.

2. The human microbiome project and metagenomics of the human intestinal tract consortium aim to characterize microbial communities in multiple human body sites and look for correlations with diseases.
3. Studies have shown that the human gut flora belongs mainly to two phyla: firmicutes and bacteroidetes, with smaller representations of proteobacteria and actinobacteria. Archaea, mostly represented by methanogenic methanobrevibacter smithii, have also been discovered.
4. The composition of the bacterial flora depends on the environment and maternal input during delivery and breastfeeding. Members of the same family have more similar bacterial communities than unrelated individuals, regardless of host genotype.
5. Recent studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities, including the identification of genes encoded by intestinal microbiota and their relevance to gut function.
6. The minimal gut microbiome genes are present in most bacteria and code for functions necessary for survival in the gut, including housekeeping genes and those involved in gut-specific functions.
7. Enterotypes are a relatively new concept in the classification of the gut microbiome, which identifies clusters of bacterial species present in each individual. Three enterotypes have been identified based on different clusters of bacterial species, with no geographical or demographic differences.

2. Twenty-four patients, all clinical non-responders to CRT, underwent an acute haemodynamic study to search for potential improvements.
3. The study found that in five patients, optimizing the CRT system at the coronary sinus lead position led to a positive haemodynamic response, with an average increase of 30.2%.
4. In three of these five patients, endocardial pacing did not significantly increase the haemodynamic response, and in one patient, an adverse effect was observed.
5. One patient with an apical position of the coronary sinus lead experienced a sufficient increase in haemodynamic response during endocardial pacing, justifying the upgrade to lv endocardial pacing.
6. The study showed that when pacing endocardially opposite the epicardial coronary sinus lead, lvdp/dtmax did not differ significantly for any of the patients.
7. Basal or mid-posterolateral segments had the highest haemodynamic response in all 14 patients who showed a haemodynamic improvement of 15% or more.
8. Five of the nine patients who were considered possible candidates for lv endocardial pacing agreed to the procedure, resulting in clinical improvement for all five.
9. The study demonstrated that endocardial lv pacing, guided by acute haemodynamic studies, could improve clinical outcome in patients not responding to conventional CRT.
10. The study showed some limitations in using acute haemodynamic studies to predict clinical outcome, as some patients with a clear haemodynamic response failed to clinically improve.
11. The best haemodynamic response correlates well with the longest time interval between the onset of the qrs complex and intrinsic activation at the lv electrode.
12. The study showed that epicardial pacing at the optimal site may be a good alternative for endocardial lv lead placement, as endocardial pacing opposite epicardial sites did not show acute haemodynamic improvement.

2. The lactation curve was modeled using gamma type function for normal and mastitis cows to predict milk yield with minimum error. The data was collected from the National Dairy Research Institute in India for a period of 12 years.
3. The fortnightly test-day milk yield (ftdmy) increased gradually to peak in td-3 and td-4 (14.34-14.48 kg/d) for normal cows, but in mastitis cows, it peaked in td-3 (13.15 kg/d) and was maintained only for that period. Both groups exhibited a steady decline in milk yield with advancement of lactation.
4. The ftdmy showed an increasing trend from td-1 to td-4 and decreased thereafter in both groups during the second parity. The minimum ftdmy of 11.31-9.18 kg/d and maximum ftdmy of 17.19-15.53 kg/d were observed on td-4 in both groups.

The study involved male mice being randomly assigned to treatment groups at 12 months of age, with control mice shifted to daily feeding of a specific diet and experimental groups receiving the same diet supplemented with varying amounts of NDGA. The mice were monitored for food consumption, health, and lifespan.
2. The study utilized an unbalanced statistical design to minimize the number of mice per test group while maintaining statistical power. The results showed that 3.5g/kg diet (373mg/kg bw/d) extended murine and drosophila lifespan, but doses higher and lower than this were ineffective. NDGA also increased the median lifespan of flies by approximately 23%.
3. The study found that NDGA consumption was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis in mice, suggesting that its target(s) and mechanism(s) of action may be phylogenetically conserved. However, aspects of the response in flies were unlike those in mice, as NDGA did not appear to affect energy uptake or utilization in flies.
4. The study also investigated the potential toxicity of NDGA in mice through clinical chemistries and necropsies. The results showed that while there was an association between NDGA consumption and an increased incidence of liver, lung, and thymus tumors, and increased hemorrhagic diathesis, there was little evidence for acute liver or kidney toxicity as measured by serum chemistries. However, other studies have reported serious pathologies, such as stunted growth and inflammatory cecal lesions, at higher doses of NDGA.

2. Personalized medicine applications include situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients. For example, in prostate cancer, DNA biomarker tests may determine whether treatment can be safely delayed.
3. Biomarkers are defined as characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. They can be discrete or continuous, stable or unstable, and suitable for therapy monitoring or not.
4. DNA biomarkers are stable and reproducible, making them suitable for prospective and retrospective studies. They are generally measured in the blood and cannot be used for therapy monitoring or as surrogate markers. However, their discovery rate is faster than their product cycles, leading to potential obsolescence before marketing approval.
5. DNA tumor biomarkers are specific to cancerous tumors and cannot serve as surrogate markers. They can show greater variation depending on how they are measured and may require biopsy for measurement.
6. General biomarkers, such as RNA, protein, or metabolite measurements, are complex and require more time and resources for measurement. They can be measured in biofluid, tissue, or cell lines and can serve as surrogate markers.
7. Current applications of biomarkers include diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction in personalized medicine. For example, mammaprint is a DNA tumor biomarker used for breast cancer prognosis following surgery, while IL28B is a predictive biomarker for response to HCV treatment.

1. Myosin VA (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
2. Each myova dimer consists of two motor domains connected to lever arms and a coiled-coil rod domain ending in a cargo-binding domain.
3. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms.
4. Calcium is required to activate the myova ATPase activity, but high calcium levels reduce motor processivity and may cause calmodulin dissociation from the lever arms.
5. Calmodulin dissociation decreases the lever arm's flexural stiffness, potentially impacting the motor's processivity.
6. Myova constructs were expressed and purified for tethered particle microscopy (TPM) analysis to measure their flexural stiffness.
7. TPM involves anchoring a myova-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle to a desired location along the motor, then measuring the particle's motion due to thermal energy.
8. The myova constructs were found to have varying flexural stiffness, with longer constructs exhibiting greater tethered particle motion.
9. The findings provide insight into the structural components of the myova motor, highlighting the importance of lever arm rigidity and the compliance of the lever arm/rod junction for proper gating and efficient cargo transport.

However, this method has limitations, including the use of radioisotopes and limited availability in many hospitals. An alternative method using a magnetic tracer and handheld magnetometer has been evaluated as a radiation-free alternative.
2. Two clinical trials have shown that the magnetic technique is noninferior to the combined technique with high identification rates, but there is a discordance in SLNs identified between the two methods. A smaller study using a similar magnetic tracer and different magnetometer demonstrated the viability of the technique for performing SLNB without radioisotopes. The particle size of the magnetic tracer influences its distribution and lymphatic uptake, and optimizing the clinical application of the magnetic technique requires evaluating different formulations in an in vivo model.

1. The text discusses the use of surrogate variables to predict complete healing in advanced diabetic foot ulcers (dfus) using data from clinical trials and a postmarketing surveillance study.
2. Two studies were conducted: a dose-exploratory trial and a confirmatory trial, involving a total of 190 ulcers.
3. Patients received intralesional injections of rhegf at 75g or 25g three times a week, adjuvant to standard care.
4. Surrogate variables proposed were percent change in area, log healing rate, ratio of log areas at 2nd week and end of treatment (eot), and granulation tissue development.
5. The median treatment duration was 5 weeks, and missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward or the average of contiguous evaluations.
6. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination.
7. The granulation variable, percent of granulation tissue covering the ulcer area, was confirmed to be the most efficient predictor of complete healing, with a high negative predictive value (93.5%).
8. The proportion mediated for granulation variables was high (1.008 and 1.043 for 2 weeks and eot, respectively), suggesting that almost 100% of the effect of treatment on complete healing may be mediated by granulation tissue formation.
9. The results confirmed that granulation tissue development at the eot was an early predictor of final healing, with a 72.9% certainty and positive/negative pvs of 71.7/75.8%, respectively.
10. The study provides the first evidence for the use of granulation tissue development as a predictor of wound healing in advanced dfus, which can be useful for clinical trial design and healthcare programs managing diabetic foot ulcers.

2. Breathing through the nose prepares air with warming, moistening, and filtering, while mouth breathing lacks filtering or immunological activity.
3. Mouth breathing in childhood can lead to pathological adaptations in the stomatognathic system, causing dental occlusion alterations and facial growth pattern changes.
4. Hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, nasal mucosa and turbinate edema, nasal septal deviation, and extended suction habits are common causes of mouth breathing in childhood.
5. Nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry are essential exams for diagnosing nasopharyngeal obstruction, with nasopharyngoscopy being the most reliable exam for diagnosing pharyngeal hyperplasia.
6. Cephalometry is a noninvasive, more comfortable, and cost-effective alternative to nasopharyngoscopy for diagnosing nasopharyngeal obstruction.
7. This study aimed to verify the correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing pharyngeal tonsil hyperplasia.
8. The study included 55 children aged 7.0 to 11.11 years who underwent otorhinolaryngologic assessment, nasopharyngoscopy, and cephalometry.

1. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in breast cancer patients is less than 6%, but distinguishing between true local recurrence (TR) and new primary tumor (NPT) is necessary.
2. TR and NPT have different natural histories, prognosis, and therapeutic management.
3. A 35-year-old woman with no relevant medical history was diagnosed with moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in her right breast in 2004.
4. The patient underwent surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, but in 2008, she noticed periareolar thickening and redness in the same breast, leading to a diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).
5. IBC is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer, accounting for 0.55% of primary invasive breast tumors, and is more common in Caucasian women under 60 years.
6. The risk of second primary breast cancer (SPBC) depends on the er status, diagnosis period, and family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer.
7. Women with er-positive first tumors have a decreased risk of SPBC, while those with er-negative primary tumors have an increased risk, especially those with a strong family history.
8. The patient received chemotherapy and trastuzumab for IBC, and is currently in complete clinical remission after 4 years and 8 months.
9. IBTR can be defined as the re-emergence of tumor in the previously treated breast, with a rate under 1% per year, but about 5-15% at 10 years.
10. The best way to differentiate TR and NPT is through genetic sequencing, but molecular techniques like DNA fingerprinting, loss of heterozygosity pattern, or allelic imbalances profile are not yet standardized.

2. Upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in AMD development and progression.
3. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, such as ranibizumab (Lucentis) and aflibercept (Eylea), is the current standard of care for neovascular AMD, significantly improving visual acuity (VA) and preventing vision loss.
4. The Pelli-Robson Contrast Sensitivity (CS) test measures an individual's ability to detect low contrast images and perceive differences between light and dark, providing a more comprehensive assessment of visual function beyond high-contrast VA.
5. The Snellen eye chart primarily measures VA using high-contrast letters, but it may not be an adequate measure for all types of vision loss, such as cataracts, glaucoma, or irregular astigmatism.
6. A study was conducted to evaluate change from baseline to week 12 in Pelli-Robson CS as the primary clinical end point in patients with recalcitrant exudative AMD who were switched to aflibercept therapy after previous ranibizumab treatment.
7. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in CS and a reduction in central retinal thickness (CRT) over 12 weeks, with no meaningful change in VA. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between CS improvement and CRT reduction, suggesting that CS measurement may provide a more complete understanding of the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment on vision-related functional performance.

2. The most common type of MS is relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), which accounts for 85-90% of cases. Researchers are investigating IL-25, a cytokine involved in immune system development and control, as a potential factor in MS.
3. A polymorphism (C424c/A) within exon 2 of the IL-25 gene may be associated with immune system-related diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the association between this polymorphism and MS in an Iranian population.
4. The study recruited 74 RRMS patients and 75 healthy controls, and used logistic regression analysis to estimate the odds ratio of MS development in patients with the AC and AA genotypes compared to the CC genotype.
5. The results revealed no statistically significant association between the C424c/A polymorphism and MS or the frequencies of A and C alleles in patients with MS versus healthy controls.

Additional points:

6. MS is an autoimmune disease with several immune-related genes involved in its pathogenesis. Th1 and Th17 responses are the main causes of MS progression, and th2 responses, which regulate th1 and th17, can improve clinical and laboratory outcomes.
7. IL-25, a th2 cytokine, may participate in the regulation of immune responses during inflammatory diseases, including MS. Previous studies suggest that serum levels of IL-25 are decreased in MS patients compared to healthy controls.
8. Polymorphisms within cytokine genes are associated with their expression. The authors hypothesized that polymorphisms within the IL-25 gene may be associated with MS.
9. The study identified that neither the AA, AC, nor CC genotypes nor the A and C alleles were associated with MS in the Iranian population.

1. The study aimed to explore the prevalence of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAs and AAAs) in a Korean population using non-contrast CT scans. The population consisted of 522 Korean male hypertensive patients without a history of aortic aneurysms. The prevalence of TAAs and AAAs was 36.5% (181/496) and 6.0% (30/496), respectively. Prevalence of AAAs suitable for intervention was very low.
2. TAAs were more common in patients with AAAs and were associated with older age, larger body surface area, and higher diastolic blood pressure. Interestingly, TAAs were less likely to be associated with dyslipidemia, while AAAs were more likely to occur in current or past smokers and those with dyslipidemia.
3. The study highlighted the need for further research to clarify the relationship between TAAs, AAAs, dyslipidemia, serum cholesterol, and statin therapy. Future studies should also establish screening strategies and management plans for elderly hypertensive patients with TAAs and AAAs. The primary limitations of the study were the inability to accurately measure aortic root diameter using non-contrast CT and the applicability of the results only to elderly Asian males with hypertension at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

2. Endometrial complex hyperplasia with atypia and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) are considered precursors of type I endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and endometrial glandular dysplasia is the precursor of type II carcinoma. Traditional methods for evaluating endometrial conditions include D&C or hysteroscopy, but the adequacy of specimens obtained using the SAP-1 device is unknown.
3. This study aimed to investigate whether liquid-based Surepath preparation for endometrial cytology tests (ECT) can maintain the three-dimensional structure of the endometrium. Histology is the gold standard for evaluating the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value (NPV) of ECT.
4. The study was conducted from November 2011 to May 2014 at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Peking University First Hospital and included 1514 patients with endometrial carcinoma risk factors who underwent SAP-1 sampling and 375 of these women who also underwent D&C or hysteroscopy.

2. Oxidative stress, caused by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defense, plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction in older individuals.
3. NO production decreases in aged endothelium due to increased ROS production and subsequent inactivation of NO, leading to impaired relaxation and inhibition of the antiproliferative effects of NO.
4. Regular exercise, such as endurance, resistance, and sprint training, has been shown to improve endothelial function in the elderly by upregulating antioxidant defense mechanisms and increasing NO bioavailability.

2. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and International Union Against Cancer (UICC) classify nodal disease into three groups based on the number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes: n1, n2, and n3.
3. The number of metastatic lymph nodes depends on the number of lymph nodes removed and examined, and studies show that the number of metastatic lymph nodes increases with the number of removed lymph nodes.
4. The lymph node ratio (LNR), which is the ratio of the number of metastatic lymph nodes to the number of removed lymph nodes, provides more useful prognostic information than nodal disease classification based on the number of metastatic lymph nodes.

The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, and is a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx. It is believed to be a normal part of development that disappears during the second month of fetal development.
2. If the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, a tornwaldt's cyst can develop. The crust type of tornwaldt's cyst does not obstruct the orifice, and the crust sheds periodically from the nasopharynx, causing an offensive smell and unpleasant taste. The cystic type is more common and can form part of the differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal abscesses and cysts.

1. The study included 242 children with type 1 diabetes diagnosed between 1994 and 2008, and followed up until adulthood. Pr (partial remission) occurred in 56.2% of patients, without any case of complete remission. The proportion of girls and boys was comparable among remitters and nonremitters. Mean age at diagnosis was 8.8 years, and height and BMI z-scores were similar between subgroups.
2. At diagnosis, most patients had no DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and the absence of DKA was significantly higher in pr patients (82.3%) than in no pr patients (63.5%). This effect was more pronounced in boys, who had a higher pr frequency (69.4%) when no DKA occurred at diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that chances of pr were higher when there was no DKA at diagnosis (OR = 0.43, p = 0.018).
3. Mean pr duration was 9.2 months (279.6 days), with 71.6% of patients experiencing pr for less than 1 year and 7.5% for more than 2 years. Patients entering pr had a lower baseline a1c (10.1%) than patients with no subsequent pr (10.8%). Lower a1c at diagnosis was associated with higher chances of pr (OR = 0.87, p = 0.03), but initial a1c did not impact long-term a1c levels. A1c levels at 3 months allowed for estimating the proportion of patients that will experience pr for more than 1 year (34% for a1cs ≤ 6%, 16% for a1cs > 6-7%, and 5% for a1cs > 7-8%).

1. Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that primarily affects the epiphyseal regions of long bones, including the temporal bone and temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Misdiagnosis is common due to its unusual histological features and non-specific symptoms such as hearing impairments, trismus, and dizziness. Incomplete resection carries a high risk of recurrence, and radiation therapy is not recommended due to the risk of malignant progression.
2. A case study is presented of a 41-year-old male with a misdiagnosed chondroblastoma in the temporal bone, which was initially diagnosed as otitis media and later as a giant cell tumor. The patient underwent several unsuccessful treatments, including antibiotic therapy and endoscopic surgery, before being referred to the department for persistent trismus and hearing loss. A thorough examination using MRI and CT scanning, along with histopathologic analysis, led to an accurate diagnosis. Surgical removal of the tumor using a radical mastoidectomy, subtotal resection of the temporal bone, and reconstruction of the facial tissue was performed, resulting in no tumor recurrence or postoperative dysfunction after four and a half years.

1. The benefits of regular structured exercise, such as improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic function, are well documented and reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Exercise also reduces visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL), both associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk.
2. However, it is unclear if increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits in reducing VAT and IHL. Cross-sectional analyses show an inverse relationship between central adiposity and self-reported physical activity levels, as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
3. Objectively measured physical activity using accelerometry supports these observations, but research on the relationship between VAT, IHL, and sedentary behavior is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity with VAT and IHL in adults with overweight/obesity.
4. The study recruited 82 volunteers from larger intervention trials and used accurate assessments of VAT and IHL, as well as 24-hour habitual physical activity behavior. Participants were excluded if they were physically active or had certain health conditions.
5. The study found no relationship between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat. Instead, there was a weak positive association between VAT volume and time spent in moderate activity and total energy expenditure. The inclusion of objectively measured levels of moderate activity and sedentary behavior did not improve the potency of traditional risk factors for predicting liver fat concentration or visceral adiposity.
6. While current habitual activity levels are not related to VAT or liver fat in a cross-sectional analysis, regular structured physical activity reduces VAT and IHL. Emphasis should be placed on adopting and adhering to structured exercise programs, considering individual barriers to participation and exercise preferences, and facilitating behavioral management strategies.

2. Among those who could recall the type of firecracker causing injury, those who ignited the fireworks themselves had more severe ocular damage than bystanders. Five eyes had open-globe injuries, and 48 had closed-globe injuries.
3. Eighteen eyes underwent surgical management, including corneal tear repair, scleral tear repair, cataract extraction, lensectomy, pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and IOFB removal. Twenty-two eyes had a final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/6, while 11 had BCVA between 6/60 and 6/9, and 7 had no perception of light.

1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, representing early, mild thyroid failure. The condition is increasingly recognized due to increased thyroid function tests in primary care settings.
2. The relationship between SCH and adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes is unclear, and it remains controversial whether variations in thyroid hormone levels within the normal range are associated with mortality endpoints. The definition and clinical significance of SCH are confounded by controversies regarding the correct upper limit of the reference range for serum TSH.
3. The most common cause of SCH is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is associated with the presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is more common in girls and women, and its prevalence increases with age in both sexes.
4. SCH is associated with various clinical conditions, including increased body weight, worsening blood pressure, and altered lipid levels. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that higher TSH levels are associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and weight gain, as well as increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and higher total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
5. SCH is also associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), a condition characterized by a cluster of metabolic disorders including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have observed strong associations between SCH and MetS.
6. The treatment of SCH is typically considered for pregnant women, infertile individuals, those with associated symptoms, or those at high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. The evidence supporting screening for SCH and the benefits and risks of its treatment remain controversial, and the primary goals of the present narrative review were to assess current evidence regarding the clinical aspects of SCH and its relationship to CV disease and to evaluate the mechanisms underlying this relationship.

2. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits are commonly used for CDAD diagnosis, but their sensitivity for detecting CD toxins is lower than polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytotoxigenic culture.
3. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical history and need for treatment of patients with gdh-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens.
4. The study retrospectively analyzed patients whose stool specimens were submitted for CD toxin testing between March 2013 and June 2014.
5. Patients were divided into three groups based on EIA results: toxin-positive stool group, discrepant negative/positive group, and dual negative group.
6. No significant differences were observed in clinical characteristics, antibiotics usage, or inflammation findings among the three groups. However, diarrhea duration was significantly longer in the positive stool group compared to the dual negative group.
7. Of the patients receiving oral vancomycin or metronidazole treatment for CDAD, significantly fewer patients in the discrepant negative/positive group received treatment, but diarrhea duration tended to be shorter.
8. Patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates had milder symptoms, suggesting that toxin concentrations below detection sensitivity may not cause severe symptoms.

3. The primary outcome variable was change in insulin secretion, assessed using the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration, with IGI defined as the ratio of insulin response to glucose challenge divided by fasting insulin.
4. Rosiglitazone treatment resulted in significant improvements in IGI and reductions in PI, indicating improved insulin secretion and reduced insulin resistance. These effects were consistent across subgroups of IGT and IFG, and persisted after adjusting for baseline levels of IGI and PI.
5. The findings suggest that rosiglitazone's diabetes preventive effect may be partially mediated through its effects on insulin secretion and insulin resistance. However, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood and may involve reducing insulin demand, ameliorating lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity, and inflammation, and maintaining pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis.

It is characterized by the progressive development of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, mainly trichoepitheliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas.
2. A 71-year-old woman with multiple rounded skin-colored or erythematous papules in her scalp and forehead was diagnosed with spiradenoma in all but one lesion, which was cylindroma. Her family history suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, with affected relatives presenting with similar lesions.
3. Exon 8 sequencing of the cyld gene revealed a heterozygous mutation, c.1628_1629delct, in the patient and her two affected daughters. This mutation results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon, leading to the loss of deubiquitinating activity of cyld and tumorigenesis.
4. Genetic testing on the unaffected daughter was negative, and the patient's other children did not present any clinical data. Genetic counseling was offered to first-degree relatives, informing them of the 50% probability of descendants developing BSS due to its autosomal dominant inheritance.

Biological scaffolds derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa have been used for soft tissue repair applications due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria. Dexon and Vicryl, absorbable polymer scaffolds, have been utilized but lose mechanical strength and are resorbed quickly, making them less than ideal for hernia repair applications.
2. Newer absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, have been developed using long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly. These scaffolds exhibit improved mechanical properties and have been used in various clinical applications with promising outcomes.
3. The current study aimed to determine the mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics of Phasix Mesh and P4HB plug designs when utilized to bridge a surgical defect in a porcine model for 6, 12, 26, or 52 weeks. The results showed that both Phasix Mesh and P4HB plug possessed similar mechanical properties and significantly greater burst strength and relative stiffness compared to the native abdominal wall. The p4hb material was significantly resorbed over time, but significant material resorption did not correspond with a significant drop in mechanical strength at the repair site. Histological analyses revealed a comparable and mild inflammatory response and mild to moderate granulation tissue / vascularization associated with the p4hb material regardless of its configuration as a mesh or a plug.

3. Several European countries have reported an increase in VRE in recent years, with Denmark experiencing a dramatic increase since 2012 due to multiclonal outbreaks of vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium.
4. Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, which relies on selective culturing and/or detection of resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR.
5. Rapidly available results from PCR can lead to substantial indirect savings, as shown in a report from France, which compared the management of two simultaneous VRE outbreaks on different wards.
6. Several studies have examined the diagnostic accuracy of various assays to detect vanA and vanB, with sensitivities ranging from 43.5% to 100% and specificities from 79.2% to 99.6%.
7. The specificity of the detection of the vanB gene is lower due to the presence of vanB-positive anaerobic bacteria.

This idea was later supported by Pelayo Correa's work on gastric cancer development, which began in the 1970s and hypothesized a stepwise process from chronic atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and cancer.
2. Correa initially believed environmental factors, such as a diet high in salt and nitrosamines and low in micronutrients, were responsible for promoting this progression. However, in the late 1980s, he suggested a possible role for Helicobacter pylori in the initiation of gastric cancer.
3. Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered H. pylori in the late 1970s and early 1980s, initially observing it in peptic ulcer patients. They later showed that these bacteria cause gastritis and ulcer disease. Although they did not directly investigate the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer, they speculated that it might be involved in other gastritis-associated diseases.
4. Early epidemiological studies in the 1980s and 1990s provided weak evidence for a link between H. pylori and gastric cancer. However, three large cohort studies conducted in the 1990s found that prior H. pylori infection was significantly more common in those who developed gastric cancer compared to those who did not. These studies provided compelling evidence for H. pylori as a definite carcinogen, leading to its classification as such by the World Health Organization in 1994.
5. Subsequent research has confirmed and expanded upon the early epidemiological studies, revealing that H. pylori is a risk factor for both intestinal and diffuse-type gastric cancers. Measuring H. pylori exposure through more sensitive methods, such as western blot against cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), has shown that prior exposure is underestimated by ELISA and that CagA-positive strains increase the risk of gastric cancer to a greater extent than Cag",0

Before the introduction of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, only prevention of visual acuity loss could be achieved in a limited number of patients using different treatment options like laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and vitreoretinal surgery.
2. Intravitreal treatments with bevacizumab (full-length antibody against VEGF-A) and ranibizumab (Fab part of antibody against VEGF-A) have led to preventing baseline visual acuity loss and even visual improvement in some patients. Multicenter studies like MARINA, ANCHOR, PRANTO, EXCITE, and the comparative study CATT showed that ranibizumab and bevacizumab were effective in preventing visual acuity loss up to 95% and making an improvement in visual acuity up to 40%.

Severe hypoproteinemia (shp) was found to be a significant risk factor for cesarean section (CS), poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes in PE women.
2. Hypoalbuminemia, indicated by shp, is a factor of poor maternal and neonatal outcomes in PE. The study found that women with shp were more likely to have CS, severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta compared to those with mild hypoproteinemia (mhp). Neonates of women with shp were more likely to have fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries.",0

1. Over the last two decades, many new immunotherapy approaches for cancer treatment have emerged due to advances in understanding antigen presentation, lymphocyte recognition, and innate immune system functions.
2. Several of these agents, such as infusional cytokine therapies for melanoma or renal cell cancer, intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer, and sipuleucel-T for advanced metastatic prostate cancer, have been approved for standard clinical use.
3. Some other agents, like monoclonal antibodies targeting CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) for advanced melanoma, are awaiting approval.
4. To evaluate these agents, it's crucial to demonstrate safety and positive patient care and outcome, and some agents may be best used in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies.
5. Identifying markers of biological response, ideally associated with clinical outcome, is necessary for evaluating these agents, especially for broadly active immune modulating agents like CTLA-4 inhibitors or TLR agonists.
6. For antigen-specific vaccines, immune responses to the target antigen can be used as a biomarker of immunological efficacy, but few instances of target antigen immune response have been linked to clinical benefit.
7. Machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) have been proposed as a method for identifying promising biomarkers and potential biomarker networks.
8. In this study, ML-BBNs were used to identify promising biomarkers and then select a subset of features to train a network of immune biomarkers related to observed declines in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
9. The study involved sera samples collected before and after three months of treatment from three separate trials, including patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a viral vaccine (PSAV), and a plasmid DNA vaccine (PAPV).
10. The findings suggest that ML-BBNs can be a useful tool for identifying early biomarkers of immune response to vaccine therapies, potentially leading to the development of predictive models for clinical response.

2. The films were coated with acrylic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and bone-like particles for improved cell adhesion and electrical insulation.
3. The study applied a 5 V square wave of 1 Hz and 3 Hz for 15 minutes at each frequency, once every 24 hours, using an actuator device with six PVDF and silver electrode actuators.
4. The results showed significant differences in total bone area, immature bone area, and mature bone area around the actuators compared to static controls.
5. The increased bone formation was due to new bone formation, with a higher percentage of woven bone and osteoid in actuators than in static devices.
6. The chosen staining technique, giemsa eosin, revealed older bone in a darker shade of pink and more recently deposited bone in a lighter pink color, with adjacent blue areas.
7. The significant differences in bone formation were observed in the distal thirds of the devices, with higher mineral apposition rates around actuated devices than static devices.
8. Opn expression was significantly higher around actuators than static controls, suggesting mechanical stress as the likely cause, but no proportional increase in trap was observed.

2. Ten patients had the salt-wasting (SW) form of CAH, diagnosed in the first year of life and treated with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Eight patients were diagnosed as classical simple virilizing (SV) patients, and eight patients had the non-classical (NC) form, diagnosed between 15 and 44 years of age.
3. The study found that eleven patients (42.3%) showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, hippocampal dysplasia, and amygdala dysplasia. Poor hormonal control due to non-compliance with medication was the main cause of these abnormalities.
4. The text suggests that chronic hyperandrogenism, resulting from non-compliance with treatment, may be the main mechanism involved in the genesis of brain MRI abnormalities. Additionally, aldosterone deficiency could induce changes in cerebral arterial structure, leading to subclinical cerebral ischemia, which could be indirectly promoted by glucocorticoids.

1. The study evaluated the role of urethral plate characters, such as shape and width, in the success of tip urethroplasty for primary anterior penile hypospadias in 100 children. The plates were categorized as flat, cleft, and deeply grooved, and the study population was divided into two groups based on the width of the urethral plate (>8 mm and <8 mm). Group B patients with a narrow urethral plate had a statistically significant higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibration compared to group A patients with a wider plate.
2. The findings are consistent with earlier reports, which showed a higher fistula rate in patients with a narrow urethral plate due to the increased tension on the suture line during tubularization. To prevent meatal stenosis and decrease fistula rate, some authors recommend extending the midline incision beyond the tip of the glans. Urethral plate augmentation using buccal mucosal grafts is also recommended for narrow and inelastic plates. The tip urethroplasty offers advantages such as preservation of the urethral plate, single suture line, creation of glandular and penile urethra, short operative time, and low complication rate.

3. The prototype was calibrated using weights and a simple linear regression analysis was applied to adjust the data.
4. The accuracy and precision of the prototype were tested using weights and no significant differences were found between two examiners.
5. Maxillary central incisor brackets were bonded to enamel using a standard procedure and then debonded using the prototype and a universal testing machine.
6. The mean bond strength obtained with the prototype (2.96 mpa) and the universal testing machine (3.08 mpa) were statistically similar.
7. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores showed that the composite resin remained bonded to the enamel after debonding, which is advantageous for preserving the enamel surface.
8. Strain gauges are sensitive transducers that convert mechanical displacement into electrical resistance, but temperature alterations can influence the measurements.

1. Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common curable sexually transmitted infection associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease, low infant birth weight, and premature delivery. The infection is more common among older women, those with less education, singles, and women who report unprotected sex with non-steady partners or multiple sex partners. The prevalence of trichomonal infection is highest among socially marginalized women from low-income communities in coastal Peru.
2. The study findings indicate that syndromic management of trichomoniasis may result in both over and under treatment due to the asymptomatic nature of the infection. The long-term prevalence of trichomonal infection in older women suggests that screening and treatment programs are necessary to prevent continued spread in the population. The study supports the need for improved disease control activities to reduce adverse reproductive health outcomes associated with trichomoniasis, such as ectopic pregnancy, low infant birth weight, preterm labor, and non-HPV associated cervical neoplasia. Further studies are needed to determine if screening and treatment of trichomoniasis will improve reproductive health and birth outcomes of women.

3. Valproic acid is the most commonly used initial medication for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS, but caution is needed in children under 2 years old and when used with other anticonvulsants.
4. Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, is an orphan drug granted for the adjunctive treatment of LGS and partial seizures in adults and adolescents.
5. Rufinamide's mechanism of action involves decreased firing of high frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation, which prevents subsequent bursts of high frequency action potentials.
6. Rufinamide has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effectiveness in animals and blocks seizures induced by various chemicals, suggesting an effect on sodium channels.
7. Rufinamide has a good safety profile in animals and humans, with minimal cognitive side effects and a relatively devoid of behavioral toxicity at clinically relevant doses.
8. In clinical trials, rufinamide reduced seizures in LGS patients, including tonic-atomic seizures, and had a higher safety index than phenytoin, phenobarbital, and ethosuximide on the rotorod test.

2. Demographic and clinical factors, such as gender, race, age, marital status, tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases, significantly impact the survival of PDAC patients. Surgical resection is the most effective treatment, but only 20% of patients are suitable candidates.
3. Cox proportional hazards regression models have been used to estimate the impact of risk factors on PDAC survival, with significant demographic factors being gender, race, age at diagnosis, and marital status, and clinical factors including tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases.
4. The most accurate estimates from these models depend on the quality and quantity of data used, the set of considered variables, and the technical approaches utilized. The predictive power of the models can be assessed using concordance indexes (c-indexes), which measure the probability that the model correctly orders the survival times of two randomly selected patients.
5. Two nomograms have been developed to estimate survival for PDAC patients based on cox proportional hazards regression models. One nomogram estimates survival for patients who have undergone pancreatectomy and accounts for tumor size, grade, stage, lymph node data, resected tissue amount, weight loss, and pancreatic subsite. The other nomogram predicts the risk of perioperative mortality in PDAC patients scheduled for pancreatectomy and accounts for patient demographics, type of pancreatectomy, hospital characteristics, and comorbidities.

1. Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus and is common in areas with close contact between intermediate and definitive hosts, usually sheep and dogs.
2. CE in humans presents with symptoms related to fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other viscera, and diagnosis is typically established through radiology and serology.
3. Postsurgical relapses or treatment failure can occur due to nonradical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material, especially protoscoleces.
4. Relapses have been reported in 2-25% of CE patients after therapy, and long-term follow-up is necessary to detect newly growing cysts.
5. Serology has been used for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies makes it difficult to diagnose relapse.
6. Many serologic techniques have been evaluated for post-operative monitoring, including latex agglutination, passive hemagglutination, immunoelectrophoresis, and specific IgE, IgM, and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
7. A study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of CE using immunoblotting analysis.

1. Obesity is a common metabolic disease associated with dyslipidemias.
2. Waist circumference (wc) and waist-to-hip ratio (whr) are important parameters for assessing obesity and predicting cardiovascular events.
3. Newer obesity indices, such as waist-to-height ratio (whtr), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and body adiposity index (BAI), are gaining attention for their role in assessing metabolic complications.
4. This study aimed to examine the relationship between obesity parameters and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
5. The study included 66 obese non-diabetic patients with a mean age of 55.8 years, and patients were divided into three obesity classes based on BMI.
6. Patients underwent a complete blood count, lipid and liver profile, and other tests to assess their health status and exclude diabetes and other conditions.
7. The study found that patients in obesity class III had lower mean serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to patients in classes I and II.
8. Negative correlations were found between BMI, wc, and LDL-C, as well as between wc, whr, and TG/HDL-C ratio.
9. The study also found positive correlations between wc, whr, and TG/HDL-C ratio, as well as between VAI and TC, TG, TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C ratio.
10. The results suggest that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C. The VAI index demonstrated the strongest correlation with TG and HDL-C levels and with the lipid indices TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C.

2. Aspirin therapy is a prevention measure recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force to prevent heart attack and ischemic stroke. It can be used as a primary or secondary prevention measure.
3. A study was conducted using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012 to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations for CVD prevention.
4. The study found that among primary prevention patients, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and over three-quarters were classified as low risk. However, less than half of high-risk primary prevention patients received a recommendation to take aspirin.
5. Among those told to take aspirin by their physicians, the vast majority complied with the recommendation. There were significant differences in demographic and access-to-care variables by race/ethnicity among primary prevention patients.
6. The study also indicated a significant disconnect between who needs and who receives recommendations for aspirin use, as well as a persistent problem with access to care and receipt of recommendations for aspirin use.
7. The analysis showed that among low-risk primary prevention patients, a higher level of education was predictive of a lower likelihood of receiving a recommendation for aspirin.
8. The study relied on self-reported data and had limitations, including the lack of information on whether respondents were recommended aspirin for cancer prevention or anticoagulant use.
9. The available data did not allow for elucidation of who is at greater risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and for whom a recommendation to take aspirin would be inappropriate.
10. High-risk patients who are not receiving the recommendation are put at increased risk of CVD events, while low-risk patients are exposed to adverse risks with unnecessary use of aspirin based on a physician's recommendation.

2. In the present study, an in situ hybridization (ISH) technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAI) was established for detecting HCV-RNA in FFPE liver sections.
3. Positive controls were obtained from humanized liver specimens of HCV-infected chimeric mice, and 13 humanized liver specimens and 11 needle biopsy liver specimens were used in the study.
4. The ISH technique was carried out by quenching endogenous peroxidase activity, digesting with proteinase K, heat-treating, hybridizing with the LNA probe, applying fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated tyramide, and reacting with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-FITC antibody.
5. The ISH technique was specific for HCV-RNA detection, as shown by the absence of signals after DNase and RNase treatments. Human-specific CK8/18 immunostaining was used to distinguish human hepatocytes from mouse hepatocytes in HCV-infected chimeric mice.
6. The ISH technique using the LNA-modified oligonucleotide probe and CSAI can be applied to detecting HCV-RNA in liver biopsy specimens, and it is relatively simple and requires no special equipment. The sensitivity is comparable to in situ RT-PCR, making it a valuable tool for routine histopathological diagnosis of HCV infection using FFPE liver biopsy specimens.

1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (eETs) are a group of compounds involved in various physiological functions, including blood pressure regulation, nociception, adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory activity, organ regeneration, insulin potentiation, and podocyte integrity. The most prominent eET isomer, 14,15-eET, is produced via metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, particularly the 2c and 2j families. The ratio and stereocomposition of eET isomers are dependent on the specific cytochrome P450 isoform and species.
2. The instability of natural eETs due to their susceptibility to aerial oxidation or auto-oxidation necessitates handling and storage under strict conditions to minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals. Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) is an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in eET-mediated processes, but this strategy might be less effective than agonist replacement therapy when endogenous eET biosynthesis is compromised.
3. To address the stability limitations of natural eETs, researchers have prepared eET surrogates with improved stability. The latest versions of these surrogates were evaluated for vasorelaxation in precontracted bovine coronary artery rings and for inhibition of recombinant human SEH. The results showed varying levels of vasorelaxation and SEH inhibition depending on the bioisosteres and their positions along the carbon chain. Oxamides and n-ipr-amides displayed useful 14,15-eET agonist activities but were modest to poor SEH inhibitors. The in vitro success of this generation of analogues prompted researchers to consider further structural iterations.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and degradation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein released in response to inflammation and infection, and its production is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines. SAA is not only an acute-phase protein but also a kind of apolipoprotein relevant in cholesterol metabolism.
2. During inflammation, SAA can contribute up to 80% of HDL apolipoprotein composition, exceeding apo-a1 in quantity and impairing the protective function of HDL. SAA may also increase the oxidation of LDL and is associated with cardiovascular disease and atherogenesis. SAA is the precursor of amyloid A protein, a fibrillar, insoluble product deposited in major organs, which carries a risk of organ failure and premature death in the course of secondary amyloidosis.
3. The study aimed to assess the concentration of SAA in RA patients with different disease activity, as well as other inflammatory, metabolic parameters, and CV and renal disease risk factors. The study group consisted of 140 RA patients, and blood samples were collected for SAA determination along with other laboratory tests. The results showed that SAA was significantly higher in patients with high disease activity, currently treated with glucocorticoids, and with advanced atherosclerosis or increased cys-c levels. Women treated with biological DMARDS had significantly lower SAA concentrations than those treated only with synthetic DMARDS, indicating better therapeutic effects.

1. Over the past decade, various cell types have been studied for their potential in cardiac regeneration, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skeletal myoblasts, and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. More recent possibilities include induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and resident cardiac stem cells.
2. ESCs can be obtained from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation blastocyst and expanded in vitro without loss of pluripotency. They can differentiate into cardiovascular lineages, and culture with specific growth factors can enrich the pool of ESC-derived cardiac cells. Both pluripotent ESCs and committed ESC-derived cardiac cells have shown promising results in rodent models.
3. iPSCs can be generated from adult somatic cells by overexpressing transcription factors critical for maintaining ESC pluripotency. They differentiate much like ESCs and contribute to normal cardiovascular development in vivo. iPSCs have shown success in a proof-of-principle study in restoring myocardial structure and function after coronary artery ligation in mice.
4. MSCs can be separated from bone marrow and adipose tissues and differentiate into cardiomyocytes under special conditions. They can be rapidly expanded in culture and are less immunogenic than other cell populations, allowing for allogenic transplantation. However, their propensity to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues limits their use.
5. Skeletal myoblasts can be harvested from muscle biopsies, expanded in culture, and autologously reimplanted. They are less prone to teratoma formation and more resistant to ongoing ischemia than ESCs. However, true cardiomyocyte differentiation has not been observed in vivo, and their contractions are dyssynchronous due to failure of electromechanical coupling with the surrounding myocardium.

1. Polyhalite is a mineral with the chemical formula K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4.2H2O, commonly found in sedimentary evaporite successions and rare cases in volcanic successions. It was first described in Austria in 1818 by the German chemist Stromeyer.
2. Polyhalite is associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulfides in evaporites. Its crystal structure was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria.
3. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C. Its dehydration temperature starts at 255°C and reaches a maximum of 343°C.
4. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements like Zn, Cu, Ni significantly changes dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures.
5. Polyhalite forms early diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact.
6. In the Alpine Haselgebirge, polyhalite is a minor but widespread and important constituent in several salt mines, including the type locality of Bad Ischl, Hallstatt, Berchtesgaden, and Dürnberg.

1. Oxidative stress, caused by an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defense, is a critical factor in several systemic diseases.
2. Propofol, a lipid-soluble anesthetic, has antioxidant properties and protects against oxidative stress in various organs.
3. In this study, propofol was given to rats for four weeks at doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg to investigate its effects on biochemical indices and lipid profile.
4. The study found no significant difference in serum, renal, or hepatic malondialdehyde levels between control and propofol-treated rats, indicating that propofol metabolism does not generate free radicals.
5. However, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly increased, while HDL-cholesterol levels were decreased in both doses of propofol.
6. The increased cholesterol levels may be due to increased alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl co-A reductase activity, while the increased triglycerides levels may be due to decreased triglycerides lipase activity or decreased fatty oxidation.
7. Propofol increased hepatic GSH levels and the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, enhancing the detoxifying potential of the liver.
8. The study also found that propofol increased serum LDH and CK-MB activities, suggesting cardiac muscle damage, and increased total bilirubin levels, but had no significant effect on ALT, AST, creatinine, or urea levels.
9. The findings suggest that the use of propofol in patients with cardiovascular or lipid disorders should be carefully considered due to its detrimental effects on the lipid profile.

2. The study compared the obtained data with previous studies to improve understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of IHH. The Kallmann Liangjian social group, the largest IHH social networking group in China, was used for the investigation.
3. The study found that IHH patients in the network investigation were similar to those reported in the literature regarding sex, age, BMI, and clinical characteristics. However, no family history was reported, possibly due to the age and sporadic characteristics of the patients.
4. Network investigation has advantages such as including more participants, being quicker and more convenient, and allowing patients to express private information freely. However, it may have biases due to patient selection and the use of layman's language.
5. The study found that hormone replacement therapy improved the conditions of IHH patients, and gonadotropin + androgen therapy appeared to be superior to androgen replacement alone, although further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance.

1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have revealed that the genome is folded into hierarchical structures called topologically associating domains (TADs), which are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions. TADs exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions, and their boundaries are enriched for specific proteins and histone modifications.
2. Brg1, a major subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, contributes to TAD boundary strength. Brg1 regulates nucleosome occupancy and possibly ctcf localization, and its loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and prevent the binding of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers at TAD boundaries.
3. Brg1 interacts with topoisomerases, and the orderly positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes at TAD boundaries may be achieved by enriched ctcf binding, which positions 20 nucleosomes around its binding sites. Brg1 loss may reduce nucleosome occupancy at ctcf sites through loss of its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity or by negatively impacting ctcf binding.
4. Chromatin remodeling enzymes, including the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, architectural proteins, and topoisomerases, play a strong link in genome organization. Brg1 interacts with topoisomerases IIA and IIB, and is required for their recruitment to chromatin. The findings from prokaryotes and yeast support this interplay and functional cooperativity between chromatin remodeling enzymes, architectural proteins, and topoisomerases in the organization of TADs.

1. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). The characteristics of SPIOs, including their superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated, enable MPI to provide high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios. Potential applications of MPI include cardiovascular imaging and guidance of interventions.
2. The choice of appropriate tracer material is crucial for MPI, and long-circulating SPIOs with a sufficient signal within the vessels after a single injection are desirable. The circulation time of SPIOs in blood is determined by their hydrodynamic diameter and the properties of their coatings. Previous studies have shown that SPIOs with a hydrodynamic size greater than 50 nm have rapid and specific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream.
3. In this study, the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) was evaluated for two different versions of Resovist, a commercially available SPIO. The study found that the signal decay in blood was significantly different between the two versions, with Resovist from irom pharmaceutical co ltd showing a more rapid decay. The study also found no significant difference in the absolute signal strength of the baseline blood MPI signal or in the mpi signal decay between the two compounds in the dilution series. The rapid decay of the MPI signal is in line with the initial phase of elimination of Resovist observed in MRI studies, but the lack of a second elimination phase in MPS may be due to the different principles of signal generation in MPI and MRI and the broad size distribution of the SPIOs in Resovist.

The researchers discovered that an rxra-centered transcriptomic pathway was aberrantly maintained in Leishmania-infected Kupffer cells (kc), leading to enhanced parasite survival.
2. The researchers used 4d intravital two-photon imaging to observe the fine membrane structure and lamellipodia dynamics of steady-state kc in exceptional detail. They also identified monocytes and neutrophils as moving rapidly through the sinusoidal spaces, while nonmotile LSEcs had an even lower velocity.
3. The early response of kc to infection with Leishmania donovani amastigotes in vivo is largely uncharacterized. The researchers examined kc behavior before and after infection in live mice and found that both infected and uninfected kc responded to the infection by loss of membrane activity, suggesting signals provided from infected kcs or the activation of serum-derived mediators of inflammation.
4. The researchers used flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated high-speed cell sorting to isolate kcs and separate them into infected or uninfected cell populations. They identified genes differentially expressed between infected and uninfected kcs and inflamed kcs, and performed pathway and gene ontology analysis to identify common and unique gene pathways in each population. They also validated the findings using quantitative real-time PCR and pharmacological intervention with a small-molecule antagonist specific for rxr.

3. The results showed that 20 unique bacterial isolates were obtained, with most belonging to the proteobacteria phylum, specifically the betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria classes. The most frequently recovered groups were Pseudomonas (7 isolates) and Janthinobacterium (5 isolates).
4. The study used two sets of primers to detect PHA synthase genes: one set that recognized both short-chain length (SCL) and medium-chain length (MCL) PHA synthase genes, and another set that was specific for MCL PHA synthase genes. Six Pseudomonas and two Janthinobacterium strains were identified as having MCL PHA synthase genes.
5. The phylogenetic analysis of the PHA synthase genes revealed high similarity between Janthinobacterium sp. p39 and Antarctic proteobacterium p21, and between Janthinobacterium sp. p38 and zooglea ramigera. The second group of sequences was dominated by members of the Pseudomonas species.

1. Transposable elements (TES), long considered as selfish and junk sequences in genomes, have been shown to serve important functions in organisms through molecular domestication events. Two major categories of TES are retroelements and DNA transposons. Retroelements use a ""copy-and-paste"" mechanism for transposition, while DNA transposons use a ""cut-and-paste"" mechanism.
2. Retroelements include retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons, with the latter lacking an envelope gene. Retrotransposition involves reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and integration of the cDNA molecule produced. Retrotransposons can be domesticated to form new cellular protein-coding genes, such as mart genes in mammals.

2. Beta adrenergic receptors (2ar), which have a seven membrane spanning domain structure, are linked to atherogenesis through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). (Source)
3. Two common non-synonymous SNPs of 2ar have been identified at nucleotides 46 (rs1042713) and 79 (rs1042714), causing changes in amino acid residues at position 16 (arg > gly) and 27 (gln > glu) of the fourth intracellular loop. (Source)
4. The arg16gly and gln27glu polymorphisms of 2ar have been hypothesized to influence receptor function and predispose individuals to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. (Source)
5. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the association between 2ar polymorphisms and ischemic stroke using case-control studies published in English and confirmed by MRI or CT. (Source)
6. Two studies were excluded due to cohort design, one due to another gene polymorphism, and one due to being a pharmacogenetic study. (Source)
7. Two studies reported genotypic data and were included for genotypic association meta-analysis, and one study reported allelic data for allelic association meta-analysis. (Source)

1. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a cancer prevention strategy used by women with BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations to reduce the risks of breast and ovarian cancer.
2. A meta-analysis of 10 studies found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
3. The analysis included studies with varying designs, small sample sizes, and short follow-up times, limiting the ability to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, and other factors.
4. Three nonoverlapping studies estimated the risk reduction associated with RRSO for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.47 (95% CI = 0.35 to 0.64).
5. Three nonoverlapping studies estimated the risk reduction associated with RRSO for breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.47 (95% CI = 0.35 to 0.64).
6. Three nonoverlapping studies estimated the risk reduction associated with RRSO for breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.47 (95% CI = 0.26 to 0.84).
7. The studies included case-control, prospective, and retrospective cohort studies, with some limitations such as variable study designs, small sample sizes, and short follow-up times.
8. The results suggest an 80% reduction in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk and a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk associated with RRSO in women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.
9. The data demonstrate the utility of RRSO in reducing cancer risk and improving overall survival in this population, but further research is needed to understand the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, and other factors.

1. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa with a prevalence of 1-2%, characterized by a dense subepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes, increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and degeneration of basal keratinocytes.
2. The interleukin-23/interleukin-17 (IL-23/IL-17) axis is a newly discovered proinflammatory signaling pathway, with IL-23 and IL-17 being two pivotal cytokines. IL-23 functions as an important driving factor in the immune response and induces the differentiation of a novel subset of CD4+ T cells, called Th17, which in turn produces IL-17.
3. In OLP lesions, both erosive and reticular forms showed increased expression of IL-23p19 and IL-17 compared to normal oral mucosa. IL-23p19 was predominantly expressed in the epithelium and extracellular matrix of the lamina propria, while IL-17 was expressed in the cytoplasm of infiltrated lymphocytes.
4. The upregulation of IL-23 in the progress of OLP lesions is associated with the increased expression of IL-17, particularly in the reticular subgroup. IL-23 stimulates the production of IL-17 in CD4+ T cells, contributing to the induction of Th17 cells and the formation of the complex immune network in the inflammatory environment of OLP lesions.
5. IL-17 selectively regulates the expressions of some inflammatory mediators in oral keratinocytes, including hBD-2, 3, IL-8, CCL-20, and TNF-, indicating the selectively regulatory role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the immune network in OLP lesions.
6. Further investigations are needed to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of the overexpression and regulatory effects of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in OLP lesions and its interaction with other signaling pathways, as",0

1. The isolation of pure populations of cells from heterogeneous suspensions is crucial for clinical and research applications, including HIV diagnosis and stem cell research.
2. Size-based separation techniques, such as those using microfluidic devices, offer advantages like small sample volumes, portability, improved sterility, and potential integration with analytical techniques.
3. Size-based separation methods, like those using microfabricated channels, do not require cell-specific markers and can be used to isolate stem cells and other rare cells that do not express known markers. However, maintaining cell viability is a concern.
4. A technique called deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) uses an array of obstacles to sort micron-sized particles based on their size by manipulating the fluid flow around the obstacles. This method can achieve high resolution and can be used to sort fluorescent polystyrene spheres and circular plasmid DNA.
5. Magnetic separation techniques use magnetic beads and an external magnetic field to separate cells based on their magnetic properties. This method is particularly useful for cells that can be separated by specific surface antigens and is easily miniaturized.
6. Adhesion-based separation techniques use antibodies immobilized on surfaces to bind to undesired constituents of a feed. This method can be used to separate cell populations that have the same size and/or density, such as subpopulations of human lymphocytes, without the need for preprocessing incubation with fluorescent or magnetic antibody tags.

1. The text discusses the diagnosis of cirrhosis using imaging techniques, specifically ultrasound, computer tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Morphological signs of cirrhosis can be identified on these imaging examinations.
2. The caudate-to-right lobe ratio (c/rl) and the right posterior notch (rpn) are two common morphological signs of cirrhosis identified on imaging. The c/rl is a quantitative measurement with high specificity and accuracy, while the rpn and expanded gallbladder fossa (egf) are simple qualitative visual signs.
3. The c/rl is a ratio of the width of the caudate lobe to the width of the right lobe, and it has been shown to have a high specificity and accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis. The size of the caudate lobe is also correlated with the hepatic functional reserve in cirrhotic patients.
4. The rpn is a sharp indentation on the posteroinferior liver surface, and its presence is the result of the atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the caudate lobe. Both the c/rl and rpn are dependent on the same lobar changes of the liver.
5. The egf is a sign of cirrhosis that reflects different segmental liver changes, including the atrophy of the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe and the cephalocaudal enlargement of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe. The atrophy of segment 4 and the enlargement of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe are common in cirrhotic livers.
6. The text reports the results of a study comparing the diagnostic performance of the c/rl, rpn, and egf signs in diagnosing cirrhosis using MRI. The study found that there was a significant statistical difference between the diagnostic value of these signs in the cirrhotic group compared to the control group.

1. The text describes a study evaluating the ability of structural and functional tests (optical coherence tomography [OCT] and standard automated perimetry [SAP]) to detect glaucoma progression in glaucoma patients.
2. The study included 462 eyes of 305 glaucoma patients and 62 eyes of 49 healthy controls, with a median of 8 visits (range 5-18) for glaucoma eyes and 7 visits (range 5-10) for healthy eyes during an average follow-up of 3.6-3.8 years.
3. The study used OCT to measure peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and SAP to evaluate mean sensitivity.
4. Progression was determined based on statistically significant slopes faster than fifth percentile cutoffs from healthy eyes and p < 0.05.
5. Progression was detected solely by OCT in 19.0%, solely by SAP in 9.5%, and by both in 4.1%.
6. The gee logistic model showed that each 1 db higher baseline mean deviation (MD) was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of detecting progression by OCT versus SAP.
7. For eyes with few visits during follow-up, OCT had a higher chance of detecting progression compared with SAP. However, there was a significant interaction between baseline disease severity and number of visits.
8. For eyes with early disease and relatively small number of visits, the odds of detecting progression by OCT were much larger for OCT compared with SAP. Conversely, for eyes with advanced disease and relatively large number of visits, the odds of detecting progression by SAP were greater than by OCT.
9. The findings may have significant implications for the evaluation of glaucoma progression in clinical practice by allowing clinicians to tailor the frequency of SAP and OCT tests during follow-up, taking into account the relative odds of detecting progression at different levels of disease severity.

3. The systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, as well as heart rates, were measured and recorded at various time points. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age, sex, weight, height, maximal height of sensory block, incidences of hypotension and bradycardia, or the amount of fluids infused. However, group h had a higher percentage of patients with ASA II physiologic scores.
4. The sbp, dbp, and mbp values were significantly higher in group h than in group n at all measurement times. Hypotension was treated with ephedrine, and bradycardia was treated with atropine. Six patients in group h and seven patients in group n received atropine due to bradycardia, which resolved with a single dose of 0.5 mg intravenous atropine.

The virus is an important cause of respiratory tract infections in infants, seniors, and immunocompromised individuals, and its genome organization is similar to human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv), but lacks two nonstructural genes.
2. The study analyzed the synonymous codon usage in hmpv genomes and its influencing factors to provide new insights into the pathogenicity and evolution history of hmpv. The results showed that hmpv has a strong synonymous codon usage bias towards codons ended with A or U, and the nucleotide composition is the main force affecting this bias.
3. The study also observed that codon usage bias in hmpv showed distinct differences among different phylogenetic types, suggesting that it plays an important role in hmpv evolution history. Additionally, hmpv showed a complementary trend with human cells, which benefits the virus by allowing it to keep replicating without competition in the host cell and could be a mechanism for persistent infection.

Valerie Oppenheimer's influential articles highlighted the significance of men's socioeconomic position in demographic change, specifically in the declining rates of marriage and the tendency to postpone or forego marriage. At the time, the dominant perspectives attributed the decline in marriage to the erosion of marriage or the growing economic role of women. However, Oppenheimer criticized both perspectives, noting that there was no evidence of an ""independence effect"" and that women's employment and education had little effect on marriage timing. Instead, she presented an alternative theory focusing on men's economic position, specifically their uncertainty about their future economic prospects, as a key factor in the decline of marriage. This theory has been supported by research in Europe, where demographic trends and economic problems have been similar to those in the United States. However, the theory's applicability may vary across different European countries due to differences in societal contexts and the role of the welfare state.",0

1. Malaria is caused by parasites belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, family Plasmodiidae, and genus Plasmodium, with the most prevalent species being Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. The natural transmission occurs through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, with Anopheles darlingi being the most prevalent species.
2. Chloroquine and primaquine are used for malaria treatment, with chloroquine being a blood schizonticide and primaquine active against latent tissue forms of P. vivax or hypnozoites. Chloroquine can cause side effects such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can also occur during primaquine use. Primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia, resulting in jaundice and choluria.
3. The most common symptoms of malaria are fever, chills, sweating, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. Chloroquine treatment can lead to the disappearance of fever, significant reduction of peripheral parasitemia, and decrease in pain symptoms. However, it can also cause side effects such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Primaquine use can cause hemolytic anemia, which is more prevalent in areas with higher levels of g6pd deficiency.
4. The study evaluated the frequency of symptoms before and after antimalarial treatment with chloroquine and primaquine in patients with vivax malaria in Mncio Lima, Brazil. A significant reduction in fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain was noted after treatment initiation, but there was also a significant increase in nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste in the mouth, weakness, and hypochondrial pain. The frequency of choluria increased to 56%.

1. The text discusses the correlation between lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in elderly men, with a focus on the potential common pathophysiology between the two conditions.
2. The study examines the effects of a combination of the alpha-blocker tamsulosin and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin on erectile function in men with LUTS/BPH and ED. The participants were divided into two groups: one received only tamsulosin, and the other received both tamsulosin and solifenacin.
3. The results showed that both groups experienced significant improvements in LUTS and IPSS scores, but there was no significant difference in the improvement of sexual function between the two groups. The study suggests that while the combination therapy may improve LUTS, it does not significantly improve sexual function in patients with LUTS/BPH and ED.

1. Mir-200c is a microRNA that represses zeb1 and zeb2, proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and loss of e-cadherin expression. Mir-200c also represses additional non-epithelial genes such as fibronectin, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, quaking 1, and tubb3. Mir-200c and zeb1 regulate each other in a double-negative feedback loop, and mir-200c expression is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell characteristics.
2. Mir-200c has been shown to decrease cell migration and invasion, and its loss is a marker for chemoresistance and aggressiveness in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. Mir-200c represses tubb3, a gene that is aberrantly expressed in several types of cancers and causes resistance to paclitaxel. Restoring mir-200c expression in cancer cells increases their sensitivity to paclitaxel by repressing tubb3. However, not all cells exhibit the double-negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1, and this can be exploited to identify their distinct roles.

1. The transobturator approach to treating female stress urinary incontinence using midurethral slings was first described by Delorme, and later modified by De Leval to reduce potential injuries to the urethra and bladder using an inside-out approach.
2. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator muscle procedures. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective.
3. This cadaveric study aimed to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT scan image analysis. The results showed that the out-in tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the in-out tapes, and both techniques had a safe distance from the obturator canal. However, distances of the tape trajectories to the individual obturator nerve branches could not be determined.
4. The mean full inner angle of the in-out mus measured 122 (95%ci: 107-136) degrees, while the out-in mus measured 144 (95%ci: 131-151) degrees (p = 0.02). The differences in tape inner angles were significantly different, with a mean difference of 19.8 (median 19.0) (wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.008). There was a trend between the out-in and in-out mus angle (correlation coefficient: 0.6, p = 0.08), as well as between the patient's BMI and the in-out mus angle (correlation coefficient: 0.6, p = 0.08), but not for BMI and the out-in mus angle (correlation coefficient: 0.08, p = 0.8). There was no correlation between the infra-pubic angle measurement and the out-in mus angle nor the in-out mus angle.

1. Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, testified before the Children, Young People and Education Committee about the impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. He emphasized that the sector makes a significant economic contribution to Wales, but uncertainty about future relationships and arrangements with Europe is causing difficulties for universities. The sector is exposed to sources of income from the EU, including EU students, structural funds, and research funding. Applications from EU students and international students have decreased, and there are signs of increasing difficulties in collaborative research activities. The financial impact of these challenges is uncertain, but the sector is preparing for potential turbulence.
2. Bethan Owen, the Director of Institutional Engagement at the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, provided details on the decreases in EU and international student applications to Welsh institutions. She also outlined the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector, including funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and uncertainty about the consequences of the review in England of fees and funding. The sector is forecasting a deficit for the current year, and institutions are trying to minimize costs while maintaining infrastructure for future funding.
3. Darren Millar, a committee member, asked about the financial forecasts of universities and the potential impact of Brexit on fee and access plans. Dr. Blaney responded that universities are required to submit fee and access plans annually, and they make assumptions about income based on recruitment forecasts. If there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then fee income will decrease, and institutions may need to find other sources of income to maintain investment in student mobility and research. The sector is committed to promoting and resourcing international mobility, and there are ongoing discussions about the potential impact of Brexit on the Erasmus+ programme.
