Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials that direct particle transport and are of interest due to their potential for extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations in biological systems.\n\u2022 Recent research has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, which are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes. The behavior of these systems is complex and can change dramatically as parameters change, leading to changes in transport properties.\n\u2022 A study by Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the time and ensemble-averaged velocity, can change direction depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics.\n\u2022 A later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals can occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits. However, their arguments implicitly assume ergodicity, which is not always true for chaotic systems.\n\u2022 The behavior of chaotic systems can depend strongly on the initial ensemble, and this has implications for experimental validation of results. A study of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the system considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno, is reported.\n\u2022 The study considers the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and shows that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.

These welded blanks then undergo heat treatment to form a surface alloy and are then hot-pressed and quenched.\n* The invention aims to solve the difficulties encountered when welding coated steel blanks, where a portion of the initial surface pre-coating is transferred into the molten area created by the welding operation. This results in intermetallic areas that tend to be the site of onset of rupture under static or dynamic conditions, reducing the overall deformability of the welded joints after heat treatment.\n* The invention proposes eliminating the source of these intermetallic areas, namely the initial surface metal coating liable to be melted during butt-welding. However, this gives rise to a serious problem of scale formation and decarburizing within areas located next to the weld, which tend to corrode when the parts go into service because they are not protected by any coating.

The program has been extended and reauthorized multiple times, with the latest reauthorization being considered. Under CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigates contaminated areas and places the most highly contaminated sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) for study and cleanup. As of December 1996, there were 1,210 sites on the NPL. After a site is placed on the NPL, EPA extensively studies and evaluates the site to determine the appropriate cleanup remedy for it. The remedy selected depends upon the site's characteristics, such as the types and levels of contamination, the risks posed to human health and the environment, and the applicable cleanup standards. The site's cleanup can be conducted by EPA or the party responsible for the contamination, with oversight by EPA or the state.\n\n\u2022 Superfund Incineration: Incineration is the burning of substances by a controlled flame in an enclosed area and is used as a Superfund cleanup remedy.

It is currently managed by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). CRAF supports DOD airlift requirements in emergencies when the need for airlift exceeds the capacity of DOD's organic airlift fleet.\n- **CRAF Participation and Activation:** To participate in CRAF, a carrier must commit at least 30% of its CRAF-capable passenger fleet and 15% of its CRAF-capable cargo fleet. Aircraft committed must be U.S. registered and air carriers must also commit and maintain at least four complete crews for each aircraft in CRAF. CRAF has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into the long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into the domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the aircraft performance characteristics needed. The long-range international section consists of commercial airliners capable of transoceanic operations. Medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft make up the short-range international section supporting near offshore airlift requirements. The aircraft in the Alaskan section provide airlift within U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility, specific to Alaska needs. The domestic section is designed to satisfy increased DOD airlift requirements in the United States during an emergency. The aeromedical evacuation segment assists in the evacuation of casualties from operational theaters to hospitals in the continental United States.\n- **CRAF Legislation and Funding:** The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) contained three provisions that affected the CRAF. First, Section 356 called for a comprehensive and independent assessment of CRAF to examine current and long-range issues associated with CRAF and make specific recommendations for preserving and improving the program.

The lizards from the northern populations (fuenfra and golondrina) were larger, heavier, and had larger, more robust heads than the lizards from the southern populations (aranjuez and belmonte). These differences could be explained by the different contrasting environments where these populations live, with the northern mountains having cold temperatures, high humidity, and high altitude, and the southern plains having hot temperatures, dry conditions, and low altitude.\n\n\u2022 The study also found that there are differences in the number of femoral pores and blue spots between the populations. Males from the northern populations have more femoral pores and less blue spots than males from the southern populations. These differences suggest that the importance of chemical and visual signals may differ between populations, with a higher number of femoral pores being related to a higher production of chemical secretions, and a larger number of blue spots representing a higher use of visual signals. The relative importance of these two sensory modes may be explained by the effectiveness of these two types of communication in different environments.\n\n\u2022 The chemical analyses showed that femoral gland secretions of P. hispanica have carboxylic acids and steroids as predominant components.

It was first described in a salt mine in Bad Ischl, Austria, and has since been found in many salt deposits worldwide. In evaporites, polyhalite is commonly associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.\n\n\u2022 The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, and later confirmed. It can be synthesized in the laboratory under specific conditions. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite has been found to start at 255\u00b0C and reach a maximum of 343\u00b0C. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements significantly changes dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures.\n\n\u2022 Polyhalite most commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact with the precursor rock.

Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials that direct particle transport and are of interest due to their potential for extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations in biological systems.\n\u2022 Recent research has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, which are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes. The behavior of these systems is complex and can change dramatically as parameters change, leading to changes in transport properties.\n\u2022 A study by Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the time and ensemble-averaged velocity, can change direction depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics.\n\u2022 A later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals can occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits. However, their arguments implicitly assume ergodicity, which is not always true for chaotic systems.\n\u2022 The behavior of chaotic systems can depend strongly on the initial ensemble, and this has implications for experimental validation of results. A study of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the system considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno, is reported.\n\u2022 The study considers the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and shows that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.

The main result is a sufficient condition for a knot that admits no purely cosmetic surgery in terms of its Jones polynomial.\n\n\u2022 The proof of the main result relies on a surgery formula by Lescop, which involves a knot invariant that satisfies a crossing change formula. The authors show that this invariant is the same as the finite type invariant of order five. This enables them to reformulate the main result in terms of the finite type invariants of the knot.

Under CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigates contaminated areas and places the most highly contaminated sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) for study and cleanup. As of December 1996, there were 1,210 sites on the NPL. After a site is placed on the NPL, EPA extensively studies and evaluates the site to determine the appropriate cleanup remedy for it. The remedy selected depends upon the site's characteristics, such as the types and levels of contamination, the risks posed to human health and the environment, and the applicable cleanup standards. The site's cleanup can be conducted by EPA or the party responsible for the contamination, with oversight by EPA or the state.\n\n\u2022 Superfund Incineration: Incineration is the burning of substances by a controlled flame in an enclosed area and is used as a Superfund cleanup remedy.

It is currently managed by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). CRAF supports DOD airlift requirements in emergencies when the need for airlift exceeds the capacity of DOD's organic airlift fleet.\n- **CRAF Participation and Activation:** To participate in CRAF, a carrier must commit at least 30% of its CRAF-capable passenger fleet and 15% of its CRAF-capable cargo fleet. Aircraft committed must be U.S. registered and air carriers must also commit and maintain at least four complete crews for each aircraft in CRAF. CRAF has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into the long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into the domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the aircraft performance characteristics needed. The long-range international section consists of commercial airliners capable of transoceanic operations. Medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft make up the short-range international section supporting near offshore airlift requirements. The aircraft in the Alaskan section provide airlift within U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility, specific to Alaska needs. The domestic section is designed to satisfy increased DOD airlift requirements in the United States during an emergency. The aeromedical evacuation segment assists in the evacuation of casualties from operational theaters to hospitals in the continental United States.\n- **CRAF Legislation and Funding:** The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) contained three provisions that affected the CRAF. First, Section 356 called for a comprehensive and independent assessment of CRAF to examine current and long-range issues associated with CRAF and make specific recommendations for preserving and improving the program. Second, Section 378 of the FY2008 NDAA extended authorization of the Aviation Insurance Program (AIP) from", "format_properties": {"n_points": 3, "n_subpoints": 1, "symbol": "*"}}

The lizards from the northern populations (fuenfra and golondrina) were larger, heavier, and had larger, more robust heads than the lizards from the southern populations (aranjuez and belmonte).

These differences suggest that the importance of chemical and visual signals may differ between populations, with a higher number of femoral pores being related to a higher production of chemical secretions, and a larger number of blue spots representing a higher use of visual signals. The relative importance of these two sensory modes may be explained by the effectiveness of these two types of communication in different environments.\n\n\u2022 The chemical analyses showed that femoral gland secretions of P. hispanica have carboxylic acids and steroids as predominant components.
