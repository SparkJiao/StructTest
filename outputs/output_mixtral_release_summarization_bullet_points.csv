• The transport properties of nonlinear, non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials that direct particle transport and are of interest due to their potential for extracting useful work from noisy fluctuations in biological systems.

• Recent research has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, which are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes. The behavior of these systems is complex and can change dramatically as parameters change, leading to changes in transport properties.

• A study by Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the time and ensemble-averaged velocity, could change direction depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics.

• A later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals could occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits. However, their arguments implicitly assume ergodicity, which is not always true for chaotic systems.

• A detailed methodology is necessary to understand transport properties in mixed regular and chaotic systems, taking into account the dependence on ensemble statistics and parameter values.

• The current in chaotic systems can depend significantly on the initial ensemble and transient behavior, making broad heuristics rare. A study of the same system considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno finds that the current depends on the initial ensemble and that bifurcations can be associated with abrupt changes in the current, but not necessarily with current reversals.

• The behavior of individual trajectories and ensembles can be subtly connected, and a bifurcation diagram can be used to characterize the behavior of a system as a function of a parameter.

• The goal of the studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets and discover heuristic rules by considering specific systems in detail before generalizing.

- The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z-boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z-decay into fermion pairs with high precision. The agreement between LEP data and SM predictions has constrained new physics at the Z-pole.
* The physics of the Z-boson is expected to play a central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Z-factory is realized, which can generate Z events several orders of magnitude higher than that of LEP.
* The decay of the Z-boson into light Higgs bosons is another type of rare process that has been widely studied. In contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decays in the SM, the rates of these decays can be as large as the SM prediction in new physics models.
* The work extends previous studies of these decays to some new models and investigates these decays altogether, motivated by recent studies on the singlet extension of the MSSM and the more stringent constraints on the properties of the light Higgs boson.
* The study examines the constraints on the light CP-odd Higgs from many latest experimental results and compares the rare Z-decays in four models, namely the type-II 2HDM, the L2HDM, the NMSSM, and the NMSSM.
* The general 2HDM contains two Higgs doublets, and after the electroweak symmetry breaking, the spectrum of this Higgs sector includes three massless Goldstone modes, two CP-even Higgs bosons, one neutral CP-odd Higgs particle, and a pair of charged Higgs bosons.

- Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem, predicts gauge coupling unification, and the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles. The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology. In the no-scale type Kahler potential, the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes. The only source of SUSY breaking is gaugino masses, making this scenario highly predictive.
* The no-scale structure of the Kahler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory. If the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated in the superspace density in the supergravity Lagrangian, the Kahler potential is given as in eq. ([eq : noscalekahler]). In a five-dimensional setting with two branes, the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other, and the form of the Kahler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed eq. ([eq : noscalekahler]). In this scenario, gaugino mediation induces SUSY breaking on the hidden sector brane to the visible sector brane, and the no-scale boundary condition is given at the compactification scale of the fifth dimension.
* The no-scale scenario has limited degrees of freedom in the SUSY particle mass spectrum because only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given. Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, mainly focusing on the mass spectrum. Direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint were considered, and the allowed region in the parameter space was identified. The minimal scenario, where universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, is severely constrained by the cosmological constraint. The second case, where universal gaugino masses are given above the GUT scale, and the third case, where non-universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, are not as constrained.

* Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but this strength is weakened by relative cross polarization prior to collision.
* A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) possesses a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity, initiating a literature on horizon stability.
* CH formed in spacetimes of CPW was shown to be unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and any perturbation applied to a CPW spacetime will turn the CH into an essential singularity.
* The electromagnetic (EM) field itself weakens the strength of a singularity in CPW, with collision of pure EM waves having special significance for singularity formation.
* A solution describing the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves was given by Bell and Szekeres, where the singularity (a CH) formed in the interaction region is removable by a coordinate transformation, but essential curvature singularities exist on the null boundaries.
* A cross-polarized version of the Bell-Szekeres solution (CPBS) was found, with the Weyl scalars being all regular in the interaction region, but singularities remain on the null boundaries.
* The paper tests the validity of a conjecture by Helliwell and Konkowski regarding CH stability using the CPBS solution as a test ground, with various added test fields.
* The metric describing collision of EM waves with cross polarization was found to be a minimal extension of the BS metric, and the interaction region of this metric is of type-d without scalar curvature singularities.
* The single component of the Weyl scalar is used to explore the true nature of the singularity, and it is found to be a quasiregular (qr) singularity, the mildest type among all types of singularities.

• X-ray studies of ""normal"" galaxies have been extended to cosmologically interesting distances through deep field surveys, which have reached 1 ms of exposure. These surveys have detected significant numbers of normal galaxies among the population of X-ray sources contributing to the diffuse X-ray background (XRB).

• Normal galaxies contribute as much as 50-100% of the XRB flux in the 0.52 keV band. The investigation of the typical galaxy, whether its X-ray emission is dominated by X-ray binaries, hot interstellar gas, or a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), is an important function of deep X-ray surveys.

• Normal galaxies are likely to be the most numerous extragalactic X-ray sources in the universe and are expected to dominate the number counts at 0.52 keV fluxes of 10^-15 - 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2.

• The Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) survey has reached the depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies to z~1.3, corresponding to a look-back time of 8.2 Gyr. Reaching larger look-back times presents the exciting possibility of detecting the bulk X-ray response to the heightened star formation rate at z~3.

• The CDF-N data provide extremely deep X-ray coverage over a large area, allowing for the study of the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to K-band luminosity of normal spiral galaxies up to z~1.3. This ratio is an indicator of the current level of star formation in a galaxy.

* Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, with different degrees of non-classicality.
* Bipartite correlations are considered, with two spatially separated parties named Alice and Bob.
* Non-separable or entangled states are those that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents.
* Bell-nonlocality is the strongest form of non-classicality, where measurement correlations violate Bell inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality.
* EPR-steering is a weaker form of non-classicality, where a bipartite state allows for a demonstration of EPR-steering, and is the only way to verify entanglement if one of the parties or their detectors cannot be trusted.
* A bipartite state is Bell-local if and only if there is a local hidden variable (LHV) model for any measurements Alice and Bob perform.
* The set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non-EPR-steerable states, which is a strict subset of the set of Bell-local states.
* The steering ellipsoid formalism is used to investigate EPR-steerability of the class of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, the so-called T-states.
* Two sufficient conditions for T-states to be EPR-steerable are obtained via suitable EPR-steering inequalities, including a new asymmetric steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix.

- The visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information is not conclusively known, but Richard Feynman is said to have mentioned the idea in casual conversations around 1985.
- Spintronic logic gates, which use the spin of electrons to encode information, were first proposed in the mid 1990s. Spin-based devices may have advantages over charge-based devices, including lower power dissipation, reduced sensitivity to noise, and the potential for faster operation.
- In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins was proposed. The system uses exchange interaction between neighboring spins to create a binary variable based on the spin orientation of conduction band electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.
- Spintronic devices may have a problem with unidirectional flow of logic signals due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction. This can prevent logic signals from propagating from the input to the output of the logic device.
- A proposed solution to this problem is to use clocking, as is done in charge coupled device (CCD) arrays, to impose unidirectionality in time. This would involve lowering barriers between neighboring cells to allow exchange interaction and then raising them again to propagate the input state through a linear array.
- The use of spin in classical irreversible logic gates dissipates a minimum amount of energy per bit flip, which can be significant. To overcome this challenge, logically and physically reversible quantum gates have been devised.
- Spin coherence times in solids are much larger than charge coherence times, making spin the preferred vehicle to encode qubits in solids. Optical read out of qubits, which does not require contacts, is a more practical approach than electrical read out.

• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary star fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off around 77 minutes.

• The minimum period of CV evolution occurs when the mass transfer time scale and the thermal time scale of the donor star are approximately equal. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the rate of orbital angular momentum losses. The paper investigates ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population.

• The orbital angular momentum loss rate of a CV can be written as the sum of the systemic loss rate and a term that depends on the mass transfer rate. Possible mechanisms for consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) include magnetic propellers and accretion disc winds. The paper presents detailed calculations of the long-term evolution of CVs and compares the observed short-period CV period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions.

• The main elements of SQ include a primary shock, an intruder galaxy (NGC 7318b), a Seyfert 2 galaxy, and other group members. A peculiar extranuclear star formation region, SQ-a, is located at the shock wave's extreme northern end.
• The discovery of extremely powerful pure rotational H2 line emission using the Spitzer Space Telescope has sparked interest in the SQ system.
• The collision between two inhomogeneous gas flows describes H2 formation in the shocked gas, and mechanical heating driven by the radio jet interaction with the host galaxy's ISM is the favored mechanism for the observed MIR H2 line emission.
• The SQ detection has led to the discovery of several other systems with similarly strong H2 emission, and large-subset of local 3CR radio galaxies exhibit extremely dominant MIR rotational H2 lines.
• The study of nearby prototypes, like SQ, can provide valuable insights into the nature of more distant systems.

- The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula and may have been injected into the presolar cloud or solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
- The injection of SLRI occurred as a single spatially heterogeneous event, which could reduce its usefulness as a spatially homogeneous chronometer for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation.
- Initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles.
- The stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation, possibly due to UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula.
- MGU disks can accomplish early large-scale transport of refractory particles from the inner to the outer solar nebula, and are likely involved in FU Orionis outbursts experienced by young solar-type stars.
- MGU models can explain high mass accretion rates needed to explain FU Orionis events, and offer an alternative mechanism for gas giant planet formation.

- The first evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was observed through supernovae type Ia (SNIA) being fainter than expected.
- This observation has been confirmed by various independent measurements, including temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), and gamma-ray bursts.
* The accelerated expansion is attributed to a new energy density component with negative pressure, known as dark energy (DE).
* The nature of dark energy is unknown, and understanding its properties is a major scientific effort. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the origin of DE.
* The current cosmological model, known as Lambda-CDM, assumes a cold dark matter (CDM) component with negligible pressure and temperature, which contributes to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures.
* The Lambda-CDM model is favored by observations but not theoretically satisfactory, as the value of the cosmological constant is much smaller than estimated in particle physics.
* Suggestions have been made that DE could be dynamic and evolve with time, leading to the introduction of new cosmological models.
* Interaction between dark matter and dark energy has been proposed to address the coincidence problem, which arises from the similarity of their current values despite their potentially different time variations.
* Observational evidence can constrain the dark matter-dark energy interaction, potentially leading to its detection.
* The emergence of galaxies and large-scale structures is connected to the growth of matter density perturbations, which are affected by the interaction between dark sector components.

• Type 1 AGN spectra show a variety of broad and narrow emission lines that provide information about the structure and kinematics of photoionized gas near the central massive object. Broad emission lines like Hβ are thought to originate in or near an accretion disk. Two populations of Type 1 AGN have been identified based on the width of the Hβ line. Population A has the smallest broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ = 1000-4000 km/s) and includes narrow-line Seyfert 1 sources (FWHM Hβ < 2000 km/s). Population B sources have larger broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ = 4000-12000 km/s) and include both radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars.

• FeII emission is almost ubiquitous in Type 1 quasars and is thought to arise in or near the emitting clouds that produce other low-ionization lines like Hβ. The width of the FeII emission appears to correlate with the width of the Hβ line. Systematic line shifts, such as a systematic blueshift of high-ionization lines relative to low-ionization lines in Population A sources, and a recent claim of a systematic redshift of FeII relative to [OIII]5007 in a majority of Type 1 quasars, have important implications for models of the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region.

• The claim of a systematic FeII redshift was tested using a sample of bright SDSS DR5 quasars and found no evidence for a systematic shift of FeII lines relative to Hβ or [OIII]5007. The majority of the h08 sample, which reported the systematic FeII redshift, consists of lower signal-to-noise ratio spectra than those in the sample used in the test. The accuracy of FeII shift measures depends on the FeII strength, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and the presence of other emission lines.

• The claim of large FeII shifts in Type 1 AGN is not confirmed and cannot be confirmed using composite spectra generated from random subsamples of sources.

• Similar experiments by EOS and INDRA followed, but obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region being absent in most cases.
• Discrepancies in the experimental results are attributed to the precision of the measurements and finite-size effects, which depend on the reaction type.
• Recent reevaluations by the ALADIN group brought corrections to the kinetic energies of emitted neutrons and showed that the energies of spectator parts grow with approximately 30 MeV in the bombarding energy interval 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon.
• Theoretical calculations suggest that for the reactions studied, the equilibrated sources sequence should be the same, indicating the presence of an important nonequilibrium part included in the measured source excitation energies.
• The improved version of the microcanonical multifragmentation model is presented, which includes refinements in the break-up stage and secondary particle emission stage.

- The solar corona is heated to a temperature of about 12 million kelvins, which is much higher than the visible surface of the sun, known as the photosphere, at roughly 250 times cooler.
- Magnetic fields or waves are believed to play a key role in heating the solar corona, with energy being converted from convective energy in the photosphere to thermal energy in the corona via magnetic fields or wave energy.
- The primary energy source for this heating must lie in the convection zone below the solar photosphere, where there is 100 times as much energy available than that required to heat the corona.
- The debate over the energy to heat the corona centers on whether it derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events giving rise to nanoflares.
- Theoretical studies suggest that only high-frequency MHD waves are capable of significant heating, and these waves have been sought using the Fe XIV green ""line"" at 530.3 nm and the Fe X red ""line"" at 637.5 nm.
- Observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations of the coronal structures have been made using ground-based equipment, but the results are somewhat contradictory, with both positive and negative observations of oscillations.
- A new setup will be used to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations, using the mid-sized coronagraph at Lomnicky Peak Observatory and the SECIS instrument.
- The coronagraph is equipped with a fast optical automatic guider that detects offsets of the actual pointing and precisely stabilizes the relative position of the occulting disk against the solar image.
- The SECIS instrument was built to search for short-period coronal light oscillations and has been used successfully during total eclipses seen from various locations.
- The SECIS instrument installed at the Lomnicky Peak Observatory Lyot coronagraph will allow data to be acquired that may result in an improved knowledge of where in the corona MHD waves are generated and/or dissipated.

- Threshold nets are obtained by assigning weights to nodes and connecting those with a combined weight above a certain threshold. They can be produced with arbitrary degree distributions and encompass a wide variety of architectures.
- Threshold graphs may be more elegantly encoded by a two-letter sequence, with nodes of type 9 connecting to none of the existing nodes and nodes of type 10 connecting to all of the nodes. This modular structure gives rise to cliques and subsets of nodes that connect to subsequent nodes.
- Given the sequence of a threshold net, important structural benchmarks such as degree distribution, triangles, betweenness centrality, and the spectrum and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian can be computed. This allows for the design of threshold nets with specific properties.
- Despite their malleability, threshold nets have limitations such as a diameter of 1 or 2. A broader class of nets, called sequence nets, can be constructed from a sequence of letters with deterministic rules of connectivity. Each additional letter in the alphabet increases the diameter of the nets by one.
- Sequence nets gain much latitude in the types of nets that can be described while retaining analytical appeal. They also admit a natural ordering, allowing for the exploration of eigenvalues and other structural properties.
- In a study of two-letter sequence nets, it was found that threshold nets are only one of three equivalence classes, characterized by the highest level of symmetry. The remaining two classes also exhibit a high degree of modularity and can be related to a generalized form of threshold nets.
- Three-letter sequence nets can be derived from a two-letter alphabet with symmetry arguments, leading to the discovery of 30 distinct equivalence classes. Among these classes, a natural extension of threshold nets to three-letter sequence nets can be identified.
- The analysis of 3-letter sequence nets can be done using the directed graph notation, where nodes represent the letters of the sequence alphabet and a directed link from one letter to another indicates the rule. This notation is useful for the analysis of sequence nets with more than two letters.

- The lasso method for variable selection in high-dimensional data analysis uses an L1-norm penalty.
- The lasso estimate can be viewed as the mode of the posterior distribution, and the L1 penalty can be transformed into a Laplace prior, which can be expressed as a Gaussian scale mixture.
- This has led to Bayesian developments of the lasso and its variants, as well as work on nonconvex penalization under a parametric Bayesian framework.
- The paper discusses the use of subordinators, one-dimensional Lévy processes that are almost surely non-decreasing, in Bayesian nonconvex penalization problems under supervised learning scenarios.
- The authors model latent shrinkage parameters using subordinators, which are defined as stochastic processes of regularization parameters, and show that both gamma and Poisson subordinators are limiting cases of two families of compound Poisson subordinators.
- The paper also establishes a connection between two nonconvex penalty functions, log and exp, with the Laplace transforms of gamma and Poisson subordinators.
- The authors use the notion of Bernstein and completely monotone functions, as well as subordinators, in their work on Bayesian sparse learning problems.
- They discuss the use of subordinators in the construction of sparsity-inducing priors, and propose a hierarchical model with multiple regularization parameters, giving rise to a Bayesian approach for nonconvex penalization.
- They devise an ECME (expectation/conditional maximization either) algorithm to adaptively adjust the local regularization parameters in finding the sparse solution simultaneously.
- The paper is organized into sections on Lévy processes in Bayesian sparse learning problems, two families of compound Poisson processes, the application of Lévy processes to Bayesian linear regression, empirical evaluations using simulated data, and conclusions.

• The text discusses the proposal by Sauls and co-workers to examine the nonlinear current response of d-wave superconductors as a probe of order parameter symmetry. They showed that a nonanalyticity in the current-velocity relation is introduced by the presence of nodes in the order parameter, leading to an anisotropy in the nonlinear current as a function of the direction of the superfluid velocity relative to the position of the node.

• The text also mentions the proposal by Dahm and Scalapino, who examined the quadratic term in the magnetic response of the penetration depth, which shows a T^3 dependence at low temperatures. They demonstrated that this upturn would provide a clear and unique signature of the nodes in the d-wave gap and that this feature could be measured directly via microwave intermodulation effects. Experimental verification of this has been obtained, confirming that nonlinear microwave current response can be used as a sensitive probe of issues associated with the order parameter symmetry.

• The text then goes on to consider the case of two-band superconductors, such as MgB2, and compares the differences between one-band and two-band s-wave superconductors in terms of their nonlinear response. The authors find new effects due to strong coupling at both high and low temperatures in the one-band case, and signatures of the low energy scale due to the smaller gap, the effect of integration of the bands, and the response to inter- and intraband impurities in the two-band case.

• Selecting an appropriate distance measure is crucial for 1-NN classification, with the DTW distance being more suitable for time series data than the commonly used Euclidean distance.
• Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band) was initially introduced to speed up DTW calculation and later used as a global constraint, with its width historically fixed at 10% of time series length.
• Recent work shows that classification accuracy depends on the size of the global constraint, which should be determined based on data properties by testing all possible widths and selecting the one with maximum training accuracy.
• Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band) generalizes the global constraint model, represented by a one-dimensional array, and can be adjusted according to its own class warping path.
• A learning algorithm is needed to discover the best multi R-K bands, with the original work proposing a hill climbing search algorithm using accuracy and distance metrics as heuristic functions.
• To address overfitting, two new learning algorithms are introduced: band boundary extraction and iterative learning, which adjust band structures based on a silhouette index.
• The proposed classification algorithm uses 1-NN with DTW distance and multi R-K bands as a global constraint, with the best R-K band selected using the band boundary extraction or iterative learning algorithm and silhouette index.

• The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles has been successful in describing electroweak (EW) scale nature, and the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson, strengthening the correctness of the SM. However, there is no explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM reported from the LHC.

• An anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) has been observed, with estimated discrepancies between SM predictions and measured values consistently more than expected. This anomaly could suggest new physics beyond the SM, possibly related to new particles and interactions in the muon sector.

• The SM Lagrangian contains terms contributing to lepton masses, including Yukawa couplings for charged leptons. Neutrino masses are determined by Yukawa couplings, Majorana masses, and interactions that break lepton symmetry. The seesaw mechanism can provide the observed order one neutrino mixing if Majorana masses are of the same order.

• Quantum entanglement in multipartite systems has unique properties and plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.
• The dynamical behavior of entanglement under decoherence has been studied extensively, with a focus on the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD).
• ESD is the termination of entanglement in a finite time, even when the coherence of individual qubits is lost asymptotically.
• However, further studies have shown that ESD is not always the eventual fate of qubit entanglement. Entanglement can revive after some time of ESD, and in some cases, finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit due to structured environments.
• The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.
• A similar situation occurs for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom for one of the two particles interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.
• The entanglement dynamics in a double Jaynes-Cummings model shows that entanglement is transferred periodically among all bipartite partitions, and an identity is satisfied at any time.
• A system consisting of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs exhibits similar behavior, even in the presence of decoherence, due to the unitary evolution of the global system.
• The distribution of entanglement among bipartite subsystems depends on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.
• The rich dynamical behaviors obtained previously in the literature can be regarded as special cases of the present result or Markovian approximation.

• Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful flashes of gamma-rays that lack a definitive explanation, with isotropic distribution in the sky and lasting from less than one second to tens of seconds. They are observed above the Earth's atmosphere using X-gamma ray detectors aboard satellites.

• At least long GRBs are at cosmological distances, with measured redshifts up to 4.5. The most likely candidates for these events are the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) and the coalescence of one compact binary system, both of which are expected to emit gravitational waves (GWs).

• The duration of a GW burst is predicted to be of the order of a few milliseconds for various sources, including coalescing and merging black holes and/or neutron star binaries. Present resonant detectors can detect GW bursts, but the sensitivity required for detecting a gravitational signal associated with a single GRB is not yet achievable.

• A program has been launched to study the presence of correlations between GRB events detected with BeppoSAX and the output signals from gravitational antennas Nautilus and Explorer. The analysis uses an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors, coping with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts and unmodelled noise.

• The probability density function of GW amplitude is plotted, with the highest beliefs for very small values, while values above a certain threshold are practically ruled out. An upper limit for the amplitude of GWs can be provided, such that there is a given probability for the amplitude of GWs to be below it.

• Using a cross-correlation method applied to the data of two GW detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, new experimental upper limits have been determined for the burst intensity causing correlations of GWs with GRBs. The result is given in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound, which is considered the most complete and unbiased way of providing experimental information.

• The process of selecting high-quality scientific publications can be overwhelming due to the vast number of works produced. Citation count is a common measure of a paper's scientific credibility, but it may not account for unnoticed or forgotten publications.

• A simple model is proposed to study the citation distribution of scientific publications, focusing on two research areas and referencing within and across each other. This model can also be applied to the web of human sexual contacts, where interactions between males and females are considered as two coupled growing networks.

• The model's time evolution is analyzed using a rate equation approach, and the proposed model is visualized in Figure 1, illustrating the growth mechanism. The time evolution of the joint distribution of intra-links and cross-links is described by a rate equation, which can be used to find other distributions.

• The total in-degree distribution in the network follows a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes. The distribution of the average number of nodes with intra-links in the network also exhibits a power-law form, depending on the coupling parameter.

• The model can represent various complex systems, such as citation networks and the web of human sexual contacts, with different power-law exponents for intra-link and cross-link distributions.

• The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions is traditionally framed in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.
• The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
• However, this production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions.
• Instead, recombination of partons is shown to be a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.
• The purpose of the paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
• The shower parton distributions (SPD) can be determined phenomenologically in the same way as fragmentation functions are, except that they are defined in the context of the recombination model.
• The recombination model provides a generic formula for a hadronization process, and the shower parton distributions can be used to determine the properties of the distribution of quarks and antiquarks in a shower initiated by a hard parton.
• The paper demonstrates the importance of the recombination of shower partons with other partons that are not in the jet but are in the ambient environment, and shows how the shower parton distributions can be determined phenomenologically and applied in heavy-ion collisions.

• Differential geometry has been valuable in extracting the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories, with the Dirac-Khler formulation of fermionic field theory being of particular interest. This formulation uses the antisymmetry inherent in the product between differential forms to describe the Clifford algebra.

• To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, which would ideally have the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit. However, defining such a scheme has proven challenging, with difficulties often exhibited by the Hodge star and the wedge product between forms.

• Several discrete schemes have been proposed to address these difficulties, including the use of a lattice to define operators with desirable properties but non-locality, and the introduction of translation operators to resolve non-locality. Other proposals include the use of a quantized phase space to regularize the system, leading to a fuzzy coordinate space.

• In this paper, the authors build upon a proposal by Adams, which introduces two parallel lattices to maintain the locality of the Hodge star and uses a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product. This proposal describes a local, discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space, and its formal aspects have been thoroughly studied. The authors focus on its application to the Dirac-Khler formulation.

• The text discusses the use of cognitive radio networks and information-theoretic security to ensure secure wireless communication. A cognitive radio network allows secondary users to transmit on the same frequency band as primary users, as long as the interference power at the primary receivers is below a certain limit. Information-theoretic security involves using the secrecy capacity to transmit messages while keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the transmitted information.

• The text also presents a collaborative relay beamforming scheme for a cognitive radio network, which involves using relay nodes to transmit messages between a source and a destination while ensuring that the interference on the primary user's transmission is below a certain limit. The beamforming optimization problem is formulated as a quasiconvex optimization problem, which can be solved through convex semidefinite programming (SDP). Two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes are proposed to reduce the computational complexity.

• The parallel chip-firing game is a periodic automaton on graphs where vertices, each with a nonnegative number of chips, simultaneously fire one chip to their neighbors if possible. The game was introduced in 1992 and has been shown to have deep connections with number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. It also has nontrivial computing capabilities and can simulate classical computer gates and two-register machines.

• The game has a step operator that determines the position after one step, and for each initial position, there is a finite number of positions and a positive integer called the period, which is the number of steps before the game repeats. Kominers and Kominers (2008) proved that the period of any position on a tree graph is 1 or 2 and established a polynomial bound for the transient length of positions on such graphs.

• The game can be used to simulate a pile of particles that falls whenever there are too many particles stacked at any point, which is an important problem in statistical physics. The game is also an example of a cellular automaton, which has implications in biology, social science, and other fields.

• In section 2, the document establishes lemmas about parallel chip-firing games on general simple connected graphs, including bounds on the number of chips on any single vertex in games with nontrivial period and a necessary and sufficient condition for a period to occur. In section 3, the document finds every possible period for the complete bipartite graph.

• The document also discusses the relationship between period lengths and the activity or lengths of subcycles of the graph, conjecturing that any period length of a game on a graph is either a divisor of the order of some subcycle of the graph or the least common multiple of the orders of some disjoint subcycles of the graph.

• The broadband emission of GRB 090510 has been analyzed using synchrotron/self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) and traditional afterglow models, but it has become evident that GRBs can be subdivided into various classes and sub-classes, each characterized by specific progenitors requiring specific theoretical treatments.
• GRB 090510 is taken as a prototype for short gamma-ray bursts (S-GRBs), and a new time-resolved spectral analysis is performed, revealing a new structure in the thermal emission of the precursor (P-GRB) emission and the onset of GEV emission linked to black hole (BH) formation.
• This sequence illustrates the formation process of a BH, and the analysis is guided by a theoretical approach successfully tested in this new family of S-GRBs.
• The discovery of the first prototype of this S-GRB class, GRB 090227b, led to the first detailed analysis of a genuine short GRB originating from a binary NS merger leading to a BH.
• The fireshell theory, initially introduced to describe a GRB originating in a gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a Kerr-Newman BH, is used to summarize the relevant aspects of the fireshell theory and compare and contrast it with alternative approaches.

• The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in complex systems is of growing interest, with applications in areas such as contact process, domain growth, catalysis, phase separation, and transport phenomena. There is no general theory for these model systems, but progress has been made in understanding their stationary states using approximate analytical methods and simulations.

• This paper focuses on the phase transitions observed in a modified version of the surface reaction model proposed by Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad, which describes some kinetic aspects of the oxidation of CO over a catalytic surface. The modification incorporates a random distribution of inert sites on the catalytic surface.

• The original ZGB model is an irreversible lattice model for surface reactions based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where reactants must be adsorbed before reacting. The model is a lattice Markov process, with molecules of CO and O from a gaseous phase able to be adsorbed onto the sites of a regular square lattice. The dynamics of the model are controlled by a single parameter, the arrival probability of a CO molecule.

• Simulations have shown that the system exhibits two phase transitions between active and poisoned states. The first-order transition is from an o-poisoned state to a reactive steady state, while the continuous transition is from a reactive steady state to a state poisoned by CO. A mean field theory qualitatively reproduces the phase diagram of the ZGB model, but only the first-order transition appears at the level of site approximation. Employing the pair approximation, both continuous and first-order transitions are obtained.

• The paper investigates the effects of inert sites on the phase transitions of the ZGB model. The dependence of the phase transitions on the concentration of inert sites is studied, with experimental interest in the automobile industry where lead particles are deposited over the catalyst during the exhaust of gases after combustion. The presence of inert sites affects the efficiency of the catalytic surface by pinning lead particles on the surface and reducing the reaction paths.

• Dust efficiently absorbs optical and UV emission and re-radiates it in the mid- and far-IR, depending on temperature and grain size.
• The IR emission from dust can provide insights into the current SFR, although for passive galaxies, it can overestimate the SFR due to dust heating by older stellar populations.
• Dust also obscures our view of AGN, with dust heated by AGN thought to primarily live in a toroidal-like structure that absorbs its radiative output.
• The AGN dusty torus can manifest itself in the SFR of its host galaxy, making the far-IR (FIR) the ideal waveband to study star formation in AGN host galaxies.

- Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecule in the universe and plays a crucial role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM). Its formation is primarily governed by the transformation of atomic diffuse clouds into molecular clouds, with dust grains being the favored habitat for H2 molecules to form. The sticking of H atoms onto dust grains is an important mechanism for cooling interstellar gas and forming other molecules containing H atoms.
- The ISM contains carbonaceous and silicate dust grains of various sizes, and a significant portion of the available surface area for chemistry is in the form of very small grains or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These PAHs have characteristics similar to graphite surfaces and can efficiently form H2 by involving a pre-adsorbed H atom in monomer or para-dimer configurations. However, the inefficient sticking of H atoms in monomers constitutes a major obstacle to entering the catalytic regime for H2 formation on graphitic/PAH surfaces, resulting in a low H2 formation efficiency.

- Research in wireless ad-hoc networks and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has increased, with IEEE 802.15.4 targeted for wireless body area networks (WBANs) requiring low power and low data rate applications.
- The IEEE 802.15.4 standard supports two topologies (star and peer-to-peer) and two modes of operation (beacon enabled and non-beacon enabled). The non-beacon enabled mode is analyzed in this paper, with sensor nodes using CSMA/CA protocol to access the channel.
- The main aim of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is to provide a low-cost, low power, and reliable protocol for wireless monitoring of patient health. The standard defines the physical layer and MAC sub-layer, supporting three distinct frequency bands, with 2.4 GHz being the most important.
- The 2.4 GHz band is also used by IEEE 802.11b/g and Bluetooth, causing potential interference and affecting the performance of IEEE 802.15.4.
- CSMA/CA is a contention-based MAC protocol, while TDMA is a schedule-based MAC protocol. In CSMA/CA, each node waits for a random amount of time before attempting to access the medium, while in TDMA, each node transmits data in its pre-allocated time slot.
- The performance of IEEE 802.15.4 with non-beacon enabled mode in a star topology is analyzed, considering that sensor nodes are using CSMA/CA protocol to access the channel. The long-term power consumption of devices is the main aim of the analysis, but authors do not analyze their study for different data rates.
- An analytical model for non-beacon enabled mode of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol is provided in [2], but authors do not analyze different MAC parameters with varying data rates.
- A novel low-power MAC protocol based on TDMA is proposed in [5] to satisfy traffic heterogeneity, and authors examine the use of IEEE 802.15.4 standard in ECG monitoring in [6], analyzing the effects of CSMA/CA mechanism on the network's performance.

* The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is a major puzzle in particle physics, and consists of several pieces such as the existence of various sources of vacuum energy density and large radiative corrections including a cutoff scale. The experimental value of the cosmological constant is estimated to be much smaller than the theoretical value, which is known as the cosmological constant problem.
* The vacuum energy density can receive large radiative corrections including a cutoff scale. The zero point energy density is calculated by using an effective potential at the one-loop level, and it naively contains quartic, quadratic, and logarithmic terms concerning an ultra-violet (UV) cutoff parameter. After the subtraction of logarithmic divergence, the zero point energy is given by the sum of the zero point energy at a renormalization point and the logarithmic divergence.
* In the presence of gravity, if the vacuum energy gravitates, the motion of the planets in our solar system can be affected by the vacuum energy. From the non-observation of such an effect for Mercury, we have a constraint that the existence of a large vacuum energy density, the energy density from the Higgs potential after the breakdown of electroweak symmetry, and the energy density accompanied with the chiral symmetry breaking due to quark condensations threatens the stability of our solar system.
* The classical gravitational field does not feel a large portion of the vacuum energy, and the equivalence principle holds with accuracy at the atomic level. The external matter-dependent part of energies must gravitate in both macroscopic and microscopic worlds. Physics on the CCP can be described by the scalar curvature made of the classical gravitational field, the Lagrangian density of matters as classical objects, and the Lagrangian density of matters does not contain a constant term.

- Hyperfine manifold measurements in alkali metals have been made more precise through advanced experimental techniques, aided by the hydrogen-like structure of these elements.
* Recent precise measurements in higher excited states have been made possible through two-step transitions, leading to renewed interest in theoretical methods like many-body perturbation theory (MBPT).
* Experimental complications arise in precise measurements of excited states beyond the first one, due to the low population of atoms in excited states and potential unavailability of detectors at desired frequencies.
* Two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy is presented as a solution, using two counter-propagating lasers (pump and probe) through a thermal vapor, with one laser modulated to create sub-Doppler peaks and eliminate experimental complications.
* The method is demonstrated using two ladder systems in rubidium, with different modulation techniques applied to the pump and probe lasers, allowing for frequency locking and high signal-to-noise ratios.
* A three-level model is used to explain the qualitative features of the experimental spectra, using density matrix formalism and a ladder configuration with two lasers, one with sidebands.
* The theoretical model is then solved using a Floquet basis expansion of the density matrix, taking into account the time dependence of the Rabi frequency and damping rates.
* The three-level model is validated by comparing its results with experimental absorption features in rubidium, and the model is shown to reproduce resonance features observed in both amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated systems.
* The method has potential applications in precision measurements and laser frequency stabilization in excited atomic states, and is supported by the National Science Foundation.

- The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has attracted significant attention, particularly for the central exclusive production (CEP) process where protons remain intact and are separated from the central system by a large rapidity gap. Observation of any particle in the CEP channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers and allow for mass measurement regardless of decay products. Proposals exist to install forward proton detectors at 220 m and 420 m from interaction points to detect central systems with approximate mass range 70 GeV to 700 GeV.
- The CEP process is crucial for the central exclusive production of the Standard Model (SM) and supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs bosons. For a 120 GeV Higgs boson, the dominant decay channel is H -> bb, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches at the LHC due to large QCD background. However, the CEP process suppresses the leading order background for this channel, making it observable with appropriate proton tagging detectors.
- The acceptance of forward detectors and their ability to correctly associate detected outgoing protons with a Higgs boson candidate event in the central detector are critical for this analysis. The proposed forward detectors aim to achieve a 10 ps accuracy in the time-of-flight measurement, allowing for a vertex measurement accurate to 2.1 mm. Central detector timing measurements could further improve pile-up event rejection.
- The acceptance of forward detectors is governed by the distance of the active edge from the beam and the aperture of LHC beam elements. Previous estimates assume the closest distance is given by the Gaussian beam size at the detector location plus a constant term. The beam size is approximately 250 μm at 420 m and 100 μm at 220 m, leading to a distance of closest approach of 3 mm for detectors at 420 m and 1.5 mm for detectors at 220 m. However, detectors may begin operation at a larger distance from the beam.

• This work addresses the zero-field hall effect in a chiral p-wave SC originating from vortex dynamics near Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition.
• In KT transition, vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process and renormalization of vortex-antivortex interaction play a key role in understanding 2D phase transition phenomena.
• The relative strength of convection between two types of integer vortices in a 2D p-wave pairing state is quantified by a convective ratio, leading to a nonzero vortex-dynamics-induced hall conductivity.

• The measurement of rotation curves (RCs) of disk galaxies is used to investigate the nature of dark matter (DM), including its distribution and content relative to baryonic components.
• Dwarf galaxies are good candidates for this purpose as their kinematics are dominated by DM down to small galactocentric radii, providing a reliable measurement of DM's dynamical contribution.
• The NFW profile, which arises from pure N-body DM simulations, may not be accurate in cosmological DM halos due to the effects of baryonic infall and subsequent stellar disk formation, leading to shallower DM halo profiles.
• Recent studies have found that DM halos with constant density cores fit kinematic data of dwarf galaxies better than centrally peaked profiles, with DDO 47 being a specific example.
• The Orion dwarf galaxy is a nearby system with an extended disk, and its kinematics suggest a cored DM profile, making it a critical system for investigating the nature of DM particles and the evolution of DM halos.
• The Orion dwarf's distance remains a significant source of uncertainty, with a potential distance ambiguity much larger than the formal errors estimated using the brightest stars method.
• The Orion dwarf's stellar surface brightness profile is well-fitted by an exponential thin disk, and spectral line imaging shows rich morphological and kinematic structure in the neutral gas disk.
• The Orion dwarf's rotation curve (RC) has a high spatial resolution and extends out to 5.1 times the scale length, with uncertainties of a few km/s and on the RC slope.

• The system is studied using two methods: specialized variational with physically relevant trial functions and standard variational based on using standard gaussian trial functions.
• Numerical computations were made using the specialized variational method and the results show that the total energy does not indicate a minimum or non-adiabatic irregularities, implying that the molecular ion does not exist in equilateral triangular configuration in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

- Recent investigations of galaxy distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) reveal a complex relationship between galaxy properties (color, luminosity, surface brightness, concentration) and their environments. Galaxy clustering is found to be a function of both star formation history and luminosity.
* Color and luminosity measures of star formation history have a more fundamental relationship with environment than do surface brightness and concentration measures.
* The scale dependence of these relationships is explored through correlation function studies, but it is important to examine whether the density on large scales is related to galaxy properties independent of the relationships with density on small scales.
* If only the masses of the host halos of galaxies strongly affect their properties, there should be no such independent relationship. Recent studies have come to conflicting conclusions on this issue.
* For example, some studies find that the equivalent width of Hα is a function of environment on scales of 1.1 and 5.5 Mpc independently, while others find that the distribution of D4000 (a measure of the age of the stellar population) is not a strong function of density on larger scales at fixed density on smaller scales.
* The relative bias of SDSS galaxies is found to depend on scale, and the relationship between the color, luminosity, and environments of galaxies is shown to depend on scale.
* The blue fraction of galaxies is found to decline as a function of density, and the dependence of blue fraction on density does not change when the sample is divided into bins of luminosity.
* The question of which scales are important to the process of galaxy formation remains open, and further investigation is needed to determine the relative importance of local and larger scale environments.

• Transverse spin fluctuations are important low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, and play a significant role in various macroscopic properties at low temperatures.
• In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are crucial in both two and three dimensions, significantly reducing the zero-temperature AF order parameter in the strong-coupling limit.
• Recently, there has been interest in spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet. The random-t model shows an enhanced lattice-averaged AF order parameter for small fractions of defective sites, while strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies enhances spin fluctuations.
• A new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections has been developed, based on magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA). This method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength.
• The RPA approach has been shown to properly interpolate between weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity and yield identical results as the spin-wave theory approach in the strong coupling limit.
• The new method is used to illustrate three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: the pure model in different dimensions, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-concentration impurities.
• The method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral in order to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators, and is used to demonstrate the calculation of transverse spin correlations.
• The paper also discusses the spin-vacancy problem in the quantum antiferromagnet, which is relevant to electron-doped materials. The quantum correction to sublattice magnetization is obtained solely in terms of transverse spin correlations, parallel to the spin-wave theory approach.
• The new method is applicable in the whole range of vacancy concentration, allowing determination of the critical vacancy concentration at which the AF order parameter vanishes.

* The study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory, particularly in cosmology, has received much attention due to its importance in understanding inflation. Inflation is the most successful mechanism for explaining the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe, as well as the small-scale inhomogeneity and anisotropy. With observations now able to directly test the detailed predictions of specific inflationary models, the efforts to understand inflation and its dynamics have redoubled.
* One area of interest is the dynamics of multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation. These models can lead to a variety of features unavailable in single-field models, such as hybrid inflation models. The dynamics during inflation and the subsequent phase of energy transfer between the inflaton and other degrees of freedom are both subjects of intense study. The inflaton may decay through perturbative processes as well as non-perturbative parametric amplification, which can lead to explosive particle production and efficient reheating of the universe.
* The renormalization of time evolution equations in single-field models was understood several years ago, but going beyond tree level in multi-field models brings in the issue of renormalization. The procedure for renormalizing time evolution equations in multi-field models is discussed in the paper, using a closed time path formalism and dimensional regularization.

• The study of dipole moments of elementary particles, such as the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron, has provided valuable information in subatomic physics, including the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the renormalizable theory of QED. The magnetic moment of a charged particle with spin is given by the equation @xmath5 in the particle data tables, where @xmath4 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath5 is the anomaly.

• The electron anomaly is now measured to a precision of about four parts in a billion, providing a better determination of the fine-structure constant than its direct measurement. The muon anomaly, measured to 0.5 parts per million, has an increased sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections of about 40,000 over the electron. A significant difference between the experimental value and the standard model prediction of the muon anomaly would signify the presence of new physics, such as lepton substructure, anomalous couplings, or supersymmetry.

• The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomaly is a topic of much theoretical investigation and is likely to provide the ultimate limit to the precision of the standard-model value. Measurements of the muon anomaly have placed serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model, and interest in the experimental and theoretical value of @xmath20 has grown substantially with the development of supersymmetric theories. Susy contributions to @xmath20 could be at a measurable level in a broad range of models.

- The text discusses the study of the dynamics of a quantum Ising chain due to the transport of transverse magnetization. A new protocol is introduced to prepare an initial configuration with odd-occupation basis states in fermionic momentum space, which cannot be made homogeneous even after infinite time due to the presence of the odd-occupation states. The dynamics of the system are characterized by two timescales of oscillation, and the phenomena of quantum phase transition are manifested in the dynamics in two ways.
- The text provides the Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 quantum Ising chain and transforms it into a direct sum of Hamiltonians of nonlocal free fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The transverse magnetization at a given site is calculated for a specific initial configuration that incorporates the odd-occupation basis in momentum space.
- The dynamics of the system are studied by obtaining the wave function at a given time and calculating the magnetization at that time. The magnetization is found to be inhomogeneous at all times and exhibits oscillatory behavior with the envelope decaying algebraically in the large time limit. The dynamics are characterized by two time-dependent parts of two separate timescales.
- The text also discusses the behavior of transverse magnetization at a given site and time, which is continuously varying and inhomogeneous. The temporal behavior of transverse magnetization at a given site is shown for different external fields, exhibiting oscillatory behavior with the envelope decaying algebraically in the large time limit. The frequency of oscillation varies monotonically with the external field in the ferromagnetic phase and becomes independent of it in the paramagnetic region.

- The behavior of QCD at finite baryon density and low temperature is crucial for astrophysics to understand the structure of compact stars and supernovae. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase, which was proposed several decades ago and has stirred significant interest recently. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the charge neutrality condition and chemical equilibrium are required, which can lead to a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks and eventually destroy the Cooper pairing.
* The chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase remains an unsolved puzzle, and it is still not fully understood how the Cooper pairing is destroyed by increasing mismatch in a charge neutral system. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system. If the charge neutrality condition is satisfied globally and the surface tension is small, the mixed phase will be favored. Homogeneous neutral cold-dense quark matter can be in the gapless 2SC (g2sc) or gapless cfl (gcfl) phase, depending on the flavor structure of the system. Under a natural charge neutrality condition, the gapless phase is a thermally stable state.
* The existence of thermally stable gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed in refs. and generalized to finite temperatures in refs.. Recent results based on more careful numerical calculations show that the g2sc and gcfl phases can exist at moderate baryon density in the color superconducting phase diagram. One of the most important properties of an ordinary superconductor is the Meissner effect, i.e., the superconductor expels the magnetic field. In ideal color superconducting phases, e.g., in the 2SC and cfl phases, the gauge bosons connected with the broken generators obtain masses, indicating the Meissner screening effect. However, in the g2sc phase, the Meissner screening masses for five gluons corresponding to broken generators become imaginary, indicating a type of chromomagnetic instability in the g2sc phase.

However, only about half of the Kepler candidate stars have been observed due to their brightness distribution.

• The presence of stellar companions can affect transit depths and planetary radii, introducing systematic uncertainties in occurrence rate distributions. Recent work suggests that a non-negligible fraction of Kepler host stars may be multiple stars, which could impact planetary radius estimates.

• The transit depth of a planet depends on the brightness ratio of the transited star to the total brightness of the system and the stellar radius, which changes depending on the transited star. Misinterpreting a multiple star system as a single star can lead to incorrect planet radius reports.

• The cumulative Kepler candidate list and stellar parameters table from the NASA Exoplanet Archive have been used to assess possible bound stellar companions for each koi. Possible companions are assumed to lie along the same isochrone as the primary star, and the primary host star is assumed to be the brightest star in the system.

- The column densities of neutral gas disks in nearby galaxies, as observed through 21-cm emission line, are similar to those in damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs). Mapping the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission could provide a direct observational link between DLAs and local galaxies, but it is currently impossible with present technology.
- The identification of DLAs as absorbers in background QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, and the lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground due to the Earth's atmosphere's opacity to UV wavelengths. The number density of DLAs decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts, making it difficult to find DLAs whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present-day radio telescopes.
- There are now known to be around 100 DLA galaxies at various redshifts, spanning a wide range of galaxy properties. However, it is challenging to study these galaxies in the 21-cm line on a case-by-case basis.
- Blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe with single-dish radio telescopes have resulted in an accurate measurement of the total HI mass density, which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLA studies.
- High-resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope can be used to constrain the column density distribution function of HI.
- The resulting column density distribution function shows only mild evolution in the intersection cross-section of HI from redshift z~2 to the present. This implies that the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate of low and intermediate redshift DLAs, and there is no need for a population of hidden very low surface brightness galaxies or isolated HI clouds.
- The probability distribution of oxygen abundance in DLAs constructed from 21-cm maps shows that the metallicity distribution for HI column densities peaks around [o/h]=-1.5 to -1.0, much lower than the mean value of a typical L* galaxy. This suggests that DLAs arise in the HI disks of galaxies.

- The majority of stars are formed in star clusters. During the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud into a star cluster, only a small percentage of the gas is turned into stars. A star cluster will consist of a combination of gas and stars in its initial phases.
- After the onset of stellar winds and supernova explosions, the gas within the embedded cluster is removed, causing a rapid change in gravitational potential energy and resulting in a cluster devoid of gas. This process is well understood theoretically but has received little consideration in observational studies of young massive star clusters.
- Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters. However, discrepant results have been found, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs. An age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs has been suggested.
- The paper presents observations and models of early cluster evolution for three young massive clusters in nearby starburst galaxies. The clusters were observed using the ACS HRC on board the Hubble Space Telescope, and the data were reduced and analyzed to produce surface brightness profiles.
- The observed profiles were compared with 0-body simulations of early cluster evolution. The authors conclude that the clusters display the signature of rapid gas removal and are not in dynamical equilibrium.

- The escaping stars from a cluster can result in an artificially high velocity dispersion, leading to incorrect mass estimates based on the assumption of stellar virial equilibrium.

- Quantum fluctuation can suppress or enhance chaotic motion in wave packets due to quantum interference and tunneling effects, respectively.
- The relation between chaotic behavior and tunneling phenomenon in classically chaotic systems is an important subject in quantum physics.
- Semiclassical descriptions for tunneling phenomena in classically chaotic systems have been developed by several groups.
- Lin and Ballentine studied the interplay between tunneling and classical chaos for a particle in a double-well potential with oscillatory driving force.
- Coherent tunneling takes place between small isolated classical stable regions of phase space, which are much smaller than the volume of a single potential well.
- Chaos-suppressed tunneling can be explained in terms of the Floquet formalism, and there is a one-dimensional manifold in the parameter space where tunneling is completely suppressed.
- Decoherence and dissipation, which are additional effects caused by coupling the chaotic system to other degrees of freedom or an environment, have been studied less frequently.
- Environment-induced quantum decoherence has been studied since the mid-eighties, and quantum dissipation due to interaction with chaotic degrees of freedom has also been studied.
- A numerical investigation of the relation between quantum fluctuation, tunneling, and decoherence combined with delocalization in wave packet dynamics in a one-dimensional double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field is presented.
- The study also refers to a delocalization phenomenon by a perturbation with some frequency components in another model, where the kicked rotator model with a frequency modulation amplitude of kick can be mapped to the tight-binding form on a higher-dimensional lattice in solid-state physics.

However, it also notes the limitations of these models and suggests that other bath models, such as fermionic baths, may be necessary to accurately predict the dissipative quantum dynamics of certain systems.
* The text also introduces the stochastic formulation of quantum dissipation, which can be used to incorporate different bath models by assigning distinct noise variables and associated statistics to different bath models. This formulation can be used to derive exact master equations, hierarchical equations of motion, and hybrid stochastic-deterministic numerical methods.
* The text then discusses the use of the stochastic formalism to study bosonic baths, non-Gaussian bath models, and fermionic bath models. It also introduces the dual-fermion representation, which can be used to transform a spin bath into a pair of coupled fermions, making it easier to study the non-Gaussian properties of the spin bath.
* Finally, the text presents a numerical scheme for calculating dynamical quantities, such as system-bath joint observables, using the stochastic formalism. It also notes that the stochastic formalism can be used to derive numerical schemes for deterministically simulating quantum dynamics for all three fundamental bath models.

- The glass transition, a topic in statistical physics, is associated with a sharp increase in relaxation times and a departure from equilibrium in experiments.
- Theoretical proposals suggest that the transition from a liquid to a glassy state is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic transition, with an ""ideal"" glass transition believed to occur at the Kauzmann temperature.
- However, simulations of polydisperse hard-core disks have failed to detect any evidence of a thermodynamic transition, raising questions about the discrepancies between hard-disk and soft-sphere systems models.
- Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) offers an alternative perspective, predicting a ""kinetic"" or ""dynamic"" transition at the mode-coupling temperature.
- Simulations based on models by Stillinger and Weber and Kob and Andersen have contributed to shaping current views about the glass transition.
- The idealized MCT predicts a transition from a high-temperature liquid state to a low-temperature arrested state at a critical temperature.
- The nonergodicity parameters, which indicate whether the system is in a liquid or arrested state, can be calculated from the partial structure factors and their temperature dependence.
- The present study investigates a molecular dynamics simulation model adapted to the glass-forming NiZr transition metal system, aiming to determine the critical temperature and nonergodicity parameters.

- Dyadic data is common in psychosocial and behavioral studies, with many social phenomena being interpersonal in nature. This results in related observations that refer to both persons involved in the dyadic relationship, with members influencing each other's cognitions, emotions, and behaviors.
- Longitudinal dyadic data, which involves repeatedly measuring dyads over time, brings two complications: within-dyad correlation and within-subject correlation. It is important to account for these two types of correlations simultaneously to ensure valid analysis results. Additionally, longitudinal dyadic data is prone to the missing data problem caused by dropout, which can lead to biased estimates if not properly handled.
- There is extensive literature on statistical modeling of nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal studies. Two broad classes of likelihood-based nonignorable models have been identified: selection models and pattern mixture models. Other likelihood-based and estimation equation-based approaches have also been proposed. However, the nonignorable dropout problem has not been addressed in the context of longitudinal dyadic data, which presents new challenges due to the interdependence structure within dyads.
- The proposed approach to handle longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts is a fully Bayesian selection model. This approach models each subject's longitudinal measurement process using a transition model that includes both the patient's and spouse's characteristics as covariates to capture the interdependence between patients and their spouses. It also accounts for the within-dyad correlation by introducing dyad-specific random effects into the transition model.
- The proposed Bayesian selection-model-based approach is applied to a motivating data set from a longitudinal dyadic breast cancer study and is shown to outperform complete-case and available-case analyses in simulation studies. The method is also used to analyze a breast cancer data set, providing insights into the interdependence of patients and spouses and the design of more efficient prevention programs.

• Quantum fluctuations in electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that never vanishes, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources. This phenomenon was predicted by quantum electrodynamics and led to the Casimir effect, where two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum attract each other with a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation.

• The Casimir effect is a consequence of the fact that the zero-point energy (per unit area) is smaller when the plates are kept at close distance compared to when they are at infinite separation. This is because the plates act as a cavity where only the electromagnetic modes that have nodes on both the walls can exist.

• Lifshitz, Dzyaloshinskii, and Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics, allowing for the derivation of the force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions. Lifshitz's theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force at very short distances and the retarded force at larger separations.

• The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been verified in several high precision experiments, but less precise measurements in liquids and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids have also been reported. The force might be a potentially relevant issue for the development of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems.

• Essentially no attention has been devoted to the torque between anisotropic materials predicted by Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash, with the exception of a theoretical derivation of a more simplified equation of the torque between two plates in a one-dimensional calculation and between engineered anisotropic surfaces.

- The study of complex networks has gained popularity in various fields, and the behavior of random walks on graphs is a central problem in network science. Random walks have implications for issues such as epidemics, web page classification, and community detection.
- This paper introduces a new framework for the study of topologically biased random walks (TBRW) on graphs, which allows for more efficient exploration of network structure and can be used to address problems of community detection and synchronization in complex networks.
- The authors focus on the behavior of the spectral gap in biased random walks and define the conditions for which such a spectral gap is maximal. They also present an invariant quantity for the biased random walk that depends only on the topology for a broad class of biased random walks.
- The paper presents a general methodology for the application of different TBRW in community finding problems and concludes with a discussion of the material presented and potential applications of TBRW.
- The traditional approach to random walks on graphs deals with the connection between the properties of unbiased random walks and the spectral features of transition operators associated with the network. The authors consider undirected graphs and define the transition matrix for an unbiased random walker.
- A biased random walk on a graph can be defined by a more general transition matrix, where the element gives the probability that a walker on the vertex of the graph will move to the vertex in a single step, depending on appropriate weights for each pair of vertices.

* A new type of worms, called p2p worms, which leverage peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay applications, pose a serious threat to the internet.
* P2P worms can be passive or active, with passive worms spreading through shared folders or responses to queries, and active worms infecting vulnerable hosts or releasing worms in a hit list of P2P hosts.
* Active p2p worms are more deadly than scanning worms as they can easily blend into normal P2P traffic and exhibit fewer network traffic anomalies.

- The debris disk surrounding the star HD32297 has been found to have an edge-on orientation, making it an ideal target for gas phase absorption measurements. Observations of this disk have revealed two absorption components, one of which is likely caused by circumstellar material.
- The ism absorption is similar among HD32297 and its two closest neighbors, and is likely due to absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the local bubble. Some variation in local bubble absorption is detected toward 18 ori.
- Radial velocities of HD32297, BD+07 777s, and BD+07 778 differ significantly, indicating that they are likely not physically associated. Some indication of temporal variability is detected over several epochs of observations, but a definitive detection of circumstellar variability is difficult due to instrumental resolution variations and masking by the strong ism absorption.
- The measured circumstellar feature toward HD32297 is the strongest such absorption measured toward any nearby main sequence debris disk, and if the morphology and abundances of the stable gas component around HD32297 are assumed to be similar to β Pic, the estimated upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding HD32297 is 40.3 Mearth.

* Theories of quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimum measurable length, also known as the Planck length, which is largely model-independent.
* The generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is a modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that holds at all scales and implies the existence of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum.
* The dimensionless parameter in the GUP is normally assumed to be of order unity, but if it is not, current experiments predict large upper bounds on it that are compatible with current observations and may signal the existence of a new length scale.
* Quantum gravity effects influence all quantum Hamiltonians and have phenomenological implications, such as a modification of commutators and a similar prediction of maximum observable momenta in doubly special relativity theories.
* The GUP can be used to investigate the consequences of quantum gravity in a cosmological setup, such as the Planck era of the universe, and to evaluate the modifications to quantities that characterize the Planck era.
* The entropic content of the universe behind the cosmological horizon at the Planck time is unaltered when quantum gravity corrections are taken into account.
* The quantum gravity corrections affect directly the main cosmological quantities in the early universe, such as the inflaton mass, via the HUP-based GUP factor, which cannot be re-absorbed by a redefinition of units.

• The text discusses the computation of couplings in Conformal Field Theory (CFT) using deformations of the theory by marginal or irrelevant operators. The authors show that the deformation introduces new divergences in the renormalized operators of the critical theory, which can be used to compute the couplings in the deformed anomalous dimension matrix. This method is applied to the case of planar N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, where the action of the matrix on operators diagonalized by means of the Bethe ansatz can be used to compute the couplings.

• The text also discusses the computation of couplings at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT duality. The authors show how to extend the computation of the 2-point function of single trace operators with a large number of basic fields to the case of a 3-point function with an additional chiral operator. This is done by taking into account the coupling between the heavy string worldsheet and the supergravity fields, which allows for the computation of the coupling between the operators.

• The authors also discuss the relation between the 3-point correlation function in a CFT and the anomalous dimension matrix obtained from deforming the CFT with a marginal or irrelevant operator at the CFT fixed point. They emphasize that the results presented in the text are valid at a CFT fixed point with coupling.

• The text focuses on the case of N=4 SYM, so the discussion is limited to four dimensions. The dimension of the operator satisfies the condition, and the theory has a line of CFTs parameterized by the coupling constant. The authors consider the operator to be a scalar primary, but the results can be generalized to more operators.

• The text discusses the development of an embedding scheme for the Dirac equation, similar to Inglesfield's scheme for the Schrödinger equation. This is motivated by the need to include relativistic effects in the study of materials containing heavier elements, where shifts in inner core levels and spin-orbit splitting can significantly affect calculated densities and ground state properties.

• The embedding scheme is derived using a trial function with a continuous large component and a discontinuous small component across the surface separating regions i and ii. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian is then expressed in terms of the trial function in region i alone, leading to a relativistic embedding potential. The method is illustrated through examples, including a confined hydrogen atom and a sandwich structure with relativistic effects.

• The embedding scheme is shown to be stable and convergent, and its use in the continuum regime is demonstrated through the calculation of the green function for the embedded hamiltonian. Future applications are expected to focus on defects and surfaces of materials containing heavier elements within the framework of density functional theory.

• Semiclassical methods have been used to treat large wave-dynamical systems, providing approximate solutions in terms of the properties of the corresponding classical system. In the case of dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard where rays travel freely and are partially reflected and refracted when impinging the boundary.
• The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics.
• Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are being investigated for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
• Trace formulas are essential tools in semiclassical physics, relating the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system. A trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators has been developed and tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics.
• While trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is little investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators due to the difficulty of numerically solving the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities.

• The merger of neutron stars and/or black holes are significant sources of gravitational waves (GW) due to the large amount of energy released. The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) can radiate about 10@xmath6 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory. The rate of these mergers in the local universe is estimated to be one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations.

• The superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts will produce a stochastic background of GW. Different astrophysical processes, such as distorted black holes, bar mode emission from young neutron stars, supernovas or hypernovas, and tri-axial rotating neutron stars, are capable of generating stochastic GW background. Populations of compact binaries, such as cataclismic variables, are responsible for the existence of a galactic background of GW in the mhz domain.

• Using the DNS merging rate estimated in a precedent study, the GW background spectrum produced by these coalescences was estimated. Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods were performed to determine the critical redshift beyond which the duty cycle condition required to have a continuous background is satisfied. The simulations focus on the few thousand seconds before the last stable orbit is reached, when more than 96% of the GW energy is released.

• The occurrence of merging events was simulated by estimating the probability for a given pair of massive stars, supposed to be the progenitors of DNS, to be formed at a given redshift. The probability distribution is essentially given by the cosmic star formation rate, normalized in a given redshift interval, and the formation rate of massive binaries per redshift interval. The resulting fraction of bound NS-NS binaries depends on the adopted velocity distribution of the natal kick.

• Three viable approaches exist to account for backreaction: numerical simulations, fluid approach treating cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, and analytical methods.
• A perturbative approach in ref. [xcite] provides an answer for weakly modified shocks, and an alternative method in ref. [xcite] assumes sufficient energy dependence in particle diffusion for separate solutions of subrelativistic and relativistic particles.
• Nonlinear backreaction effects on the maximum achievable energy and geometry have been investigated in refs. [xcite] and [xcite], with a practical solution for the acceleration problem in the nonlinear regime presented in ref. [xcite].
• Recent promising analytical solutions for nonlinear shock acceleration have appeared in the literature, avoiding limitations of previous approaches.
• Analytical approaches reproduce basic features of nonlinear effects in shock acceleration, and numerical simulations show that even a small fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas can significantly affect the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid.
• The backreaction is crucial for accurately modeling shock acceleration, particularly in astrophysical environments where cosmic rays are non-negligible.

- Cosmological observations from Type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large scale structure suggest that the universe is in an accelerating phase, likely due to a form of dark energy (DE) with negative pressure.
- The simplest DE candidate is the cosmological constant (Λ) with an equation-of-state parameter w = -1. However, the cosmological constant problem arises due to the large discrepancy between the observed and expected values of DE density from quantum field theories.
- Over the past decade, numerous DE models have been proposed, such as quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic DE, new agegraphic DE, and Ricci DE.
- Alternatively, modifications to the gravitational sector itself can induce effective DE, such as f(T) gravity, gravity with higher curvature invariants, scalar-tensor gravity, vector-tensor gravity, and gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes.
- Teleparallel gravity is a theory of gravity based on the Weitzenböck connection, which describes the gravitational field through torsion instead of curvature. It is equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but has different geometric structures.
- Modifications to teleparallel gravity, such as f(T) gravity, can provide alternatives to inflationary models and effective DE models, with the advantage of having 2nd-order field equations, making them simpler than other extended theories of gravity.
- The focus of this paper is to explore the implications of f(T) gravity on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), which describes the sequence of nuclear reactions that yielded the synthesis of light elements in the early universe.
- BBN calculations can impose stringent constraints on a given cosmological model. By confronting various f(T) gravity models with BBN calculations based on current observational data on primordial abundance, one can extract constraints on their free parameters.

- The length scale of acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at recombination can be calculated from CMB anisotropy power spectrum measurements and used as a ""standard ruler"" to measure the matter and energy content of the universe at low redshifts.
- However, if CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, low-redshift inferences could be biased.
- The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
- The actual densities of matter and radiation are not needed for the calculation; only their ratio matters.
- The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, is used to measure the baryon-to-photon ratio.
- The sound horizon depends on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, which is very insensitive to the cosmology.
- The baryon-to-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum by both the ratios of the odd and even acoustic peaks and by the silk damping tail.
- The sound horizon can be translated into knowledge of the wavelength of the baryonic features in the mass power spectrum.
- Measuring this scale at lower redshifts, such as in large galaxy surveys, can constrain the Hubble constant and the bare cosmological parameters.
- The prefactors of the sound horizon cancel out between the CMB and low-redshift distances, allowing for reliable distance ratio predictions and cosmology constraints.

• The LC metric has two essential constants: one related to the topology of spacetime (deficit angle) and another that presents serious obstacles to interpretation.
• For small values of the second constant, LC describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass; when the constant is zero, the spacetime is flat.
• However, circular timelike geodesics exist only for certain ranges of the constant and become null or spacelike for other ranges.
• The Kretschmann scalar decreases monotonically as the constant increases, implying that the space is flat for certain values, and admits an extra killing vector for even larger values.
• The absence of circular test particle orbits and the fact that most known material sources for LC require a specific range of the constant, led to the interpretation that LC describes the field of a cylinder only within this range.
• However, interior solutions matching to LC exist for other values of the constant, and the absence of circular test particle orbits may simply be due to the fact that the required centrifugal force implies velocities greater than the speed of light.
• The interpretation of LC as the spacetime generated by a cylinder whose radius increases with the constant, tending to infinity as the constant approaches its maximum value, has been proposed.

* The principle of quantum superposition plays a central role in quantum mechanics and its applications, with the destruction and preservation of these superpositions being crucial to issues such as the quantum-to-classical transition and potential technological applications in quantum information, computation, and cryptography.
* The loss of coherence in quantum systems is due to the pervasive action of the environment on the system, and has received mathematical treatment through tracing-out methods and axiomatic approaches.
* The paper develops a novel attempt to derive master equations (MEs) in both the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes using stochastic methods and well-known operator techniques.
* The main idea is to build random evolution operators with stochastic parameters and take the stochastic expectation value with respect to this randomness.
* The paper's main result is that any Lindblad-type ME, either Markovian or non-Markovian, with self-adjoint Lindblad operators can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution.
* The paper also discusses the flexibility of the mathematical language employed and its implications for intrinsic decoherence models and physical interpretations.

• Left-handed metamaterials (LH) are a new class of artificial materials with negative indices of refraction for certain wavelengths, with applications in modern optics and microelectronics. They can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, and yield slow light propagation. LH metamaterials also suppress Anderson localization in disordered systems, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths.

• The localization length in disordered systems follows a sixth power dependence with the wavelength under refractive-index disorder instead of the well-known quadratic asymptotic behavior. This suppression of Anderson localization has been observed in one-dimensional (1D) disordered metamaterials, and similar effects have been found in bilayered periodic-on-average structures with oblique incidence and dispersion.

• The localization length of light has been calculated numerically for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with positive indices of refraction (homogeneous stacks or h stacks) and alternating layers of left- and right-handed materials (mixed stacks or m stacks). The localization length in h stacks shows a quadratic dependence for long wavelengths and saturates for lower values, while in m stacks, it depends linearly on the wavelength for low-disordered systems and wavelengths several orders of magnitude greater than the grating period.

• The localization length behavior is modulated by the corresponding bands in weakly disordered systems, and this modulation decreases as the disorder increases. In the case of both homogeneous and mixed stacks with non-symmetric band distribution, the localization length presents an irregular form in all the transmission spectrum, with more sensitive changes in mixed stacks than in homogeneous structures.

* The concordance cosmological model, consistent with various observational data, suggests that only 4% of the total mass-energy is ordinary matter (made up mostly of baryonic matter like stars, gas, galaxies, etc.).
* The rest is 23% dark matter, made of non-baryonic matter whose nature is unknown, and 73% dark energy, linked to the expansion of the universe and possibly in the form of a cosmological constant.
* Dark matter explains the difference between the dynamic mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of visible matter. It also plays a crucial role in the formation of large structures by pulling ordinary matter into gravitational collapse.
* Dark matter should be non-relativistic (cold) during galaxy formation, known as Cold Dark Matter (CDM). The associated particle is called a WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle).
* The Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) formula, an empirical recipe, can accurately reproduce the rotation curves of many galaxies, suggesting a modified law of gravity or unusual dark matter properties.
* The theory of a tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) gravity modification has been developed to recover MOND in the non-relativistic limit, but it has difficulties at the cosmological scale and with reproducing the observed dark matter in galaxy clusters.
* A massive neutrino component could help resolve the issues with TeVeS and other modified gravity theories at the galaxy cluster scale, but it faces challenges in reproducing the observed CMB fluctuations.
* An alternative approach is to consider a specific form of dark matter with distinct properties, keeping the classical general relativity intact, through a phenomenon called ""gravitational polarization.""
* The ""gravitational polarization"" concept is inspired by the analogy between MOND and electrostatics in dielectric media, suggesting a new form of polarizable dark matter.

• Long chain macromolecules, or polymers, have been extensively studied due to their ubiquity in nature. While the physical properties of homopolymers are well understood, less is known about heteropolymers of biological significance. The specific properties of a particular molecule are of interest to biologists, as genetic information is coded by specific sequences of nucleic acids that are translated into chains of amino acids. The energy and shape of a polymer are determined by various interactions between its constituent amino acids.

• From a physicist's perspective, simplified models of heteropolymers are used to gain more general information. Statistical descriptions of ensembles of molecules composed of a random linear sequence of elements with various interactions are of particular interest. These models are also useful for understanding disordered systems, such as spin glasses, and can provide faster relaxation times.

• Recent experimental studies have focused on solutions and gels of polymers with randomly charged groups. Simple models that include the essential ingredients of these systems are used, as statistical approaches only provide general descriptions. The overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups are most likely controlled by the coulomb interactions that are the strongest and have the longest range.

• The behavior of quenched polymers with a fixed charge on each monomer is explored in the text. The long range nature of the coulomb interactions, combined with the randomness of the charge sequence, produces effects quite distinct from systems with short range interactions. The phase diagrams of quenched polymers in different dimensions are examined, and it is shown that the behavior of polymers is similar to that of random chains with short range interactions in certain dimensions, while in other dimensions, the spatial conformations of a polymer strongly depend on its excess charge.

• A short distance cutoff, such as the range of the excluded volume interaction, introduces a temperature scale. In random polymers with approximately balanced positive and negative charges, the polymer assumes spatial conformations where the interactions are predominantly attractive. The chain undergoes a transition from an expanded to a collapsed (dense) state at a critical temperature.

Their theoretical study shows that the half-metallic ferromagnetic character of these compounds is preserved over a wide range of lattice parameters.
* Yamana studied the effects of tetragonal distortion on zb CrAs and CrSb and found the half-metallicity to survive large tetragonal distortions.
* Zhao and Zunger argued that zb MnAs, CrAs, CrSb, and CrTe are epitaxially unstable against the NiAs structure, and zb CrSe is epitaxially stable only for lattice constants higher than 6.2, remaining half-metallic at such volumes.

- The illuminated material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic black holes (GBHs) was initially assumed to be cold and non-ionized, but it was later discovered that photoionization has a significant impact on both the reflected continuum and iron fluorescence lines.
- The density of the illuminated material is typically assumed to be constant along the vertical direction, but this is only applicable to the simplest version of radiation-dominated Shakura-Sunyaev disks and only for the portion where viscous dissipation is the dominant heating process. Photoionization and Compton scattering are the major heating sources in the surface layers.
- Thermal instability allows the coexistence of gas at different phases with very different temperatures and densities. Recently, the assumption of constant gas density was relaxed, and the gas density was determined from hydrostatic balance solved simultaneously with ionization balance and radiative transfer.
- The Thomson depth of the hot coronal layer can significantly influence the X-ray reprocessing produced by the deeper, much cooler disk. However, without taking into account the role of thermal conduction, the method of connecting two different stable layers is rather ad hoc.
- The paper calculates the temperature structure in the layers above the accretion disk and derives the emission lines via radiative recombination (RR) and reflection due to resonance line scattering from the derived layers. The model includes thermal conduction in the self-consistent solution of the vertical structure, which presents a serious numerical challenge due to the coupling between hydrostatic balance, radiative transfer, and heat conduction.

• The source document discusses the theoretical description of semiflexible polymers, which are polymers with bending stiffness. The Kratky-Porod model is used to describe these polymers, which takes into account the bending energy penalty and local inextensibility. The transverse distribution function of a polymer embedded in two-dimensional space has been found to possess a bimodal shape for short polymers, which is considered a manifestation of semiflexibility. The paper studies the transverse distribution function of the three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation of one polymer end using the exact representation of the distribution function in terms of the matrix element of the Green's function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field.

• The paper also discusses the short chain expansion of the distribution function of the free Kratky-Porod chain, which was studied recently in [xcite]. The authors succeeded in computing the anisotropic moments for small chain persistence length within the short chain expansion, with the first-order correction coinciding with that obtained in [xcite] using the WKB method, and the second-order correction being new. The higher-order terms in the short chain expansion can be established in a straightforward way using the present method. The end-to-end distribution function for large chain persistence length is expanded in powers of the chain persistence length, and the subseries with small values and simple structure can be summed up. The results of computations of the end-to-end distribution function for various chain lengths are given in fig - doublepeak, which shows that the distribution function possesses the bimodal shape at intermediate chain lengths within the interval [xmath0].

• The cosmic ray spectrum is a continuum with a power law energy spectrum that decreases as approximately the cube of the primary energy. For high energies, extensive air shower techniques are used to measure the particles.
• The detected particles, mainly protons, have an isotropic distribution of arrival directions, which is understood in terms of diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields. However, for very high energies, propagation in the galaxy should cease to be diffusive, and such particles are expected to be extragalactic.
• There is increasing evidence for a different component of the high energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum, with a clear signal of a change of the spectral slope just above 2 x 10^18 eV. Composition studies also indicate a change to light element composition for energies above 10^19 eV.
• The highest energy events detected present a serious challenge to theory, as they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background over distances of order 50 Mpc. However, no such features are seen in the observed cosmic ray spectrum.
• The observed particles in the cosmic ray spectrum could be nuclei or photons, coming from relatively nearby sources compared to the 50 Mpc scale. However, the conclusive power of observations is limited by poor statistics and a complex interrelation of hypotheses.
• A new generation of large aperture experiments is expected to bring significant progress in understanding the complex puzzle that connects particle physics, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays.
• The origin of cosmic rays is still an open question, with many possible scenarios being discussed, including acceleration in astrophysical objects such as young pulsars, gamma-ray bursts, our own galaxy, active galaxies, and the local group of galaxies.

- The family of iron pnictides is an important prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with various sub-families and a wide structural variety. They share common physical properties such as magnetic behavior and a phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic crystal symmetry, often accompanied by antiferromagnetic order.
- The suppression of these phase transitions is believed to be crucial for the emergence of superconductivity. Understanding the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides is mandatory to unveil the physics underlying the superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated. There is ongoing debate about whether the magnetic moments are better described by an itinerant or localized model, and the role of correlation effects is still not clear.
- Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an essential experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides. However, DFT calculations often have problems reproducing all features of ARPES spectra correctly, which is often attributed to strong correlation effects. Additionally, the connection between the magnetic phase of the iron pnictides and the resulting consequences for ARPES is often ignored, leading to mixed magnetic domains and lost information on anisotropy.
- Experimentally, it is possible to effectively detwin the crystals by applying uniaxial stress during the measurement, but such measurements are connected with several technical difficulties. Understanding the electronic properties of iron pnictide superconductors comprehensively and gaining deeper insights into the influence of in-plane anisotropy in the magnetic phase requires these studies.
- The work presents a comprehensive DFT study on the magnetic phase of a specific iron pnictide and its corresponding ARPES spectra. The computational results can be directly compared to available experimental ARPES data on detwinned crystals. The Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-Green Function (KKR-GF) approach is used, which has been shown to be accurate for dealing with iron pnictides.

However, the drawback is the low magnetic ordering temperature, which is below the liquid nitrogen temperature.

Thurston about the core entropy of polynomials. The core entropy function can be defined purely combinatorially and displays a rich fractal structure that reflects the underlying geometry of the Mandelbrot set. The concept of core entropy generalizes the entropy theory of real quadratic maps to complex polynomials.

• The core entropy function is used to study the parameter space of polynomials. For instance, the restriction of the core entropy function to non-real veins of the Mandelbrot set is monotone, which implies that the lamination for the Mandelbrot set can be reconstructed by looking at level sets of the core entropy function. The value of the core entropy function is equal, up to a constant factor, to the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for a polynomial. For dendritic Julia sets, the core entropy also equals the asymptotic stretch factor of a polynomial as a rational map.

• The paper describes an algorithm, devised by Thurston, that considers a larger matrix whose entries are pairs of postcritical angles to compute the entropy of a polynomial. This algorithm does not require knowledge of the topology of the hubbard tree. The algorithm is then used to prove that the entropy function is continuous. The algorithm is also used to prove that the entropy function is Hölder continuous at angles where the core entropy function is not Hölder continuous.

These tools are used to prove that the inverse of the growth rate of a graph equals the smallest real positive root of a holomorphic function constructed by counting the multi-cycles in the graph.

The paper then associates an infinite graph to each labeled wedge and proves that it has bounded cycles, which allows us to apply the theory developed in the first part of the paper.

However, the puzzle of GRBs is far from being resolved, with a major problem being the uncertainty in whether they are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs, which affects the determination of their energetics.
* Three methods may help determine the degree of beaming in GRBs: (1) based on analytic solutions, the break in the light curve of optical afterglows from a jetted GRB should occur during the relativistic phase, but this method is not conclusive due to the smoothness of the break and other factors; (2) optical afterglows from a jet can be strongly polarized, but polarization can only be observed under certain conditions; and (3) due to relativistic beaming effects, the majority of jetted GRBs cannot be observed, but their corresponding late-time afterglow emission can safely reach us, which could allow measurement of the GRB collimation angle.
* The absence of large numbers of orphan afterglows in many surveys has been regarded as evidence that the collimation cannot be extreme, but recently, it has been argued that measurement of the GRB beaming angle using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult due to the low optical flux density when the afterglow emission from a jet begins to go into a much larger solid angle than the initial burst.

* Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which can result in different superconducting gap symmetries and structures.
* The Random-Phase Approximation Spin Fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach suggests that the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets is the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations.
* Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure, as the measured dynamical spin susceptibility in the superconducting state carries information about the gap structure.
* A well-defined peak in neutron spectra has been reported in 1111, 122, and 11 systems, which is commonly explained as the spin resonance appearing due to the s± state.
* However, recent ARPES and Andreev spectroscopy results suggest that there are at least two distinct gaps present in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LiFeAs, which raises questions about the spin resonance frequency in systems with multiple gaps.

* Impurities can significantly alter the properties of a quantum system's spectrum, affecting its coherence and transport properties.
* In the absence of interactions and with random impurity distribution, all states are exponentially localized in 1D and 2D, while a mobility edge exists in 3D. Correlated impurity positions can lead to the appearance of delocalized states in the spectrum.
* The effects of correlated disorder have been studied in 1D, but exploration in 2D is limited to speckle potentials and pseudo-2D random dimer lattices. Correlations in speckle potentials can mimic the presence of a mobility edge, but all states are localized in the thermodynamic limit.
* Random dimers introduce delocalized states in pseudo-2D lattices, with a main statistical difference being the decay of the correlation function, which is algebraic for the first and exponential for the second.
* A short-range correlated disorder in a weakly interacting Bose gas confined on a 2D square lattice can lead to a richness of phenomena, such as modifying the condensate and superfluid fraction, shifting the onset of superfluidity, and inducing exotic phases like the Bose glass.
* A 2D generalization of the dual random dimer model (2D-DRDM) has been introduced, where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites. In the non-interacting regime, there exists a resonance energy at which the impurity is transparent, leading to delocalized states around this energy.
* The 2D-DRDM resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and is the same as in 1D. In the presence of weak interactions, the 2D-DRDM drives the homogeneity of the ground state, inducing a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and condensate fraction as a function of disorder strength.
* The dependence of these quantities on interaction strength can be explained by including the effect of the healing length in the resonance condition discussion.

• Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is often said to be unconditionally secure, but it requires the users' devices to meet certain requirements for the security to hold.

• In practice, it is difficult for devices to meet these requirements, leading to the possibility of attacks on QKD systems. Some attacks have been successfully demonstrated against practical QKD systems.

• To combat these attacks, countermeasures such as device-independent security proofs and experimental measures have been proposed.

• A new scheme called Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD) has been proposed, which removes potential loopholes in detector measurements without sacrificing performance.

• MDIQKD has been shown to cover twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD, and only requires the assumption that the preparation of quantum signal sources by the users is nearly perfect.

• The characterization of the signal source is easier than that of the detection unit, and with MDIQKD, researchers can focus on imperfections of signal sources rather than detectors.

Various theories beyond the Standard Model, such as grand unified theories and supersymmetric theories, imply specific ways of time reversal symmetry violation. However, relating hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom is challenging due to the absence of a complete solution of quantum chromodynamics at the energies considered.

The charge exchange and axial vector type exchange nucleon nucleon interaction are considered, and the ansatz to calculate matrix elements from the quark structure is described. The results for different types of quark models are presented, and the importance of experimental precision tests in translating experimental constraints to a more fundamental interaction level is emphasized.

• The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from a companion star, increasing its mass until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes.

• Recent progress in the accreting WD model includes the introduction of a stellar wind from the WD, which helps sustain stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia. There are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel.

• The companion stars leading to SNe Ia can be predicted by the accreting WD model, but this evolutionary scenario has not been confirmed by observations. Identifying the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site is required for confirmation.

• Observations of a G2IV star (Tycho G) near the Tycho supernova remnant (SNR) suggest that it may be the companion star of the SNR, but this hypothesis is still debated. The presence of broad wings in Fe II absorption lines in the UV spectrum of a star behind the SNR ejecta can be used to identify companion stars of SNe Ia.

• The entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation are two measures of entanglement that satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure. They give the value zero for certain states, which might be counterintuitive, but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state.
• The problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system is one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment, and is complicated by the fact that the state of the environment is complex and unknown. To fully characterize the entanglement in this situation, the inherent uncertainty of the mixed state description must be removed.
• Quantum trajectory unravelings of open system dynamics can be used to measure entanglement in a more complete way by considering the way in which information about the system is read from the environment. This approach yields a contextual entanglement measure that is dependent on the kind of measurements made.

- The difference between Type 1 and Type 2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is explained by angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region, caused by a dusty medium known as the ""dust torus."" This torus absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the energy in the infrared.
- Observations have shown that Type 1 AGN show significantly more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity, which is consistent with the picture where the face-on view onto the torus in Type 1 AGN exposes the innermost hot dust to the observer, while the torus is seen edge-on in Type 2 AGN, blocking the line-of-sight to the hot dust.
- The anisotropy of the infrared emission of AGN has implications for the formation of isotropic AGN samples based on infrared fluxes and the understanding of how the torus obscures the AGN. The anisotropy may be used to distinguish between torus models where the dust is smoothly distributed and those where the dust is arranged in clouds.
- A problem commonly encountered when studying AGN samples in the local universe is a significant contribution of the host galaxy to the infrared emission. This can be mitigated by using high-spatial resolution observations or by studying high-luminosity objects where the AGN outshines the host galaxy.
- The paper aims to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of the AGN emission in the infrared using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars. The analysis is improved by using host-galaxy subtraction for the radio galaxies and clumpy torus models for interpretation.

* Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has seen advancements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, with practical systems such as fiber-based Gaussian-modulated and discrete-modulated coherent-state protocol QKD systems demonstrated over tens of kilometers. The unconditional security of these systems has been confirmed through security analysis of the equivalent entanglement-based (EB) scheme.
* However, traditional security analysis of the EB scheme in CVQKD only considers the signal beam and not the local oscillator (LO), an auxiliary light beam used for phase reference and balanced homodyne detection. This leaves security loopholes as LO is within Eve's manipulating domain. The necessity of monitoring LO intensity for security proofs in discrete QKD protocols embedded in continuous variables has been discussed, and the excess noise caused by imperfect subtraction of balanced homodyne detectors in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations has been noted and quantified.
* In practical CVQKD implementation, shot noise scaling with LO power measured before key distribution is assumed constant, with pulses having large LO intensity fluctuations discarded. This approach gives Eve an advantage in exploiting LO intensity fluctuations. A paper proposes an attacking scheme based on this fluctuation and analyzes the effect on the secret key rate with and without LO monitoring for reverse and direct reconciliation protocols.
* The paper finds that LO intensity fluctuation could compromise secret keys severely if not properly addressed. It emphasizes the importance of accurate LO intensity monitoring to ensure the security of CVQKD practical implementation.

It was inspired by the review and tests of adiabatic stellar oscillations provided by @xcite.

• The code defines the equilibrium model in terms of a minimal set of dimensionless variables, as well as mass, radius, and other physical properties. It also introduces a new set of dependent variables for numerical integration, which allows for the calculation of modes of arbitrarily high degree in a complete model. The code can handle both complete stellar models and envelope models, with appropriate boundary conditions at the center and surface of the star.

• The code uses a shooting method or a relaxation technique to solve the equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations, with the option for Richardson extrapolation to improve the precision of the computed frequencies. The code also includes techniques for redistributing the mesh in a way that takes into account the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions, as well as options for outputting eigenfunctions and mode inertia.

• The code has been used in a number of studies and comparisons with other oscillation codes, and has been improved with the installation of a fourth-order integration scheme and the implementation of a new classification scheme for dipolar modes of low order in centrally condensed models. The code is currently being extended to cover second-order effects of rotation and integrated with the astec evolution code for full calculation of oscillation frequencies.

• Exceptionally huge Hi arcs and loops have been identified in edge-on spirals, interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like appearance and velocity range.
• Supershells can be attributed to internal or external sources: internal sources involve starbursts, stellar winds, and supernova explosions, while external sources suggest infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane.
• The main difficulty with the starburst model lies in the required input energies for the largest shells, often needing staggering numbers of supernova events.
• Alternative explanations propose that Hi supershells are produced by gamma-ray bursts or infall of massive gas clouds.
• Recent observations reveal galaxies with extremely large Hi supershells but no evidence of interaction or nearby companions, suggesting a new explanation for their formation.

* However, Baade noted that there are characteristics in the stellar populations of dSph galaxies that differentiate them from globular clusters, such as extreme red horizontal branches and distinct characteristics of variable stars.
* The discovery of carbon stars in dSph galaxies led to the recognition that these differences are due to the presence of an intermediate-age population.
* The CMDs of several dSph galaxies, such as Carina, Fornax, Leo I, and others, show evidence of an intermediate-age population, while some dSph galaxies, like Ursa Minor, only show a dominant old stellar population.
* An old stellar population, traced by a horizontal branch (HB), has been observed in all dSph galaxies satellites of the Milky Way, except Leo I, regardless of their subsequent star formation histories.
* Leo I is peculiar in that it lacks a conspicuous old population and has a much larger fraction of intermediate-age population than its dSph counterparts, as well as a non-negligible population of young (<1 Gyr old) stars.
* The distance to Leo I has been estimated to be ~200 kpc, and it has not been detected in HI observations, suggesting it may not be bound to the Milky Way.
* The star formation history (SFH) of Leo I has been studied through the comparison of observed CMDs with synthetic CMDs, and it shows a continuous star formation activity with possible changes in intensity but no big time gaps between successive bursts.
* The presence of bright yellow stars in the CMD of Leo I supports the conclusion that some star formation has likely been going on in the galaxy from 1 Gyr to a few hundred Myr ago.
* The characteristics of the errors in the photometry of Leo I suggest that the faintest stars in the turnoff region are unlikely to be put there due to large errors, indicating the possible presence of stars older than 10 Gyr in the galaxy.

The large variations in accretion rate in SXRTs allow for the study of regimes inaccessible to LMXRBs. The origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in the quiescent state of several SXRTs is unclear, but it's suggested that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) may turn on during this state, creating a link between LMXRBs and recycled MSps.
- AQL X-1, the most active SXRT known, has been extensively studied. Its outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay. The X-ray spectrum varies with luminosity, transitioning from a soft blackbody to a power law as the luminosity decreases. BEPPOSAX observations allowed for the first detailed study of an SXRT outburst from peak to quiescence.
- The outburst decay of AQL X-1 is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts, but there are notable differences due to the different efficiencies in gravitational energy release between white dwarfs and neutron stars. Models of Low Mass X-ray Transient outbursts hosting an old neutron star or a black hole are built in analogy with dwarf novae outbursts, but important differences exist.
- During the February-March 1997 outburst of AQL X-1, Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations revealed a nearly coherent modulation at 450 Hz during a type I X-ray burst and a single Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) peak at two different flux levels. The burst periodicity may represent the neutron star spin frequency or half its value. The possibility of accretion onto the neutron star surface in the quiescent state of AQL X-1 faces serious difficulties, suggesting a transition to the propeller regime.

* Good candidates for the realization of qubits are semiconductor quantum dots with controlled electron numbers, and the qubit state can be encoded using an electron charge or spin.
* Spin qubits have longer decoherence times, which are necessary for quantum computation, but require a magnetic field to prepare and manipulate.
* Another concept for encoding the qubit is based on the singlet-triplet states in a double quantum dot, which can be prepared and manipulated using electrical control of the exchange interactions.
* The qubit states can be controlled using external magnetic fields, spin-orbit or hyperfine interaction, and the qubit state can be read out using current measurement and the effect of Pauli spin blockade.
* Divincenzo et al. suggested building the qubit in a more complex system, namely in three coherently coupled quantum dots, which provides a decoherence-free subspace and purely electrical control of the exchange interactions.
* Recent experimental efforts have been undertaken to achieve coherent spin manipulations in a linear triple quantum dot system according to Divincenzo's proposal, and a new detection method for the qubit state, called the doublet blockade effect, has been proposed.

- Symbiotic systems (SS) typically consist of a white dwarf (WD), a red giant (RG) star, and circumbinary nebulae.
- The Z Andromedae (Z And) binary system is a SS with a cool giant and a hot compact component, experiencing periods of activity since 1915.
- Outbursts in Z And can be single, double, or in a series with decreasing maximum brightness and different shapes, often accompanied by a jump in the accretion rate and hydrogen burning rate.
- The 1984-1986 outburst in Z And had two maxima, suggesting a double or disturbed single outburst, possibly caused by a drop in WD radiation flux and ejection of material.
- The stellar wind of the cool giant in Z And has a velocity of 25 km/s, which can change the accretion regime and lead to an optical thick wind forming from the WD.
- Collision of the winds from WD and RG leads to shock fronts, increasing the luminosity of the system.
- The observed continuum spectral energy distribution (SED) of Z And can be reproduced by models constrained by the fit of the line ratios, providing a detailed picture of the components.
- The 1984-1986 outburst in Z And can be explained by the collision of the WD wind with two ejected shells from the RG, causing a sudden increase in distance between the WD and the downstream nebula.
- The absence of broad lines and collimated jets during the 1984-1986 outburst suggests no WD explosion or accretion disk presence.
- The 2000-2002 outburst of Z And was characterized by broad wings and collimated bipolar jets, while other SS have shown similar features caused by high-velocity matter accompanying outbursts or accretion disk presence.

• Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks are emerging as novel electronic materials, and their electrical properties need to be accurately determined for various applications. SWCNT networks can be viewed as a two-dimensional network of conducting one-dimensional rods with large dimension ratio, leading to percolation behavior and nonlinear thickness dependence.

• The frequency- and electric-field dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks have been investigated for individual SWCNTs and some types of SWCNT networks. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation on the correlation between the onset frequency and the length scale determined from nonlinear transport for varying network densities.

• The paper investigates the frequency- and electric-field dependent conductivity for SWCNT networks with systematically varying densities and finds that the onset frequency extracted from the frequency dependence measurement increases with the film thickness, while the length scale extracted from the electric field dependent measurement decreases at the same time. An empirical relation between the two transport measurement methods is developed.

• The investigation of SWCNT networks on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate prepared by the spraying method shows that the networks fit well to the extended pair approximation model, and the onset frequency changes linearly with the dc sheet conductance over about 4 decades. The frequency-dependent conductance of ultra-thin sub-monolayer nanotube networks also fits well to the extended pair approximation model.

• Quantum algorithms, specifically Grover'Search algorithm, can perform certain tasks more efficiently than classical counterparts due to quantum superposition and interference. For example, searching an item in an unsorted database containing N elements can be done in square root of the time required classically.

• Grover'Search algorithm has been realized using various physical systems such as NMR, superconducting qubits, and atom-cavity QED systems. Superconducting qubit-cavity QED is an attractive approach due to its strong coupling limit in microwave cavity. SQUIDs have attracted attention as superconducting qubits due to their design flexibility, large-scale integration, and compatibility with conventional electronics.

• The document discusses the implementation of three-qubit Grover'Search algorithm using four-level SQUIDs in cavity-QED, employing a three-qubit phase gate to reduce the number of quantum gates required. The scheme is based on resonant and off-resonant interaction of cavity field with SQUID transition and application of resonant microwave pulses. The proposed implementation aims to suppress decoherence caused by adjustment of level spacing and reduce the possibility of error.

• The document also discusses various imperfections that can arise during the implementation of Grover'Search algorithm, such as coupling constant, decay rate of level, and cavity decay rate. The fidelity and success probability of three-qubit phase gate and Grover'Search algorithm are analyzed considering these imperfections.

• The 1970s saw the flourishing of many-body theory, with many-body effects on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra from deep core levels in metals receiving significant attention.
• The excitation of core electrons by XPS can lead to shake-up effects, where conduction-band (CB) electrons are left in a non-equilibrium state, resulting in plasmon replicas in the spectrum.
• The shift in the main peak's position is due to the screening of the core hole by CB electrons, while the plasmon replicas correspond to different excited states of the system.
• In a metal, single-particle excitations can also occur, leading to a deformation of both the main peak and plasmon replicas.
• The low-energy tailing in the XPS line shape is a characteristic of metallic systems and can be used to determine the core hole's location in a complex sample.
• In the case of pristine graphene, the chemical potential is not inside an energy band or a band gap, resulting in a unique system with a low-energy tailing.
• In doped graphene, the chemical potential is inside an energy band, leading to tailing and the contribution of two-dimensional plasmons with a different dispersion than in ordinary three-dimensional metallic systems.
• The collective excitations in doped graphene start from zero frequency and upwards, making it difficult to quantitatively interpret graphene core-hole spectra using Doniach and Sunji fitting.
• The present work aims to provide the reader with the tools needed to calculate the spectra of core-hole in a two-dimensional system.

* The dynamics of these processes are typically analyzed in the simplest setting, consisting of two genotypes.
* Fitness is a key concept representing the selection pressure on individuals, defined as the expected number of offspring an individual will produce.
* Experimental studies have shown that many natural systems exhibit frequency-dependent selection, where an individual's fitness depends on its interactions with other individuals and the frequency of different genotypes in the population.
* The impact of nonlinear frequency dependence on coevolutionary dynamics has not been studied theoretically, but the text shows that it may induce new stable configurations of the evolutionary dynamics.
* The article uses the Moran process in a non-spatial environment to study the evolutionary dynamics, which is a well-established model and was already used in many applications.
* The Moran process is a stochastic birth-death process that keeps the population size constant, and in a two-genotype model, the system becomes effectively one-dimensional, so that the dynamics may be described by a one-dimensional Markov chain with transition rates defined by the Moran process.
* The stationary probability distribution of the system dynamics is derived via its Fokker-Planck equation, which reveals metastable points of the dynamics and stochastic switching dynamics between multiple stable points.

• Weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure has been detected in samples of high-redshift quasars (QSOs), intermediate-redshift galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It manifests as angular correlations between these sources and foreground mass inhomogeneities or as a coherent shear effect in the case of galaxies.

• Another way to detect weak lensing is by using fluxes of standard candles, such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). If the observed magnitudes of SNe Ia are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen as brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess and fainter ones having mass deficits in their foregrounds.

• The best example of a cosmological standard candle, SNe Ia, have been extensively observed to determine the global geometry of the universe. Nuisance effects like evolution, variations in individual SNe, and gray dust extinction have been studied and either corrected for or shown to be small. Weak lensing, another nuisance effect, has been addressed theoretically and found to be unimportant given current uncertainties.

• The main goal of the work described in the text is to determine if the observed fluxes of cosmologically distant SNe Ia have suffered significantly from lensing-induced (de-)amplifications. The largest homogeneous compilation of SNe Ia contains 74 objects, but only 55 lie on usable parts of APM plates, which are used as tracers of foreground mass density.

• The analysis presented in the text yields values for global cosmological parameters, which are used in the paper's analysis. The sample of 55 SNe Ia is examined for the effects of lensing by comparing the number of galaxies in circles around each SN to the average number density in control circles. The fractional galaxy excess is calculated, and the rank of each SN circle among its control ""peers"" is determined.

• The text discusses the behavior of lanthanide-based heavy fermion (HF) metals, which exhibit distinct physical properties due to strong spin-flip scattering from essentially localized f-levels, leading to a large effective mass and low-energy scale indicative of strong interactions.

• At low temperatures, HF metals transition from a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid state to an incoherent screening regime via independent Kondo scattering, before displaying clean metallic behavior.

• Theoretical treatments of HF metals typically involve the Periodic Anderson Model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo Lattice Model. Various approximation schemes have been developed to study these models, including dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), which becomes exact in the large-dimensional limit.

• DMFT maps lattice models onto an effective single-impurity model with a self-consistently determined host, but its application to HF materials requires a method to solve the PAM, which it does not provide inherently.

• Several techniques have been employed to solve the PAM, including numerical renormalization group (NRG), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), exact diagonalization, and various theoretical approaches like perturbation theory, iterated perturbation theory, and large-N mean-field theory.

• The text focuses on the Local Moment Approach (LMA), a non-perturbative technique that introduces the concept of local moments and a two-self-energy description, capturing correlated spin-flip dynamics in a lattice model.

• The LMA has been successful in describing the dynamics and transport properties of HF metals, particularly in the strongly correlated kondo lattice regime. It has also been extended to handle the asymmetric PAM, applicable to HF metals.

• The LMA provides a many-body description of dynamical and transport properties, such as single-particle dynamics, DC transport, and optical conductivities, and enables direct quantitative comparison with experiment.

• Recent experiments have shown the impact of tension on DNA looping. A small tension of 100 femtonewtons can increase the looping time and reduce it in the presence of fluctuating tension. Theoretical studies have explored the effects of nonlinear elasticity, tension, and enzymes on DNA bending and loop formation probability.

• Brownian dynamics simulations of semiflexible polymers treated as extensible wormlike chains, combined with one-dimensional theory of barrier crossing, have been used to understand the basic physical mechanism of biopolymer looping. The simulations show that looping time increases steeply with applied tension and is reduced by dichotomically fluctuating tension.

• The study also highlights the potential of biopolymers to self-organize optimally using ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations, suggesting further experiments with dichotomically fluctuating tension for various chain lengths to establish the resonant activation phenomena in polymer loop formation.

- Tidal interactions in close binary systems, such as star-star or star-planet systems, can lead to various phenomena like synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, disruption, and fall of an object onto a star.
- The paper investigates the tidal interaction of two bodies: a star and a point source (which can be a star or a planet) and considers the evolution of the star itself on time scales that depend on the orbital period of the binary system.
- The study focuses on dynamical tides and chose three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses. The stars are considered without rotation or magnetic field and superficially touch on stellar physics.
- The problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star-planet system.
- The low-frequency g-modes of stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides, especially at small periastron distances of the planet.
- The results of this paper can be directly applied to some exoplanet systems, such as the system YBP1194, which has a solar twin star and a planet with a mass of 0.34 and a period of only 6.9 days.
- The paper considers the possibility of a planet falling onto the star due to quasi-static tides and provides a plot for solar-like stars that shows the threshold below which the planet falls onto the star.
- The stellar evolution time scales strongly depend on the orbital period of the binary system and can take values up to 108 yr or more for periods of about 5 days.
- The eigenfrequencies of stellar oscillations are divided into three types: p-modes, f-modes, and g-modes, and the study focuses only on the low-frequency g-modes.
- The brunt-vaisala frequency, which determines the properties of g-modes, is subject to significant changes as the stellar age increases, affecting the tidal forces and the orbital evolution of the planet.

- Determining the location of an isolated fluorescent marker is limited by photon noise, not the diffraction barrier.
- Optical transparency of the media surrounding the light emitters is a key issue affecting subwavelength imaging methods.
- Fluorescence microscopy provides noninvasive imaging of the interior of cells and allows the detection of specific cellular constituents through fluorescence tagging.
- Certain biological tissues or soft-matter systems can look turbid due to intense scattering of photons, giving rise to a speckle pattern and producing a blurred image.
- Techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can measure the distance between individual nano-objects without imaging their position.
- FRET relies on the near-field energy transfer between two fluorophores emitting at different wavelengths, with the FRET signal depending on the donor-acceptor distance.
- Determining distances between two emitters in the range of 10 to 500 nm in a scattering medium is still a challenging problem, not accessible by fluorescence microscopy or FRET techniques.
- A new approach is introduced to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment, based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light.

• Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of materials with non-trivial topological invariants and robust surface metallic states, typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction. However, all known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements, which poses constraints on the search for topological materials. A proposed solution is to generate effective spin-orbit couplings from ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons.

• An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been proposed to generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI). However, realizing this proposed topological phase in real materials or simple theoretical models has been challenging due to competing orders and quantum fluctuations.

• A study found that reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones tends to stabilize the TMI in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. By suppressing the Fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the TMI emerges in an extended parameter region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking even when many-body and quantum fluctuations are taken into account.

- Graphene-based transistors have moved closer to reality with the realization of a gate-induced band gap in Bernal stacked bi-layer graphene. However, sub-gap conductance with weak temperature dependence below the optically measured gap presents a puzzle.
* The gapped bilayer is not as insulating as expected, and dominant transport along the physical edge of the samples has been ruled out. A new theory suggests the existence of a topological gapless channel of transport along a recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary network.
* This predicted topological edge state would be the first realization of a topological surface(edge) state hosted by a structural topological defect. No such topological gapless mode has been observed so far in lattice dislocations in three-dimensional crystals.
* The AB-BA tilt boundary is a structural topological line defect along which each neighboring layer is displaced by one inter-atomic spacing. It can occur due to the third dimension added by the stacking of the graphene layers and forms a boundary between two inequivalent stacking structures frequently referred to as AB and BA.
* The tilt boundaries host gapless modes of topological origin and form the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states.
* The authors propose feasible experiments to detect topological edge states at naturally occurring tilt boundaries and make the first concrete application of the SPT approach for a two-dimensional (2D) system to study a large class of gapped graphene systems.

• Charged polymers have numerous industrial and medical applications and are often water-soluble. Many biological macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins are charged polymers.
• Intra-chain electrostatic interactions are repulsive in polyelectrolytes and tend to swell the chain, while in polyampholytes, attractive interactions between charged monomers of opposite sign decrease the chain size.
• The behavior of a single polyampholyte and the solution of polyampholytes depends on the sequence of charged monomers on the chains.
• Electrostatic interactions in a polyelectrolyte brush can be sufficiently strong even at low grafting densities, making it easy for the system to access the brush regime.
• At high enough grafting densities and charge fractions of polyelectrolyte chains, most counterions are trapped inside the polyelectrolyte brush, and the competition between osmotic pressure of the counterions and elasticity of the chains determines the brush thickness.
• The regime of a polyelectrolyte brush where some theoretical scaling methods predict no dependence of the brush thickness to the grafting density is known as the osmotic regime.
• Diffusion of a fraction of counterions outside the polyelectrolyte brush leads to a logarithmic dependence of the average brush thickness on the grafting density.

Lattice QCD studies and studies based on the random instanton liquid model also support the use of scalar diquark fields. The two-point correlation functions of these currents are written down and hadronic representations are obtained by inserting a complete set of intermediate hadronic states.

• The text also introduces a new Lagrangian and performs the operator product expansion with basic diquark fields instead of quark fields. The quark-gluon interactions are absorbed into the effective diquark masses, which are characterized by the correlation length. The diquarks can be gauged with the same color group to embody the residual quark-gluon interactions. In calculations, all diagrams are taken into account, new vacuum diquark condensates are introduced, and the high dimensional vacuum condensates are suppressed by large denominators or additional powers of the inverse Borel parameters. The sum rules are obtained by taking the dualities below the thresholds and performing the Borel transform with respect to the variable.

G65.2+5.7 shares these characteristics and could help explain the origins of these mysterious SNRs.

• Researchers have suggested various hypotheses for the formation of thermal composite SNRs, including the radiative phase evolution hypothesis, entropy mixing, cloudlet evaporation, ejecta enrichment, dust destruction, and collisions with molecular clouds. However, observational evidence supporting these theories is still limited.

A dynamical phase transition was found and studied in the framework of mean field theory. In this paper, the authors study structural properties of the networks that determine their attractors, focusing on the relevant elements and their probability distribution. They also describe how the relevant elements are subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules, which was suggested by Kauffman and used to study attractors in @xmath4 networks.

• The authors describe the phase transition in random Boolean networks in terms of the scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size or as a percolation transition in the set of relevant elements. They also discuss the consequences of this approach for the statistical properties of the attractors. The authors computed the properties of the attractors in the framework of the annealed approximation, but observed that the results of this approximation are reliable only when the system is chaotic enough.

• Spin-superflow turbulence (SST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC has been studied, revealing a Kolmogorov spectrum in the superflow kinetic energy through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields. SST sustains two power laws when the -5/3 power law is sustained in the kinetic energy spectrum, and the spin-dependent interaction energy exhibits a +1 power law simultaneously.

• The text also discusses the assumptions used in the derivation of the power laws, the possibility of a Kolmogorov spectrum in SST with hydrodynamic equations, and the numerical method and results to confirm these theoretical considerations.

• Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) are thought to have low luminosities due to very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes.
• The accretion has been explained by the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model, which predicts a ""submillimeter bump"" in the spectral energy distribution and a high brightness temperature in radio bands.
• The ADAF model has been successful in explaining the broadband spectra of LLAGNs, but there is a gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum in low-frequency radio bands.
• About half of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and LINERs, and at least 25% of transition objects, hold a compact radio core. Most of the cores show nearly flat spectra in 0.5-arcsec resolution, indicating jet domination.
• Millimeter continuum observations for 16 out of 20 targets using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array were made, resulting in the detection of at least ten LLAGNs with inverted high-frequency radio spectra.
• An inverse correlation was found between the high-frequency radio spectrum and the low-frequency radio core power, which can be explained by the idea that flux ratios between the jet and the ADAF disc are different from LLAGN to LLAGN.
• The findings will encourage further LLAGN surveys at higher-frequency ranges with the Atacama Large Millimeter and Submillimeter Array to prove the ADAF.
• The existence of the ADAF will give radio astronomers a chance to make the direct imaging for accretion discs, which has been limited to nonthermal phenomena in relativistic jets of AGNs.

• Scattering, absorption, and reradiation of photons by dust grains affect the propagation of starlight and play a key role in regulating the energy balance in the interstellar medium.
• The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and this dependence can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law.
• Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with the ratio of total to selective extinction being a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.
• The overall shape of the reddening law is found to be tightly correlated with the slope, and a one-parameter family of empirical fitting functions has been devised to characterize the observed range of extinction law shapes.
• Significant deviations from the canonical value of the ratio of total to selective extinction are known to exist for a variety of interstellar dust clouds, and these variations appear to be generally correlated with environment.
• Measurements are necessary along many sight lines through a broad range of cloud types to improve our understanding of the dependence of the ratio of total to selective extinction on environment.
• The study of dust extinction law slope variations is important for quantifying extinction/reddening variations on the smallest scales possible, which can impact the accuracy of many astronomical measurements even at high galactic latitudes.

• Heavy-fermion systems are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, with the Kondo scale marking the screening of local magnetic moments by conduction electrons' spins. This screening is a many-body effect that results in a paramagnetic heavy-fermion liquid emerging below the coherence temperature, which is believed to track the Kondo scale. The paramagnetic state is characterized by a large Fermi surface including both magnetic moments and conduction electrons.

• The competition between Kondo screening, favoring paramagnetic ground states, and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, favoring magnetically ordered states, can lead to quantum phase transitions. Two scenarios have been proposed to describe this quantum phase transition: the Herzt-Millis picture, where the quasi-particles of the heavy-fermion liquid remain intact and undergo a spin-density wave transition, and alternative scenarios where the quantum critical point is linked to the breakdown of the quasi-particle state and a topological reorganization of the Fermi surface is expected.

• Recent experiments show that a change in Fermi surface topology can occur not only at the magnetic order-disorder quantum critical point but also via application of chemical pressure. The Kondo lattice model (KLM) is used to investigate the ground state of heavy-fermion systems, and dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations are presented to map out the magnetic phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and conduction electron density.

• The DCA implementation approximates the Fourier space of a lattice with two-point basis by patching, leading to real-space clusters of size 39, each encompassing 54 orbitals. The lattice Green function can be expressed in an extended Brillouin zone scheme, and the DCA approximates the Fourier space of a lattice with two-point basis by patching, leading to real-space clusters of size 39, each encompassing 54 orbitals. The KLM is solved using the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) version of the Hirsch-Fye algorithm, and the performance of the QMC cluster solver is enhanced by almost an order of magnitude using the method of delayed updates.

* Upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons from LHC experiments have been discussed, and bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity can also be obtained from strong-gravity astrophysical objects like active galactic nuclei (AGN) and primordial black holes.
* The presence of strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, affecting the mass of fundamental particles such as the electron, but minimally affecting nucleons due to their gluonic fields not being coupled to the Higgs field at tree level.
* This deformation leads to peculiar wavelength shifts, which should be present for electronic transitions and strongly suppressed for molecular transitions. Attention has been focused on the Kreschmann invariant as a possible coupling to the only non-null curvature invariant for spherically symmetric objects.

- White dwarf (WD) stars, which represent the end points of stellar evolution for most low-mass stars, are the fate of more than 97% of all stars in our galaxy. A specific type of WD stars, known as da WDs, make up about 80% of all WDs and have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. When da WDs cool to a certain temperature, they can develop a hydrogen partial ionization zone and start pulsating, going through the zz Ceti (or DAV) instability strip. These pulsations can help determine the fundamental parameters of the WDs using asteroseismology.
* The zz Ceti instability strip is believed to be pure, meaning that all da WDs will eventually pass through it and pulsate as they cool. The strip runs in temperature from roughly 11,000 K for standard WDs with a surface gravity of log g = 8.0. There is also a dependence on surface gravity, with WDs having lower surface gravities pulsating at lower effective temperatures. This trend has been observed for WDs with masses ranging from 1.1 M⊙ down to 0.5 M⊙.
* The discovery of pulsating extremely low-mass (ELM) WDs, which have masses less than 0.25 M⊙ and are likely the product of binary evolution, provides a new opportunity to study the nature of WD pulsations at cooler temperatures and lower masses. These ELM WDs are useful for constraining the interior composition, hydrogen-layer mass, overall mass, rotation rate, and behavior of convection in low-mass WDs. Several groups have investigated the pulsation properties of helium-core WDs, and non-adiabatic calculations have shown that non-radial p- and g-modes should be unstable and observable in these objects.

- The blue edge of the zz Ceti instability strip, where pulsations are turning on, has been successfully estimated using convective period arguments and full non-adiabatic calculations.

Star formation is restricted to cold dense gas and is strongly correlated with molecular gas content. However, the link between star formation and molecular gas is probably not causal, but molecular gas is an indispensable tracer of star forming regions in the local and distant universe. Understanding the links between star formation, ISM, and galaxy evolution requires identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas is able to develop.

• The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores that develop in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Tracking molecular chemistry is crucial to accurately represent small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations of star-forming clouds. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity far below its mean. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, so-called photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively both numerically and theoretically. The outer, unshielded layers of a PDR are composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon, while deeper layers are dominated by the presence of deep penetrating cosmic rays and the freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains. Simply understanding the structure of a non-dynamic, one-dimensional PDR is of limited utility, as the ISM is a dynamic environment where a variety of non-linear, coupled processes determine the global distribution and state of gas.",1,"{'n_points': 2, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases as a function of increasing local galaxy density in the low redshift universe, a correlation known as the star formation-density relation. This relation has been confirmed in many studies using optical and UV data to trace star formation in massive galaxy clusters and field environments. Mid-infrared data has also revealed the presence of highly obscured, dusty star-forming galaxies.
• WISE data has been used to study obscured star formation in low redshift clusters out to the virial radius, but there are still uncertainties in the relationship between star formation and global cluster properties. Some studies suggest a correlation between cluster mass and the mass-normalized cluster star formation rate, while others argue there is no strong correlation.

They also find that the CSSFR increases with projected radius and remains below the field value even at large radii.
• The authors suggest strangulation as a plausible candidate for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies, as it is less dependent on cluster mass than ram pressure or harassment.

The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now essential for a proper description of data, and there is growing interest in implementing 2p-2h models into Monte Carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations. The only 2p-2h model implemented so far is the IFIC Valencia model in GENIE, with plans to incorporate the Lyon model in GENIE and phenomenological approaches like the Effective Transverse Enhancement Model in nuWro generator. The main challenge is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved.

• The text presents a fast and efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) model, called the Frozen Nucleon Approximation (FNA). This approach reduces the number of nested integrals from 7 (full calculation) to 1, making it well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux. The FNA assumes that the initial momenta of the two struck nucleons can be neglected for high enough energy and momentum transfer, and it was found to work properly in computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators.

• The accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the nucleus of galaxies is believed to be the source of activity in quasars and Seyfert galaxies, also known as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Several studies suggest that the mass of the SMBH in these objects is correlated with the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the galaxies. These correlations may imply an evolutionary relation between the growth of the SMBH and the host galaxy. Independent and reliable estimates of the mass of the black holes are required to study the dependence of the various observed phenomena of AGNs on the black hole mass and the cosmic evolution of the black holes. The reverberation mapping technique can be used to make estimates of SMBH masses over a large range of redshift, but it is observationally taxing and has only been used for about three dozen AGNs to date.

The relative calibration procedure used to inter-calibrate the spectra is described, as well as the reduction and analysis of the R-band images. The paper also discusses the variability of the light curves and the time lag between the variations of the broad line and that of the continuum, which is found to be of the order of hours to days for low luminosity sources.

These quantities can be rewritten as a function of temperature and baryon density, which is more suitable for experimental measurement. The phase diagram of QGP can be extracted by solving an equation involving the QGP and hadronic pressures.

This can be measured using statistical criteria such as the Shannon mutual information, Kullback divergence, or Fisher information quantity.
• The paper studies the problem of estimation and hypothesis testing for a model with a threshold and a subthreshold constant signal, using two schemes of observations: observing the proportion of time spent above the threshold and measuring the energy of the signal above the threshold.
• The noise in the model is an ergodic diffusion process, and the paper proposes two estimators for the schemes with asymptotic properties. The presence of stochastic resonance is noted for the first time in this context.
• The paper also studies the problem of testing a simple hypothesis against a simple alternative using the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion.
• The asymptotic variance of the estimator can be calculated, and it is shown that the estimators are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators.
• The paper establishes asymptotic properties of estimators given by the generalized method of moments and provides an example of stochastic resonance based on a specific stochastic differential equation.

• High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have been found to have mainly d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant d-gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature. This symmetry has been confirmed through try-crystal phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements.

• The effect of pinning of vortices plays an important role in determining the correct angle pattern in thermal conductivity measurements. A field-cooled procedure must be used to rule out the influence of this effect. The angular patterns of the longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures show a fourfold oscillation in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the CuO planes.

• The variation of the thermal conductivity can be explained with a model involving a Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles and an accurate inclusion of impurity scattering. The ds affects both the carrier density and the scattering rate of quasiparticles, while the as mechanism induces Andreev reflection of the quasiparticles.

• The thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature can explain the experimental results in the whole temperature range, in particular the change of symmetry of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. The numerical calculation of the thermal conductivity at different angles and temperatures confirms the predominance of the d-gap up to the superconducting critical temperature.

• Dehn surgery is an operation that modifies a three-manifold by drilling and then regluing a solid torus.
• Two Dehn surgeries along a knot with distinct slopes are called purely cosmetic if they result in orientation-preserving homeomorphic three-manifolds.
• The cosmetic surgery conjecture states that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic.
• The paper focuses on purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere.
• For most knots in the three-sphere, the resulting three-manifolds are not orientation-preserving homeomorphic for distinct slopes.
• A knot's Jones polynomial can be used to determine if it admits no purely cosmetic surgery.
• Lescop's surgery formula and a knot invariant satisfying a crossing change formula are used to prove the main result.
• The main result is reformulated in terms of finite type invariants of the knot.
• Applications of the main result include proving the nonexistence of purely cosmetic surgery on certain families of two-bridge knots and whitehead doubles.

- Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties such as calculable soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking terms and renormalization group invariant soft terms, but they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters leading to tachyonic states.
- A solution to this problem is to add a universal scalar mass to the AMSB soft SUSY breaking terms, resulting in the ""minimal"" AMSB (mAMSB) model with a parameter space given by $m_0, m_{3/2},$ and sign($\mu$).
- An alternative setup for AMSB is hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB), a string-motivated scenario where SUSY breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, leading to suppressed tree-level gravity mediation and dominant anomaly mediation.
- The bino mass in the mSSM can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation, leading to a small or large perturbation to the spectrum depending on its size.
- The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation can lead to phenomenologically viable spectra for a wide range of relative contributions, with the hCAMSB ssb contribution governed by a dimensionless quantity $\alpha$.
- The hCAMSB model can be implemented in the ISASUGRA subprogram of the ISAJET event generator, with weak scale sparticle masses determined by renormalization group evolution from input parameters at the GUT scale.
- The hCAMSB parameter space and sparticle mass spectrum can have significant consequences for the LHC collider, with differences in sparticle production cross sections and decay signatures between hCAMSB and mAMSB models.

- The text discusses the use of the Zero Range Potential (ZRP) approach in quantum mechanics, which allows for the exact solution of scattering problems. The ZRP can be represented as a boundary condition on the wavefunction or as a pseudopotential. Darboux transformations (DT) can be used to construct exactly solvable potentials and modify the generalized ZRP (GZRP) boundary condition, creating a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.
- The DT technique can be used to correct the ZRP model by dressing the potential, which involves defining the free parameters of the solutions and introducing short-range cores of centrifugal type in the potential. This can lead to the generation of complex poles of the S-matrix, which correspond to quasi-stationary states (resonances). Darboux transformations can also be used to add or remove poles of the S-matrix.
- The text also discusses the use of ZRPs in the multi-center problem, where the wavefunction can be expressed in terms of the outgoing-wave Green function. The partial waves can be classified with respect to symmetry group representation, and the structures of the scatterers can belong to different point groups. The phases and partial and integral cross sections can be expressed in terms of the inverse scattering lengths of the scatterers.

- The text discusses the use of multi-object spectrographs on 4m-class telescopes to construct large samples of faint galaxies with measured redshifts, allowing for the computation of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies as a function of redshift and the observation of the evolution of the galaxy population. Several deep, faint galaxy redshift surveys have been conducted, and while there is broad agreement that the population of blue, star-forming galaxies has evolved strongly since z~1, there are differences in the LFs derived by different groups, which may be due to selection effects and systematic errors. The text also discusses the importance of a reliable measurement of the local LF for quantitative estimates of evolution and the uncertainties that remain in the local LF.
- The text also describes a redshift survey of the Corona Borealis Supercluster, which was originally planned to study the dynamics of the supercluster but ended up providing a sample suitable for studying the evolution of the LF. The survey resulted in 1654 redshifts, with 1022 galaxies lying beyond the Corona Borealis Supercluster. The survey fields are distributed across an area of 25 deg^2, and the objects were selected from photographic plates of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey II. The survey data is used to compute the LF of galaxies in the supercluster and in the field, and the results are discussed in the context of other surveys and galaxy formation theories.

• Rapidity gaps, or pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron. They are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons.

• At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies above 10 GeV and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets. This observation suggests that color singlet exchange effects in QCD events are relevant at momentum transfers of order 1,000 GeV, raising the hope that perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions.

• Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent, in terms of a fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps of order 10%. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event, i.e. without soft interactions between the other partons in the scattering hadrons.

• The two-gluon exchange model, with the two gluon-exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part, is used to calculate the color singlet fraction. In this model, the color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons.

• The predicted color singlet fractions are found to very strongly depend on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer, and thus can not be reliably calculated within perturbation theory. Within the unitarized model, the non-perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters, the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift.

• The gap fraction between two hard jets varies with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation. Predicted fractions are compared with Tevatron data, and the conclusions are given in section [sec5].

• The formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence, and its ubiquity asks for a theoretical explanation within QCD. The formation of gaps between two hard jets at the Tevatron is particularly intriguing and is commonly being explained in terms of color singlet exchange in the s-channel.

• Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole, is orbited by a low mass star.
• The compact object in LMXBs accretes matter from the low mass star, forming an accretion disk that emits X-rays.
• Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z sources and atoll sources.
• Z sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and have high accretion rates, while atoll sources have lower accretion rates and their X-ray color-color diagrams consist of fragmented island-like regions.
• The main physical difference between Z sources and atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.
• LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z source and is therefore thought to be a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit.
• Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, the authors detected narrow emission lines in the Bowen region of LMCX-2, which they identified as coming from the irradiated side of the companion star.

• The axial anomaly is a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, representing a violation of chiral symmetry. It has been analyzed using renormalization procedure and ultraviolet divergences, as well as through the path integral formalism. An alternative approach using dispersion relations and the triangular diagram shows that the anomaly can be interpreted as an infrared phenomenon, caused by a singularity in the chiral limit.

• The Dolgov and Zakharov approach to the axial anomaly has been related to some effects in the dynamics of physical reactions, such as the radiative decays of particles. The authors calculate the corresponding decay rates for the cases where the outgoing leptons are in a definite helicity state and examine the structure of the mass singularities and their cancellation. They also consider the analogies and differences with respect to the corresponding unpolarized decay rates.

• The paper discusses the physics involved in the amplitudes contributing to the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram, including the production and annihilation of a fermion-antifermion pair and the chirality non-conservation in the massless limit. The authors also show that the axial anomaly can be derived by studying the properties of the amplitude in the infrared region.

• The paper also discusses the cancellation of mass singularities in polarized processes and the manifestation of the axial anomaly in reactions where a fermion changes helicity by emitting a photon, which they call helicity changing processes.

• This problem has gained significant attention in the computer vision community due to its potential applications in various areas such as recognition, image compression, video summarization, and image editing.
• A typical salient object detection model consists of two steps: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area.
• Current models have bypassed the challenge of selecting objects by focusing on scenes with single objects, and they perform well on the segmentation step for biased datasets.
• However, the performance of these models on complex, cluttered scenes with multiple objects is unclear due to the lack of suitable benchmark datasets and a widely agreed-upon definition of the most salient object.

* In their papers, Ozsváth, Szabó, and others constructed a decorated topological quantum field theory (TQFT) in dimension 2, called Heegaard Floer theory.
* This TQFT associates a vector space to a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold and a map to a connected, oriented four-dimensional cobordism decorated with a 2-structure.
* These maps can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary.
* For example, two homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic 4-manifolds can be obtained by performing a log transform with odd multiplicity on a regular fiber of the nucleus of an elliptic surface.
* The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, which are related to the three-manifolds and cobordisms involved via Heegaard diagrams.
* Sarkar and the third author showed that every three-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that is nice in the sense that the curves split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles.
* Using such a diagram, holomorphic disks in the symmetric product can be counted combinatorially, giving a combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of any three-manifold and null homologous knots and links in any three-manifold.

- In physics, the goal is not just to calculate observables but also to understand the physical picture behind phenomena. When a theory becomes too complicated at a certain scale, it is necessary to select essential degrees of freedom. For example, in crystals, although the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field, understanding electric conductivity and heat capacity involves working with ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interaction.
- In QCD, the theory becomes too complicated at the scale of 1 GeV, making it difficult to determine the relevant physics for the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties. However, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is crucial for understanding these properties. Beyond the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks that interact through the exchange of Goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.
- The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD has important consequences, such as the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons with low mass and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by valence (practically massless) quarks, known as constituent quarks. These constituent quarks should be considered as quasiparticles with a dynamical mass resulting from nonperturbative gluon and quark-antiquark dressing.
- The flavor-octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit implies that the constituent quarks and Goldstone bosons should be coupled with a strength given by the quark analog of the famous Goldberger-Treiman relation. The microscopic mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking in QCD is not yet fully understood, but sufficiently strong scalar interaction between quarks can induce this symmetry breaking.
- The Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model illustrates these general aspects of chiral symmetry breaking, where the constituent mass is generated by the scalar part of some nonperturbative local gluonic interaction between current quarks, while the pseudoscalar part gives rise to relativistic deeply-bound pseudoscalar systems as Goldstone bosons.

The present invention concerns streptavidin muteins, a process for the production of such proteins by means of recombinant DNA technology as well as the use of these streptavidin muteins for the isolation, purification and determination of biological substances, in particular of other recombinant proteins. The biotin/streptavidin system is a generally known binding system in molecular biology the importance of which has increased considerably in recent years and which is used in various fields of application. In doing so one utilizes the specific affinity between biotin and streptavidin which, together with an affinity constant of the order of 1013, is one of the most stable known non-covalent interactions. Important conventional applications are for diverse separation and detection methods usually using biotinylated enzymes or/and antibodies in various variations. Examples are for example ELISA, Western blot etc. A prerequisite for such methods is that the reagent or enzyme used in a biotinylated form in the method must firstly be obtainable in a pure form in order to be able to carry out the biotinylation which takes place in a chemical reaction. However, for certain applications a biotinylation is not possible or at least not in a simple manner such as for example when detecting and purifying recombinantly produced proteins which have previously not yet",1,"{'n_points': 6, 'symbol': '*'}"

Explanation:

* The present invention describes a new spinning system for forming a melt spun nonwoven web that combines the advantages of both eductive and non-eductive spinning systems. The system uses a two-dimensional slot across the entire machine width to produce a linear plane of filaments with constant filament distribution, providing good control of cross-machine uniformity. This is a significant improvement over conventional spinning systems, which often suffer from turbulence and vorticity that can lead to entanglement and grouping of filaments, reducing the uniformity of the final product.
* The system is also simpler than both eductive and non-eductive systems, with fewer air sources, less nozzle length, and a smaller drawing chamber. This makes it easier to maintain and clean, as there is less surface area exposed to the fiber stream, reducing the accumulation of dirt, polymer drippings, and monomer build-up. The system also uses the same air for two purposes: first to quench the filaments and then to draw them as the air exits through the drawing impingement slot at high velocity. This eliminates the need for a separate quenching air system, further simplifying the system.
* The system is also more flexible than conventional spinning systems, as it can accommodate a wide variety of materials and operating conditions. The quench air temperature, flow rate, and slot opening can all be adjusted to achieve the desired filament properties, such as denier, tenacity, and the like. The system can also handle a wide range of materials, including polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, and even molten glass",1,"{'n_points': 3, 'symbol': '*'}"

- The present invention is a pulsed power device and a method of using the pulsed power device for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).
* Pulsed power is the rapid release of electrical energy that has been stored in capacitor banks, and can be used in a direct plasma mode or by discharging the energy through a coil to generate a short-lived but intense magnetic field.
* The energy release from the system can be used in a plasma, or electrohydraulic (EH) mode, to generate a shock wave that can be used in various processes including geophysical exploration, mining, and EOR.
* The Wesley '650 patent teaches a method for generating strong acoustic vibrations for reservoir stimulation using an electrohydraulic spark discharge, but it has a limited range of about 1000 feet.
* The present invention aims to address this issue by using pulsed power as the source to generate high-frequency acoustic stimulation of the reservoir separately from the direct acoustic response of the EH shock wave.
* This is achieved by using pulsed power to generate a strong electromagnetic pulse that travels at the speed of light across the reservoir, inducing a coupled acoustic vibration at very high frequencies in geologic materials like quartz.
* This induced acoustic vibration acts for a short period of time after the pulse is discharged, but is not limited by the natural acoustic attenuation that limits the effectiveness of a direct acoustic pulse source.
* The present invention also recognizes the importance of targeting specific scales of inclusions in the reservoir with the acoustic stimulation frequencies to optimize energy absorption and effective stimulation.
* The invention can be applied using a multi-level discharge device or multiple pulse sources in multiple wells to extend the effective range of the stimulation and achieve better stimulation of a specific volume of the reservoir.

- The invention describes a method and arrangement for compressing and cooling natural gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method involves compressing the gas to a higher pressure, cooling it by heat exchange, and feeding it back into the pipeline at a lower temperature and increased pressure. The arrangement includes compressors, heat exchangers, valve-controlled pipelines, and control units. The invention utilizes the cooling effect of expanding compressed gas to a lower pressure to reach the desired exit temperature.
- The invention proposes a different type of cooling during the warmer period of the year, when re-cooling units were necessary in the past for ensuring the required exit temperature. The present invention utilizes the physical effect that a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure. The gas is compressed to an excess pressure, cooled by heat exchange, and then expanded to the desired exit pressure. The excess pressure is selected so that cooling during expansion is sufficient for obtaining a temperature reduction to the desired exit temperature.
- The expansion can be carried out in a simple manner, such as by means of a valve, or more significantly by an expansion turbine that recovers mechanical energy for providing a portion of the drive energy for the compression of the gas to the intended excess pressure. The compression to the excess pressure can be carried out in a total of three stages, with a predominant portion of the compression taking place in two successive primary compression stages. The gas is cooled between the two primary compression stages and then further cooled before expansion in an expansion turbine.
- The invention allows for the use of compressors in the stages to be completely exchanged for one another, providing flexibility in operation during different seasons. The compressors can be operated in parallel during peak load periods, and additional compressors can be used as needed during breakdowns or maintenance. The invention provides an overall better possibility of using the principal units of the compressor stations throughout the entire year.

* The joint contours are preferably configured such that adequate coupling of the ring segments is produced with as short as possible a weld seam length and the weld seams taper both towards the ring element inner circumferential edge and towards the ring element outer circumferential edge with as obtuse an angle as possible.
* The flat material ring segments are cut out, in particular punched out, from a sheet metal material, preferably as 120° ring segments, which allows for a relatively high material saving and easy punching out in close succession from a sheet metal strip.
* The concept according to the invention of the production of the rolling body guide cage from a welded ring segment is suitable for the manufacture of radial bearing cages and axial bearing cages, in particular cages of groove and angular ball bearings.
* The ring segments can be produced in such a manner that they initially have a slight oversize and are initially further cut and where necessary calibrated after welding in the context of a contouring step, or cut to their final dimensions in terms of their material width and are subsequently only formed and where necessary punched internally.
* The punching and welding steps can be carried out such that these overlap chronologically, and the welding is preferably carried out by a laser beam guided in a path-controlled manner.
* The invention can achieve a high-quality design of the weld connection points by generating a material bead close to the edge prior to the punching out of the ring segment or during punching out",1,"{'n_points': 10, 'symbol': '*'}"

* This invention relates to a system for compensating electromagnetic interfering fields, specifically for magnetic field compensation using two sensors and a digital processor.
* The system aims to compensate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields, perform a simulation of measuring electromagnetic interfering fields at the protected object's location, and equalize potential feedback effects when using two magnetic field compensation systems in close proximity.
* The system consists of two real triaxial magnetic field sensors, three pairs of compensation coils, and a control unit (preferably a Digital Signal Processor or a field programmable gate array).
* The six output signals from the two real sensors can be combined into three output signals of a virtual sensor using a freely definable kind of averaging, achieved through a matrix multiplication in the control system.
* The control system receives the six output signals from the two real magnetic field sensors and uses a 6x6 matrix M to calculate the output signals of the virtual sensor.
* The virtual sensor's output signals are used as input for independent control loops operating in parallel, which can be broadband or selective concerning a frequency range or a single frequency.
* The control loops have control algorithms that transform the virtual input signals into changed signals, described by an operator Ω.
* The matrix {circumflex over (V)} is multiplied by a 6x6 matrix L to obtain control signals for the six coils.
* The compensation system can be adjusted for homogeneous or inhomogeneous interference, using a single actuator coil instead of a pair of Helmholtz coils if necessary.
* If two compensation systems are operated directly beside each other, a 6x6 feedback or crosscoupling matrix C is used to describe the feedback between the two systems and avoid interferences.

- The invention describes a process for co-producing power and hydrocarbons using an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process and a hydrocarbon production process. Coal is gasified in a wet gasification stage to produce a combustion gas at elevated pressure, which is then used to generate power and enrich a first portion of the combustion gas with hydrogen. The enriched gas is then mixed with a synthesis gas precursor produced in a dry gasification stage to synthesize hydrocarbons.
- The process aims to show economic and environmental benefits by integrating the IGCC process with a hydrocarbon production process. The wet gasification stage uses water as a carrier for solid feedstock, while the dry gasification stage uses a gas as a carrier. The molar ratio of H2/CO in the combustion gas is higher than that in the synthesis gas precursor, and the dry gasification stage produces synthesis gas at a sufficiently high pressure for hydrocarbon synthesis.

• The humidity sensing element of the present invention is a small, hollow cylinder made of commercially pure (99.4%) aluminum with an outer flange for mounting and a fine, smooth-finished bore that serves as the moisture sensing portion. The bore is anodized to form a porous layer of aluminum oxide, which is then impregnated with nickel particles using vacuum deposition. The anodized layer is sealed, and a thin, water vapor pervious electrode is formed over the nickel-impregnated sealed anodized layer using vacuum deposition of nickel atoms. This results in a doped dielectric layer formed by the nickel impregnated sealed portion of the anodized layer, which is vapor pervious and electrically conductive.

• The sensor is mounted in a mounting bracket with a bore and counterbore for receiving the cylindrical portion and flange of the sensor, and a clamping ring of non-conductive material equipped with screws for firmly mounting the sensor. A thin plastic insulating ring is adhesively fastened to the flanged outer end of the sensor, and a layer of electrically conductive material is applied to cover the second electrode for a short distance within the bore and to extend unbroken over the inside diameter of the plastic ring and over its exposed flat surface. A metal ring is then clamped over the conductive layer to make a suitable pressure electrical contact with the second electrode without inadvertently crushing the doped dielectric layer that could effectively short circuit the two electrodes.

* The invention is about devices for producing power or useful work from surface waves on a water body, using submerged devices that rely on differences in hydrostatic pressure and enhanced surge or pitch.
* Wave energy commercialization lags behind wind energy due to high cost per unit of energy capture, caused by heavy steel construction for severe sea-state survivability and low wave energy capture efficiency.
* Only about 10% of currently proposed ocean wave energy converters (OWECs) are deployed subsurface, where severe sea-state problems are reduced.
* Most subsurface OWECs are designed for near-shore sea bed deployment, but ocean waves lose substantial energy as they approach shore due to breaking, reflected wave, bottom and hydrodynamic friction effects.
* Near-shore submerged sea bed OWECs must be deployed at greater depths relative to average wave trough depths due to severe sea-state considerations, and depth can not be adjusted for the large tidal depth variations found at higher latitudes.
* Wave induced subsurface static pressure oscillations diminish more rapidly in shallow water as the depth below waves or swell troughs increases.
* Only a few prior art subsurface devices use gas filled or evacuated containers like the present invention, producing container deformation in response to overhead swell and trough induced static pressure changes.
* None of the prior art subsurface OWECs capture both hydrostatic (heave) and hydrokinetic wave energy (surge or pitch) which represents half of all wave energy.
* None of these prior art subsurface OWECs enhance or supplement energy capture with overhead floating bodies.
* All of the prior subsurface deformable container OWECs suffer from high mass (and therefore cost) and low energy capture efficiency (even more cost) usually due to near-shore or sea bed deployment and high mass.

• The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007, due to material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in internal control. This resulted in a material weakness in SEC's financial reporting process, including issues in period-end financial reporting, disgorgements and penalties accounts receivable, accounting for transaction fee revenue, and preparing financial statement disclosures. Three significant deficiencies were also identified in internal control, concerning property and equipment, and accounting for budgetary resources.

• The SEC's financial statements for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were fairly stated in all material respects, but the weaknesses in internal control may adversely affect decisions based on inaccurate information and result in misstatements in unaudited financial information. Control deficiencies were found in SEC's period-end financial reporting process, calculation of accounts receivable for disgorgements and penalties, accounting for transaction fee revenue, and preparing financial statement disclosures, constituting a material weakness.

• The Postal Service had about 765,000 career employees at the end of fiscal year 1997, with 10% of them in EAS positions. The Service's diversity development program was created to provide equal employment opportunities and take advantage of its diverse workforce. A study by Aguirre International in 1997 found that the Service was a leader in meeting affirmative action goals and striving for parity between its workforce and the CLF, but women and minorities appeared to be experiencing problems advancing to management jobs at EAS 17 and above positions.

• The representation of women and minorities in EAS 17 and above positions generally increased from fiscal year 1993 to 1997, but black men's representation decreased slightly. White and Hispanic women, Native American men and women, and white men were underrepresented in the Service's cluster-level workforce compared with their representation in the CLF. Similar underrepresentation was found in the Service's headquarters-level and area office-level workforces.

• The Aguirre report found that a glass ceiling existed at positions beginning at EAS 17 for women and minorities, but the report did not explicitly define the term or present convincing supporting evidence. The Service contracted with Aguirre International to study the Service’s diversity program and assess its progress in meeting its goal of creating a Service workforce as diverse as the CLF.

• The Aguirre report used multiple research methods, including data analyses, policy reviews, and employee surveys, to research eight research areas. The report made appropriate adjustments to the 1990 Census CLF data to arrive at compatible postal districts for comparisons and developed models to allow for Service hiring requirements and restrictions.

• The Service developed an action plan to address the diversity issues raised by Aguirre and began implementing a plan to strengthen its diversity program. The Service organized its 23 diversity initiatives into six functional groups and reported that it had completed implementation of nine of the initiatives and was on schedule for completing the remaining initiatives.

They can be adopted after their service, with priority given to former handlers, followed by others capable of caring for them and then law enforcement agencies.
• The NDAA for FY 2016 established priorities for the authorized recipients of MWDs removed from service, with MWDs being made available first to former handlers, then to others capable of humanely caring for the MWD, and finally to law enforcement agencies.
• The DOD uses three systems to track different types of information about MWDs, including information related to their removal from service. These systems are WDMS, the Central Repository, and ROVR.
• Over the past 5 years, the number of MWDs adopted or transferred varied, with the highest numbers in 2012 and 2013. The number of euthanized MWDs varied to a lesser extent.
• Prevalent medical conditions among adopted MWDs include skin, dental, and musculoskeletal issues. The most prevalent medical conditions are skin conditions or ear infections, dental disease or injury, arthritis or degenerative joint disease, and degenerative lumbo-sacral stenosis.
• Assistance with privately provided veterinary care is available through nonprofit organizations such as the U.S. War Dogs Association and the American Humane organization.

- The Comanche helicopter program, established in 1983, aimed to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet with a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter for armed reconnaissance and attack missions.
- The program faced funding cuts and restructuring, leading to a delay in the development phase by 3 years, reduced funding, and the production of two flyable prototypes. The Army proposed acquiring six additional aircraft within the Secretary's funding constraint by deferring developmental efforts.
- The restructured program has a high degree of concurrency, meaning production decisions will be made before significant initial operational test and evaluation is completed, increasing the risk of retrofitting production items and inadequate system design testing.
- The Comanche program has experienced significant increases in program acquisition unit cost since 1985, from $12.1 million per aircraft to $34.4 million per aircraft, primarily due to funding reductions and restructuring.
- Software development and maintainability issues increase the risk that the aircraft will not perform successfully. The Comanche will be the most computerized, software-intensive Army helicopter ever built, with about 1.4 million lines of code required for mission critical functions.
- Configuration management challenges and maintainability requirements, such as direct maintenance man-hours per flight hour, mean time to repair, and fault isolation, put lower operating and support costs and wartime availability goals at risk.
- The Army plans to start operational testing with six helicopters by about August 2005, under the restructured program, which provides sufficient time and aircraft to operationally test the Comanche prior to making any production decisions.

- The Food Stamp Program, overseen by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), provides assistance to eligible low-income households for food purchases. FNS regulates eligibility, benefit calculation, and reporting requirements, while states implement the program and determine household eligibility based on income and asset limits.
- FNS has introduced options and waivers to increase program access, reduce reporting burden, and minimize payment errors. These include adjustments to eligibility, reporting requirements, extending benefits to households leaving TANF, and options related to TANF recipients. States can also use options to allow households to own vehicles worth more than the allowed amount and remain eligible for food stamp benefits.
- To monitor program performance, FNS measures states' accuracy in determining eligibility and calculating benefits through a quality control system. States face penalties if their payment error rate is higher than the national average. Payment errors can be caused by inadvertent or intentional errors made by recipients or caseworkers, with about half of all errors due to incorrect income determination.

• ICE investigations resulted in 102,034 apprehensions in 2005, which is about 8% of the total 1.3 million DHS apprehensions. The removable alien population grew to 10.5 million in January 2005, with various categories of violations serving as the basis for removal.
• ICE officers have discretion in various phases of the alien apprehension and removal process, particularly in the initial phases of initiating removals, apprehending aliens, issuing removal documents, and detaining aliens. Officers exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis, especially for aliens with humanitarian issues or those not targeted by investigations.
• The removal process consists of six phases: initial encounter, apprehension, charging, detention, removal proceedings, and final removal. The phases from encounter to determining whether to detain an alien involve the most discretion.
• ICE attorneys and DRO officers have limited discretion during removal proceedings and final removal, following clearly delineated situations and statutory and regulatory requirements.
• Officers may decide not to pursue action against some removable aliens due to factors such as limited resources, competing enforcement priorities, or the availability of detention space.
• ICE has updated some training for officers responsible for making alien apprehension and removal decisions, but guidance on the exercise of discretion during the process is not comprehensive, leaving officers at risk of taking inappropriate actions.

• The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) costs are mainly associated with military personnel and operation and maintenance accounts.
• Estimating the cost of ongoing military operations is difficult due to changing operational requirements, which can cause operations to cost more or less than originally estimated.
• DOD has several authorities to meet its needs if operations cost more than originally estimated, including transferring and reprogramming funds and reducing or deferring planned spending for peacetime operations.
• In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses, but they lost visibility over these funds provided through annual appropriations.
• DOD received funding through supplemental appropriations to support GWOT in both fiscal years 2004 and 2005, totaling about $52.4 billion and $62.1 billion, respectively.
• Program Budget Decision 736, approved in January 2002, provided for increasing DOD's annual budget request by more than $10 billion per year plus inflation in fiscal years 2003 through 2007 to enhance the department's efforts to respond to terrorism.
• DOD and the military services cannot be certain that Program Budget Decision 736 funds were actually used to support GWOT-related activities, as they lack visibility over these funds after fiscal year 2003.
• The military services projected gaps between reported obligations and supplemental appropriations for GWOT in fiscal year 2004, which they covered using various actions, including transferring funds and reducing or deferring planned peacetime spending.
• DOD did not explicitly take into account the GWOT funds provided through its annual appropriation when considering funding for GWOT, which may create spending pressures in fiscal year 2005 and later.

Both agencies use the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system to ensure the safety of food products processed in the United States.
- The food-processing sector is the middle segment of the farm-to-table continuum, and FDA and FSIS inspect food facilities to verify that they are implementing their HACCP plans. In fiscal year 1999, FDA, FSIS, and the states spent a total of about $1.3 billion on food safety activities.
- Following the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government intensified its efforts to address the potential for deliberate contamination of agriculture and food products. The Congress provided FDA and USDA with emergency funding to prevent, prepare for, and respond to potential bioterrorist attacks.
- FDA has used the emergency funds to enhance the security of imported food, while FSIS has used its emergency funds to support its food security activities, such as providing educational and specialized training.
- Both FDA and FSIS have taken many actions to better protect the food supply against deliberate contamination, such as hiring new inspectors, participating in emergency response exercises, and working with the CDC to initiate a nationwide Laboratory Response Network for foods.

• The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes and to provide services to reunite families.
• If reunification is not possible, the state must find permanent placement for the child outside the family home, with options including reuniting the child with their family, adoption, or long-term foster care.
• Twenty-six states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing to less than the federally allowed 18 months.

• Transit-oriented development (TOD) is generally defined as compact, mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods located near transit, typically within a half-mile radius of a transit station. TODs can vary in size and scope and can be found in urban and suburban areas.

• TODs can provide increased access to employment, educational, and cultural opportunities by promoting transportation options and reducing road congestion. A variety of stakeholders, including local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, local governments, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts, play important roles in the planning and implementation of TODs.

• The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD, but it does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, the FTA has been expanding its role in TOD in recent years through funding research, coordinating with other federal agencies, implementing a transit-oriented development planning pilot program, and providing funding for the Capital Investment Grant program.

• FTA evaluates proposed TOD projects for New Starts funding based on several criteria, including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, cost-effectiveness, economic development, and land use. Two of these criteria, economic development and land use, require documentation related to whether current and future land use is supportive of transit.

• The amount of TOD realized and the factors that support or hinder TOD can vary depending on local conditions, such as real estate market conditions, development patterns, and acceptance for dense, urban living. FTA evaluations of TOD projects are based on a snapshot of a specific moment in time and may not necessarily be predictive of future economic or political cycles.

• The case studies provided in the source document suggest that TOD can lead to increased transit ridership and economic development, but the extent to which TOD is realized and the factors that support or hinder TOD can vary depending on local conditions.

• The Information Quality Act (IQA) is a law that requires federal agencies to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, that they disseminate. It consists of two major elements: the development of guidelines by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the establishment of administrative mechanisms by federal agencies for affected persons to seek correction of information.

• IQA builds on previous efforts to improve the quality of information, such as OMB Circular A-130 and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. It requires agencies to manage their information resources to improve the integrity, quality, and utility of information to all users within and outside an agency.

• OIRA, a division of OMB, is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of government-wide policies in the areas of information technology, privacy, and statistics. It helped agencies meet the act's requirement that they develop their own guidelines and considered IQA a continuation of the executive branch's focus on improving the quality of information.

• OMB set up a framework for agencies to follow in implementing IQA and provided assistance and direction to agencies in developing agency IQA guidelines. However, not all independent agencies' Web sites had IQA information, and OIRA concentrated its communication and outreach efforts on cabinet-level and regulatory agencies.

- Both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and invest them in the economy.
- Banks use deposits to make loans or invest in debt securities, while mutual funds invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks.
- The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with companies increasingly turning to securities markets for their financial needs.
- Securitization, the process of converting bank loans into marketable securities, has further diminished the importance of bank loans as a source of finance.
- The growth of mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, with sizable amounts of money being attracted away from deposits and into mutual funds.
- The total net flows into mutual funds from all sources during 1990 through 1994 were $1,067 billion, but the impact on deposits was probably less than this amount.
- The decline in the deposit-to-GDP ratio in the early 1990s, which coincided with a rise in the mutual funds-to-GDP ratio, suggests a substitution of money into mutual funds rather than bank deposits.
- The shift of funds from deposits into mutual funds has been driven by historically low interest rates on bank deposits and the expected risk-adjusted returns on mutual fund investments.
- The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds should have little if any effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy.
- The impact of mutual funds on deposits is difficult to quantify, but a reasonable estimate is that it was sizable but probably less than $700 billion during the period 1990 through 1994.

- The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to provide flood insurance and reduce the federal government's costs for repairing flood damage after disasters. It is overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
- NFIP has mapped flood risks across the country, assigning flood zone designations based on risk levels, and offers two types of flood insurance premiums: subsidized and full risk. The subsidized premium rates apply to about 22% of all NFIP policies.
- Since NFIP's inception, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation to strengthen the program, including the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, and the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004.
- To participate in NFIP, communities agree to enforce regulations for land use and new construction in high-risk flood zones and to adopt and enforce state and community floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood damage. Currently, more than 20,000 communities participate in NFIP.
- Despite efforts to reduce the long-term risk of flood damage to buildings and other structures insured by NFIP, the inventories of repetitive loss properties and policies with subsidized premium rates have continued to grow.
- Increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss, including the risk of catastrophic loss, would generally result in premium rates that more fully reflected the actual risk of loss, decrease costs for taxpayers, and encourage private market participation.
- A variety of actions could be taken to mitigate the disadvantages of increasing premium rates, such as phasing out subsidized rates over time or not transferring them with the property when it is sold, and offering targeted assistance to those most in need to help them pay increased NFIP premiums.

OCIE examines mutual funds to evaluate compliance with federal securities laws, determine if they are operating in accordance with disclosures made to investors, and assess the effectiveness of their compliance control systems.

• The SEC regulates mutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Investment Company Act imposes requirements on the operation and structure of mutual funds, and its core objectives include ensuring adequate and accurate information about mutual funds, protecting the integrity of fund assets, prohibiting abusive forms of self-dealing, and preventing inequitable or unfair valuation of investor purchases and redemptions.

• The SEC has made significant changes to its traditional examination approach for mutual funds, focusing on targeted examinations of specific risks and monitoring larger funds on a continuous basis. This revised approach offers the potential for more quickly identifying emerging risks and understanding the operations of large and complex funds, but it also involves tradeoffs that raise regulatory challenges, such as limited capacity to examine lower risk advisers and funds within a reasonable time period.

• Routine examinations of mutual fund complexes have historically served as the cornerstone of SEC's mutual fund oversight, accounting for 85 percent of the total fund examinations from 1998 through 2003. However, due to resource constraints, SEC examinations typically focused on discrete areas that staff viewed as representing the highest risks of presenting compliance problems that could harm investors.

- Medicare uses health insurers to process and pay claims, which was intended to win acceptance from providers when the program was created.
* However, the number of health insurers willing to serve as Medicare contractors has declined, and the potential for using new types of business entities has increased due to advancements in information technology.
* Medicare's contracting process is authorized by the Social Security Act and differs from most federal programs, with no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts.
* Intermediaries are selected through a nomination process by provider associations, while carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers.
* Medicare could benefit from contracting reforms, such as directly choosing contractors on a competitive basis, allowing contractors to specialize in specific functions, and paying contractors based on performance.
* The agency has repeatedly submitted legislative proposals to repeal the provider nomination authority and make explicit its authority to contract for claims administration with entities other than health insurers.
* Allowing Medicare to have separate contractors for specific claims administration activities, also called functional contracting, could further improve program management.

* DSB's first report focused on outsourcing and privatization issues, while the second report, incorporating findings from the first, had a broader scope that included other methods for reducing infrastructure costs.
* DSB concluded that DOD could realize 30-40% savings in logistics costs and achieve broad improvements in service delivery and responsiveness by outsourcing support services.
* An aggressive DOD outsourcing initiative could generate savings ranging from $7 billion to $12 billion annually by fiscal year 2002.
* DSB's second task force report provided a new vision where DOD would only provide warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy- and decision-making, and oversight activities, with all other activities done by the private sector.
* DOD would need to make an investment of about $6 billion but would ultimately save about $30 billion annually by the year 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions.

• FSA cannot be assured that millions of dollars in farm program payments it made to thousands of deceased individuals from fiscal years 1999 through 2005 were proper because it does not have appropriate management controls.
• GAO recommended that USDA conduct all required annual estate eligibility determinations, implement management controls to verify that an individual receiving program payments has not died, and determine if improper payments have been made to deceased individuals or to entities that failed to disclose the death of a member, and if so, recover the appropriate amounts. USDA agreed with these recommendations.

- The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for managing the retirement program for federal employees, and it uses two defined benefit retirement plans to provide benefits to eligible employees. However, OPM has identified several factors that limit its ability to process retirement benefits in an efficient and timely manner, including paper-based and manually intensive processes, outdated information systems, limited customer service capabilities, and difficulties attracting qualified personnel to operate and maintain the antiquated retirement systems.
* OPM has recognized the need to automate and modernize its retirement processing since the late 1980s and has initiated several modernization initiatives, including the FERS Automated Processing System (FAPS) and the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program. However, these initiatives have faced significant challenges, including a lack of strategic planning, improperly managed requirements, and no clear accountability for decision making and oversight.
* In 2006, OPM awarded contracts to Hewitt Associates, Accenture Ltd., and Northrop Grumman Corporation to modernize its retirement processing system. The new system, called RetireEZ, was intended to provide prompt and complete benefit payments, automated processes, and self-service tools for active and retired federal employees. However, the deployment of RetireEZ was suspended in 2008 due to system quality issues, and the contract was terminated in October of that year.

- Tobacco is a high-value, pesticide-intensive crop that ranks sixth in terms of the amount of pesticide applied per acre. Most tobacco is grown in Kentucky and North Carolina, and is used to manufacture cigarettes. Pesticides play a significant role in increasing tobacco production, but exposure to pesticides can harm humans. The potential for harm is related to both the amount of a substance a person is exposed to and the toxicity of the chemical.
- The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for registering pesticides and ensuring that they do not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. EPA uses risk assessment to evaluate the potential health impacts of a pesticide and determine what measures are needed to mitigate identified risks. In 1988, FIFRA was amended to require EPA to review pesticides initially registered prior to November 1984 to consider their health effects and to determine whether and how they might continue to be registered.
- Most of the pesticides used on tobacco during the 1990s were initially approved before 1984 and therefore are subject to reregistration. The FQPA amendments to FIFRA passed in 1996 require EPA to reevaluate the amounts of pesticide residues allowed on or in food and to ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from all pesticide exposures from food and nonfood uses for which there is reliable information. EPA must also ensure that there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result to children specifically from ""aggregate"" exposure to a single pesticide and consider available information concerning the cumulative effects on children of pesticides that act in a similar harmful way.
- During the 1990s, tobacco producers in the United States commonly used 37 of the pesticides approved by EPA for such use. Most of the pesticides used on tobacco were insecticides and herbicides, which control insect and plant pests. The actual number and amount of pesticides used on tobacco or other crops in any given year vary depending on factors such as the weather and the specific pests that become problematic.

• The EPA has set standards for six principal pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, and lead.
• The 1977 amendments to the act set new goals and deadlines for attaining the standards, and the 1990 amendments encouraged the use of market-based approaches to reduce emissions, such as cap-and-trade programs.
• The major provisions of the 1990 amendments are contained in the first six titles, and this report addresses EPA’s actions related to Titles I, III, and IV.
• Title I establishes a detailed and graduated program for the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards.
• Title III expands and modifies regulations of hazardous air pollutant emissions and establishes a list of 189 hazardous air pollutants to be regulated.
• Title IV establishes the acid deposition control program to reduce the adverse effects of acid rain by reducing the annual emissions of pollutants that contribute to it.
• The Clean Air Act is a federal law, but states and local governments are responsible for carrying out certain portions of the statute, such as developing implementation plans to achieve and maintain compliance with the national standards set by the EPA.
• The EPA has identified 452 actions required to meet the objectives of Titles I, III, and IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, with about half of them included under Title III and the largest number of requirements with statutory deadlines.

• East Asian nations, including China, Japan, and South Korea, have had exchange rate policies that have caused tension with the United States. Some argue these policies are instances of ""currency manipulation"" and violate international agreements.

• The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the Department of the Treasury to analyze the exchange rate policies of major trading partners. In its most recent report, it found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for being labeled a currency manipulator. However, China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan were placed on a ""Monitoring List.""

• There are various types of exchange rate policies that countries can adopt, ranging from a ""free float"" where the value of a currency is determined by market forces, to a ""pegged"" exchange rate where a country fixes the value of its currency to another currency or a basket of currencies. Many East Asian governments have chosen a ""managed float"" policy, which allows for some flexibility while also giving governments more control.

• A ""free float"" policy has advantages, such as allowing a country more autonomy with its domestic monetary policy, but it also has disadvantages, such as greater exchange-rate risk and potential instability. A ""pegged"" exchange rate policy eliminates exchange-rate risk but can lead to a loss of autonomy in domestic monetary policy and potential vulnerability to speculative attacks.

• The United States has required biannual reports on the exchange rate policies of foreign countries since the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 expanded these reporting requirements.

• The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (MLLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas deposits and onshore public domain lands containing oil and gas deposits, with the federal government retaining title to the lands. This leasing authority applies to National Forest System (NFS) lands that are reserved from the public domain and most reserved subsurface mineral estates.
• The Secretary of the Interior cannot issue any lease for National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain if the Secretary of Agriculture objects. The U.S. Forest Service has issued separate regulations governing certain aspects of leasing and permitting for oil and gas development on lands within its jurisdiction.
• The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop and revise land use plans (RMPs) for public lands managed by BLM, which serve as the initial determinant of which lands may be subject to leasing. All activities performed on these lands must be consistent with the RMPs.
• The Forest Service also manages its lands under multiple use and sustained yield policies, and develops land management plans for NFS lands by considering the desired conditions, objectives, suitability of areas for various uses, and other criteria.
• The MLLA authorizes both competitive and noncompetitive leasing procedures. Competitive bidding must be held on a quarterly basis in each state where public lands are available for leasing, and the Secretary may also authorize additional opportunities for bidding if he considers them to be necessary.
• General restrictions on leasing include limitations on who can lease (U.S. citizens, associations of U.S. citizens, corporations organized under U.S. laws or the laws of any State, and municipalities) and how much land they can lease (no entity is permitted to own or control oil or gas leases in excess of 246,080 acres in any one State other than Alaska).

• The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed multiple times throughout history, with some legislative changes attempting to reestablish symmetry between the two. Under current law, asymmetries remain, such as the deductibility of net long-term losses against net short-term gains without limit, and the different tax rates for ordinary income, short-term gains, and long-term gains. The loss limitation was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from minimizing their income taxes by altering the timing of the realization of gains and losses.

• Increasing the net capital loss limitation to soften the impact of the stock market downturn on some investors may increase the dichotomy between the tax treatment of gains and losses. The cost to the taxpayer of forgoing the full loss in the current year is the interest that would have been earned on the additional tax reduction that would have been realized had there been no excess loss limitation. The current system, even without indexing the $3,000 loss for inflation, is more generous than the system that existed in 1978.

* The United States has deep-seated interests in Southeast Asia, including maritime security, the promotion of democracy and human rights, the encouragement of liberal trade and investment regimes, counterterrorism, and the combating of illegal trafficking of narcotics and human trafficking.
* Engagement with ASEAN has presented the United States with a foreign policy dilemma, as some analysts believe the region has become an important site of ""soft power"" rivalry between the United States and China.
* Despite considerable U.S. security, economic, and foreign assistance initiatives in the region, particularly at the bilateral level, in recent years a perception has developed among Southeast Asian elites that the United States has placed relatively little priority on ASEAN itself and has, thereby, demonstrated a lack of commitment to Southeast Asia as a whole.
* The United States has long had close bilateral relations with many of Southeast Asia's nations, but symbolic commitment is particularly important in a region that places a heavy emphasis on process and informal networking.

• The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax calculation with a broader base than the regular tax, including certain business provisions and itemized deductions, but excluding benefits like lower capital gains tax rates and home mortgage interest deductions. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, causing an increase in the number of taxpayers subject to it.

• The AMT covered 1.0% of tax returns in 1987, but due to inflation and the elimination of the capital gains deduction, it covered 6.0% of tax returns in 1999 and is projected to cover 6.3% in 2009. The AMT would also limit tax credits, such as the child credit and education credits, affecting a larger portion of returns with tax liability.

• The AMT shift from the very highest income classes to the middle and upper middle income classes is dramatic over time, with almost half of AMT taxpayers falling into the 1.6% of tax-filers with adjusted income over $200,000 in 1998, and less than 15% having incomes over $200,000 in 2008.

• The cost of correcting the AMT is significant, with indexing AMT exemptions costing $13.9 billion by 2008, eliminating the credit limit provision costing many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009, and eliminating the credit limit provision and adding standard deductions costing $26 billion by 2009 and $96 billion for the period 1999-2009.

• Tax cuts, such as those in H.R. 1836, can increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families, particularly for joint returns due to progressive tax rates and larger dependents.

The majority of DOT's budget is in the form of contract authority, while most of HUD's programs are designed to address housing problems faced by low-income households or those with special needs.

• The THUD appropriations bill is divided into four titles: Title I funds DOT, Title II funds HUD, Title III funds a collection of transportation and housing-related agencies, and Title IV sets out general provisions applicable to the bill. Most of the programs and activities in the bill are funded through regular annual appropriations, also referred to as discretionary appropriations.

• The President's FY2018 budget requested $106.65 billion for the programs in the THUD bill, a reduction of $9.7 billion from the FY2017 level. The House-passed bill would provide $115.3 billion, and the Senate-reported bill recommended $119.1 billion, representing reductions of roughly 3% and an increase of just over 2% in real funding, respectively, compared to FY2017.

• The source discusses the debate over import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs) in the US, which are derived from raw milk and used in various food products, animal feed, and industrial products. Currently, US imports of MPCs have limited or no trade restrictions while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas. Advocates argue that stricter import controls on MPCs would encourage the use of domestically produced protein and raise milk prices for dairy farmers, while opponents argue that it would increase their costs and result in higher retail food prices. Major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the US market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new US restrictions on MPC imports.

• The US produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates, and the federal dairy policies, particularly the Dairy Product Price Support program, have encouraged the production of nonfat dry milk (NDM) at the expense of milk protein concentrate or casein. U.S. imports of dairy products, including MPCs and casein/caseinates, represented 35% of total import value in 2008. Dairy imports are modest relative to domestic production, but constraints on dairy product imports are needed to maintain the integrity of the domestic dairy program. The US dairy program supports prices of dairy products and pays farmers subsidies when milk prices decline below certain levels.

* The bill requires individuals to maintain health insurance and imposes a tax on certain employers with more than 50 employees who do not provide insurance. Market reforms include modified community rating, guaranteed issue and renewal, and are linked to essential health benefits coverage.
* Qualifying coverage includes QHBPs offered in or out of an exchange, new group or individual coverage that meets or exceeds minimum health benefits, grandfathered employment-based plans, grandfathered nongroup plans, and other coverage such as Medicare and Medicaid.
* Exchanges would provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to private plans in a comparable way, and certain individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level could qualify for credits toward their premium costs and subsidies towards their cost-sharing.
* States would be provided flexibility to establish basic plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid, and existing plans offered by employers and in the individual market would be grandfathered.
* New plans could be sold in both the individual and group market outside of an exchange, but only those new plans that meet the minimum requirements specified in the bill would satisfy the requirements for individuals and employers.
* Title VI includes a number of provisions to raise revenues to pay for expanded health insurance coverage, including excise taxes and annual fees on health insurers, limitations on executive compensation of insurance companies, and limitations on contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
* The bill would alter how current private health insurance markets function, primarily for individuals who purchase coverage directly from an insurer or through a small employer, and would require insurers to not exclude potential enrollees or charge them premiums based on pre-existing health conditions.
* The removal of one provision from the bill could be deleterious to the implementation of the others, and the provisions are interrelated and interdependent.

• The campus-based programs were among the first of the federally funded student aid programs, each designed to increase access to higher education for students who demonstrated financial need.
• The Federal Perkins Loan program, the oldest of the campus-based aid programs, was originally enacted under Title II of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 and authorized participating IHEs to award low-interest rate loans to students with financial need.
• The FWS program was originally authorized as the College Work Study program under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to stimulate and promote the part-time employment of students in institutions of higher education who are from low-income families.
• The FSEOG program, authorized as the Education Opportunity Grants under the HEA, was extended and renamed as the FSEOG program in 1972 to serve as a supplement to the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant program.

* Deductions from the gross estate include estate administration expenses, certain debts and losses, the amount of qualified transfers to a surviving spouse, charitable bequests, and state death taxes.
* The federal gift tax is a tax imposed on an annual basis on all gratuitous transfers of property made during life, and the taxable gift is determined by reducing the gross value of the gift by the available deductions and exclusions.
* The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is a flat-rate tax applied to three different transfer events: a direct skip, a taxable termination, or a taxable distribution, and is calculated based on the value of the property transferred and the inclusion ratio of the transfer.

* Border and Transportation Security (BTS) is a critical function in protecting the American people from terrorists and their weapons.
* The federal government has implemented multiple programs and policies to achieve BTS, which can be seen as a series of concentric circles or screens starting from preventive efforts launched outside the country and moving through progressively smaller circles.
* Congressional concern with terrorism and border security has been manifested through a series of commissions and legislative measures, starting in 1998 and continuing through the present day.
* The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated many federal agencies responsible for border and transportation security into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes the Directorate of BTS, the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Transportation Security Agency (TSA), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
* CBP is responsible for securing U.S. borders while facilitating the flow of people and goods, and works in tandem with the U.S. Coast Guard at sea ports of entry to prevent harmful things from entering the country.
* The U.S. maritime system consists of more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3,700 cargo and passenger terminals, and contains many potential vulnerabilities that are being addressed through various security measures.
* The U.S. government has employed a number of strategies and programs to make the nation's borders more secure, including pushing the border outwards, hardening the border, making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel, strengthening the border through more effective use of intelligence, and multiplying effectiveness through the engagement of other actors in the enforcement effort.
* Current border security policies may reflect an attempt at layering, with efforts to preempt potential attacks, prevent individuals from entering the country illegally, harden the border through the use of technology, and engage other actors such as state and local law enforcement and foreign neighbors.
* The current programs and policies in place to achieve BTS were either put into place as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks or predated the attacks, and some contend that there are still gaps in the system.

- About 27.5% of state and local government employees in the US (around 6.6 million people) do not have Social Security coverage, with considerable variation across states.
- Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory for most state and local government employees hired after July 1991 who were not already covered, with some exceptions for those with public pension plans.
- Social Security coverage for public employees is extended through ""Section 218 Agreements"" between states and the Social Security Administration, with each state having a designated State Social Security Administrator.
- Coverage under Section 218 Agreements differs by state and even by county, and once provided, it generally cannot be terminated for future employees in covered positions.
- Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all newly hired state and local government employees have been discussed for many years.
- The Bipartisan Policy Center and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform have recommended mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees, starting in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
- The Social Security Trust Funds are projected to face long-term funding shortfalls, and mandatory coverage for newly hired state and local government employees could help alleviate some of these issues.
- Opponents of mandatory coverage argue that it might not result in better benefit protections for workers, as state and local governments could reduce some pension benefits, and Congress could change Social Security contribution and benefit structures.

• The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) was established in 2004, offering supplemental dental and vision benefits to federal employees, Members of Congress, annuitants, and dependents. OPM does not review disputed claims, and enrollees are responsible for 100% of the premiums.

• Eligible individuals can enroll in FEDVIP during the standard open season for FEHB plans or following a qualifying life event. There are four nationwide dental plans, three regional plans, and three vision plans, with varying premiums based on plan, family members, and residency (for dental plans only).

• Active employees pay FEDVIP premiums on a pre-tax basis, but annuitants, survivor annuitants, or compensationers do not have this option. There are no preexisting condition exclusions, but waiting periods for orthodontia apply. Enrollees pay less out-of-pocket costs using in-network services.

• FEDVIP enrollees can choose self-only, self +1, or family plans, and are not required to enroll in both dental and vision plans. Premiums vary by plan and geographic area, and individuals can enroll in a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) to cover any qualified unmet medical expenses.

• When comparing FEDVIP plans, individuals should consider coverage in their FEHB plan, likelihood of using services covered by the plans, and placing the same dollar amount in an FSA. Under the FEDVIP program, any coverage provided by an individual's FEHB health plan is primary, and the FEDVIP plans are the secondary payers.

These programs aim to achieve forest management and protection goals, including wildfire planning and response, and developing wood products markets.

• Forestry assistance programs have been a part of USDA's initiatives for over a century, with the creation of the USDA Division of Forestry in 1881. The FS, established in 1905, has three main mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. The Senate and House Agriculture Committees oversee forestry-related programs.

• State Forest Action Plans are required for states to receive funds for most programs. These plans involve statewide assessments of forest resource conditions, identification of threats, and long-term strategies for addressing issues. The FS provides technical and financial assistance to states, who then help private landowners and eligible entities.

• Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years. Most programs are available nationally, have permanently authorized funding, and are funded through the annual discretionary appropriations process. The Administration requested $197.4 million for FY2019, a decrease from the FY2018 funding level.

* The President's FY2013 budget request sought increased funding for the doubling path accounts but included support for few COMPETES 2010 authorized STEM education programs.
* Of the new programs with defined funding authorizations in COMPETES 2010, only the Regional Innovation Program (RIP) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) was specifically included in the Administration's FY2013 budget request.
* The President's FY2013 budget request for NIST was $857.0 million, including $648.0 million for the core laboratories account and $60.0 million for the construction account.
* The President's FY2013 budget request for the NSF's Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account was $5.983 billion, with specific funding for two COMPETES 2010 programs: Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and Partnerships for Innovation (PFI).
* The President's FY2013 budget request for the DOE Office of Science was $4.992 billion, and $350.0 million for the ARPA-E account.
* The COMPETES acts aimed to double funding for the targeted accounts from their FY2006 levels by increasing funding at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. However, actual appropriations for the targeted accounts during the COMPETES 2010 authorization period slowed down, resulting in a growth rate of about 3.0% since the FY2006 baseline.

* The Lacey Act was amended in 2008 to include nonindigenous plants and violations of foreign laws pertaining to certain conservation actions and other activities involving plants and plant products.
* The 2008 amendments expanded the definition of a plant and made it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state, or any foreign law, that protects plants or that regulates taking or exporting plants and plant products in certain situations.
* The 2008 amendments also require importers of all covered plants and plant products to submit an import declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the time of importation, which includes information such as identification of the species and genus of plants or plants used in a product, and country of origin of plants.
* The primary aims of the 2008 amendments were to reduce illegal logging and to increase the value of U.S. wood exports.
* Illegal logging is a pervasive problem affecting several countries that produce, export, and import wood and wood products, with estimates of the extent of illegal logging varying between 15% and 90% of the volume of all forestry.
* The economic value of global illegal logging is estimated to be between $50 billion and $100 billion of the global wood trade, and it is a concern due to its economic implications as well as its environmental, social, and political impacts.
* The Lacey Act is administered by the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, and Agriculture through their respective agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

* The U.S. farming industry has been characterized as cyclical, with farmers often relying on federal intervention, including counter-cyclical assistance, to support commodity prices and incomes for the past 70 years. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 ended deficiency payments linked to target prices and replaced them with fixed production flexibility contract (PFC) payments. However, marketing assistance loans continued, allowing farmers to pledge their stored commodities as collateral for USDA nonrecourse commodity loans, and repaying them at lower rates when market prices are lower than the loan rate.
* The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) of 2002, which covers the 2002-2007 crop years, provides new long-term counter-cyclical support for grains and cotton, by restoring target prices and deficiency payments, similar to the program terminated by the 1996 Act. The new law brings soybeans and the minor oilseeds fully under the support program rules that apply to grains and cotton, and redesigns peanut support to operate like that for grains, oilseeds, and cotton. Under the new counter-cyclical program, the deficiency payment rate will be calculated as the difference between the target price, and the lower average season market price, but payments are based upon historical, not current, production, and farmers can plant virtually any crops except most fruits and vegetables.

North Korea escalated the security situation on the Korean peninsula through words and actions, including announcing it had nuclear weapons and suspending participation in the Six-Party Talks.
* In September, all parties agreed to a joint statement of principles, committing North Korea to abandoning its nuclear weapons and programs and returning to the NPT and IAEA safeguards. However, disagreements over North Korea's right to develop peaceful nuclear energy programs and the imposition of sanctions on a Macau bank for its alleged role in helping North Korea launder counterfeit U.S. dollars led to the stalling of the Six-Party Talks.
* Criticism of North Korea's human rights record became more prominent on the U.S. agenda in 2005, with the appointment of Jay Lefkowitz as the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea. South Korea, however, abstained from voting on resolutions condemning North Korea at the United Nations to avoid provoking Pyongyang.

- Over the past decade, protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry have improved, allowing for qualitative and quantitative proteome comparisons. However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present over wide concentration ranges. To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at either the protein or peptide level, followed by analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS. Undersampling can occur if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer.
- A study comparing the effects of two commonly used strategies, gelc-MS/MS with repetitive LC-MS/MS analysis and additional protein prefractionation, found that both strategies can increase protein identifications after different fractionation schemes. The 3-d method, which included microsol ief prior to SDS-PAGE separation, substantially improved proteome coverage compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.

• The source document is a study that compares the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy (SMUPPP) procedures. The study found that the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was significantly higher in the tonsillectomy group (5.05%) than in the SMUPPP group (1.45%).

• The study suggests that suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP and double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence. The study also recommends the routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.

* The AMRs use sulfone-substituted anhydrides, which are synthesized from benzenesulfinic acid sodium salt and various acyl chlorides.
* The AMRs yield carboxylic acid intermediates, which can be converted to methyl esters using trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSCHN2) and then desulfonylated to produce the corresponding esters.
* The carboxylic acid intermediates can also undergo decarboxylation to form sulfone lactams, which are formed as single isomers in high yields.
* The AMRs can tolerate a variety of non-enolizable aldehydes and a variety of alkylamines and anilines.
* The reaction of imine 16 with anhydride 3a followed by ring-closing metathesis provides the pyrrolizidine core of the natural product from cinnamaldehyde, allylamine, and 3a in two steps.
* The elimination of 18 yields 21, which has been converted to ( )-isoretronecanol in two steps in low yield.
* Further reduction yields lactam ester 22, which has been converted to ( )-isoretronecanol in one step.
* The AMR of sulfone-substituted anhydrides will be useful for the assembly of many heterocyclic targets, natural and otherwise.

• Acute rejection episodes are a risk factor for CAI, and a rat strain combination (F344 to Lewis) is used as an experimental model to study its pathogenesis.
• A severe but reversible acute rejection episode occurs 9 days after allogenic transplantation, characterized by mononuclear infiltration and intravascular leukocytes.
• After resolution of acute rejection, the number of intravascular leukocytes decreases but remains elevated, and a majority of these cells are monocytes displaying a unique state of activation.
• In a gene array experiment, tissue transglutaminase (TGase2, TGM2) was found to be upregulated by mononuclear leukocytes accumulating in the lumina of allograft blood vessels.
• TGM2 has diverse functions, including antigen presentation, t cell activation, NFB pathway activation, proinflammatory factor expression, leukocyte adhesion, and leukocyte migration.
• The study investigates TGM2 mRNA and protein expression by mononuclear blood leukocytes isolated from isografts and allografts and by respective renal tissue during acute rejection and after resolution, and assesses the role of early extracellular transglutaminase activity in the pathogenesis of CAI.

- Endothelial cells were grown and stimulated with plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to produce extracellular microvesicles (EMVs).
- EMVs were characterized and quantified using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- EMVs were introduced into an IV bag containing 0.9% saline and circulated through a CVVH filter for 70 minutes.
- Flow cytometric analysis was used to record EMV levels, which declined rapidly and reached a relatively constant level after 40 minutes.
- At the end of 4 hours of dialysis, 5.7% of the original EMV concentration was found in the dialysate.
- These findings suggest that CVVH can remove EMVs from a model patient's circulation, which has implications for treating acute lung injury (ALI) due to EMV-induced inflammation.
- The observed clearance of EMVs is likely a saturable phenomenon, and convection and pressure gradient forces were not modeled in this study.
- Empirical interactions with plasma oncotic elements are not expected to have a major impact on the steady state of EMVs in vivo.
- Frequent changing of the CVVH filter and more efficient and selective EMV clearance using specialized filters and convection and pressure gradients could improve the clinical utility of CVVH in ALI management.

- The residual and resistant microorganisms, including fungi like Candida albicans, are the primary reasons for failures in root canal treatments.
- Candida species have a tendency to invade dentin and can survive despite a lack of nutrients or resistance to intracanalicular treatment materials, leading to treatment failures.
- MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) is a gold standard for root-end filling materials due to its excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, antimicrobial effects, and resistance to fluid and blood contamination.
- MTA-Angelus has shown good marginal adaptation, good sealing, sealing ability in mineralized tissues with complete closure, and is inflammation-free in most cases. It also has an excellent antibacterial effect and a strong fungicidal effect against Candida albicans.
- A study was conducted to evaluate and compare the antifungal properties of fresh and set Proroot MTA and MTA-Angelus against Candida albicans at 1-, 24-, and 48-hour time points.
- The study found no significant difference in the antifungal properties of Proroot MTA and MTA-Angelus at either of the concentrations or time points (p<0.05).
- The results suggest that both Proroot MTA and MTA-Angelus are effective in eliminating Candida albicans by the 24-hour time point.

* Ipsilateral motor deficits emerge during the acute phase of stroke and persist chronically, but their causes are unclear.
* Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to differentiate ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination function on the ipsilateral side.
* Recent studies have also found kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb during specific motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination.
* Possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits include disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, or the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.
* Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have focused on motor deficits, but a new study investigated the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb.
* The study recruited 50 hemiparetic stroke patients and 40 sex- and age-matched control subjects, and conducted tracking and joint position sense tests on the hand ipsilateral to the damaged hemisphere.
* The results showed that the stroke group had a lower accuracy index in the mp joint and a higher score of reposition errors in the joint reposition test, indicating significant motor and sensory deficits.
* The study also found a significant correlation between ipsilateral sensory deficits and motor deficits, suggesting that stroke patients may have difficulty performing complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions.

- The study found that participants who newly self-reported diabetes during follow-up were significantly more likely to have reported trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours, and sleep apnea.
- Several military service characteristics, such as no deployment, enlisted pay grade, administration/supply occupation, and having separated from the military since baseline, were significantly related to the outcome of new-onset diabetes.
- Binge or problem drinking was less likely to have been reported in people reporting new-onset diabetes, and current smoking emerged as a risk factor for new-onset diabetes after adjustment.
- Screening positive for depression, panic, other anxiety disorder, and PTSD were all significantly associated with higher odds of new-onset diabetes in adjusted models.
- Sleep characteristics, including reported trouble sleeping and sleep apnea, remained significantly and independently associated with higher diabetes odds in the final model.
- A positive screen for PTSD was significantly associated with higher diabetes odds, independent of sleep characteristics and other covariates in the model.
- The study findings suggest that sleep characteristics are associated with subsequent new-onset self-reported diabetes, independent of mental health conditions known to affect sleep duration and quality.

- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects people of all ages, but its prevalence increases with age and is more common in women. The prevalence of RA in Northern Europe and North America is estimated to be 0.5-1%, while in Southern Europe, it is estimated to be 0.45-0.66%. The annual incidence of RA is also lower in Southern European countries. The economic burden of RA is significant, and it is expected to increase due to the aging population. The cost of RA varies across countries due to differences in treatment guidelines, reimbursement policies, and availability of drugs and social services.
- In Italy, the proportion of people aged 65 years or older is the highest in the European Union, and it is estimated that by 2029, 25.7% of the population in Italy will be 65 years or older. Therefore, the healthcare costs associated with age-related diseases like RA are likely to increase in Italy. The introduction of newer costly therapies may further contribute to the expected increase in the economic burden of RA in Italy.
- A review of the economic impact of RA in Italy in the past two decades found that the costs of RA before and after the introduction of biological agents were not significantly different. However, the review predicted that the future costs of RA in Italy would increase, and they would be higher than the costs in other European countries. The review also highlighted the need for accurate pharmacoeconomic analyses to guide treatment decisions and ensure effective spending without compromising the quality of care delivered.
- The studies conducted to date have indicated that the prevalence of RA in Italy is around 0.5%. The largest study on the prevalence and incidence of RA in Italy involved more than 4.5 million people and clearly indicated that both the prevalence and incidence of RA progressively increase in both men and women up to the age of 80 years. As Italy is undergoing a process of demographic transition, it is expected that RA will impose a heavy socioeconomic burden on the NHS in coming years.

* ZnO nanostructures have been popularly used in photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices due to their wide bandgap, and they can be fabricated for photovoltaic application by various approaches, including a seeding and growth two-step process in zinc salt and amide mixed solutions, which is acceptable for photovoltaics due to its low cost and good potential for scale-up.
* Experiments have shown that ZnO nanorod arrays can exhibit better antireflective properties than other oxide compounds, and a weighted global reflectance of 6.6% has been achieved in the broadband range from 400 to 1,200 nm. However, most work on ZnO nanorod arrays as antireflective layers is performed on naked silicon wafers, and the application of ZnO nanostructures in practical silicon solar cells is seldom reported.

• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, predominantly involving the interventricular septum. It can be caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with the major genes implicated including MYH7, TNNT2, MYBPC3, and others.

• TNNT2 mutations are associated with a severe form of HCM and are thought to account for approximately 15% of familial HCM. These mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle and can lead to a poor overall prognosis with a high incidence of sudden death. However, the genotype-phenotype correlation of the TNNT2 gene in Japanese familial HCM remains insufficient.

• A study of 173 Japanese patients with familial HCM identified three reported mutations and a new mutation of TNNT2 in 11 individuals from four families. The study also found that the phenotype of each family was often different from reported cases, even if they had the same genetic mutation.

• The study suggests that in Japanese familial HCM, the type of genetic mutation of TNNT2 does not seem useful in distinguishing the prognosis. However, if mutations are found, there is a risk of sudden death in youth. Therefore, regardless of the type of genetic mutation, it is important to observe patients in detail from birth in each lineage.

• Schistosomatidae is a family of digenean trematodes that have complex life cycles involving intermediate (freshwater gastropods) and definitive hosts (birds, reptiles, fishes, and mammals). Schistosoma species can live in human hosts for over 5 years. The genus Schistosoma includes several species that infect humans and cause schistosomiasis, including S. haematobium, S. intercalatum, S. japonicum, S. malayensis, S. mansoni, and S. mekongi. Other Schistosoma species infect a range of mammals such as hippopotamus, rodents, carnivores, and ruminant animals like buffalo, cattle, goat, lechwe, and sheep.

• Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating disease that is endemic in 77 countries and affects 237 million people worldwide. It is considered one of the most serious public health issues and the second most prevalent tropical disease with high morbidity. Control of schistosomiasis is based on drug treatment (praziquantel), snail control, improved sanitation, and health education. The development of powerful methods to analyze nucleic acids and proteins has expanded our understanding of schistosome biology and host-parasite interactions.

• The genomes and transcriptomes of several Schistosoma species have been sequenced, including S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni. Genome sequencing has revealed conserved features among Schistosoma species, as well as unique gene order rearrangements in some species. Comparative genomics has supported the evolutionary hypothesis of S. haematobium and S. mansoni as the most related species, followed by S. japonicum. Mitochondrial genes have been used as molecular markers for species and strain identification, as well as for phylogenetic, population genetic, biogeographic, and molecular ecology studies.

- Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare, congenital liver cysts first described by Friedrich in 1857.
- CHFCs are typically found in the left lobe of the liver, measuring 1-24 cm in diameter, and are more common in women over 50 years old.
- CHFCs have four distinct layers: pseudostratified columnar epithelium with mucus cells, sub-epithelial connective tissue, smooth muscle, and outer fibrous capsule.
- CHFCs are usually asymptomatic but can present with abdominal pain or be found incidentally on imaging studies.
- CHFCs can be differentiated from other hepatic cysts by their unique histological features, including the presence of ciliated epithelium.
- CHFCs are thought to originate from a detached hepatic diverticulum or abnormal tracheobronchial bud that migrates to the liver during embryonic development.
- CHFCs can be treated with observation, aspiration, sclerosis, or surgical excision, depending on the size, symptoms, and imaging findings.
- Minimally invasive laparoscopic excision is a safe and effective treatment option for CHFCs, especially for lesions located in the anterolateral portion of the liver.

- Osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee joint is a common cause of functional disability and reduced quality of life in older adults in India. The severity of OA can be influenced by factors such as age, height, weight, and BMI.
* Physiotherapists use a combination of self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to monitor OA rehabilitation outcomes, including pain, symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL).
* Self-reported questionnaires provide subjective information about the disease process without examiner bias, while performance-based tests objectively measure a patient's ability to perform ADL activities. Examples of self-reported questionnaires include WOMAC, SF-36, and KOOS, while physical performance tests include Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Six-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT), and Stair Climbing Test.
* Performance-based tests are affected by motivation but not by psychogenic factors such as beliefs, expectations, cognitive impairments, and cultural, lingual, and educational level. These tests measure functional limitation, while self-reported questionnaires reveal disability, which includes the social and psychological aspects of functional limitation.
* Functional limitation is often detected earlier by performance-based tests than by self-reported questionnaires. While there is no consensus on the use of these tests, ideally, both self-reported and functional tests should be used in knee rehabilitation settings.
* The present study aimed to correlate the subjectively measured KOOS questionnaire with the objectively measured 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT), age, height, weight, and BMI in patients with primary OA knee.

- Obesity is a low-level, chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy eating habits. Adipose tissue secretes pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, and a high-fat diet can promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
- Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to the loss of ovarian function, which can lead to adverse changes in lipoprotein profiles, glucose and insulin metabolism, distribution of body fat, clotting, and vascular endothelium. These changes, combined with weight gain, can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases in women.
- A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a high-fat diet and ovariectomy on the inflammatory process in rats. The results showed that administration of a hyperlipidic diet combined with short-term ovariectomy promoted an increase in body weight gain and a decrease in metabolic efficiency, accompanied by hyperleptinemia. Levels of all cytokines analyzed were decreased in mes adipose tissues.
- The study also found that ovariectomy in rats fed a hyperlipidic diet caused hyperleptinemia and increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content. These changes, in combination with long-term ovariectomy, may contribute to the induction of proinflammatory processes, particularly those associated with a high-fat diet.

It highlights the conflicting results in the literature regarding the relationship between H. pylori and CD, as well as the lack of extensive characterization of the lymphocytic populations infiltrating the gastric mucosa in CD and H. pylori infected children.

• The study included 40 patients divided into four groups: normal controls, patients with new active CD without H. pylori infection, celiac negative patients infected by H. pylori, and new active CD patients infected by H. pylori. The diagnosis of CD was based on histological findings and positive serology for CD, while H. pylori status was assessed according to conventional biopsy-based criteria plus positive urease test. The study aimed to define the immunophenotype of the gastric mucosa of the two most prevalent etiologies of pediatric LG (CD and H. pylori infection) and to demonstrate a unique histopathology profile of LG by immunohistochemistry staining.

• The study found that increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were observed in CD and H. pylori gastritis patients compared to patients without LG. The highest proportion of LG (50%) was found in CD patients without H. pylori infection, followed by patients with CD infected by H. pylori (20%). The distribution and total number of lymphoid aggregates in the antrum were highest in patients infected with H. pylori, regardless of CD status. The mean number of CD3+ and CD8+ IELs was increased significantly in CD patients with or without H. pylori infection compared to controls.

• The study suggests that in undefined cases of CD, the number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum might hint toward the diagnosis of CD rather than H. pylori infection, and the number of lymphoid follicles directs toward the diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by defects in various enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). This can lead to signs and symptoms of androgen excess, including ambiguous genitalia in females and rapid growth with accelerated skeletal maturation in both sexes.

• Medical treatment for CAH typically consists of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. However, recent reports have revealed a high prevalence of small adrenal tumors in patients with untreated 21-OHD CAH. Two of the four cases described in the text were managed with adrenalectomy due to increasing adrenal mass size and virilization.

• The pathogenesis of adrenal tumor in patients with 21-OHD CAH is thought to be related to a consequence of ACTH hypersecretion, which results from the lack of glucocorticoid synthesis. Chronic poor compliance to therapy appears to be associated with the development of the tumor. Therefore, patients with 21-OHD CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumor, improve its symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorder.

• The development of adrenal adenoma or carcinoma in patients with CAH is rare, but the incidence of adrenal masses appears to be higher in CAH patients and in heterozygotes than in the general population. Follow-up imaging may help to discover the appearance of adrenal tumor in patients with long-term management of 21-OHD CAH.

The American Urological Association recognizes Dx/HA injection as an option in VUR management.

• The success rate of Dx/HA injection varies between 75% and 89%, with unpublished data from the institution showing an overall radiographic success rate of 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection. Due to the possibility of remaining VUR after Dx/HA injection, voiding cystograms are performed 2 months post-surgery. Positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography has higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystogram and can detect occult VUR.

• The source document also discusses a study comparing two different PIC techniques and their usefulness in detecting de novo contralateral VUR in the case of preoperative unilateral VUR and predicting successful surgical outcomes. The study found no statistically significant difference between the two PIC techniques in detecting de novo VUR, and the success rate of 75% for patients and 80% for renal units could not be improved.

* The study found that different smear layer removal methods from root canal dentin affect the bond strength of a fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin. The higher bond strength results were obtained for the helbo theralite laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups.
* The smear layer produced by post space preparation should be removed for increased antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness. However, some authors insist on retaining the smear layer for better adaptation of materials to the root surface. The photodynamic diode laser group showed a higher bond strength than the other groups, except for the 37% orthophosphoric acid group, without removing the smear layer.
* The study suggests that modifying the smear layer may be more effective when using a self-adhesive system. Naocl (5.25%) and naci (0.9%) were not effective in removing the smear layer when used as a final irrigation. Orthophosphoric acid (37%) and edta (17%) were more effective methods in removing the smear layer than naocl, naci irrigants, and helbo theralite laser. However, helbo theralite laser and orthophosphoric acid were more effective at the cement-dentin interface than edta for bond strength of self-adhesive cements.

- Concerted efforts to identify, describe, and quantify the bacterial communities of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract have been made, with a focus on characterizing the microbial communities in various sites of the human body and looking for correlations between changes in the microbiome and prevalence of diseases.
- The human microbiome project in the USA and the metagenomics of the human intestinal tract (MetaHIT) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives that aim to characterize the microbial communities inhabiting multiple sites in the human body.
- Collaborations to investigate if there is a common core of bacterial species shared among all or the majority of human beings have also been initiated, resulting in the discovery of a common core of bacterial species in the human gut.
- The composition of the bacterial flora seems to strongly depend on the main nutritional source, separating bacterial profiles of omnivores, carnivores, and herbivores.
- The human gut flora belongs mainly to only two phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Archaea, mostly represented by the methanogenic Methanobrevibacter smithii, have also been discovered in the human gut.
- The composition of the bacterial flora seems to strongly depend on the environment and the maternal input during delivery and upon breast feeding.
- Recent high throughput studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities, including the discovery of a common bacterial core shared by all or at least a majority of humans.
- The minimal gut microbiome and minimal gut metagenome are not mutually exclusive, and there are many genes that will belong to both groups, being necessary both for the survival of the bacterium as well as for gut function.
- The human gut flora has recently been classified as belonging to one of three different clusters termed enterotypes, which give rise to enterotype-specific effects and likely also harbor common essential functions that may then facilitate bacterial survival in the gut.

- Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nail, characterized by nail discoloration, thickening, and defect. The most common agents of onychomycosis are dermatophytes such as trichophyton rubrum and trichophyton mentagrophytes, accounting for 50%-90% of cases. If left untreated, nail fungal infections can cause further complications, especially in at-risk patients.
* The study reports the therapeutic efficacy of tazarotene 0.1% gel for the topical treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis. Mycological cure was observed in subungual samples collected at the first follow-up visit in 40% of patients, and complete cure with complete clinical healing in all patients was observed at the end point.
* The study also documents the inhibition of fungal growth with tazarotene solution in vitro. The disk diffusion assay showed the inhibition of t. mentagrophytes growth, starting with 2 ml of tazarotene solution, and the reduced growth of c. albicans starting with 1 ml of tazarotene solution.
* The study reports that tazarotene has proven quite effective in reducing hyperkeratinization in fungus-infected nails. The synthetic third-generation retinoid has proved to be beneficial in modulating keratinocyte proliferation and in reducing inflammation.
* The study suggests that tazarotene could be useful in those patients with treatment-resistant forms of onychomycosis or in those with evident enhanced nail thickening, wherein the therapeutic reducing action of the retinoid can be providential. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy in terms of relapse and reinfection.

• The study examines the effects of NDGA (nordihydroguaiaretic acid) on the lifespan, weight, and food consumption of mice and drosophila. The mice were fed NDGA in their food at different concentrations, and the drosophila were treated with NDGA in their medium. The study found that NDGA consumption extended murine and drosophila lifespan, but it was also associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis. The drug increased the lifespan of drosophila, suggesting that its target(s) and mechanism(s) of action may be phylogenetically conserved. However, aspects of the response in flies were unlike those in mice, with no apparent effect on energy uptake or utilization in flies. The study also found that 3.5g/kg diet (373 mg ndga / kg bw / d) extended lifespan in mice, but higher and lower dosages were ineffective.

• The study found that NDGA consumption was associated with an increased incidence of liver, lung, and thymus tumors, and increased hemorrhagic diathesis in mice. However, there was little evidence for acute liver or kidney toxicity as measured by serum chemistries. The study also notes that others have reported that treatment of mice with high concentrations of NDGA produced serious pathologies, including stunted growth and inflammatory cecal lesions in rats. In humans, continuous oral dosing at up to 2.5g / d (~31mg / kg bw / d) was tolerated, except for the development of elevated ast or alt (transaminitis) in some patients.

- Myosin VA (MyoVA) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
- MyoVA is composed of a pair of motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain.
- MyoVA's movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms for processive motion.
- Calcium is required for MyoVA's ATPase activity, but high calcium reduces processivity and may cause one or more calmodulins to dissociate from the lever arm.
- Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVA motors and their subdomains.
- MyoVA must have sufficient structural flexibility to maneuver through actin intersections and switch actin tracks.
- The structural domains critical to MyoVA's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction.
- The flexural stiffness of MyoVA subdomains was defined by TPM, allowing for the analysis of the motor's structural components and their impact on functional capacities.
- The lever arms must be rigid enough for proper gating and control of the motor's processivity, while the lever arm/rod junction must have sufficient flexibility for intracellular cargo transport and delivery.

Higher plasma vaspin concentrations are found in men with the metabolic syndrome and in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, serum vaspin levels were lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic individuals. In patients with renal insufficiency (RI), serum vaspin levels showed no significant difference between those with and without diabetes.
* Adiponectin, a fat-derived hormone, is associated with obesity-linked diseases and has antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and antiproliferative effects. Plasma adiponectin levels are reduced in obese humans, particularly those with visceral obesity. In patients with RI, lower BMI may lead to higher adiponectin levels, but in diabetic patients, there is no difference in adiponectin levels between those with and without RI.
* Multiple regression analyses showed that HbA1c levels were independently and significantly associated with vaspin concentration in all subjects. The level of creatinine clearance (CrCL) was found to be independently and significantly associated with adiponectin concentration in all subjects.
* Sex differences were observed in serum vaspin and adiponectin levels, with higher levels found in women than in men. The study also found that the serum vaspin level was lower in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic individuals, which contradicts previous studies. This discrepancy may be due to sex differences and variations in diabetic patients with vascular complications between the two populations.

• A total of 190 ulcers were included in the analyses, and patients received intralesional injections of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (RHEGF) or a placebo.
• The main efficacy variable was granulation tissue development, with a median time to complete closure of 15 weeks.
• Surrogate markers of complete healing were generated, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT).
• The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals.
• Cutoff points were generated to maximize both sensitivity and specificity, and the candidate surrogates were then codified and assessed for their association with the final outcome (complete ulcer closure).
• The product coefficient (PC) was used to quantify the contribution of the surrogate on ulcer closure.
• The association with some baseline influencing factors between healing and candidate surrogate variables was estimated using binary logistic regression.
• The most efficient predictor of healing was the granulation tissue covering > 75% of the ulcer area at the EOT, with 79.5% correct classification and a high negative predictive value (93.5%).

- The global population is aging, and this trend is expected to continue, with aging being a decreased ability to resist cellular stresses or insults. Aging is a major cardiovascular risk factor, predisposing individuals to conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.
* The endothelium, which forms a monolayer lining blood vessels, has a primary role in adjusting vascular function. Alterations in the control of endothelial processes often lead to atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders. Endothelial dysfunction is defined as functional alterations in endothelial physiology, characterized by a reduction of vasodilator substance output and augmentation in endothelium-derived contracting factors.
* Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production of oxidizing agents and opposing antioxidant systems, interferes with endothelial function by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. This reduction is due to the rapid inactivation of NO by superoxide anions produced in the aging vascular wall. Oxidative stress also causes alterations in biomolecules, DNA breakage, and decreased NO bioavailability, leading to impaired relaxation and inhibition of the antiproliferative effects of NO.
* Exercise has been shown to improve endothelial function, and vitamin C can restore the impaired vasodilatory response to acetylcholine in older subjects with oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction. Antioxidant defense mechanisms attenuate during the aging process, making older individuals more susceptible to free radical-induced damage.
* Aging increases the levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP), which activate the nuclear factor-B (NF-B) pathway, a critical component of inflammatory processes. NF-B induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes, creating a vicious cycle of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

These enzymes were found to be efficient catalysts in the phosphorylation of various alcohols, while other enzymes such as phytase and aphast were not. The substrate scope of these enzymes was also investigated, and it was found that they could phosphorylate primary and secondary mono and dihydroxy compounds, as well as cyclic substrates.
- The text also discusses the importance of controlling the reaction conditions, such as pH and the type of oligophosphate donor, to ensure optimal product titers and to minimize product depletion by hydrolysis. It was found that using tri and polyphosphate as alternative donors to ppi could significantly increase the amount of product formed, and that the enzyme phonsf generally delivered the highest product titers with primary alcohols as acceptors.

• Non-native biological invasions have caused significant harm to ecosystems for centuries, such as the Phylloxera destroying grapevines in Europe and chestnut blight in North America.
• Charles Elton's book on invasions in 1957 did not spark widespread research or policy response, but an international project in the mid-1980s led to increased research on the topic.
• Research has shown that non-native invaders can affect ecosystems at the population, community, and ecosystem levels, causing changes in nutrient cycles and other processes.
• Molecular genetic research has revealed that hybridization and introgression between native and non-native species is more common than previously thought, leading to evolutionary changes in native species.
• Introduced species can also facilitate the establishment or impact of other non-native species, leading to ""invasional meltdown.""
• Critics of invasion biology argue that the problem is overblown, that introduced species can increase native biodiversity, and that the antipathy toward introduced species is xenophobic.
• However, many introduced species do cause harm, and it is not possible to determine the impact of all non-native species due to a lack of research.
• Ecosystem impacts of non-native species can be subtle and take time to manifest, making it important to act before an impact is evident.
• Risk assessment tools have been developed to prevent some planned introductions and prioritize eradication or containment efforts for recently introduced species.
• Biosecurity measures, early detection, and rapid response can be effective in preventing or mitigating the impacts of non-native species, and eradication efforts have been successful in some cases.

- Posterior transpedicular pedicle screw fixation is commonly used for managing unstable spines, often caused by trauma or burst fractures.
* Transpedicular short-segment fixation, using pedicle screws one vertebra above and below the fracture, is beneficial for correcting kyphotic deformity, providing stability, and enabling early mobilization.
* However, this approach can lead to loss of reduction and instrumentation failure in some cases.
* Adding pedicle screws (intermediate screws) at the fractured vertebra can improve the biomechanical stability of the construct.
* A calf experimental model was used to compare the stiffness of short-segment pedicle fixation with either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws placed at the level of the fracture.
* The study found that the addition of intermediate screws provided a smaller range of motion (ROM) in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion for both mps and pps groups, indicating enhanced stability.
* The short-segment transpedicular fixation group with intermediate screws had significantly increased stiffness compared to the intact spine in both mpsi and ppsi groups.

- The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
- ESA bypasses the high-temperature sintering needed for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, allowing the use of conductive plastic substrates.
- ZnO structures have been used for the construction of photoanodes using ESA, with minor additions of water-soluble dye molecules impacting crystal growth and crystallographic orientation.
- Porous crystal ZnO thin films have been prepared using ESA, resulting in large surface area and high crystallinity, suitable for efficient electron transport and high incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of around 90%.
- The development of a compatible system for fabricating sensitized photocathodes is of interest for DSSC applications.
- A porous p-NiO electrode sensitized with a specially designed dye has achieved 1.3% conversion efficiency in an inverted DSSC structure.
- The electrodeposition of CuSCN, a p-type, wide-bandgap semiconductor, into highly crystallized thin films at low temperature is being explored as a counterpart to ZnO-based hybrid systems.
- Dyes with soft Lewis basic ncs groups have been added to the bath for electrodeposition of CuSCN, resulting in colored thin films with nanostructures indicative of their action as structure-directing agents.
- Rhodamine B (RB), a cationic dye, has also been employed as a structure-directing agent for CuSCN electrodeposition, showing positive results in terms of nanostructure formation and crystallographic orientation changes.
- The recent progress in photocathodic DSSCs presents an opportunity to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized cathode systems, which can eventually be combined with existing sensitized anodes for realization of a tandem solar cell to achieve high efficiencies in very simple structures.

- Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose, which is induced by both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.
- The complications of T2D, such as cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and blindness, always bring a heavy burden to society.
- The latest studies from the International Diabetes Federation reported that currently, there were 366 million people with diabetes in the world, and this number is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030 if no action is taken.
- Some 90% of patients with diabetes have T2D, which is always a result of a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.
- Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC-1) gene is a multifunctional regulatory factor involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis, fatty acids oxidation, beta-cell insulin secretion, hepatic gluconeogenesis, glucose transport in muscle.
- The associations of PGC-1 loci with T2D were found in different populations.
- ESRRA protein binding PGC-1 protein could regulate the expression of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) gene by stimulating the activity of the MFN2 promoter.
- ESRRA gene is an orphan nuclear receptor belonging to the NR superfamily, group iii, and it is a vital regulator involved in a wide variety of cell functions such as mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, adaptive energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism.
- The study found that the c allele of rs2878677 of MFN2 gene in the diabetic group was lower than in the control group, and there was a borderline association between genotype distributions of rs873458 of MFN2 gene and type 2 diabetes.
- The study suggests that there are interactions between genetic variants in the MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1 gene.

• Ex vivo platelet aggregation during clopidogrel therapy varies among individuals and has been linked to reduced exposure of the active clopidogrel thiol metabolite and differences in p2y12 receptor occupancy.
• High platelet reactivity during clopidogrel therapy and low platelet inhibition are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, particularly stent thrombosis.
• Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (cyp2c19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at a higher risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting.
• Clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation: first, oxidation to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic cyp450 enzymes, and second, generation of thiol metabolite.
• A recent study suggests that a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (pon1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the second step of clopidogrel biotransformation.
• A common polymorphism of pon1 (q192r) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the qq (aa) haplotype, and has been linked to increased risk of stent thrombosis in two cohorts of patients with coronary stenting.
• A genome-wide association study (GWAS) found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 10q24 in linkage equilibrium with the cyp2c19 * 2 loss-of-function variant to be significantly associated with clopidogrel platelet inhibition, but did not find evidence of a significant association of SNPs located on or near the pon1 gene with variation in platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.
• A new study aims to assess the impact of pon1 (q192r) and cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphisms on clopidogrel platelet inhibition in a North American study population of mixed racial background.

• Approximately 10-15% of the adult population has gallstones, with 1 million new patients diagnosed annually, making cholelithiasis the most costly digestive disease at an estimated annual cost of over $5 billion.
• A National Institute of Health conference in 1992 concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no increase in morbidity or mortality, resulting in equal or slightly lower treatment costs and substantial savings due to reduced disability period.
• A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients showed that the average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922, while that of open cholecystectomies was $13,042 (p<0.01). The amount attributed to laparoscopy was $6,880.
• Decision tree analysis showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective, but if charges could be reduced to certain levels, depending on the conversion rate, laparoscopic cholecystectomy would become cost-effective.
• Sensitivity analysis showed that a reduction in charges and conversion rate is necessary to make laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost-effective.
• Healthcare providers should evaluate charge data and conversion rates for each hospital before contracting for medical services and should use this information to become cost-efficient in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

• The study found that partial remission (PR) or ""honeymoon period"" in type 1 diabetes patients is characterized by a reduction in daily insulin requirements and improved glycemic control, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. The new definition of PR is based on insulin-dose-adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) levels, which has shown a strong correlation with stimulated C-peptide levels.

• The study identified several factors associated with PR, including younger age at diagnosis, absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis, and lower HbA1c levels at diagnosis. The duration of PR was significantly shorter in patients with two positive anti-GAD65 and anti-IA2 antibodies at diagnosis. Additionally, higher baseline C-peptide concentrations were observed in both girls and boys entering PR compared to patients without PR.

• The study found no correlation between PR duration or HbA1c+2y levels with occurrence of severe hypoglycemia or diabetes-related complications. The overall occurrence of PR was 56.2% and the mean PR duration was 9.2 months, which was comparable to other studies. The study did not find gender differences in PR rates, but young children had similar PR rates compared to older children.

• Regular structured exercise is known to improve cardiovascular and metabolic function, reducing the risk of chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
• Recent evidence shows that exercise alone reduces visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL), both of which are associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk.
• However, it is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits in reducing adipose tissue depots.
• Cross-sectional analyses suggest an inverse relationship between central adiposity and self-reported physical activity levels, as well as for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
• Prospective studies support this association, and physically inactive twins have been found to have greater liver fat scores than their active counterparts.
• A study was conducted to evaluate whether levels of accurately quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of VAT and IHL in adults with overweight/obesity, but no relationship was observed between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat.

- Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by an isolated elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with a normal free thyroxine (FT4) level, often representing early mild thyroid failure.
* The clinical significance and optimal treatment of SCH are controversial, with treatment typically considered for pregnant women, infertile individuals, those with symptoms, or those at high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism.
* SCH has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, increased weight, altered blood pressure, worsening lipid levels, and vascular problems.
* A systemic review found that SCH has a major impact on metabolic syndrome components, and high normal TSH levels are associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome.
* The TRUST study, a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial, aims to assess the effects of thyroid hormone replacement in older adults with SCH, evaluating cardiovascular events, quality of life, muscle function, and cognitive function.
* Understanding the prevalence and risk factors of SCH is crucial for preventing cardiovascular disease and mortality, but the decision to treat or not treat an SCH patient depends on clinical judgment, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion until the TRUST study results are published and incorporated into updated clinical recommendations.

- Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
- C. difficile toxin A and toxin B induce C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), but not all carriers of C. difficile in the intestines will develop CDAD.
- Diagnosis of CDAD is based on an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and C. difficile toxins A and B, but the low detection sensitivity of EIA for the CD toxins has been reported.
- A nucleic acid amplification test, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can be used to compensate for the low sensitivity of EIA.
- Patients with toxin-negative stool may be dismissed as non-CDAD and thus overlooked in terms of treatment and infection countermeasures.
- The present study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA and found that patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates had shorter diarrhea duration compared to patients with toxin-positive stool.
- The study also found that patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates did not receive CDAD treatment and had similar diarrhea duration as patients with both toxin-negative stool and isolates.
- The group with toxin-negative isolates may have been infected with nontoxigenic C. difficile, while the toxin concentration in the stool and intestines of the group with toxin-positive isolates but toxin-negative stool specimens was likely too low to be detected by EIA.
- Nucleic acid amplification tests are recommended to detect toxigenic C. difficile in stool for a diagnosis of CDAD, but toxin production is not evaluated.

- The DREAM trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with IFG or IGT.
- Participants receiving rosiglitazone had a significant increase in insulinogenic index (IGI)/homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and a significant decrease in proinsulin (PI)/C-peptide ratio, while those receiving ramipril did not have significant changes in these measures.
- Rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI and reduced PI concentrations over time after adjustment for age and insulin resistance, while ramipril did not significantly affect adjusted IGI or PI concentrations.
- After accounting for baseline -cell function as measured by either IGI or PI in models that adjusted for insulin resistance and other covariates, rosiglitazone significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes.
- Rosiglitazone, but not ramipril, improved measures of -cell function over time in people with IFG and/or IGT, and the demonstration that an agent that reduces diabetes incidence also improves -cell function invites the hypothesis that measures of change in -cell function in response to therapy are indexes of that therapy's ability to reduce the incidence of diabetes.

• Interacting microbial strains share metabolites, such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose, and these interactions can be predicted based on individual strain characteristics.
• A general model of metabolic interaction should account for various metabolites exchanged and the genotypic diversity of the strains involved, without requiring detailed biochemical characterization of each participant.
• Using a model set of E. coli auxotrophs, optimization-based techniques of flux balance analysis have been successful in describing metabolic systems and can be extended to higher-order systems of two strains in co-culture.
• Certain pairs of E. coli auxotrophs complement each other's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites, referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT).
• SMIT interactions constitute a class of synthetic genetic interactions, reflecting and elucidating the genetic and metabolic network from which they derive, and can be used to identify biosynthetic modules in the metabolic network.

* Biological scaffold materials derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa of human, bovine, and porcine origin have been used in soft tissue repair applications such as hernia repair, breast reconstruction, staple-line reinforcement, and orthopedic applications. These scaffolds are particularly useful in contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria.
* Absorbable polymer scaffolds, such as Dexon and Vicryl, have been developed and used primarily in damage control situations. However, these scaffolds lose mechanical strength and are resorbed fairly quickly, making them less than ideal for hernia repair applications. More recent absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, have been developed to address these issues.
* The study described in the text evaluates the mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics of Phasix Mesh and p4hb plug when utilized to bridge a surgical defect in a porcine model. The results indicate that the p4hb material is capable of augmenting the strength of the native porcine abdominal wall and that scaffolds derived from the p4hb material are durable and capable of maintaining support at the repair site over a 52-week period in a porcine model.

• In Denmark, there has been a dramatic increase in vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium infections since 2012 due to multiclonal outbreaks.
• Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, with screening relying on selective culturing and/or detection of the resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR.
• A study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert VANA/VANB assay and its impact on infection control decision making in a laboratory serving a population of 800,000 inhabitants in Denmark.
• The study found that the sensitivity of the vanA PCR assay was 87.1% and the specificity was 99.7%, while the specificity and positive predictive value of the vanB part of the assay were low.
• Of the 1099 samples with available pcr and culture results, only 29 showed discordant results, and false-negative pcr results were not due to alterations of the primer binding sites.
• The study also found that using culture results complemented with information from patients' follow-up samples as a reference standard, the diagnostic accuracy of the vanA part of the Xpert VANA/VANB assay was excellent.
• The implementation of the Xpert VANA/VANB assay led to a change in the culture protocol from plating 10 µl to 100 µl of enrichment broth on the chromogenic plates to increase sensitivity.

* Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease characterized by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions, and endothelial cells play a significant role in maintaining a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. In the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts, leading to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.

- The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is based on the work of three pioneering pathologists: Rudolf Virchow, Pelayo Correa, and Robin Warren.
- Virchow proposed that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation, while Correa developed a model for gastric cancer development, hypothesizing that it results from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over 30-50 years.
- Warren, along with Barry Marshall, discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Their work led to the realization that H. pylori is associated with gastric cancer, although initial investigations provided only weak evidence for a link.
- Subsequent research, particularly large cohort studies, has provided stronger evidence for the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer, with an overall odds ratio for gastric cancer development in H. pylori-infected vs. uninfected persons of 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-6.2).
- The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer declared H. pylori as a definite (Group 1) carcinogen in 1994, based on the compelling results of these cohort studies, despite the lack of supporting evidence from animal models or basic science research at the time.

• Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NAMD) is a major cause of visual loss in the elderly. Before the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents like bevacizumab and ranibizumab, only prevention of visual acuity loss was possible with treatments like laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and vitreoretinal surgery.
• Intravitreal treatments with bevacizumab and ranibizumab have led to maintaining baseline visual acuity in most patients and visual improvement in some. Multicenter studies and the CATT study have shown that both drugs are effective in preventing visual acuity loss and improving vision in up to 40% of patients.
• A study comparing the functional and anatomical outcomes of bevacizumab and ranibizumab therapy on an as-needed treatment regimen in Turkish NAMD patients found no significant difference between the two groups in regards to change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) at all time points.
• Both groups showed significant improvement in BCVA and CRT at every time point, with similar injection numbers and complication rates. Previous clinical studies have also reported similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes with bevacizumab and ranibizumab.

• The study found that women with severe hypoproteinemia preeclampsia (SHP) were delivered earlier, had a higher rate of cesarean sections (CS), and more frequent severe hypertension compared to those with mild hypoproteinemia preeclampsia (MHP). Women with SHP also had a higher incidence of abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta.

• The study concludes that SHP is a significant risk factor for poor maternal and neonatal outcomes in preeclampsia, including CS, severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, abruptio placenta, and poor neonatal outcomes. SHP is associated with a higher risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, indicating a need for closer surveillance during pregnancy.

* The development of humanized monoclonal antibodies, such as Avastin (bevacizumab), and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors have been used to target the VEGF-A signaling pathway in cancer treatment. Avastin has been successful in treating various human cancers, including colorectal, lung, and renal cell carcinoma. However, its recent withdrawal for treating breast cancer in the US highlights the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments and the need for careful cost-benefit analysis.
* Other growth factors, such as alternative ligands for the angiogenic receptor VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C and VEGF-D) and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families (e.g., fibroblast growth factor), may contribute to the development of resistance to Avastin. Other mechanisms, such as vascular mimicry, the involvement of endothelial precursor cells, or altered tumor metabolism leading to reduced oxygen requirement, may also play a role in resistance.
* The past 20 years have seen the development and evaluation of various agents that modify or inhibit VEGF-A signaling pathways, including vegf-a itself, vegf receptors, vegf co-receptors, PTKs and signaling intermediates, and transcription factors. Other vegf family members have also been identified, increasing the diversity of signaling induced by the vegf family of ligands. Agents specifically targeting vegf family members and their receptors are currently in development, with mabs to vegf-b, vegf-c, vegf-d, pigf, vegfr-1, vegfr-2, and vegfr-3 being evaluated by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries for their efficacy as anti-cancer agents.

- Over the last two decades, new immunotherapy approaches to cancer treatment have been developed due to increased understanding of the immune system and how tumors can circumvent it.
* Many of these investigations have led to approved agents, such as infusional cytokine therapies, intravesical BCG therapy, and an active cellular therapy targeting prostatic acid phosphatase for advanced metastatic prostate cancer.
* Other agents have demonstrated benefit in large clinical trials and are expected to be approved, such as a monoclonal antibody targeting a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor for advanced melanoma.
* To be clinically approved, these treatments must demonstrate safety and positive impact on patient care and outcome.
* Some agents may best be used in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies, presenting challenges for clinical development and evaluation.
* Identifying markers of biological response, ideally associated with clinical outcome, is needed to evaluate these agents used in combination.
* For antigen-specific vaccines, it has been relatively straightforward to evaluate immune responses to the target antigen as a biomarker of immunological efficacy.
* However, there are few instances in which target antigen immune response has been associated with clinical benefit.
* Appropriate biomarkers of response have been more elusive for broadly active immune modulating agents such as anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies or TLR agonists.

- Bone mass density and architecture are dependent on mechanical factors, and cell mechanical stimulation promotes proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic lineage.
- Stress shielding can cause bone loss through remodeling due to decreased loading, and solutions such as design variations and controlled-stiffness implants have been proposed.
- A new approach to this problem is the development of smart implants that integrate systems for bone mechanical stimulation using the converse piezoelectric effect.
- An in vivo study was conducted using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films to mechanically stimulate bone, with the films used as a substrate for MC3T3 cells.
- The coating was performed using an acrylic material, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), with Bonelike particles added in the fourth layer.
- The actuator device was programmed to apply a 5V square wave of 1Hz and 3Hz for 15 minutes at each frequency, once every 24 hours.
- The device was implanted in the left hind limb of a 4-year-old merino ewe, and a control device was implanted in the right hind limb.
- Total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher compared to static controls, and the increment of bone occupied area was due to new bone formation.
- The study suggests that piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect may be used to effectively stimulate bone growth at the bone implant interface, eliciting an early response.

Serum L-fucose levels also progressively increased with the stages of oral cancer, with stage IV showing the highest level.
- The study suggests that serum L-fucose levels can be used as a noninvasive, cost-effective biochemical indicator for the detection, staging, therapeutic success, prognosis, and posttreatment evaluation of oral cancer. However, further investigation on a large scale is needed to establish its effectiveness as a tumor marker.

- Male Wistar rats were obtained from Sankyo Labo Service Co. Ltd. in Sapporo, Japan and were given LPS and methylprednisolone injections to promote non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).
- The rats were housed individually and had free access to food, water, and a 12-hour light/dark cycle.
- The rats were divided into weight-bearing (WB) and non-weight-bearing (NWB) groups, with the NWB group's hindlimbs unloaded using a tail suspension system.
- The femur and humerus from each rat were harvested and processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining.
- Histopathological osteonecrosis was defined as the presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis.
- Femoral head osteonecrosis was observed in 63.6% of WB rats and 54.5% of NWB rats, with no significant intergroup difference.
- The humeral head did not show any signs of osteonecrosis in either group.
- The NWB group had a larger number of hematopoietic cells and fewer fat cells in the humeral head compared to the WB group.
- The study suggests that weight bearing is not related to the development of non-traumatic ONFH in rats, but the rat model may not be useful for observing the mechanism of femoral head collapse.
- The aetiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of non-traumatic ONFH remain unclear.

* Nurses are underengaged in health policy processes due to lack of awareness of policy issues and processes, inadequate knowledge and skills, and limited opportunities to contribute to policy decisions. This is partly attributed to gender differences in the health care system, with nursing being predominantly viewed as a woman's occupation and men more likely to be in positions of power and decision-making.
* Studies have emphasized that nurses can engage in policy processes directly by assuming formal leadership positions and indirectly through lobbying and advocacy with policy-makers via professional organizations. However, there is a need to strengthen LMIC nurses' research abilities to enhance their ability to understand, generate, and utilize research knowledge for policy change.
* A survey of nurse leaders' involvement in health policy processes in East Africa found that nurse leaders' participation in all stages of policy development was limited and inconsistent. A study on nurses' involvement in HIV/AIDS policy in four LMICs, including Kenya and Uganda, revealed nurses' lack of involvement in policy processes, poor communication of policies from the national level, and a lack of resources for nurses to implement the policies.
* This study applied a critical theory perspective to examine how nurses had been involved in national health policy processes in Kenya, eliciting the perspectives of nurses and decision-makers working at various levels of the health care system. The study found that nurses were not adequately involved in the health sector policy development processes at the national level, with only three nurse leaders invited to participate in national policy committees.

The study found that e. coli was the most prevalent organism (64.4%), followed by enterobacter (19.2%). The study also showed that gram-negative bacteria were the leading cause of UTI in the study population (95.8%).
* The study found that e. coli was mostly resistant to ampicillin (93.6%), cefixime (85.7%), and cephalexin (77.3%). However, it was most susceptible to cefotaxime (63.6%), norfloxacin (100%), and ciprofloxacin (100%). Enterobacter was highly resistant to amikacin (100%) and ampicillin (92.8%) but sensitive to ceftazidime (100%) and norfloxacin (100%). Klebsiella and S. epidermidis were found to be completely resistant to ampicillin.
* The study highlights the importance of continuous assessment of uropathogen epidemiology in neonatal period as UTI is hard to diagnose at this age group and could potentially lead to systemic infection leaving potential life-threatening and long-term sequelae. The study suggests that having knowledge of prevailing antibiotic sensitivities of local bacterial isolates can help clinicians choose an empirical therapy regimen that is most clinically and epidemiologically ideal till further microbiologic results are available.

• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders that affect cortisol and aldosterone secretion due to a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, most commonly 21-hydroxylase. This deficiency is caused by inactivating mutations in the CYP21A2 gene.
• The study examines 26 patients with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, who were followed at the department of endocrinology in Mahdia and Sfax, Tunisia. The patients were classified into three groups based on their clinical form: salt-wasting (SW), simple virilizing (SV), and non-classical (NC). The study found that 42.3% of the patients showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, temporal lobe atrophy, and hippocampal dysgenesis.
• The study suggests that hormonal imbalance related to a deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone and an overproduction of 17-oh-progesterone and androgen could cause a destabilization of the myelin molecule leading to its degeneration. Exogenous glucocorticoids may also alter the process of neuronal maturation and myelination.
• The study highlights the importance of monitoring the adequacy of therapy in CAH patients and the need for more extensive studies to define better the relationships between brain involvement and different CAH phenotypes and treatment regimens.

The study took place between 2010 and 2013 at Mayo Hospital, Hodeidah, Yemen. The results showed that patients with a urethral plate wider than 8 mm (Group A) had a significantly lower fistula rate and fewer failed 8 fr calibrations compared to patients with a urethral plate narrower than 8 mm (Group B). Additionally, patients with a flat urethral plate had a higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibrations compared to patients with either cleft or deeply grooved urethral plates, although not statistically significant.

• The study also highlights the advantages of TIP urethroplasty, including preservation and utilization of the urethral plate, a single suture line of the neourethra, creation of glandular and penile urethra, short operative time, and low complication rate. However, the study suggests that augmentation with a buccal mucosal graft (BMG) may be necessary for patients with flat and narrow urethral plates to improve the results.

- The study found that trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is common in socially-marginalized young women from low-income communities in coastal Peru, and is associated with older age, lack of education, being single, unprotected sex with non-steady partners, and multiple sex partners. However, there is no association between TV infection and vaginal symptoms. The prevalence of TV infection is not different between women with or without recent painful urination or vaginal discharge, suggesting that syndromic management may result in both over and under treatment. The asymptomatic nature of TV infection could contribute to long-term prevalent infection and continued spread in the population.
- The study highlights the need for screening and treatment programs to control the spread of TV infection, especially in hard-to-reach populations such as socially-marginalized women who are often underrepresented in health care and may represent a high-risk target population. The study also emphasizes the importance of screening and treatment of sex partners of infected women to prevent reinfection and reduce infection prevalence and complications in untreated males. Further studies are needed to determine if screening and treatment of TV will improve reproductive health and birth outcomes of women.

- Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, characterized by specific types of seizures, EEG patterns, and cognitive impairment.
- LGS is caused by various congenital or acquired etiologies, and its prognosis is poor with regard to both seizures and cognitive outcome.
- Diagnosing LGS can be difficult due to its heterogeneous causes and the absence of classic clinical and EEG features at the onset of the syndrome.
- Systematic difficulties complicate performance of drug trials in LGS, including the frequent occurrence of atypical absence seizures, the inaccuracy of parental reports of seizure semiology and frequency, the wide range of etiologies, and the evolution of seizure types over time.
- A few randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of single agents have been performed in LGS, showing that felbamate, lamotrigine, and topiramate reduced the occurrence of atonic and tonic-clonic seizures in children with LGS.
- Valproic acid is considered the most useful initial medication of choice for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS, although caution must be exercised in using valproic acid in children under the age of 2 years.
- Rufinamide is a triazole derivative granted orphan drug status for the adjunctive treatment of LGS in the United States in 2004 and approved by the FDA for treatment of LGS in children 4 years of age and older.
- Rufinamide is structurally unrelated to other anticonvulsants and reportedly involves decreased firing of high frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.

- Interpopulational variation in sexual chemical signals may contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation in animals.
- Phenotypic plasticity in sexual signals can lead to signal divergence in different environments, potentially amplified by sexual selection and mating preferences.
- In Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica), femoral gland secretions convey information about social status and genetic quality, and differences in chemical signals can prevent interspecific mating.
- The study investigates the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five populations of Iberian wall lizards in central Spain.
- Researchers found significant morphological differences between populations, suggesting partial reproductive isolation, and variations in femoral gland secretions that could indicate cryptic speciation.
- Tongue-flick experiments revealed that males and females discriminated between scents of lizards from different populations, potentially contributing to reduced gene flow and reproductive isolation.
- The study suggests that differences in chemical signals and population recognition abilities may indicate the probable existence of cryptic speciation between Iberian wall lizard populations.
- Morphological and chemical differences between populations may be explained by phenotypic plasticity, local adaptation, or different contrasting environments.
- The findings support the idea that reproductive isolation between some Iberian wall lizard populations is not entirely clear, and further studies are needed to confirm cryptic speciation.

• Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a common technique used to detect gene expression patterns in developmental research labs. It has been simplified with the use of nonradioactive probes and can be used to detect multiple transcripts simultaneously.
• Fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts have several advantages over chromogenic methods, including higher quality three-dimensional imaging, multiplexing different RNA species, and covisualization of RNA with proteins. However, the use of fluorescent methods is limited by high endogenous background fluorescence and the limited brightness and photostability of organic fluorophores.
• Quantum dots (QDS) are a new type of inorganic fluorophore that have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between the excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching.
• QDS have been used for in situ hybridization in clinical biopsies for the detection of multiple mRNAs with successful conjugation to oligonucleotide probes. They have also been used for in situ hybridization in fish experiments, but their large size can cause penetration issues in embryos.
• Proteinase K can be used to render Xenopus embryos sufficiently permeable to allow QD penetration deep within embryonic tissues, enabling sensitive and high-resolution detection of endogenous messenger RNAs.
• The use of QDS for nonamplified fluorescent whole mount in situs in Xenopus embryos suggests that QD whole-mount in situs will find successful applications in most developmental models.

- Obesity is a common metabolic disease worldwide and is often associated with dyslipidemias.
- Obesity is commonly assessed using parameters such as BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.
- Newer obesity indices, such as waist-to-height ratio, visceral adiposity index, and body adiposity index, have been proposed to take into account adipose tissue distribution.
- A study was conducted to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
- The study included 66 patients with a mean age of 55.8±11.6 years, and patients were divided into three groups based on their obesity level.
- The following body mass-related indices were calculated: BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, visceral adiposity index, and body adiposity index.
- Lipid metabolism indices, such as TC/HDL-C ratio, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, and TG/HDL-C ratio, were also calculated.
- The study found that patients with class III obesity had lower mean serum levels of TC and LDL-C compared to patients with class I obesity.
- Negative significant correlations were found between BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, visceral adiposity index, and HDL-C levels.
- The study suggests that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C levels.

• Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 29.4% of total deaths in 2010 and costing over $312.6 billion in healthcare spending and lost productivity.
• Aspirin therapy can reduce the risk of major CVD events and is recommended for primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, past research on aspirin use for CVD prevention may not accurately reflect physician recommendations due to a lack of information on physician recommendations and the use of various risk factors instead of the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) to determine high-risk individuals.
• A study analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011-2012 to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention in a nationally representative sample. The study found that among the total sample eligible for aspirin as primary prevention, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin.
• Among primary prevention patients, over three fourths were classified as low risk, and less than half of those with a high CVD risk level received a recommendation to take aspirin. Of those told to take aspirin by their physicians, the vast majority complied with the recommendation.
• Among primary prevention patients, education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention. Among high-risk individuals, age, health insurance, and being of Asian/other descent were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention.
• The study found that recommendations for aspirin for CVD prevention do not match up to the objectively computed future risk, and decisions for treatment recommendations seem to be being made on criteria other than objectively calculated future CVD risk.

• Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate cellular signaling pathways.
• Oxidation of protein cysteine residues by ROS results in formation of sulphenic acid, which can change protein function and is reversible.
• MROS generation is required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses.
• Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and MROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs.
• In the epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium, mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production promote signaling through pathways required for differentiation of mammalian stem cell populations in vivo.
• In the epidermis, conditional deletion of TFAM, a protein required for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome, results in impaired differentiation and an epidermal barrier defect.
• MROS generation is required for activation of the Notch and β-catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth respectively.
• Proper regulation of cellular differentiation is likely dependent on cell type-specific factors as well as environmental influences such as hypoxia and calcium concentrations.

* Endocrine-disrupting chemical effects on wild animals and humans are a concern, with many chemicals altering the thyroid system in vertebrates.
* The OECD and EPA established guidelines for investigating frog metamorphosis to focus on thyroid toxicity, as amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to contaminants in wastewater due to their thin, permeable skin and aquatic environment.
* Frog metamorphosis is regulated by thyroid hormones (THs), promoting the remodeling of aquatic larvae into adult tetrapods, making it a useful parameter for reflecting endocrine disruption.
* Several processes influence the thyroid hormone balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation, which can be disrupted by environmental contaminants.
* Chemicals can bind to TH transport proteins, reducing total and free TH levels in serum, and interfere with TH metabolism.
* Amphibian tadpoles have a higher affinity for T3 than T4, and chemicals that bind to ttr can affect the free concentration of plasma T3 and its plasma clearance rate.
* The aldosterone plasma level is low prior to the onset of climax but rises sharply during metamorphic climax, and combined ACTH and T treatment causes a marked increase in concentration.
* Several thyroid-disrupting substances, such as propylthiouracil (PTU), methimazole, perchlorate, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenol A (BPA), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), have been tested for toxicity using amphibians.
* The OECD and EPA have adopted the Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (AMA) using X. laevis as a guideline for testing chemicals, focusing on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis.
* Thyroid gland histopathology is a valuable indicator of thyroid toxicants, and histological examination of the amphibian thyroid gland is a sensitive approach for detecting antithyroidal activity.

However, the transition process can be difficult, and common challenges include promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records.
- To become recognized as a PCMH by the NCQA, a practice must provide documentation of its guidelines for implementation and adhere to PCMH principles. This includes ensuring greater access, increased communication, and improved care coordination.
- The PCMH model emphasizes team-based care, where staff address patient treatment decisions collectively and pre-visit meetings are conducted to allocate resources and ensure adequate health maintenance and chronic care management. This can result in improved decision-making, care, and patient satisfaction.
- The transformation of a primary care practice into a PCMH requires significant changes in office culture, including new experiences for current members, additional training for nurses and front office staff, and a more sophisticated level of decision-making skills for clinical and clerical staff members.

• Mild hypothermia therapy has been proposed to protect patients' brains during CPR and has been shown to increase survival rates and improve neurological function in animal experiments and clinical trials. The 2010 American Heart Association guidelines recommend cooling comatose patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest to 32-34°C for 12 or 24 hours.
• A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found that mild hypothermia therapy improved the survival rate (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.05-1.49, p = 0.01) and neurological function (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.13-1.66, p = 0.001) of cardiac arrest patients. However, mild hypothermia did not influence the incidence of rearrest or other adverse events.
• The meta-analysis also identified limitations in the current research, including inadequate sample sizes, clinical and methodological heterogeneity, and potential side effects of hypothermia therapy. Further research is needed to determine the optimal cooling measures and duration for improving the survival rate and neurological function of cardiac arrest patients.

- Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a common surgical treatment for localized prostate cancer, with numerous studies demonstrating excellent tumor control, good functional results, and low morbidity.
- The major long-term morbidity from radical retropubic prostatectomy is erectile dysfunction, which is caused by injury to the cavernosal nerves.
- These nerves were identified by Walsh and Donker as branching from the pelvic plexus and running as a plexus of small nerves within a neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate.
- Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, but there is still variability in recovery of erectile function.
- A recent study described periprostatic nerve distribution and constructed a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution using adult male human cadavers.
- The study found that nerve fibers were distributed evenly around the prostatic capsule, except for the ventral part which had significantly fewer nerve fibers.
- The average thickness of the nerve fibers in the ventral part was also significantly decreased compared to the other parts.
- The three-dimensional model revealed an almost even distribution and nearly similar thickness of periprostatic nerve fibers on dorsal and both lateral parts, with no cord-like structure noted.
- The study's findings suggest that the number of periprostatic nerve fibers is evenly distributed on both lateral and dorsal (rectal) parts from base to apex of the prostate without forming any cord-like structures, and an excessive high up incision over 2, 10 o'clock on the ventral part of the prostate is insignificant during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.

Elevated SAA levels were associated with higher inflammatory burden, increased risk of cardiovascular and renal involvement, and amyloidosis development.
- SAA was directly related to RA activity, with higher SAA concentrations found in patients with high disease activity and those currently treated with glucocorticoids. Women treated with biological DMARDs had significantly lower SAA concentrations than women treated only with synthetic DMARDs.
- The study also found that SAA could be considered a biomarker associated with both current inflammatory disease activity and chronic complications in RA patients. Persistently elevated SAA concentration increases the risk of amyloidosis development due to deposition of amyloid proteins in different tissues and organs.

- iPSCs can be generated from adult somatic cells and differentiate into functional cardiovascular lineages, offering an unlimited supply of autologous donor cells once tumorigenesis risks are eliminated.
- MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and cardiomyocytes under special conditions. They can be rapidly expanded and are less immunogenic, but their propensity to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues limits their use.
- Skeletal myoblasts can be autologously reimplanted but do not truly differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vivo, leading to dyssynchronous contractions and increased arrhythmias.
- Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in vitro and supply proangiogenic, positive remodeling, and antiapoptotic factors after transplant. Intracoronary infusion of these cells has shown improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct scar size, and left ventricular end-systolic volume.

• Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy have improved our understanding of genome folding, revealing that the dynamic folding of chromatin is essential for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. The genome is organized hierarchically into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), which are stable across different species, cell types, and conditions. TADs are units of chromosomes with higher frequencies of physical contacts between genes and regulatory regions.

• TAD boundaries are associated with the enrichment of certain proteins and histone marks in human cells and insulator binding in drosophila. These boundaries regulate long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, and their strength is associated with the frequency of inter-TAD interactions. A strong TAD boundary limits interactions between adjacent TAD domains, while a weak TAD boundary allows a higher frequency of inter-TAD interactions.

• The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, Brg1 (SMARCA4), is required for proper nucleosome occupancy, positioning, and long-range chromatin interactions. Recent findings suggest that Brg1 contributes to TAD boundary strength, and its loss affects nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization.

• ChIP-seq analysis of Brg1 shows binding primarily at genic regions (60%), with intergenic peaks including super-enhancers. Comparison of control and Brg1 knockdown Hi-C data sets reveals that the majority of TAD boundaries are largely overlapping, but more than 10% of the TAD boundaries are unique to either control or Brg1 knockdown cells. Brg1 knockdown results in reduced TAD boundary strength and increased inter-TAD genomic interactions, which may be due to disrupted chromatin accessibility and preclusion of transcription factor and/or chromatin modifier binding at TAD boundaries.

• Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO). Its imaging relies on the superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and magnetic saturation ability of SPIO. MPI provides high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios.

• Resovist, an approved T2* contrast agent for MRI, is the most important benchmark material for MPI. However, its hydrodynamic diameter is greater than 50 nm, limiting its in vivo distribution. The blood half-life of Resovist in MPI may differ significantly from that in MRI, and the pharmacokinetics of Resovist, especially its half-life in blood, are important for cardiovascular MPI.

• The study found that Resovist from Bayer Pharma Ag and Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. have different blood half-lives in MPI. The difference in formulation of the polymeric coating is improbable, and the Japanese company that developed Resovist still produces the drug substance. The mpi performance of the tracers is almost the same, indicating that the mechanism of clustering of Resovist particles as described by Eberbeck et al. for Resovist by Bayer Pharma Ag holds true for Resovist from Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.

- Intracellular pathogens like Leishmania have evolved to coexist with host defense mechanisms, and their interaction with the host is challenging to study due to the general inflammatory response that occurs during infection. This response is driven by the complement cascade, coagulation pathway, acute phase response, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can affect phagocyte function.
- A study of Leishmania infection in a mouse model found that the transcriptomic response of uninfected cells exposed to inflammation can serve as a measure of the normal in vivo response to insult. Transcriptomic networks specifically observed in infected cells, but not in neighboring uninfected cells, represent cell-intrinsic pathogen-induced changes, while transcriptomic networks restricted to uninfected cells can identify responses potentially beneficial to the host.
- In the livers of uninfected mice, Kupffer cells (KCs) were identified by their large size, expression of membrane GFP, and continued contact with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. KCs exhibited small fluctuations in cellular volume and surface area over time, while monocytes and/or neutrophils moved rapidly through the sinusoidal spaces. Shape factor, a quantitative measure of how close a cell is to a perfect sphere, was always lower for KCs than for either lining cells or monocytes and/or neutrophils.
- The early response of KCs to infection with L. donovani amastigotes in vivo is largely uncharacterized. In this study, the binding and phagocytosis of amastigotes by KCs did not result in detectable changes in KC volume or surface area. However, injection of live, but not dead, amastigotes induced a rapid increase in the average shape factor of KCs, suggesting a cellular response to active infection. This response was not observed following injection of dead amastigotes, indicating that it was specific to live parasites.

• The control of appetite involves the coordination of inputs from both physiological and environmental sources.
• Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids or proteins, or adipose tissue, while recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract.
• Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract.
• A new formulation explains how aspects of body composition and energy expenditure regulate hunger and appetite.
• The inter-relationships between energy expenditure and energy intake provide an alternative approach to appetite control.
• Exercise can raise resting values of energy expenditure several fold and have numerous physiological effects, potentially exerting a mechanistically different type of control over appetite.
• Acute bouts of exercise do not lead to a consistent increase in food intake, but partial compensation begins to appear when exercise is repeated over several days.
• Detailed analysis of body composition and appetite variables has demonstrated that fat-free mass, but not fat mass or body mass index, is strongly correlated with meal size and daily energy intake.

- Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a commonly used material in prosthetic dentistry for denture bases due to its esthetic properties, low water sorption and solubility, relative lack of toxicity, repairability, and simple processing technique.
* Heat-polymerized PMMA resin is the most frequently used denture base material, but it can cause dimensional changes and inaccuracies in the fit of the denture base.
* Chemically activated resins, when compression molded, display less polymerization shrinkage than heat-activated counterparts, leading to greater dimensional accuracy.
* The injection molding technique has advantages over the compression molding technique, including reduced processing time, lower cost, lower skin sensitivity to evaporated monomer, and availability of the resin reservoir to compensate for acrylic resin shrinkage.
* Surface treatments of denture teeth, such as grinding the glossy ground surface, painting the ground surface of the teeth with monomer, and cutting mechanical retention features in the ground surface of the teeth, can increase the bond strength between acrylic resin teeth and denture base resins.

- Arc welding emits intense ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that can cause acute and delayed health effects, including keratoconjunctivitis, erythema, cataracts, and skin cancer. A survey of 1667 workers at workplaces where arc welding is performed indicated that 86% of them had experienced symptoms of uv keratoconjunctivitis, and 45% reported ongoing experience with this ailment.
- The UVR hazard during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel with a shielding gas of 80% Ar + 20% CO2 or 100% CO2 increases with welding current and depends on the type of welding wire. The effective irradiance of UVR emitted during GMAW performed with a digital inverter-type pulsed arc welding machine was measured and assessed in accordance with the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines. The study found that the effective irradiance of UVR emitted during pulsed 80% Ar + 20% Co2 welding was 3.0 - 6.7 times larger compared with that emitted during non-pulsed 80% Ar + 20% Co2 welding at each welding current.

• A wide variety of microorganisms produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as energy and carbon storage compounds, with higher PHA content enabling longer survival.
• PHAs are synthesized by many bacteria and archaea when carbon is available but other essential nutrients are scarce, and are divided into short-chain-length (SCL) and medium-chain-length (MCL) groups.
• The type of PHA produced depends on the metabolic pathway of the microorganism, with PHA synthase playing a major role; four classes of PHA synthase exist, each with different substrate specificities and subunit organizations.
• Extremophiles, such as psychrotrophic bacteria in Antarctic freshwater reservoirs, have potential as sources of novel PHA synthases for industrial applications.
• A study of five Antarctic freshwater reservoirs and one stream found that bacteria inhabiting these areas have the potential to synthesize PHAs, with 12 pseudomonas strains and 3 janthinobacterium strains possessing PHA synthesis genes.
• The presence of bacteria possessing specific forms of PHA synthase genes correlated with environmental conditions, such as low total phosphorus and high pheophytin levels, suggesting that PHA metabolism may be an adaptation mechanism for harsh polar conditions.

• Reclaiming arid and semi-arid lands involves modifying topography, creating appropriate surface composition, and establishing vegetation, with the latter being the most uncertain category.
• Establishing vegetation is important for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing productive reuse of land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape.
• Uncertainty in vegetation establishment comes primarily from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment, with irrigation being expensive and not more successful.
• Natural rainfall can allow the establishment of robust native or non-native vegetation, but natives are now more recommended due to their long-term stability, resource value for wildlife, and better public acceptance.
• A mixed plant community is needed to maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation, with perennial grasses often being the primary contributors to surface stability and erosion prevention.
• The study aims to estimate how frequently native perennial warm-season grasses may be established in southern Arizona using 31 years of historical rainfall event data.
• The likelihood of vegetation establishment is important to research for better mitigation strategies and appropriate budgeting.
• The study simulated soil moisture for a 31-year period using a land surface model with detailed long-term precipitation event data, data on moisture movement through the soil, and data on evaporation from the Santa Rita Experimental Range.
• The study found that the monsoon rainfall in this region is generally from convective cells, resulting in different amounts of rainfall even over short distances, and that seven years of eddy flux data were available with various measurements.

- Patient blood management is becoming more important due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which also have high costs and a shortage of blood bank products. Postoperative severe bleeding is common following cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass are at increased risk of postoperative bleeding.
- The correlation between blood flow, oxygen delivery, and consumption together with hemoglobin can easily be visualized. Oxygen delivery is determined by cardiac output, hemoglobin level, and oxygenation. If oxygen delivery is out of balance with oxygen consumption, the compensation mechanisms are relatively simple, as a decrease in hemoglobin must result in a compensatory increase in either cardiac index or oxygen extraction or a combination.

However, recent research has shown that neuronal regeneration continues in specific tissues after birth, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium.
• The olfactory epithelium has the ability to recover from significant damage, even in the face of overwhelming injury. This is due in part to the presence of olfactory ensheathing cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, schwann cells, and multipotent stem and progenitor cells.
• Researchers have long searched for an ideal cell with the properties of absolute totipotency and regenerability for use in neural regeneration therapies. While progress has been made, many questions remain unanswered.

• Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a slowly propagating wave of near-complete depolarization of neurons and astrocytes followed by a period of electrical suppression. It is accompanied by secondary changes of cerebral blood flow and can be elicited by various stimuli. CSD has been shown to initiate inflammatory activation of microglia, which can contribute to the perpetuation of CSD induction.

- New technologies and innovations are seen as a way to address challenges in the healthcare industry, specifically to improve access, cost, and quality of care simultaneously.
- There is significant stress on research-based institutions globally due to increased competition for less funding, with the NIH losing 22% of its capacity to fund research from 2003 to 2015.
- Efficiency and effectiveness in translating research investments into products, services, and procedures that improve health and wellbeing are crucial.
- Technological innovations can enable disruptive step changes in performance while reducing costs, as seen in Moore's Law and Eroom's Law.
- Successful innovation in healthcare requires navigating a long and challenging journey from unmet needs or basic research discoveries to viable commercial products or services.
- The ""valley of death"" between academic research and commercialization is a key obstacle for health innovations, often caused by non-economic investments and lack of a clear commercialization pathway.
- Financial investors expect solutions to market risks, not just technical risks, and many academic investigators are not prepared or motivated to address commercial issues.
- To improve the effectiveness of translational research, academic programs should focus on building skills and advancing projects, with a balance between cost and intensity.
- Healthcare Commercialization Programs (HCPs) aim to strike a balance by cost-effectively advancing projects into commercialization while building the skills of team members.

- The study found that not all patients are honest about their smoking status, and not all follow recommendations to quit smoking. Only 18% of patients admitted to active smoking, but 36% had cotinine levels indicating active smoking. Additionally, 4% of patients were unaware of the adverse effects of tobacco smoke exposure.
* The study also found that detection of cotinine in urine is a convenient and easy way to verify patients' self-reported smoking status, and can help identify individuals who are involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke.
* The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring cotinine levels to accurately assess smoking status and to effectively convey recommendations for quitting tobacco smoking.

• Anal incontinence (AI) is a bothersome ailment associated with various health complaints and discomfort in daily life.
• Prevalence and severity of AI are measured by patient self-reporting, and no objective assessment methods exist.
• Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is a leading cause of AI in nonpregnant women, and multiple vaginal deliveries increase the risk of AI.
• Age, obesity, and medical conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and gastrointestinal disorders also increase the risk of AI.
• Prevalence of AI among women differs largely in previous studies and between different study populations.
• A comprehensive perineum research study was conducted to assess the prevalence and risk factors for AI in an unselected female population across parity groups in the second trimester of pregnancy.
• The study found that previous OASIS was the strongest risk factor for self-reported AI among pregnant parous women, and low educational level and comorbidity were significant risk factors among nulliparous women.
• The study also found a high frequency of self-reported AI among nulliparous women, and the process of vaginal delivery may be more damaging to the anal continence mechanisms than pregnancy per se.

- The incidence of hypotension in non-obstetric patients varies between 5% and 66%, depending on various factors. Previous studies have shown that hypotension due to spinal anesthesia is more common in hypertensive patients.
- A study was conducted to compare the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia performed with hyperbaric bupivacaine in normotensive and hypertensive patients under medical treatment. The study found no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups, but the number of hypertensive patients who developed hypotension was higher.
- The study also found that hypertensive patients had higher systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure values at all measurement times compared to normotensive patients. The amount of fluids infused during surgery was not significantly different between the two groups.
- The authors suggest that the improvement in vascular structural changes and the achievement of a decrease in basal sympathetic activity with effective antihypertensive treatment may explain why there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups.
- The study's most significant limiting factor was the lack of measurement of the basal sympathetic activities of the patients.

- Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a non-enveloped DNA virus that infects the mucosal areas of the human upper digestive tract and anogenital region through sexual contact, leading to an increased risk of development of cancer.
* HPV genotypes are grouped into high-risk and low-risk based on the degree of risk of development of cancer after infection.
* In Nigeria, the prevalence of HPV is high in all female age groups, with the highest rates in women aged 15-23 years. High-risk HPV genital infections in young females are transient and have little long-term significance, but when the infection persists, there is a high risk of developing a precancerous lesion of the cervix.
* Detection of anti-HPV has been shown to reflect the overall HPV infection rate in a population more effectively than detection of HPV DNA.
* A study conducted in a reproductive health clinic in Zaria, Nigeria, found a seroprevalence of 42.9% for HPV in the general population, with the highest prevalence in women aged 45-49 years.
* The study also found that hpv infection was significantly associated with educational status, with antibodies detected with the highest prevalence among women with secondary education.
* The high seroprevalence of HPV in the study area could be due to the lifestyle of the local population, where women are constantly exposed to the virus by means of early sexual debut, early marriage, multiple sexual partners due to polygamy, and high divorce rates.

- The world is experiencing rapid innovations and developments in healthcare, but there is a gap between medical research and its implementation in clinical practice. Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) is a new paradigm that aims to integrate the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values to make effective and efficient clinical decisions.
* Factors affecting the use of EBM include lack of access to updated information, insufficient skills in evidence-based decision-making, and lack of financial and non-financial incentives for evidence production.
* A national evidence-based healthcare system can ensure the best evidence is generated, stored, used, shared, and monitored systematically to provide effective and safe services according to the needs of different stakeholders.
* The system includes a national clinical knowledge management system, a national evidence-based practice system, and an integrated national network of clinical effectiveness. It promotes clinical knowledge management, usage of clinical policies or knowledge products, and facilitates evidence-based practice in the country.

* Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, and is becoming a major concern in child RTIs. A comparative analysis of synonymous codon usage in HMPV genomes was performed to understand its pathogenicity and evolution history.
* The study found that HMPV has a strong synonymous codon usage bias, with all preferred codons ending in A/U, and a high abundance of A/U nucleotides. The stable ENC values suggest that the genomic compositions are conserved among HMPV genomes. Natural selection and mutation pressure were found to be key factors influencing codon usage patterns, with nucleotide constraint playing an important role in influencing synonymous codon usage bias.
* The analysis of different HMPV genotypes showed that each genotype is mainly separated and clustered into two clades, and the phylogenetic distance might affect the variation of synonymous codon usage. The study also found that HMPV shows a complementary pattern with its human host cell, which might be more suitable for HMPV to survive and persist in the human host environment, and could help understand the mechanism of HMPV persistent infection.

- Comprehensive protein annotation is necessary after gene identification in genomes, as around 30% of proteins in well-annotated genomes remain functionally unidentified.
- Protsweep, Domainsweep, and 2dsweep are protein analysis tools that perform sequence similarity searches, predict secondary structural elements, attribute sequences to super-families, predict protein localization, determine physicochemical characteristics, and assign domain functionalities.
- Protsweep uses global and local sequence similarities to assign functional roles to proteins and classifies proteins into categories such as identical, homolog, similar, weakly similar, and putative.
- Protsweep selects the order of databases to search and combines annotations based on the results, while Domainsweep identifies domain architecture within protein sequences and aids in finding correct functional assignments for uncharacterized protein sequences.
- 2dsweep identifies structural domains in proteins, predicts secondary structure elements, transmembrane regions, signal sequences, hydrophobicity, antigenicity, protease cleavage sites, and more.
- Protsweep, Domainsweep, and 2dsweep use different protein family databases, such as UniProt/SwissProt, UniProt/Trembl, RefSeq, Ensembl, DSSP, Pfam, Smart, Tigrfams, Scop, and Blocks, with varying thresholds for each database.
- Protsweep, Domainsweep, and 2dsweep output results as HTML for visual inspection or as XML for storage in private databases.
- The servers are implemented using the w3h task framework, which allows the execution of compound jobs using work and data flow descriptions in a heterogeneous bioinformatics environment.
- The servers are continually updated and extended based on user requests and suggestions, and new and improved algorithms and methodologies are incorporated into the protein analysis process.
- The development of the three pipelines is user-driven, and checks are being developed through the application of filtering strategies and algorithms that take into account the relationships between domain structure and homology searches.

• Delirium is a common and severe complication in elderly patients, associated with increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and higher risk of post-discharge institutionalization and dementia. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium could help improve recognition and care.

• The study found that patients with delirium had significantly lower mean levels of arginine, higher mean phe/tyr ratios, and lower mean trp/lnaas ratios compared to patients without delirium. These findings suggest disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission and increased oxidative stress in patients with delirium.

• The study also found reduced plasma arginine levels and borderline statistically significantly reduced citrulline levels in patients with delirium, which might be due to a pre-existing arginine deficiency or partially deficient bh4 leading to the generation of superoxide instead of citrulline and no from arginine, indicating an increased status of oxidative stress.

• The study's cross-sectional design, small sample size, and potential selection bias are some limitations that need to be considered while interpreting the results.

* Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, with diabetes impacting approximately 25% of this population.
* Lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications may contribute to the increased prevalence of diabetes in individuals with SMI.
* The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established Health Home programs to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions, and it has been hypothesized that these programs can improve early recognition of developing problems and provide access to preventative somatic care for individuals with SMI.
* A case study of a Behavioral Health Home (BHH) embedded in the Division of Community Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine aimed to identify abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and clarify the severity of such findings to permit enhanced, individualized interventions for individuals with SMI.
* The BHH provided a minimum of two services per month, coordinated by a nurse case manager, and included care coordination, comprehensive transitional care, and health promotion services.
* A population-based health management program was created to target highly prevalent somatic conditions for individuals with SMI, such as diabetes and hypertension.
* Of the 120 patients enrolled in the BHH, 45% were not having their HbA1c levels drawn per the clinic's recommended guideline of every six months for those prescribed antipsychotic medications.
* Thirty-three patients had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, with four newly diagnosed as a result of the BHH initiative. Another 39 patients were identified as having prediabetes.
* Preliminary data indicate that the use of BHH services may be useful in identifying gaps in care, such as laboratory monitoring or missed diagnoses, and allowing for the delivery of preventative and individualized proactive care.
* While more empirical data are needed, the use of a BHH may be a cost-effective way to provide patient-centered care that helps identify gaps in somatic care for individuals with SMI and provide this population with much-needed interventions.

• Oppenheimer's theory challenged the popular idea in the 1980s and 1990s that blamed the growing economic role of women for the decline in marriage.
• The theory proposed that more symmetrical economic roles of men and women would lead to a decline in the gains to marriage, while ideological change and individual autonomy would also contribute to the decline of traditional institutions like marriage.
• Oppenheimer's theory was criticized for neglecting the role of women and for focusing on nonmarriage rather than delays in marriage. She also challenged the micro-economic model of specialization in marriage.
• Oppenheimer's explanation, which focused on men's economic position, was different from the cultural perspective that saw marriage as incompatible with individualistic values.

- Osteoporosis in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by a combination of factors, including motor disability, reduced bone load, long-term glucocorticoid (GCS) treatment, hypovitaminosis D, and inflammation. The level of motor disability and reduced bone load within individual patients seems to be the most significant etiology of bone loss in patients with MS.
- There are currently no specific recommendations for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions in patients with MS. However, identifying and treating the underlying cause should be the goal of therapeutic management. Early identification and preventive treatment of patients at a higher risk of osteoporosis can help avoid bone loss and fractures. Interventions that can counteract osteocyte apoptosis, as well as loss of muscle mass and muscle weakness, are promising.

• Malaria is a major global health issue, caused by Plasmodium parasites, with P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae being the most common species affecting humans. It is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, with Anopheles darlingi being the primary vector in Brazil.

• The Brazilian Ministry of Health directs malaria treatment using chloroquine and primaquine. Chloroquine is used to treat P. vivax and P. ovale infections, while primaquine is the only antimalarial drug effective against all Plasmodium species' gametocytes and hypnozoites, which cause relapses. However, primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

• A study conducted in the Brazilian Amazon found that antimalarial treatment with chloroquine and primaquine led to a decrease in fever and pain symptoms but increased gastrointestinal symptoms and hemolysis or enhanced these symptoms when already present in the patient with malaria. The sensation of itching and stinging can also hinder treatment with chloroquine.

• Healthcare personnel should be aware of the possible adverse side effects of primaquine, including severe hemolysis, especially in patients with G6PD deficiency. Currently, Brazilian control programs do not have a policy for G6PD deficiency screening before malaria treatment, making it crucial for healthcare providers to monitor patients closely during antimalarial treatment.

Several hypotheses for this correlation are proposed, including overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.

• A preliminary study is mentioned, which found a significant correlation between age, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), nocturia, and the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) in patients with LUTS/BPH and ED. The study also found that quality of life (QOL) was significantly correlated with sexual function, even when age was controlled for.

• The source also mentions a study that found overactive bladder (OAB) to be significantly associated with increased prevalence of ED and reduced sexual activity, enjoyment, and satisfaction. The study suggests that rudimentary treatments of LUTS, a risk factor for ED, would be mandatory to effectively improve sexual function in patients with BPH who concurrently have LUTS and ED.

• MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in a cell-specific manner and can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during cancer initiation and progression. Differences in miRNA expression profiles have been observed between normal and cancerous tissue in the endometrium, breast, and ovary. miRNAs can affect the expression of proteins involved in cancer-relevant pathways, making them promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various types of cancer.

• The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process that occurs during development and cancer progression, enabling cancer cells to become more motile and metastatic. The transcription factor ZEB1 plays a crucial role in EMT by binding to the E-cadherin promoter and repressing its expression. The miR-200 family, specifically miR-200c, has been implicated in EMT regulation by repressing ZEB1 and other mesenchymal genes. A double-negative feedback loop exists between miR-200 family members and ZEB1, allowing for plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal states. In breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, loss of mir-200c is associated with chemoresistance and aggressiveness.

• The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence using a midurethral sling (MUS) was first described by Delorme as an outside-in approach and later by de Leval as an inside-out approach to reduce potential injury to the urethra and bladder. A meta-analysis found similar cure rates for retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures.

• Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches in relation to neurovascular structures, but traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the MUS's configuration in relation to the urethra. A cadaveric study using CT-scan image analysis and tantalum wire marked mesh slings found that the MUS tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior and that the out-in MUS are more closely wrapped around the inferior ischiopubic ramus than the in-out MUS.

• The study found that the mean full inner angle in a strict antero-posterior view formed by the in-out MUS measured 122 (95%CI: 107-136) versus 144 (95%CI: 131-151) for the out-in MUS (p = 0.02). The paired differences between the tapes inner angles were significantly different, with a mean difference of 19.8 (median 19.0) (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.008).

• The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory. This technique can be applied to different types of non-radio-opaque implants, allowing for a better spatial understanding of the anatomical position within the pelvis.
