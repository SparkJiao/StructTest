1,"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine the total number of bolts required to make a robe, given that it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.

2. **Identifying the Variables**: Let's denote the amount of blue fiber as \( B \) and the amount of white fiber as \( W \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation**: According to the problem, the total amount of fiber used for the robe is given by:
   \[
   B + \frac{1}{2}B = 2
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation**: Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2}B = 2
   \]

5. **Solving for \( B \)**: To find \( B \), multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
   \[
   B = 2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
   \]

6. **Finding \( W \)**: Since \( B \) is the amount of blue fiber, and we know \( B = \frac{4}{3} \), we can find \( W \) by substituting \( B \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   W = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

7. **Calculating the Total Number of Bolts**: The total number of bolts required is the sum of the blue and white fibers:
   \[
   B + W = \frac{4}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
   \]

8. **Conclusion**: The total number of bolts needed to make the robe is 2.

Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour. To find the time taken to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM, we need to calculate the distance covered and then divide by the speed.

- Distance covered in 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM) = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles
- Time taken to travel 30 miles = 30 miles ÷ 10 mph = 3 hours

So, it takes Tom 3 hours to travel from 1 to 4 PM.

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM
Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. To find the time taken to travel from 4 PM to 1 PM, we need to calculate the distance covered and then divide by the speed.

Luke is building sandcastles, and each level of a sandcastle has half the square footage of the level below it. He starts with a 4-level sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16.

### Step 2: Calculating the Square Footage of Each Level
To find the square footage of each level, we need to follow the pattern given in the problem. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level step by step.

1. **Top Level (Level 4):**
   - Square footage = 16

2. **Level 3:**
   - Square footage = 16 / 2 = 8

3. **Level 2:**
   - Square footage = 8 / 2 = 4

4. **Level 1:**
   - Square footage = 4 / 2 = 2

5. **Level 0:**
   - Square footage = 2 / 2 = 1

### Step 3: Finding the Average Square Footage

\[ \text{Gerald's improved speed} = \text{Lee's improved speed} + 0.10 \times \text{Lee's improved speed} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved speed} = 39.6 + 0.10 \times 39.6 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved speed} = 39.6 + 3.96 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved speed} = 43.56 \text{ seconds per mile} \]

**Step 4: Calculate Gerald's Original Speed**
Gerald's original speed is Lee's original speed plus 10% of Lee's original speed:
\[ \text{Gerald's original speed} = \text{Lee's original speed} + 0.10 \times \text{Lee's original speed} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original speed} = 36 + 0.10 \times 36 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original speed} = 36 + 3.6 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original speed} = 39.6 \text{ seconds per mile} \]

**Step 5: Calculate Gerald's Improved Speed**
Gerald's improved speed is Lee's improved speed plus 10% of Lee's improved speed:
\[ \text{Gerald's improved speed} = \text{Lee's improved speed} + 0.10 \times \text{Lee's improved speed} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved speed} = 39.6 + 0.10 \times 39.6 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved speed} = 39.6 + 3.96 \]

129,"### Step 1: Calculate the total number of visits
The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To find the total number of visits, we need to convert the number of patients into hours and then multiply by the average time per visit.

\[
\text{Total number of visits} = \frac{500 \text{ patients}}{24 \text{ minutes per patient}} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = \frac{500}{24} \times 60 = 208.33 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the doctors
Each doctor charges $150 per hour. Therefore, the total cost for the doctors is:

\[
\text{Total cost for doctors} = 208.33 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars per hour} = 31250 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the hospital
The hospital charges $200 per hour. Therefore, the total cost for the hospital is:

\[
\text{Total cost for the hospital} = 208.33 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars per hour} = 41666 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue
The total revenue is the sum of the total cost for the doctors and the total cost for the hospital:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 31250 \text{ dollars} + 41666 \text{ dollars} = 72916 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit
The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = 72916 \text{ dollars} - 72916 \text{ dollars} = 0 \text{ dollars}

- Total carrots needed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

### 2. Calculate the number of carrots that will be used
- Since each restaurant receives 2 pounds, the number of carrots used = 80 pounds / 2 pounds/restaurant = 40 restaurants

### 3. Calculate the number of carrots that will not be used
- Since there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant receives 2 pounds, the number of carrots not used = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

### 4. Final result
- The number of pounds of carrots that will not be used = 80 pounds

### Explanation
- In the first step, we calculated the total number of carrots needed to be distributed.
- In the second step, we determined the number of carrots that will be used by dividing the total number of restaurants by the number of carrots each restaurant receives.
- In the third step, we calculated the number of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the number of carrots used from the total number of carrots needed.

   - The total population of Soda is 23786.
   - The number of men is 8417.
   - The number of women is 9092.
   - Therefore, the number of children is \(23786 - 8417 - 9092 = 5379\).

2. **Determine the number of children per 1000 inhabitants:**
   - The total number of children is 5379.
   - There are 23786 inhabitants in total.
   - To find the number of children per 1000 inhabitants, we divide 5379 by 23786:
     \[
     \frac{5379}{23786} \approx 0.22
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of children in the city:**
   - To find the number of children in the city, we multiply the number of children per 1000 inhabitants by 1000:
     \[
     0.22 \times 1000 = 220

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
\[
\text{Cards collected in the first month} = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of Pokemon cards collected in the second month
In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
\[
\text{Cards collected in the second month} = 60 - 20 = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of Pokemon cards collected in the first three months
Add the cards collected in each month.
\[
\text{Total cards collected in the first three months} = 60 + 40 + 20 = 120
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of Pokemon cards collected in the third month
In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards collected in the first and second months.
\[
\text{Cards collected in the third month} = 2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200

1. **Morning Water Consumption:**
   - Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning.
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the morning water consumption is \( 5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 25 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Afternoon Water Consumption:**
   - Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the afternoon water consumption is \( 6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 30 \text{ liters} \).

3. **Total Daily Water Consumption:**
   - Summing up the morning and afternoon water consumption gives \( 25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters} \).

### Step 2: Convert to Liters

1. **Convert Liters to Pails:**
   - Each pail contains 5 liters.

211,"### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
1. The total number of eggs produced per day by red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The total number of eggs produced per day by white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

### Step 3: Formulate the Equation
The total number of eggs produced per day is the sum of the eggs produced by red and white chickens:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

### Step 4: Substitute and Solve
Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
If \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs produced per day is:
\[ 3 \times 4 + 5 \times 6 = 12 + 30 = 42 \]
This matches the given total of 42 eggs collected per day.

214,"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute.
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

2. **Initial Water Levels:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

   From the problem, we know:
   - \( B = 2S \)

3. **Current Water Levels:**
   - After 4 minutes, the big pool has \( 4B \) gallons of water.
   - The small pool has \( 4S \) gallons of water.

4. **Water Balance:**
   - The big pool is leaking out at 4 gallons/minute, and the small pool is leaking out at 4 gallons/minute.
   - Therefore, the difference in water between the two pools is:
     \[
     (4B - 4S) - (4S - 4S) = 4B - 4S
     \]

5. **Water Balance Equation:**
   - The difference in water between the two pools is also equal to the amount of water that leaks out over 4 minutes:
     \[
     4B - 4S = 4 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     4B - 4S = 16
     \]

6. **Substitute \( B = 2S \) into the Equation:**
   - Substitute \( B = 2S \) into the equation:
     \[
     4(2S) - 4S = 16
     \]
     \[
     8S - 4S = 16
     \]

Griffin initially had 24 French fries.

1. **Kyle took 5 fries**: 
   - Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.

2. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle**: 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - Griffin now has \(19 + 10 = 29\) fries.

3. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries**:
   - Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\).
   - After giving Ginger \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(29 - x\) fries.

4. **Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken**:
   - Kyle took 5 fries, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - Griffin now has \(29 - x - 2 = 27\) fries.

5. **Final number of fries Griffin had**:
   - We know Griffin had 27 fries at the end.
   - Therefore, \(29 - x - 2 = 27\).

6. **Solving for \(x\)**:

Mico and Marco want to know the sum of their ages in 10 years. They know the sum of their current ages is 20.

### Step 2: Calculating Their Current Ages
Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( M \). According to the problem, their current sum of ages is 20:

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given as 4 times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).

### Step 2: Determine the number of customers kicked out for physical violence
The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as \( x \). Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is \( 3x \).

### Step 3: Set up the equation for the total number of customers kicked out
The total number of customers kicked out is given as 50. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3x = 50 \]

### Step 4: Solve the equation for \( x \)
First, combine like terms:
\[ x + 4x - 5 + 3x = 50 \]
\[ 8x - 5 = 50 \]
Add 5 to both sides:

380,"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, given that she borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%.

2. **Calculating Monthly Interest**: First, we calculate the monthly interest on the loan. The formula for calculating monthly interest is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \frac{\text{Number of Months}}{12}
   \]
   Here, the principal is $3,650, the interest rate is 10%, and the number of months is 5.

3. **Substituting the Values**: Plugging in the values, we get:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}

4. **Simplifying the Calculation**: First, calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167

Each camel has 2 humps, and there are 180 camels. Therefore, the total number of humps from camels is:
\[ 180 \text{ camels} \times 2 \text{ humps/camel} = 360 \text{ humps} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of bumps
Each dromedary has 1 hump, and there are 304 bumps. Therefore, the total number of bumps from dromedaries is:
\[ 304 \text{ dromedaries} \times 1 \text{ bump/dromedary} = 304 \text{ bumps} \]

### Step 4: Set up the equation
The total number of humps (360) is equal to the total number of bumps (304) plus the number of dromedaries (let's call this number \( x \)):
\[ 360 + x = 304 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract 360 from both sides of the equation to isolate \( x \):

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{500}{15} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round \( C \) to the nearest whole number, which is 33.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length to feet since the width is given in yards. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length in feet is 3 × 3 = 9 feet. Now we can solve for the width: 360 = 9 × Width. Solving for Width gives us Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

**Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the room**
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width). We already know the length is 9 feet and the width is 40 feet. Plugging these values into the formula gives us Perimeter = 2 × (9 + 40) = 2 × 49 = 98 feet.

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon is:
$$
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Step 2: Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase
The price increase was $20 per balloon. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
$$
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires.

### 2. Trading Process
Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Value of Sapphires
- Value of 3 sapphires: \( 3 \times 800 = 2400 \) dollars
- Value of 2 rubies: \( 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \) dollars

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Net Value of Sapphires
- Net value of sapphires: \( 2400 - 2400 = 0 \) dollars

Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. Therefore, the volume of soil required for one raised bed is:
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of bags needed
Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Volume per bag}} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost
Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 160 bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies he should eat based on the given ratio
According to the problem, Matt should eat half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

The number of cookies he should eat is \( \frac{1}{2}x \).

### Step 3: Set up the equation based on the total number of cookies
The total number of cookies Matt wants to eat is the sum of the cookies he eats and the extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2 = 5 \]

### Step 4: Solve the equation for \( x \)
First, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x = 3 \]

Next, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
Check if the total number of cookies (5) matches the number of cookies Matt eats (6):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 6 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

The solution is correct.

### Final Answer
Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to eat 5 cookies in total.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

- The length of each remora is 6 inches.
- Benny has 2 remoras.
- Combined length of the remoras = 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = 12 inches.

**Step 2: Calculate the total length of the shark**
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- Convert feet to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.
- Total length of the shark = 120 inches.

**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents**
- Percentage = (Combined length of the remoras / Total length of the shark) * 100

Let's denote the total number of students as **x**.

**Step 2: Set up the equation**
According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means that the remaining one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, the equation is:
\[ \frac{1}{4}x = 20 \]

**Step 3: Solve for x**
To find the total number of students, we need to solve the equation for x:
\[ x = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 80 \]

**Step 4: Verify the solution**
Let's verify our solution by checking if 80 students meet the criteria:
- Three-fourths of 80 students have a desktop computer: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \) students.
- The remaining one-fourth of 80 students do not have a desktop computer: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \) students.

- David found half of what Bodhi found, so let's denote Bodhi's insects as B.
- Together, they collected 43 insects, so D + B + 7 = 43.

From this equation, we can solve for B:
B = 43 - D - 7
B = 36 - D

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, we have:
B = 0.5 * B
B = 0.5 * (43 - D - 7)
B = 21.5 - 0.5D

Now we have two expressions for B:
1) B = 36 - D
2) B = 21.5 - 0.5D

We can set these equal to each other:
36 - D = 21.5 - 0.5D
36 - 21.5 = D - 0.5D
14.5 = 0.5D
D = 14.5 / 0.5

- Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot.
- Let \( H \) represent the cost of the house.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
- According to the problem, the house and the lot cost $120,000 together. Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  H + L = 120,000
  \]

### Step 3: Express the Relationship Between the House and the Lot
- The problem states that the house costs three times as much as the lot. Therefore, we can write:
  \[
  H = 3L
  \]

### Step 4: Substitute and Solve for \( L \)
- Substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:

We need to determine how much money Jeff gets compared to Brad, given that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.

### Step 2: Set up the equation
Let's denote:
- \( J \) as the amount of money Jeff gets.
- \( B \) as the amount of money Brad gets.

According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so we can write:
\[ J = 4B \]

### Step 3: Express the total amount
The total amount of money they have together is 100 dollars:
\[ J + B = 100 \]

### Step 4: Substitute the equation from Step 2 into the total amount equation
Substitute \( J = 4B \) into \( J + B = 100 \):
\[ 4B + B = 100 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( B \)
Combine like terms:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in the second week.**
In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Since she reads 2 pages per minute, the total time she spent reading in the second week is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{100 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages per minute}} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]
So, the total time she spent reading in the second week is 50 minutes.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in the second week.**
Using her reading speed and the total time, the total number of pages she read in the second week is:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 50 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} = \frac{200}{3} \text{ pages} \approx 66.67 \text{ pages} \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. If 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans are red, then the number of red jelly beans is 99% of the total number of jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). Then, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).

### Step 2: Determine the number of green jelly beans
The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

### Step 3: Set up the equation for the total number of jelly beans
The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( B \)
Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2.99B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{2.99} \]
\[ B \approx 1500 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of red and green jelly beans
Using the value of \( B \), we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ \text{Number of green jelly beans} = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

674,"**Step 1: Convert the height from feet to inches**
First, we need to convert the height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply the height in feet by 12:
20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days required**
Now that we know the bamboo grows 240 inches in 20 feet, we need to determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. We divide the total height required by the daily growth rate:
600 inches / 240 inches/day = 2.5 days

**Step 3: Round up to the nearest whole number**
Since the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to account for any potential growth beyond the 2.5 days we calculated. This ensures that the bamboo reaches its target height.

**Final Result:**
The bamboo will reach its target height of 600 inches in **3 days**.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints10MathFormat'}

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 96 hash browns, we first need to determine how many potatoes are required for one hash brown. Given that 36 hash browns require 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of potatoes needed for one hash brown as follows:
- Total potatoes for 96 hash browns = 96 potatoes
- Total potatoes for 36 hash browns = 36 potatoes
- Potatoes per hash brown = 96 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 2.67 potatoes per hash brown

Since we can't have a fraction of a potato, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 potatoes per hash brown.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 96 potatoes**
Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 96 potatoes. We can use the same ratio as before:
- Potatoes per hash brown = 2.67 potatoes per hash brown
- Potatoes for 96 potatoes = 96 potatoes / 2.67 potatoes per hash brown

**Step 3: Calculate the number of hash browns that can be made**
Finally, we can calculate how many hash browns can be made with 96 potatoes by dividing the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes needed for one hash brown:
- Hash browns that can be made = 96 potatoes / 2.67 potatoes per hash brown

**Step 4: Perform the calculation**
Let's perform the calculation:
- Hash browns that can be made = 96 potatoes / 2.67 potatoes per hash brown ≈ 36.07 hash browns

Since we can't have a fraction of a hash brown, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 36 hash browns.

687,"### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( T \) be the age of the twin.
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of the triplet.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the twin who is 7 years older than the triplet.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
1. The combined age of the twin and the triplet is 44:
   \[
   T + T_1 + T_2 = 44
   \]
2. The twin is 7 years older than the triplet:
   \[
   T = T_1 + 7
   \]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve
Substitute \( T_1 \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
T + (T_1 + 7) + T_2 = 44
\]
Simplify:
\[
2T_1 + T_2 + 7 = 44
\]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
2T_1 + T_2 = 37
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( T_2 \)
We now have a simple linear equation:
\[
T_2 = 37 - 2T_1
\]

### Step 5: Determine Possible Values
Since \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) must be positive integers, \( T_1 \) must be an integer such that \( 37 - 2T_1 \) is also an integer. This implies \( T_1 \) must be an integer such that \( 37 - 2T_1 \geq 0 \):
\[
37 \geq 2T_1
\]
\[
T_1 \leq 18.5
\]

Since \( T_1 \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( T_1 \) are 1, 2, 3, ..., 18.

### Step 6: Calculate \( T_2 \) for Each Possible \( T_1 \)
For each \( T_1 \), calculate \( T_2 \):
\[
T_2 = 37 - 2T_1
\]

### Step 7: Verify the Solution
Check if the calculated \( T_2 \) is a positive integer:
- For \( T_1 = 1 \):
  \[
  T_2 = 37 - 2 \times 1 = 35 \quad (\text{not valid since } T_2 \text{ must be positive})
  \]
- For \( T_1 = 2 \):
  \[
  T_2 = 37 - 2 \times 2 = 33 \quad (\text{valid})
  \]
- For \( T_1 = 3 \):
  \[
  T_2 = 37 - 2 \times 3 = 31 \quad (\text{valid})
  \]
- Continue this process until \( T_1 = 18 \):
  \[
  T_2 = 37 - 2 \times 18 = 1 \quad (\text{valid})
  \]

### Step 8: Determine the Twin's Age
The valid pairs \((T_1, T_2)\) are:
- \( (2, 33) \)
- \( (3, 31) \)
- \( (4, 29) \)
- \( (5, 27) \)
- \( (6, 25) \)
- \( (7, 23) \)
- \( (8, 21) \)
- \( (9, 19) \)
- \( (10, 17) \)
- \( (11, 15) \)
- \( (12, 13) \)
- \( (13, 11) \)
- \( (14, 9) \)
- \( (15, 7) \)
- \( (16, 5) \)

**Step 1:** Rong has been saving 20 coins per month for 10 years.
**Reasoning step:**  
To calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved in 10 years, we need to multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in 10 years (which is 120 months).

**Step 2:** Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month.
**Reasoning step:**  
To find out how many coins Neil has saved per month, we need to calculate 2/5 of Rong's monthly savings. Then, we multiply this amount by the number of months in 10 years (120 months).

**Step 3:** Calculate Neil's monthly savings.

#### Explanation:

1. **Daily Gum Consumption**: Parker chews 4 pieces of gum each day.
2. **Gum Pack Quantity**: A pack contains 15 pieces of gum.

- 5 students like to play basketball.
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

- The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, so it is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total number of students:
\[ 10 \text{ (basketball players)} + 5 \text{ (baking players)} + x \text{ (video game players)} + 10 \text{ (music players)} = 50 \]

Simplifying the equation:

756,"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of votes against the new regulation.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     F = 2A
     \]

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - There are 33 people on the council.

4. **Total Votes:**
   - The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and votes against:
     \[
     F + A = 33
     \]

5. **Substitute \( F \) in the Total Equation:**
   - Substitute \( F = 2A \) into the total equation:
     \[
     2A + A = 33
     \]

6. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3A = 33
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     A = 11
     \]

7. **Find \( F \):**
   - Substitute \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
     \[
     F = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

- Size large: Half as many as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Size extra-large: Six more than size large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can calculate the total number of Pomeranians as follows:
- Total number of Pomeranians = 6 girls × 3/3 = 6 × 3 = 18 puppies

### Step 2: Determine the number of Pomeranians that are boys
Since two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate the number of Pomeranians that are boys as follows:
- Number of Pomeranians that are boys = 18 puppies × 2/3 = 18 × 2 = 36 puppies

### Step 3: Determine the total number of puppies
Now, we can calculate the total number of puppies by adding the number of Pomeranians that are girls and boys:

The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house's shingles. Let's denote the number of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \). Therefore, the first house needs \( \frac{x}{2} \) shingles.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of shingles needed for the first two houses
The first house needs 1/2 of the second house's shingles, so the total shingles needed for the first two houses is \( \frac{x}{2} + x \).

### Step 3: Calculate the number of shingles needed for the third house
The third house needs double the number of shingles needed for the first house. Therefore, the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) shingles.

### Step 4: Set up the equation for the total shingles needed
The total number of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250 \]

### Step 5: Solve the equation for \( x \)
Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 250 \]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

The third house needs \( x \) shingles, which is 100 shingles.

Explanation of reasoning steps:

1. **Glass Chips Required for Mosaic**: Milo needs 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic.
2. **Number of Chips in Each Bag**: Each bag contains 72 chips.
3. **Total Chips in Two Bags**: Since Milo has two bags, the total number of chips is \(2 \times 72 = 144\).
4. **Mosaic Length Calculation**: To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to determine how many chips are required to cover the mosaic area. Since each chip covers 1 square inch, the total number of chips needed is equal to the mosaic length in inches.
5. **Mosaic Length**: Given that each chip covers 1 square inch, the total number of chips needed is equal to the mosaic length in inches. Since each chip covers 1 square inch, the total number of chips needed is equal to the mosaic length in inches. Therefore, the mosaic length is 144 inches.

815,"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of each ingredient used:**
   - Let's denote the amount of sugar as \( S \).
   - The amount of citrus zest used is twice the amount of sugar, so it is \( 2S \).
   - The amount of salt used is twice the amount of sugar, so it is \( 2S \).
   - The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so it is \( 2 \times 2S = 4S \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of each ingredient used:**
   - The total amount of salt used is \( S + 2S + 2S + 4S = 11S \).
   - The total amount of oil used is \( 4S \).

3. **Determine the total amount of the salt scrub:**
   - Since each jar of the salt scrub contains 10 ounces, the total amount of the salt scrub is \( 10 \times 11S = 110S \) ounces.

- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
1. **Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:**
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

2. **Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:**
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

3. **The total number of books is 85:**
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve
Substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
\]

Simplify and solve for \( F \):
\[
2A + 25 + F = 85
\]
\[
2A + F = 60
\]
\[
F = 60 - 2A
\]

### Step 4: Use the Second Equation to Find \( A \)
Substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation \( F = 60 - 2A \):
\[
F = 60 - 2(F - 12)
\]
\[
F = 60 - 2F + 24
\]
\[
F = 84 - 2F
\]
\[
3F = 84
\]
\[
F = 28
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Check if \( F = 28 \) satisfies all the original conditions:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

Substitute \( F = 28 \):
1. \( S = 28 + 25 = 53 \)
2. \( A = 28 - 12 = 16 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 53 + 16 + 28 = 97 \)

Since 97 is not equal to 85, there seems to be an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

### Step 6: Correct the Problem Setup
Given the constraints and the total number of books, let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation.

### Step 7: Correct Interpretation
Given:
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.
- The total number of books is 85.

Let's assume the correct interpretation is:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

Substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into \( S = A + 25 \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the total books equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]
\[
2F + 13 - 12 = 85
\]
\[
2F + 1 = 85
\]
\[
2F = 84
\]
\[
F = 42
\]

### Step 8: Verify the Solution
Check if \( F = 42 \) satisfies all the original conditions:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

Substitute \( F = 42 \):
1. \( S = 42 + 25 = 67 \)
2. \( A = 42 - 12 = 30 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 67 + 30 + 42 = 149 \)

Since 149 is not equal to 85, there seems to be an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation.

### Step 9: Correct Interpretation
Given the constraints and the total number of books, let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation.

### Step 10: Correct Interpretation
Given:
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.
- The total number of books is 85.

Let's assume the correct interpretation is:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

Substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into \( S = A + 25 \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the total books equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]
\[
2F + 13 - 12 = 85

\[
2F + 1 = 85

903,"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

### Step 1: Calculate Material Needed for Small Masks
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, the calculation is:
  \[
  \text{Material needed for small masks} = \frac{20 \text{ masks} \times 2 \text{ yards/mask}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Material Needed for Large Masks
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, the calculation is:
  \[
  \text{Material needed for large masks} = \frac{8 \text{ masks} \times 2.25 \text{ yards/mask}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Material Needed
- Total material needed is the sum of the material required for small and large masks:
  \[
  \text{Total material needed} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
  \]

### Final Answer
Jo would need **16 yards** of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints6MathFormat'}

913,"- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y.
- Benny threw 2R pieces of bologna at red balloons.
- Benny threw 3Y pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.
- The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.
- The total number of red balloons is 20.
- We can set up the equation: 2R + 3Y = 58.
- We also know that 20 = R.
- Substituting R = 20 into the equation, we get: 2(20) + 3Y = 58.
- Simplifying, we get: 40 + 3Y = 58.
- Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get: 3Y = 18.
- Dividing both sides by 3, we get: Y = 6.
- Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

Final result: There are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints20MathFormat'}

2. **Calculate monthly mileage**: Jon drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, so the total monthly mileage is \(100 \times 30 = 3000\) miles.
3. **Determine the number of tune-ups needed**: Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to find out how many 1000-mile segments are in 3000 miles. This can be calculated as \(3000 \div 1000 = 3\).

   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each page is 100 pages to the inch.
   - Each page is printed on both sides.

2. **Calculating the Total Number of Pages:**
   - Since each page is 100 pages to the inch, and there are 2 pages per inch (one on each side), the total number of pages is:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 2 \text{ pages/side} = 300 \text{ pages}

3. **Verification:**
   - We can verify this by considering the total number of pages in a book that is 1.5 inches thick. If each page is 100 pages to the inch, and there are 2 pages per inch, then:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 2 \text{ pages/side} = 300 \text{ pages}

- **4.** Simplifying the expression, we get \( 4J + 2J + 2J - 2 = 8J - 2 \).

- **5.** Since the total number of balls Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey carried together is equal to the number of balls the coach brought to practice, we have \( 8J - 2 = 12 \).

- **6.** Solving for \( J \), we get \( 8J = 14 \), so \( J = \frac{14}{8} = 1.75 \).

- **7.** Since the number of balls must be an integer, we need to check if \( J = 1.75 \) is a valid solution. If \( J = 1.75 \), then Jason carried \( 2 \times 1.75 = 3.5 \) balls, which is not an integer. Therefore, \( J \) must be an integer.

- **8.** Since \( J \) must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the total number of balls carried by the three boys, which is \( 4J + 2J + (2J - 2) = 8J - 2 \). If \( J = 1 \), then the total number of balls is \( 8 \times 1 - 2 = 6 \).

- **9.** If \( J = 1 \), then Jason carried 1 ball, Jordan carried 3 balls, and Jeffrey carried 5 balls. The total number of balls is \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \).

- **10.** Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 9.

963,"**Final result:** Stan has caught 120 Pokemon.

**Step 1:** Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).
**Step 2:** According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \text{Stan's catch} = 4A - 13 \]
**Step 3:** Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \text{Alex's catch} = \text{Stan's catch} + 5 \]
**Step 4:** The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + \text{Stan's catch} + \text{Alex's catch} = 339 \]
**Step 5:** Substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 4, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339 \]
**Step 6:** Simplifying the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 11 = 339 \]
**Step 7:** Solving for \( A \):
\[ 9A = 350 \]
\[ A = \frac{350}{9} \approx 38.89 \]
Since the number of Pokemon caught must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 39. Therefore, Adelwolfe has caught 39 Pokemon.

**Step 8:** Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ \text{Stan's catch} = 4A - 13 = 4(39) - 13 = 156 - 13 = 143 \]
**Step 9:** Finally, we verify the total number of Pokemon caught:

Pat wants to fill the flower bed with plants that are 12 inches wide. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the width of each plant is 12 inches.

Pat has 17 flowers already owned. Therefore, the number of plants needed is:
\[

Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 1.5 feet = 18 inches.

The number of gaps between plants is:
\[
\text{Number of gaps} = \frac{\text{Total length of the flower bed}}{\text{Width of each plant} - \text{Gap width}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{12 \text{ inches} - 18 \text{ inches}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{-6 \text{ inches}} = 17 \text{ gaps}

Tobias's howl lasts for 20 seconds.

**Step 2: Calculate the duration of Chikote's howl**
Chikote's howl lasts for twice as long as Tobias's. Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the duration of Igneous's howl**
Igneous's howl lasts for as long as the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls. The combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls is:

996,"- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
- The total age of the four children is 20.
- Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, calculate the average age of the group:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Next, determine Helene's age:
\[
\text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, calculate the total age of the children excluding Helene and Alessandro:
\[
\text{Total age excluding Helene and Alessandro} = \text{Total age} - \text{Helene's age} - \text{Alessandro's age} = 20 - 10 - 4 = 6
\]

Since Helene is 10 years old and the total age of the children excluding Helene and Alessandro is 6, the age of Wilfred must be:
\[
\text{Wilfred's age} = \text{Total age excluding Helene and Alessandro} - \text{Helene's age} = 6 - 10 = -4
\]

However, this result is not possible because age cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total age of the children excluding Helene and Alessandro is 6, and Helene is 10 years old. This means Wilfred must be:
\[
\text{Wilfred's age} = \text{Total age excluding Helene and Alessandro} - \text{Helene's age} - \text{Alessandro's age} = 6 - 10 - 4 = -4
\]

This indicates a mistake in the problem setup or interpretation. Let's recheck the total age excluding Helene and Alessandro:
\[
\text{Total age excluding Helene and Alessandro} = 6
\]
\[
\text{Helene's age} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Alessandro's age} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Wilfred's age} = \text{Total age excluding Helene and Alessandro} - \text{Helene's age} - \text{Alessandro's age} = 6 - 10 - 4 = -4

This result is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem constraints. The total age excluding Helene and Alessandro is 6, and Helene is 10 years old. This means Wilfred must be:

- **Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.**
- **The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception.**
- **If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?**

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies brought by all guests:**
   - There are 100 guests.
   - Each guest brought 15 cookies.
   - Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies the bride gave to the church next door:**
   - The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.
   - Cookies given to church next door = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of cookies left for the church next door:**
   - Total cookies = 1500 cookies.
   - Cookies given to church next door = 750 cookies.
   - Cookies left for church next door = 1500 cookies - 750 cookies = 750 cookies.

4. **Determine the number of people in the church next door:**
   - Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies.

Assume the watermelon is a perfect sphere with a radius of 1 meter. The area of the base of the watermelon is given by the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \). For a radius of 1 meter, the area is:
\[ A = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi \text{ square meters} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of each slice
Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let the area of each kid's slice be \( A_k \). Then, the area of each adult's slice is \( 2A_k \). Since there are 6 slices in total, the total area of the slices is:
\[ 6 \times 2A_k = 12A_k \]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of each slice
The total area of the slices is equal to the area of the watermelon:
\[ 12A_k = \pi \]
\[ A_k = \frac{\pi}{12} \]

### Step 4: Determine the area of each slice for adults
Each adult's slice is twice the area of a kid's slice:
\[ 2A_k = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{6} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets
The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Area of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total area of the slices}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\frac{\pi}{6}}{12} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\pi}{72} \right) \times 100 \approx 1.19\% \]

**Reasoning:** Since Peter and Martha have the same number of chocolate bars in each box, we can denote this number as x.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars each has.**
**Reasoning:** Peter has 4 boxes with x chocolate bars each, so he has 4x chocolate bars. Martha has 7 boxes with x chocolate bars each, so she has 7x chocolate bars.

**Step 3: Set up the equations based on the given totals.**
**Reasoning:** Peter's total is 64 chocolate bars, and Martha's total is 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equations:
\[ 4x = 64 \]
\[ 7x = 56 \]

**Step 4: Solve for x.**
**Reasoning:** To find the value of x, we divide both sides of each equation by 4 and 7 respectively:
\[ x = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ x = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars between Peter and Martha.**
**Reasoning:** Since Peter has 16 chocolate bars and Martha has 8 chocolate bars, the difference is:

James reads 18 pages in 10 minutes. To find his reading speed, we divide the number of pages by the time taken:
18 pages / 10 minutes = 1.8 pages per minute

**Step 2: Calculate the total time spent reading**
Since James reads 18 pages and his reading speed is 1.8 pages per minute, we multiply the number of pages by the reading speed:
18 pages * 1.8 pages per minute = 32.4 minutes

**Step 3: Verify the calculation**
To ensure accuracy, we can multiply the number of pages by the reading speed:
18 pages * 1.8 pages per minute = 32.4 minutes

- Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
- She earned $120 from the sales.
- Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

Let's calculate the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold:

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
2. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2S \).
3. The price of each small stuffed animal is $4.

The bed is a rectangle with a length of 6 feet and a width of 8 feet. The area of the bed is:
\[ \text{Area of bed} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ square feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the extra fabric needed
Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. The dimensions of these extra pieces are:
- 2 feet longer: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) feet
- 2 feet wider: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) feet

The area of each extra piece is:
\[ \text{Area of extra piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total area of the extra fabric
Since Jim needs two extra pieces, the total area of the extra fabric is:
\[ \text{Total area of extra fabric} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total area of fabric needed
The total area of fabric Jim needs to buy is the sum of the area of the bed and the area of the extra fabric:
\[ \text{Total area of fabric} = \text{Area of bed} + \text{Total area of extra fabric} = 48 + 160 = 208 \text{ square feet} \]

The second person took $80 more than the first person. Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). Therefore, the amount taken by the second person is \( x + 80 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the amount taken by the third person
The third person took twice what the second person took. So, the amount taken by the third person is \( 2(x + 80) \).

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount taken by all three people
The total amount taken by all three people is the sum of the amounts taken by each person. Therefore, the total amount is:

1084,"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine how much of the 100 feet of fence is left over after Sam and Harry split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam.
2. **Setting Up the Equation**: Let's denote the amount of fence Sam has as \( S \) feet. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's fence will be \( S + 60 \) feet.
3. **Total Fence Length**: The total length of the fence is 100 feet. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the fences they share plus the lengths of the fences they each have is 100 feet. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   S + (S + 60) + (S + 60 + 60) = 100
   \]
4. **Simplifying the Equation**: Simplify the equation to find the total length of the fence they share:
   \[
   S + S + 60 + S + 60 + 60 = 100
   \]
   \[
   3S + 180 = 100
   \]
5. **Solving for \( S \)**: Subtract 180 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):
   \[
   3S = 100 - 180
   \]
   \[
   3S = -80
   \]
   \[
   S = -\frac{80}{3}

   \[
   S = -26.67

However, based on the given information and the standard interpretation of the problem, the length of the fence they share is indeed 100 feet.
6. **Conclusion**: Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet and they share it equally, each of them gets 50 feet of the fence. Therefore, the amount left over for Sam is:

   100 - 50 = 50

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( N \) represent the total number of students in the school.
   - According to the problem, 40% of the school population is made up of boys, which can be expressed as \( 0.4N \).
   - We know that 240 boys represent 40% of the total student population, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     0.4N = 240

- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, \( A = M \).

**Step 2: Use the information about Camden and Sarah**
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
- Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

**Step 3: Express the total number of eggs painted by all four**
- The total number of eggs painted is 56.
- Therefore, \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

**Step 4: Substitute the expressions from Step 2 and Step 3 into the total equation**
- \( A + M + (A + 12) + S = 56 \)
- Simplify: \( 2A + 2M + S + 12 = 56 \)
- Subtract 12 from both sides: \( 2A + 2M + S = 44 \)

**Step 5: Use the information about the number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**
- \( C = S + 12 \)
- Substitute \( C \) in the total equation: \( 2A + 2M + (S + 12) = 56 \)

Grandma walks 3 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = 0.075 \text{ miles per minute} \]

### Step 2: Determine the time spent on the sidewalk
Grandma spends 2 miles on the sidewalk, and her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times 0.075 \text{ miles per minute} = 0.15 \text{ miles per minute} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk
To find out how long it takes her to walk 2 miles on the sidewalk, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{0.15 \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{2}{0.15} \text{ minutes} = \frac{20}{1.5} \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{3} \text{ minutes} \approx 13.33 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time for the entire walk
Grandma walks 3 miles in total, and we already know the time spent on the sidewalk is approximately 13.33 minutes. Therefore, the total time for the entire walk is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ miles} + 13.33 \text{ minutes} = 3 + 13.33 = 16.33 \text{ minutes} \]

- We have two lottery tickets: one with a 20% chance of winning, and another that is three times more likely to win.
- We need to find the probability that both tickets are winners.

### 2. Calculating the Probability of the First Ticket Winning
- The probability of the first ticket winning is given as 20%, or 0.20.
- Therefore, the probability of the first ticket not winning is:
  - \( 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 \)

### 3. Calculating the Probability of the Second Ticket Winning
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.
- Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is:
  - \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \)

### 4. Calculating the Combined Probability of Both Tickets Winning
- Since the two tickets are independent, the probability that both tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:
  - \( 0.80 \times 0.60 = 0.48 \)

The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total. Since there are four different colors of paint (red, white, purple, and yellow), and half of the mural is yellow, we can calculate the total number of paint cans used as follows:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining paint is used for the other three colors.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the dentist fixes:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ teeth} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of teeth James has.**
James has 30 teeth.

**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes.**
To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{11}{30} \right) \times 100 \approx 36.67\% \]

1181,"**Step 1: Define Variables**
- Let \( C \) represent Wendy's current age.
- Let \( W \) represent Colin's current age.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information**
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   W + 25 = \frac{1}{3}C
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**
1. From the first equation, solve for \( W \):
   \[
   W = 5C + 35
   \]

2. Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
   \[
   5C + 35 + 25 = \frac{1}{3}C
   \]

3. Simplify and solve for \( C \):
   \[
   5C + 60 = \frac{1}{3}C
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   15C + 180 = C

   \[
   14C = -180
   \]

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

### Step 2: Determine the number of snowballs melted per hour
Jay melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. First, convert 15 minutes to hours:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes} = \frac{15}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.25 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the number of snowballs melted in one hour:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs} \times 0.25 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ snowballs} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the net number of snowballs built per hour
Subtract the number of melted snowballs from the number of snowballs built:

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys 20 bottles of cognac. Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is 1.5 times the cost of scotch. The total cost for cognac is calculated as follows:
- Cost of scotch: $600 / 10 = $60
- Cost of cognac per bottle: $600 / 10 = $60
- Cost of cognac per bottle: $60 * 1.5 = $90
- Total cost of cognac: $90 * 20 = $1800

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of scotch and cognac**
The total cost of scotch and cognac is the sum of the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac:
- Total cost of scotch: $600
- Total cost of cognac: $1800
- Total cost: $600 + $1800 = $2400

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of scotch and cognac per bottle**
The cost of scotch and cognac per bottle is calculated by dividing the total cost of scotch and cognac by the number of bottles:
- Cost of scotch and cognac per bottle: $2400 / 100 = $24

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of scotch and cognac per bottle**
The total cost of scotch and cognac per bottle is the sum of the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac per bottle:
- Total cost of scotch and cognac per bottle: $24 + $24 = $48

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost of scotch and cognac**
The total cost of scotch and cognac is the sum of the cost of scotch and the total cost of scotch and cognac per bottle:

- Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
First, isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 8 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 4(8) + 8 = 32 + 8 = 40 \]
The equation holds true, confirming our solution.

Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C. According to the problem, the number of brownies is C - 2. Since the total number of people is 5 and each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C - 2 = \frac{10}{5} \]
\[ C - 2 = 2 \]
\[ C = 4 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of cupcakes**
From the equation \( C - 2 = 2 \), we can solve for C:
\[ C = 2 + 2 \]
\[ C = 4 \]

**Step 3: Verify the solution**
Let's double-check the solution by calculating the number of brownies:

Rose will make a profit of $0.40.

#### Explanation:

1. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40.
   - Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal \(5 \times 12 = 60\) eggs.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 60 eggs is $2.40.

2. **Selling Price Calculation:**
   - Rose sells the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs.
   - To find the cost per egg, we divide the total selling price by the number of eggs sold per unit: \( \frac{1}{3} \) dollars per egg.
   - Therefore, the cost per egg is \( \frac{1}{3} \) dollars per egg.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price.
   - Profit per egg is \( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{60} \).
   - To find the profit per egg, we need a common denominator: \( \frac{20}{60} - \frac{1}{60} = \frac{19}{60} \) dollars per egg.
   - Therefore, the profit per egg is \( \frac{19}{60} \) dollars.
   - To find the total profit, we multiply the profit per egg by the total number of eggs sold: \( \frac{19}{60} \times 60 = 19 \) dollars.

1262,"### Step 1: Calculate John's Speed After Training
John's initial speaking speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
\[ 150 \text{ WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Time to Speak 10 Pages
John's normal speaking speed is 150 WPM. To speak 10 pages, he needs to speak 10 pages at 375 WPM. The time required to speak 10 pages is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of Pages}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10 \text{ pages}}{375 \text{ WPM}} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Time
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10}{375} \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Convert Minutes to Hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10}{375} \times \frac{1}{60} \text{ hours} \]

### Step 5: Simplify the Fraction
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10}{375 \times 60} \text{ hours} = \frac{10}{22500} \text{ hours} \]

### Step 6: Convert Hours to Minutes
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10}{22500} \times 60 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 7: Simplify the Final Calculation
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10 \times 60}{22500} \text{ minutes} = \frac{600}{22500} \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 8: Final Calculation
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{600}{22500} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = \frac{36000}{22500} \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 9: Simplify the Fraction
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{36000}{22500} \times \frac{1}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{36000}{135000} \text{ hours} \]

### Step 10: Final Answer
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{36000}{135000} \text{ hours} = \frac{36000 \div 3000}{135000 \div 3000} \text{ hours} = \frac{12}{45} \text{ hours} = \frac{4}{15} \text{ hours} \]

1. **Calculate the total weight of John's car and luggage:**
   - Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
   - Weight of luggage: 250 pounds
   - Total weight: 1200 + 250 = 1450 pounds

2. **Determine the force required to move the car:**
   - The force to move the car is 1% of its weight.
   - Force = 1% of 1450 pounds = 0.01 * 1450 = 14.5 pounds

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - The force calculation is correct because 1% of 1450 pounds is indeed 14.5 pounds.

4. **Consider the weight of the children:**
   - Each child weighs 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of the children: 75 * 2 = 150 pounds

5. **Calculate the total weight of the children and the car:**
   - Total weight = Weight of car + Weight of luggage + Weight of children
   - Total weight = 1450 + 250 + 150 = 1850 pounds

6. **Determine the force required to move the car with the children:**
   - Force = 1% of 1850 pounds = 0.01 * 1850 = 18.5 pounds

7. **Compare the calculated force with the actual force:**
   - The calculated force of 14.5 pounds is slightly less than the actual force of 18.5 pounds.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The force required to move the car with the children is 18.5 pounds, which is slightly less than the 14.5 pounds calculated.

1303,"### Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by Nate
Nate digs for 14 days and starts filling in 9 holes a day. Therefore, the total number of holes he digs is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ holes/day} = 126 \text{ holes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog
The dog digs for 14 days and starts digging 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the total number of holes the dog digs is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ holes/day} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the net number of holes dug by the dog
The dog digs 6 holes per night, so the net number of holes the dog digs per day is:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} - 9 \text{ holes/day} = -3 \text{ holes/day} \]
Since the dog digs 6 holes per night, the net number of holes the dog digs per day is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ holes/day}}{6 \text{ holes/day}} = 1 \text{ hole/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of holes the dog digs over 14 days is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hole/day} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of holes filled by Nate
Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day and digs 14 days, so the total number of holes filled by Nate is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 126 \text{ holes} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of holes filled by the dog
The dog starts digging holes on vacation and digs 14 days, so the total number of holes dug by the dog is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ holes/day} = 126 \text{ holes} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the net number of holes filled by the dog
The dog digs 6 holes per night, so the net number of holes the dog digs per day is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ holes/day}}{6 \text{ holes/day}} = 1 \text{ hole/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of holes the dog digs over 14 days is:
