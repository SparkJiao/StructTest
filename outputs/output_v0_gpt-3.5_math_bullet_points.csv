Let's denote the number of miles Walt walked on Monday as `x`.

### 2
On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked `6x` miles on Tuesday.

### 3
His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, so the total distance he walked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday can be represented as `x + 6x + y = 41`, where `y` is the number of miles he walked on Wednesday.

### 4
We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday, so we can substitute `x = 4` into the equation from step 3: `4 + 6(4) + y = 41`.

### 5
Solving the equation from step 4, we get `4 + 24 + y = 41`, which simplifies to `28 + y = 41`.

**Step 3** 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation: B - 4*4 = 2(S - 4*4).

- Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo

### 3
Calculate the percentage increase in revenue:
- Percentage increase = ((Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors) / Daily revenue from tractors) * 100

### 4
Substitute the values into the formulas:
- Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
- Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

### 5
Calculate the percentage increase:
- Percentage increase = (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100

### 6
Simplify the calculation:
- Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100

### 7
Calculate the final percentage increase:
- Percentage increase = 0.1 * 100

### 8
Convert the percentage to a percentage value:
- Percentage increase = 10%

Let's denote the number of apples Lucy picked on Tuesday as x.

### 2
On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so she picked 2x apples.

### 3
On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, which means she sold x apples.

### 4
Given that she sold all the apples picked on Monday, and she sold them at $4 per piece, we can calculate that she sold 14 apples on Monday (since $56 / $4 = 14).

### 5
Therefore, the total number of apples picked over the three days is the sum of the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which is x + 14 + 2x.

### 6
Since we know that the total number of apples picked over the three days is equal to 14 + x + 2x, we can set up the equation 14 + x + 2x = total number of apples picked.

### 7
Solving the equation 14 + x + 2x = total number of apples picked, we get 14 + 3x = total number of apples picked.

### 8
Given that the total number of apples picked over the three days is equal to 14 + 3x, and we know that Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday, we can substitute 14 for the total number of apples picked in the equation.

Substituting 14 for the total number of apples picked in the equation 14 + 3x = total number of apples picked, we get 14 + 3x = 14.

Solving the equation 14 + 3x = 14, we get 3x = 0, which means x = 0. Therefore, Lucy picked 0 apples on Tuesday.

### 2
Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

### 3
Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathered 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, so she gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

### 4
Therefore, Joanne gathered a total of 30 + 15 + x apples, and her sister gathered 60 + 45 apples.

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as $x$.

### 2
Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate is $x + 1$.

### 3
The total number of females is 6, so the total number of dumplings they ate is $6x$.

### 4
The total number of males is 8, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings they ate is $8(x + 1)$.

### 5
Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten.

### 6
Therefore, we can set up the equation $6x + 8(x + 1) = 8x + 8$.

### 7
Solving the equation, we get $6x + 8x + 8 = 8x + 8$.

### 8
Combining like terms, we get $14x + 8 = 8x + 8$.

### 9
Solving for $x$, we get $6x = 0$, which means $x = 0$.

### 10
Since each female ate 3 dumplings, Larry cooked $6x = 6(0) = 0$ dumplings.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equal to $8 \times 12 + 4 = 100$ inches.

### 3
We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be represented as: $100 = 9x + 10$.

### 4
Now, we can solve the equation $100 = 9x + 10$ to find the value of $x$.

### 5
Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives $90 = 9x$.

### 6

Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read in one hour as $x$.

### 2
Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ezra read $2x$ books in one hour.

### 3
Given that Ezra has read 300 books this hour, we can set up the equation $2x = 300$.

### 4
Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 150$.

### 5
Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so his total number of books read is $300 + 150 = 450$.

### 6
Ahmed has read $150$ books in total.

First, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. 
She has 3 stuffed puppies + 5 stuffed koalas + 2 stuffed zebras + 4 stuffed frogs = 14 stuffed animals.

### 2
Next, we need to calculate what 30% of her total stuffed animals is. 
30% of 14 = 0.30 * 14 = 4.2

### 3
Since Bubbles cannot have a fraction of a stuffed animal, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
Therefore, she needs to have at least 5 stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.

### 4
Now, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she already has. 
Since she currently has 0 stuffed goats, we need to subtract this from the 5 goats she needs to have.

### 2
We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: B + S + P = 341.

### 3
We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so we can write the equation: B = S + 12.

### 4
Additionally, we know that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can write the equation: S = 3P.

### 5
Now we can substitute the equations from steps 3 and 4 into the equation from step 2 to solve for the number of cards Becca has.

### 6
Substitute S + 12 for B in the equation B + S + P = 341: S + 12 + S + 3S = 341.

Let's start by determining how high Pompei can lift a mountain in comparison to Saskay.
- Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
- Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.

### 2
Next, we need to find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain compared to Saskay.
- Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.

- Given that it takes 3 kangaroos a total of 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate the time it takes for one kangaroo to cross by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos: 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo.

### 2. Calculate the speed of the turtles in relation to the kangaroos
- Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the turtles travel at 1/2 of the speed of a kangaroo.

### 3. Calculate the time it takes for one turtle to cross the highway
- If one kangaroo takes 6 hours to cross the highway, and a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take a turtle 2 times longer to cross: 6 hours x 2 = 12 hours per turtle.

### 4. Calculate the total time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway
- Since there are 4 turtles, we can calculate the total time it takes for all 4 turtles to cross by multiplying the time it takes for one turtle to cross by the number of turtles: 12 hours per turtle x 4 turtles = 48 hours for all 4 turtles to cross.

### 5. Compare the total time for the turtles to cross with the total time for the kangaroos to cross
- The total time for the turtles to cross (48 hours) is greater than the total time for the kangaroos to cross (18 hours).

### 6. Determine the relationship between the time taken and the speed of the animals
- Since the turtles travel at a slower speed than the kangaroos, it will take them longer to cross the highway.

### 7. Consider the impact of the number of animals on the total time taken
- Even though there are more turtles than kangaroos, the slower speed of the turtles results in a longer total time for all of them to cross.

### 8. Finalize the calculation for the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway
- Therefore, it will take 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, a total of 48 hours to cross the highway.

**Step 4** We know that the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons, so we can write the equation $x = 4000$.

**Step 5** Substituting the value of $x$ into the equation from Step 3, we get $2(4000) + 6000$.

**Step 6** Simplifying the expression, we get $8000 + 6000$.

### 3
The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so the number of blue cars is **3(R - 2)**.

### 4
The total number of cars in the rink is 75, so we have the equation: **R + (R - 2) + 3(R - 2) + Y = 75**, where Y represents the number of yellow cars.

Given that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, its speed is **11x** meters per second.

Let's denote the number of cats Larry has as $c$.

### 2
Since Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, the number of dogs he has is $3c$.

### 3
Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits he has is $3c - 2$.

### 4
Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish he has is $3(3c - 2)$.

### 5
Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so the number of gerbils he has is $\frac{1}{3} \times 3(3c - 2)$.

### 6
Now, we can sum up all the pets Larry has: $c + 3c + 3c - 2 + 3(3c - 2) + \frac{1}{3} \times 3(3c - 2)$.

### 7
Simplifying the expression from step 6, we get $c + 3c + 3c - 2 + 9c - 6 + 3c - 2$.

1. Half of the students at Brook Hills High School are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16 years old.
   
2. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

3. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which means there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.

4. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

5. To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students for each age group.

6. For students over 16 years old, there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students.

7. For students under 16 years old, there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students.

8. Adding the number of female students in each age group, we get a total of 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students at Brook Hills High School.

- This implies that the initial charge was less than 100%

**Step 2** Maria noticed her power bank was losing 9% of total capacity each hour
- This indicates a consistent rate of discharge

**Step 3** After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of total capacity each hour for 3 hours
- This change in discharge rate needs to be accounted for in the calculation

**Step 4** The final charge remaining was 28%
- This information will help us determine the initial charge of the power bank

**Step 5** Let x be the initial charge of the power bank
- We will use this variable to represent the initial charge

According to the given information, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + $80.

### 3
The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + $80).

### 4
The total amount divided among the three people is $1920, so we can write the equation: x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920.

- The total amount charged on the credit card before any returns or new purchases was $85.00.

## 2. Calculate the new balance after returning the item
- After returning the item that cost $15.00, the new balance on the credit card would be $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

## 3. Calculate the discounted price of the frying pan
- The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00, so the discounted price would be $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

## 4. Calculate the discounted price of the set of towels
- The set of towels was 10% off $30.00, so the discounted price would be $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

## 5. Calculate the total amount spent on the new purchases
- The total amount spent on the new purchases (frying pan and set of towels) would be $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

## 6. Calculate the final balance on the credit card
- The final balance on the credit card would be the new balance after returning the item ($70.00) plus the total amount spent on the new purchases ($43.00), which equals $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

- Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck, so she saves 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 from each paycheck.

**Step 2** Calculate the amount Lauren saves annually:
- Since Lauren saves $20,000 from each paycheck, and there are 26 pay periods in a year, she saves $20,000 * 26 = $520,000 annually.

**Step 3** Calculate the amount Lauren plans to live on annually during retirement:
- Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 annually.

**Step 4** Calculate the amount Lauren will have available for retirement savings annually:
- Lauren will have $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 available for retirement savings annually.

**Step 5** Calculate the total amount Lauren will save for retirement over 20 years:
- Over 20 years, Lauren will save $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000 for retirement.

**Step 6** Calculate the total amount Lauren will need for retirement:
- If Lauren saves $520,000 annually for 20 years, she will have $520,000 * 20 = $10,400,000 saved for retirement.

**Step 7** Calculate the difference between the total amount needed for retirement and the total amount Lauren will have saved:
- The difference is $10,400,000 - $1,200,000 = $9,200,000.

**Step 8** Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save enough for retirement:
- If Lauren saves $520,000 annually, it will take her $9,200,000 / $520,000 = 17.69 years to save enough for retirement.

**Step 9** Since Lauren cannot work a fraction of a year, she will need to work an additional year to reach the required savings amount.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as $b$ miles per minute.
Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the sidewalk as $2b$ miles per minute.

### 2
Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at speed $b$ miles per minute, the time spent on the beach is $\frac{2}{b}$ minutes.
Given that this time is 40 minutes, we have the equation $\frac{2}{b} = 40$.

### 3
Solving the equation $\frac{2}{b} = 40$ for $b$, we find that $b = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20}$ miles per minute.

### 4
Therefore, Grandma's speed on the sidewalk is $2b = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10}$ miles per minute.

- Let y be the number of bouquets sold per day.
- We have the equation: 2x + 8y = 26 (total earnings from sunflowers)
- We also have the equation: 12y = 56 (total earnings from bouquets)

**Step 2** Solve the system of equations from Step 1:
- From the second equation, we find that y = 56/12 = 4.67
- Substitute y into the first equation: 2x + 8(4.67) = 26
- Solve for x: 2x + 37.36 = 26
- 2x = -11.36
- x = -5.68

**Step 3** Since the number of sunflowers sold cannot be negative, we need to adjust our calculations:
- We know that x must be a whole number, so we round up to the nearest whole number.
- Therefore, Faraday sold 6 individual sunflowers per day.

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
- In 3 days, Faraday sold 6 sunflowers per day, so in total he sold 6 * 3 = 18 individual sunflowers.

**Step 5** Calculate the total number of bouquets sold after 3 days:
- In 3 days, Faraday sold 4.67 bouquets per day, so in total he sold 4.67 * 3 = 14 bouquets.

**Step 6** Calculate the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold after 3 days:
- Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold after 3 days is 14 * 12 = 168 sunflowers.

**Step 7** Add the total number of individual sunflowers and sunflowers in bouquets sold after 3 days:
- 18 (individual sunflowers) + 168 (sunflowers in bouquets) = 186 sunflowers sold after 3 days.

**Step 8** Check if the total earnings match the calculations:

### 2
After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with $x - y, where y is the amount given to their little sister.
Rissa is left with $3x - y.

### 3
Given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money after giving to her little sister, we can write the equation:

Let's denote the amount of red, white, purple, and yellow paint used in the mural as $r$, $w$, $p$, and $y$ respectively.

### 2
Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural, we can say that $r = w = p$.

### 3
We are also given that half of the mural is yellow, so we can say that $y = \frac{1}{2}(r + w + p)$.

### 4
Given that the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, we can write the equation $r + w + p + y = 12$.

Substitute $r = w = p$ into the equation $r + w + p + y = 12$ to get $3r + y = 12$.

Substitute $y = \frac{1}{2}(r + w + p)$ into the equation $3r + y = 12$ to get $3r + \frac{1}{2}(3r) = 12$.

The total time is x + 2x + 2x + 0.5x + 0.5x + x = 7x minutes.

### 6
Since x = 5 minutes (time to solve the first side), we can substitute x = 5 into the total time equation.

### 7
Total time = 7(5) = 35 minutes.

### 8
Therefore, the Rubik's cube takes 35 minutes to solve.

- Substitute y in the second equation: 2x + 4(20 - x) = 70.
- Simplify the equation: 2x + 80 - 4x = 70.
- Further simplify: -2x + 80 = 70.
- Solve for x: x = 5.

## 5. Find the number of chickens
- Substitute x back into the first equation: 5 + y = 20.
- Solve for y: y = 15.

## 6. Check the solution
- Check if the total number of legs adds up: 2(5) + 4(15) = 10 + 60 = 70.
