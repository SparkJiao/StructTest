3,"<summary>Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the standard model that predicts the existence of superpartners of standard model particles. The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector is a key problem in SUSY phenomenology.

673,"<summary> The global population, especially in developed countries, is aging, leading to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by reduced vasodilator substance output and increased contracting factors, plays a key role in atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress and inflammation are major contributors to endothelial aging and dysfunction. Exercise has been shown to improve endothelial function by boosting antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Aging leads to a decline in endothelial repair capacity and function, ultimately promoting cardiovascular disease. Regular physical activity can slow down age-related losses in endothelial function by restoring nitric oxide availability and reducing oxidative stress. Exercise-induced increases in shear stress stimulate vascular production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn upregulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. Exercise also has anti-inflammatory effects, reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines and promoting lipid turnover and fat oxidation. Overall, exercise training is a crucial modifiable risk factor for preventing and restoring age-related endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. </summary>",1

799,"<summary> The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence with midurethral sling placement was first described by Delorme and later refined by De Leval. A meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator procedures. An anatomical study compared the relationship between the tape and urethra in both approaches using cadavers and CT scans. The in-out approach had a more acute angle around the urethra compared to the flatter trajectory of the out-in approach. The tapes were found to lie posterior/dorsal to the urethra and were safe from the obturator canal. The in-out approach buried the tape deeper inside the muscles, while the out-in approach stayed closer to the ischiopubic ramus. Surgeons must pay attention to the helical pass during surgery to avoid complications, and future studies may use three-dimensional ultrasonography for dynamic measurements.
