• The text discusses the transport properties of nonlinear, non-equilibrium dynamical systems, specifically focusing on ratchet systems which exhibit directed transport of an ensemble of particles in asymmetric periodic potentials.

• The origins of interest in ratchet systems lie in the possibility of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as observed in biological systems. Recent research has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.

• The behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is sensitive to system parameters. The phase-space structure consists of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas or co-existing attractors, which can change significantly as parameters change.

• Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the average velocity could change direction depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. He conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics.

• Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals could occur without bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior, proposing an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits. However, their arguments implicitly assume ergodicity, which is not generally true for chaotic systems.

• The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the impact of different ensembles of particles on the current and the necessity of discarding transients in quantifying the current.

• The authors report studies on the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the same system considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno. They find that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and that bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameters are associated with abrupt changes in the current.

• The goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets by discovering heuristic rules through detailed examination of specific systems before generalizing.

- Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale.
  * It also predicts the existence of superpartners of the SM particles, with their masses expected to be below the TeV range.
  * Mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology.
- The no-scale type Kähler potential separates the hidden sector and the observable sector, with all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanishing as the cosmological constant vanishes.
  * The only source of SUSY breaking is gaugino masses, making this scenario highly predictive.
  * The separation of sectors implies that couplings between the hidden sector and the observable sector are flavor blind, suppressing contributions to FCNC.
- The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and the sequestered sector scenario in a five-dimensional setting.
  * In the sequestered sector scenario, the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other.
  * The form of the Kähler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed given by eq.([eq : noscalekahler]).
- In the no-scale scenario, the degrees of freedom of SUSY particle mass spectrum are limited because only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given.
  * Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, mainly focusing on the mass spectrum.
  * Direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint (i.e., a charged particle can not be the LSP if the R-parity is conserved) were considered and allowed region in the parameter space was identified.
- Current limits from the lightest Higgs mass and the branching ratio for Bs -> mu+ mu- are used to constrain the no-scale scenario.

- Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but this strength is weakened by relative cross polarization prior to collision.
  * A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) has a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity.
  * CH formed in spacetimes of CPW was shown to be unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations.
  * Any perturbation applied to a CPW spacetime will turn the CH into an essential singularity.
- The electromagnetic (EM) field itself weakens the strength of a singularity in CPW.
  * Collision of pure EM waves must have a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned.
  * A solution describing the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves was given by Bell and Szekeres (BS), where the singularity (a CH) formed in the interaction region is removable by a coordinate transformation, but essential curvature singularities exist on the null boundaries.
- Cross polarization and EM field both play roles in the nature of the resulting singularity.
  * A cross polarized version of the BS (CPBS) solution was found, which has the nice feature that the Weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region.
  * However, cross polarization does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries.
- The paper tests the validity of a CH stability conjecture (HK) using the CPBS solution as a test ground, with various added test fields.
  * The conjecture is more economical in reaching a direct conclusion about the stability of a CH compared to tedious perturbation analysis.
  * The metric that describes collision of EM waves with cross polarization was found, and it is a minimal extension of the BS metric.
  * The interaction region of this metric is of type -d without scalar curvature singularities.
  * The stability of the qr singularity in the incoming region is explored, and it is found to be a quasiregular (qr) singularity, the mildest type among all types of singularities.
- The stability of qr singularities is investigated by considering generic test fields added to such a background geometry and studying the effects.

- **Quantum correlations** can be non-classical to varying degrees.
  * At the weaker end of the spectrum, there are quantum systems whose states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents. These are called non-separable or entangled states.

• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.
• The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors has two notable features: the lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and the sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.
• Theoretical models have not been able to accurately reproduce the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
• The minimum period for CVs that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum is reached at approximately 80 minutes.
• The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses.
• A form of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) can increase the period minimum and hide the spike by introducing a spread of CV period values in the CV population.
• The orbital angular momentum loss rate of a CV can be written as the sum of two terms: the systemic angular momentum loss rate and an explicit function of the mass transfer rate. The CAML mechanism, along with nova mass ejections, can cause a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the system.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

- The solar corona is heated to a temperature of about 12 million kelvins, while the visible surface of the sun is roughly 250 times cooler.
  - This heating is believed to be caused by magnetic fields or waves converting convective energy from the photosphere to thermal energy in the corona.
- The primary energy source for this heating is located in the convection zone below the solar photosphere.
  - There is 100 times as much energy available in the convection zone as required to heat the corona.
- The debate over the specific mechanism for heating the corona centers on two main theories: dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events (nanoflares).
- MHD waves can be generated by the buffeting of magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere by granulation, which can propagate into magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona.
- In coronal loops, random motions of magnetic loop footpoints can produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines, which generates field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively.
- The main difference between these processes is that plasma inertia plays a key role in wave propagation, but is unimportant for the dynamics of field-aligned currents along coronal loops.
- Observational evidence for nanoflare heating is looking less convincing, as theoretical studies have shown that only high-frequency MHD waves are capable of significant heating.

The text describes an algorithm for solving nonconvex semidefinite programming problems with bmi (bilinear matrix inequality) constraints. The algorithm is based on the idea of locally approximating the nonconvex feasible set of the problem with an inner convex set. The convergence of the algorithm to a stationary point is investigated under standard assumptions. The algorithm generates a feasible sequence that is strictly descent with respect to the objective function, and does not require a globalization strategy such as line search or trust region. The algorithm can be applied to many problems in static output feedback controller design, and uses a psd-convex overestimate of a bilinear form to approximate the bmi constraint. This allows the algorithm to be used for problems such as sparse linear static output feedback controller design, spectral abscissa and pseudospectral abscissa optimization, and mixed synthesis.

• Discrete differential geometry has been valuable in understanding the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories.

  • The Dirac-Kähler formulation of fermionic field theory has been of particular interest, using the antisymmetry of differential forms to describe the Clifford algebra.

  • To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, which would ideally have the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit.

• Defining such a scheme has been challenging, with difficulties often exhibited by the Hodge star and the wedge product between forms.

  • In a discretization, it is desirable for the wedge product to allow the product rule to be satisfied and for both the Hodge star and wedge product to be local.

• Several discrete schemes have been proposed, with varying success.

- Quantum key distribution (QKD) and other quantum communication technologies require a new telecommunications infrastructure that can accommodate the quantum properties they rely on.
  - This network will contain many novel components, such as quantum memories, quantum repeaters, or quantum channels.
  - These components must each operate in a strictly quantum way.
- To characterize the suitability of devices for quantum communication tasks, we can use the idea of quantum throughput, which measures how well a channel preserves quantum correlations in bipartite systems.
  - This can be studied by sending one subsystem through the channel and examining the output to see how well the quantum correlations are preserved.
  - Quantum correlations can also be tested in a ""prepare and measure"" picture, which avoids the need to use actual bipartite states.
- A strong quantum channel is one that preserves all or nearly all of the quantum correlations, while a weak quantum channel preserves few or none.
  - The quantum throughput of a channel can be used to determine its suitability for quantum communication tasks.
  - A high quantum throughput indicates that a channel is well-suited for transmitting quantum information, while a low quantum throughput indicates that it is not.
- Quantifying the quantum behavior of a channel can be done using entanglement measures or other methods.
  - For quantum channels, this might involve measuring the amount of entanglement that is preserved after passing through the channel.
  - Other measures of quantum behavior, such as the fidelity or the quantum capacity, can also be used.
- To test a device, a finite number of test states and a limited set of measurements should be sufficient.
  - This is especially important for optical systems, which are a natural choice for carrying quantum information.
  - Full tomography is not practical for optical systems due to the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space.

- Quantum fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that never vanishes, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources.
	+ This concept was introduced by quantum electrodynamics.
	+ In 1948, H. B. G. Casimir predicted that two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other due to a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation.
	+ The plates act as a cavity where only the electromagnetic modes that have nodes on both the walls can exist.
	+ The zero-point energy (per unit area) when the plates are kept at close distance is smaller than when the plates are at infinite separation, causing the plates to attract each other to reduce the energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.
- E. M. Lifshitz, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii, and L. P. Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics.
	+ The force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions can be derived according to an analytical formula that relates the Helmholtz free energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field to the dielectric functions of the interacting materials and of the medium in which they are immersed.
	+ At very short distances (typically smaller than a few nanometers), Lifshitz's theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force.
	+ At larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction that in the case of two ideal metals in vacuum reduces to Casimir's result.
	+ Lifshitz's equation also shows that two plates made out of the same material always attract, regardless of the choice of the intervening medium.
	+ For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed.
	+ While the force is always attractive in vacuum, there are situations for which a properly chosen liquid will cause the two plates to repel each other.

- The acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination can be used to measure the matter and energy content of the universe.
  - This ""standard ruler"" scale can be measured at low redshifts, such as in large galaxy redshift surveys, to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.
  - However, if the CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, the misinterpretation could potentially spread to the low-redshift application and bias the inferences.
- The interpretation of the low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
  - The actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation; only their ratio matters.
  - This means that even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, the inferences for dark energy from the combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged.
- The acoustic peak method depends on measuring the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination.
  - Nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination.
  - The sound horizon integral depends only on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma.
- The sound speed depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and is well-measured in the CMB power spectrum.

• Quantum channel estimation is the problem of determining the properties of a quantum channel, which is essential for the reliable transfer of quantum information and the construction of quantum codes.

• Quantum channels can be parametrized by a vector with a specific number of components, and the goal of channel estimation is to specify the parameter vector.

• The protocol for estimating the properties of a quantum channel involves Alice and Bob agreeing on a set of quantum states, which Alice prepares and sends through the channel. Bob then performs measurements on the received states and deduces an estimated vector that should be as close as possible to the underlying parameter vector of the quantum channel.

• The quality of channel estimation protocols can be quantified using statistical and fidelity errors. The statistical error describes how close the estimated parameter vector is to the underlying parameter vector, while the fidelity error describes how close the estimated quantum channel is to the underlying quantum channel.

• The fidelity error is defined as the average overlap between two quantum channels, where the overlap is the fidelity between two mixed states, averaged over all possible pure quantum states.

• The qubits that Alice sends to Bob are fully characterized by their Bloch vector, and the disturbing action of the channel modifies the initial Bloch vector according to a specific function.

• The action of a channel is completely described by the function that maps the Bloch vector to a new Bloch vector, and the mixed state fidelity equation simplifies for qubits.

The magnitude of magnetic moments is sensitive to computational parameters. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an essential experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides, but DFT calculations often have problems reproducing all features of the ARPES spectra correctly, which is often attributed to strong correlation effects. However, the connection between the magnetic phase of the iron pnictides and the resulting consequences for ARPES is often ignored, leading to a loss of information on the anisotropy.

- **Formation of HI Supershells:**
	+ *Internal Source Model:* The internal source model for the formation of HI supershells suggests that starbursts, stellar winds, and supernova explosions are responsible for their kinetic energy. The chimney model, for example, explains disk-halo features and other halo gas via processes related to underlying star formation.
	+ *External Source Model:* The alternative explanation for the supershells is the infall of massive gas clouds on to the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies. This resolves the energy problem since input energy is then a function of the mass and velocity of the infalling cloud.

- **Evidence Against Star Formation Processes:**
	+ *Energy Problem:* The main difficulty with the starburst model for HI supershells lies in the required input energies for the largest shells. Hundreds of thousands of clustered supernovae are required, a conclusion which is not changed significantly if the energy is injected continuously over the lifetime of the shells.
	+ *Lack of Optical Evidence:* Recent studies have found no optical evidence for recent star formation in the numerous lower energy HI holes of Holmberg II and note that X-ray and FUV emission are also absent. This suggests that supernovae have not played a part in the formation of the HI shells.

- **Proposed Explanation for HI Supershells:**
	+ *Radio Jets as Energy Source:* The authors propose that HI supershells have been formed by radio jets which plow through the interstellar medium, accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles. This allows for an internal energy source for the HI shells, provides a natural explanation for any spatial symmetries seen in the HI features, and also resolves the energy problem.
	+ *Jet-Disk Interaction Hypothesis:* The ejection of jets can take place at small angles to the large-scale galactic disk, plausibly leading to clear signatures of their dynamical interaction with the ISM. A classic case of such an interaction is the bow-shaped morphology of the radio lobe in the well-known Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1068, which strongly suggests that the kil",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_subpoints': 2, 'symbol': '*'}"

-- Result: The paper is motivated by a result from Berestycki et al. about the Laplacian perturbed by a divergence-free drift in dimensions n.
-- The result states that a certain eigenvalue remains bounded as a parameter goes to infinity if and only if there exists a first integral of the drift vector field with specific properties.

- Paper's Contribution
-- Contribution: The paper aims to verify a similar property for the fractional Laplacian.
-- It introduces the set of non-zero first integrals in a Sobolev space equipped with a norm derived from the Dirichlet form of the fractional Laplacian. The paper then uses various techniques to define and study the principal eigen-pair for the fractional Laplacian with a drift.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"

• Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns to encode the input data into a lower-dimensional representation and then decode it back to the original form. Variational autoencoders impose additional constraints on the encoded representations, transforming the autoencoder into a algorithm that learns a latent variable model for its input data.

• The authors use autoencoders and variational autoencoders with one fully connected hidden layer in the encoder and decoder, each consisting of 256 neurons. The activation functions of the intermediate layers are rectified linear units, and the activation function of the final layer is a sigmoid or tanh function, depending on the problem.

• The authors test their algorithms on the Ising model and the XY model, which are well-studied models in physics. They find that their algorithms are able to find a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system which coincides with the correct order parameter. The decoder network reconstructs the encoded configuration from its latent representation, and the reconstruction is more accurate in the ordered phase. The authors suggest that the reconstruction error can be used as a universal identifier for phase transitions.

• Summary of the source document:
	• The extinction curve describes how extinction changes with wavelength, which is caused by the presence of dust grains in the interstellar medium.
	• The characteristics of the extinction curve are different in a diffuse interstellar medium compared to a dense interstellar medium.
	• Knowledge of the extinction curve is necessary to deredden magnitudes and colors of astronomical objects and to understand the physical properties of dust grains.
	• Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (CCM) derived a mean extinction law that depends on one parameter, R(V).
	• The CCM law is powerful because it allows one to determine the extinction in one spectral region based on the extinction in a different spectral region, given that one knows R(V).
	• The value of R(V) ranges from about 2.0 to about 5.5 when going from diffuse to dense interstellar medium, and it characterizes the dust properties in the region that produces the extinction.
	• Many authors have used the parameter R(V) to study extinction.
	• Gao and Shen (GS) applied a chi-square minimization to compute the R(V) values for a sample of stars with UV extinction data using the linear relation of the CCM law.
	• The authors extend the method used by GS to obtain improved R(V) values for the lines of sight toward a sample of stars with known extinction data in the UV.

• Theoretical basis of R(V) derivation:
	• The interstellar dust grains span a wide range of sizes from a few angstroms to a few micrometers.
	• They reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam by two physical processes: absorption and scattering.
	• The extinction is the result of these two processes.
	• The apparent magnitude of each star as a function of wavelength may be written as m(λ) = M(λ) + D + A(λ), where M(λ), D, and A(λ) represent absolute magnitude, distance, and total extinction, respectively.

• Weak gravitational lensing has been detected in high redshift QSOs, intermediate redshift galaxies, and BATSE GRBs.
• In point sources like QSOs and GRBs, weak lensing manifests as angular (anti-)correlations with foreground inhomogeneously distributed mass. In galaxies, it is detected through its coherent shear effect.
• A more direct way of detecting weak lensing is by using fluxes of standard candles. If observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen. Brighter sources will lie behind regions of mass density excess, while fainter ones will have mass deficits in their foregrounds.
• The best example of a cosmological standard candle is Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). They have been extensively observed to determine the global geometry of the universe.
• Nuisance effects like evolution, variations in individual SNe, and gray dust extinction have been studied theoretically and observationally, and have either been corrected for or shown to be small. Weak lensing, another nuisance effect, has been addressed theoretically and found to be unimportant given the current uncertainties.
• The largest homogeneous compilation of SNe Ia has been recently published, with 74 SNe Ia. The authors use four different light curve fitting methods to estimate distances to SNe Ia.

	+ They are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and contain heavy or rare metal elements.
* It has been proposed that an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI).
	+ The TMI phase is unusual because an emergent spin-orbit interaction appears from the electronic mutual Coulomb interaction and shows an unconventional quantum criticality that depends on the electron band dispersion near the Fermi point.
	+ However, this proposed topological phase has not been achieved in real materials, and it is unclear whether the TMIs become stable against competitions with other orders and quantum fluctuations.
* The stability of the TMI and estimation of the critical value of interaction on the honeycomb lattice has mainly been considered by mean-field calculations, which cannot treat the correlation effect satisfactorily.
	+ However, there exists a reliable limit where the TMI becomes stable: for infinitesimally small relevant Coulomb repulsions, the quadratic band crossing with vanishing Fermi velocities causes the leading instability toward the TMI.
	+ Examining the instabilities toward the TMI in Dirac semimetals requires elaborate theoretical treatments.

• Methods for measuring the extinction law slope (xmath0) in the direction of differentially-reddened galactic globular clusters:
  • The ""xmath25 rms"" method: uses three-color photometry of differentially-reddened globular clusters and computes the rms scatter of the difference between two xmath3 values for hb stars.
  • The ""xmath25 slope"" method: closely related to the xmath25 rms method, but plots one xmath3 value against the other and fits a linear relationship.
  • The ""optical / ir"" method: relies on two-color photometry and the sfd reddening map to derive xmath25 values for all hb stars and computes the rms scatter of the corrected hb stars with respect to a best-fit fiducial curve.

• Results from applying the methods to simulated cluster data sets:
  • The xmath25 rms method reproduces the correct xmath0 to within 0.1 for low photometric errors, but the precision decreases with increasing input xmath0.
  • The xmath25 slope method has a low level of predictive power due to uncertainty in the sfd reddening values.
  • The optical / ir method gives a low level of predictive power and a bias towards low xmath0 values for moderate to large photometric errors.

* **Heavy fermion systems** are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, with the Kondo scale marking the screening of local magnetic moments through a many-body effect that entangles the spins of conduction electrons and local moments.
	+ The Kondo scale is associated with a coherence temperature, below which a paramagnetic heavy fermion liquid emerges, characterized by a coherent, Bloch-like superposition of the screening clouds of individual magnetic moments.
	+ In the Kondo limit, where charge fluctuations of impurity spins are suppressed, this paramagnetic state still has a large fermi surface with Luttinger volume that includes both magnetic moments and conduction electrons.
	+ The coherence temperature of this metallic state is small, indicating a large effective mass.
* **Kondo screening** competes with the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which indirectly couples local moments via the magnetic polarization of conduction electrons.

	+ Two radically different scenarios have been proposed to describe this quantum phase transition: the standard Hertz-Millis picture, in which the quasi-particles of the heavy-fermion liquid remain intact and undergo a spin-density wave transition, and alternative scenarios in which the quantum critical point is linked to the breakdown of the quasi-particle state and a topological reorganization of the fermi surface is expected.

	• This conclusion would have profound consequences for the interpretation of galactic microlensing studies, as such debris could be responsible for a sizable fraction of the microlensing signal.
	• The existence of this stellar foreground population as an explanation for the LMC microlensing optical depth has been challenged on several grounds.
	• The MACHOTEAM finds no evidence for a foreground population at 3 kpc in their extensive photometric database, and the feature found by MACHOTEAM is unlikely to be the VRC.
	• Gould argues that any luminous foreground population must meet certain criteria, such as not extending more than 5 from the LMC center or having a stellar mass-to-light ratio 10 times that of known populations.
	• Johnston has analyzed the ZHAO (1998) proposition and concluded that an ad hoc tidal streamer to explain the microlensing optical depth would cause unobserved overdensities or require disruption within the last 200 years.
	• Bennett argues that a recently determined stellar mass function combined with the assumption that the putative foreground population has a star formation history similar to the LMC results in an implied microlensing optical depth that is only a small fraction of that determined by microlensing observations.

	+ These correlations may imply an evolutionary relation between the growth of the SMBH and the host galaxy itself.
- In order to study the dependence of the various observed phenomena of AGNs on the black hole mass and the cosmic evolution of the black holes, independent and reliable estimates of the mass of the black holes are required.
	+ One independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole is using the reverberation mapping technique.
- The reverberation mapping technique has been used to make estimates of SMBH masses over a large range of redshift.

	+ To date, the broad line region (BLR) radius of only about three dozen AGNs (Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars) have been determined.

• The text discusses the Supersymmetric MAVANs scenario, which is a model of dark energy that involves a chiral superfield in the dark sector that causes the present cosmic acceleration. The scalar component of this superfield is assumed to be the acceleron, while the spinor component is a sterile neutrino.

• The model includes a superpotential with coupling constants and mass parameters, and a Lagrangian density that violates lepton number conservation in the dark sector. The effective neutrino mass matrix is given by the sum of the usual term from the seesaw mechanism and a term derived from the coupling between the acceleron and the right-handed neutrino. The neutrino mass matrix is rewritten in terms of the mass of a sterile neutrino, which is variable in the case of vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino. The model also includes two constraints on the scalar potential, which come from observations of the universe and the stationary condition.

* The text discusses a conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies, based on the observation that the dynamical equations of gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form when subject to a conformally-flat metrical field.
	+ This model describes confinement of quarks and gluons through the introduction of two scalar fields that spontaneously break the symmetry down to subgroups.
	+ A symmetric second-order tensor field is defined that serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.
	+ Quarks and gluons are confined to an anti-de-Sitter (AdS) universe, having a finite radius in the flat space-time.
* The model is used to describe quarks and gluons that oscillate with a universal frequency inside a closed universe, as well as photons which freely travel through flat space-time.
	+ The model comprises one real scalar field and one complex scalar field.
	+ Their dynamical equations were solved for the case that the respective vacuum expectation values satisfy a certain relation.
	+ A solution for the real scalar field leads to AdS confinement, via the associated conformally flat metric.
* The model does not easily allow for interactions between hadrons, as each hadron is described by a closed universe.

For example, the nucleus of an elliptic surface can be used to show that two homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic 4-manifolds have different Heegaard Floer invariants. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, which can be related to 3-manifolds and cobordisms via Heegaard diagrams. However, a combinatorial description of these invariants was later developed by Sarkar and the third author, which allows for the computation of the Heegaard Floer homology of any 3-manifold and null homologous knots and links in any 3-manifold.

• The invention relates to methods and apparatus for providing ventilatory assistance matched to a subject's respiratory need.
• The invention is suitable for spontaneously breathing human subjects requiring long-term ventilatory assistance, particularly during sleep.
• Most known ventilatory devices do not accurately match the amplitude and phase of mask pressure to the subject's spontaneous efforts, leading to discomfort or panic.
• During sleep, there are changes in the neural control of breathing and the mechanics of the subject's airways, leading to a need for substantially increased ventilatory support.
• Ideally, a ventilatory assistance device should meet the following goals: (i) closely match the phase and degree of assistance to the subject's spontaneous efforts while awake, (ii) automatically adjust the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum ventilation during sleep without relying on the integrity of the subject's chemoreflexes, and (iii) continue to work correctly in the presence of large leaks.
• Most simple home ventilators fail to meet goal (ii) of adjusting the degree of assistance to maintain at least a given ventilation and goal (iii) of closely matching the subject's respiratory phase.
• Servo-ventilators measure ventilation and adjust the degree of assistance to maintain ventilation at or above a specified level, but they still fail to meet goal (i) of closely matching the phase of the subject's spontaneous efforts.
• Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) tailors the pressure vs time profile within a breath to unload the subject's resistive and elastic work, but it has disadvantages such as overestimation of V(t) in the presence of leaks and reliance on the subject's chemoreceptor reflexes.
• The invention seeks to match the phase and degree of assistance to the subject's spontaneous efforts when ventilation is well above a target ventilation, automatically adjust the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum average ventilation without relying on the integrity of the subject's chemoreflexes, and provide some immunity to the effects of sudden leaks.
• The invention discloses methods for calculating the instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle, determining the instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle as a continuous variable, and measuring the average respiratory",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The invention is an electro-surgical dissecting and cauterizing instrument for use in endoscopic procedures.
• It includes a distal, working tip electrode and a proximal end with an electric plug for connection to a conventional electro-surgical unit.
• The electric energy is delivered to the distal, working tip of the tool via a conductive rod surrounded by a linear, rigid sleeve formed of an insulating material.
• The distal end of the tool includes an electrically conductive, rigid arm extending from the sleeve portion of the tool, which is laterally offset from the longitudinal axis of the sleeve.
• The working tip electrode is formed at the free end of the arm and is used to make direct contact with the patient at the internal operation site.
• A thin jacket of insulating material is disposed upon the arm from the point where it extends from the sleeve right up to, but not including, the working tip electrode.

• The invention is useful in surgical procedures that may or may not include the use of an endoscope to view the operation site.
• The surgical procedure using an endoscope is termed laparoscopic and targets the abdominal area.
• The surgeon inserts the distal end of the instrument into the abdomen of the anesthetized patient through a trochar positioned within an incision made in the abdominal wall.
• The operation site is viewed at the eyepiece of the laparoscope and/or on a CRT screen by passing the laparoscope through an adjacent incision in the abdomen.
• Examples of typical laparoscopic procedures in which the dissecting and cauterizing instrument would be used are lysis of adhesions, cholecystectomy and appendectomy.

• The process of papermaking involves deposition of headbox stock onto a paper machine forming fabric, forming a fibrous web that is supported and advanced through dewatering equipment by the fabric wire.
• One stage of dewatering is passing the web through a pair or more of rotating rolls forming a nip press, during which liquid is expelled from the web via the pressure applied by the rotating rolls.

• Characteristics of nipped rolls are important in papermaking, as the amount of pressure applied to the web during the nip press stage can be critical in achieving uniform sheet characteristics.
• Common problems include lack of uniformity in pressure distribution (nip pressure) along the working length of the roll, which can result in poor quality paper, excessive nip pressure causing crushing or displacement of fibers, and improvements in nip loading leading to higher productivity and lower breakdowns.

• Conventional rolls may have roll deflection due to sag or nip loading and worn roll covers introducing pressure variations.
• Rolls with floating shells and movable surfaces have been developed to compensate for uneven nip pressure distribution.

• Previous techniques for determining discrepancies in nip pressure required stopping the roll and taking a nip impression using carbon paper or pressure sensitive film, or later techniques using mylar with sensing elements to electronically record pressures across the nip.
• These procedures cannot be used while the nip press is in operation and cannot account for temperature, roll speed, or other related changes affecting uniformity of nip pressure.

The tool has an outer body with a lower end that is attached to a stuck object or fish. The outer body has an upper end. Within the outer body and extending uphole from the upper end is the mandrel. The mandrel is connected to the surface through a string. The mandrel has a passage that is in fluid communication with the passage in the string so that pressure can be delivered from the surface to lateral ports. Ports are at different elevations. A row of ports leads to an annular space with which there is communication to a piston that is attached to the mandrel. Pressure in the space pushed down the piston and with it the mandrel at the same time displacing fluid from the chamber through an opening.

• The invention describes a method and arrangement for compressing and cooling natural gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas.

• The gas is compressed to a higher pressure, cooled by heat exchange, and then fed back into the pipeline with an increased exit pressure and a lower exit temperature, typically at most 0° C.

• The cooling process poses problems during the transition periods and summer months due to high outside temperatures. Conventional re-cooling plants with separate cooling cycles are used during these warm weather periods, but they are expensive, unused for most of the year, and pose safety risks due to the use of flammable and heavier-than-air cooling agents like propane.

• The invention aims to reduce investments and operation risks by compressing the gas to a substantially higher pressure (excess pressure) than the desired exit pressure, cooling the compressed gas by heat exchange to a temperature above the exit temperature, and then obtaining further cooling to the desired exit temperature by expanding the gas from the excess pressure to the desired exit pressure.

• The compressor station includes at least one compressor, at least one heat exchanger, valve-controlled pipelines, and control units. An electronic control is provided to control the compressor and valves, compressing the gas to an excess pressure and expanding the compressed gas to the desired exit pressure.

• The invention utilizes the physical effect that a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure. This cooling effect is sufficient to obtain the desired exit temperature during the warmer period of the year.

• The expansion can be carried out by a valve or an expansion turbine, which can recover mechanical energy and utilize it for providing a portion of the drive energy for the compression of the gas to the intended excess pressure.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

  * The lens has a high relative aperture and high range, while still maintaining high grade optical performance.
  * The size of the lens is minimized, with a short total length suitable for cameras.
- The invention addresses the challenge of increasing the relative aperture while reducing the size of the lens, which typically results in poor optical performance.
  * This is especially important for video cameras, which require a high relative aperture due to their low-sensitivity image pickup elements.
- The invention is particularly useful for 8mm video cameras, which are becoming more popular due to their compactness and high manageability.
  * These cameras use a 2/3 inch image pickup tube, which is being reduced in size to a 1/2 inch image pickup tube.
- The invention uses a 4-unit lens design, with the fourth unit stationary during zooming and the fifth unit correcting residual aberrations.
  * The front lens unit is designed to reduce the size of the entire lens system while maintaining the prescribed optical performance.
- The invention avoids increasing the spherical aberration, coma, and higher order aberrations that typically result from increasing the refractive power of each lens unit.
  * This is achieved by setting forth proper design rules for the image forming section.
- The invention reduces the total length of the lens system to shorter than 10φ A, which has been difficult to achieve while maintaining good optical performance throughout the zooming range.
  * This is achieved by satisfying certain conditions related to the focal length, radius of curvature, Abbe number, and refractive power of the lens units.

- The foil electron multiplier is a new type of electron multiplier that uses a series of thin foils to amplify electrons in a series of transmission stages.
- It can be used for amplification of an incident electron flux or for detection of particles such as photons, ions, and electrons.
- The foil electron multiplier comprises a series of thin foils held by foil holders in an evacuated enclosure that form discrete multiplication stages.
- Voltage is applied to each foil, so that secondary electrons created by incident particle are accelerated in a direction from first stage of the multiplier through last stage and collected onto an anode.
- The gain of a foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission of electrons through the foil, maximizing the transmission through the support grid, and maximizing the secondary electron emission yield.
- The gain advantage of the foil electron multiplier over conventional multipliers lies in the term γ SE +1, which represents the secondary electron yield from a primary electron exiting a foil and the continuation of the primary electron with the secondaries that it produces.
- Ion feedback, which is important primarily for continuous electron multipliers, is not experienced by the foil electron multiplier.
- The range of foil dimensions practiced for the present invention is from about 0.5 cm diameter (round) to 2×4 cm 2 (rectangular), and the foil areal thickness can range from about 0.2 μg/cm 2 to about 2 μg/cm 2.

	+ Utilizes a digitally-controlled variable gain amplifier to adjust the amplitude of the modulated IF input signal
	+ Incorporates a predictive digital filter to construct a digitally represented prediction of the modulated IF input signal
* Uses a 1-bit sampler to convert the error signal from an analog to a digital representation
	+ The sampler output contains alias components of the loop error signal
	+ The predictive structure utilizes the lowest alias component of the modulated carrier
* Implemented as a digital filter, the predictive filter is placed in the feedback path of the loop
	+ The poles of the predictive filter are placed to coincide with the center frequency of the alias component of the modulated IF after being sampled by the sampler
	+ The predictive filter is designed to generate a prediction of the modulated IF at the next sampling epoch
* The Downconverting Digitizer includes an offset nuller element to eliminate offsets from the error signal
	+ The offset nulling loop generates an estimate of these offsets and eliminates them from the error signal
	+ The offset nuller operates in conjunction with the sampler, the predictive filter, the DAC, and the analog summing element
* The predictive filter can be reprogrammed to match the modulated IF input signal
	+ The number of filter stages, weighting gain for each stage, center frequency of each filter stage, and bandwidth of each filter stage can be reprogrammed
	+ This allows the frequency response of the predictive loop to be changed upon initialization or dynamically through the use of an external algorithm
* The digital predictive loop has the inherent advantage of confining the quantization noise to a narrower bandwidth compared to conventional analog-to-digital converters
	+ This eases the design constraints placed on subsequent digital signal processing elements
	+ The dynamic frequency response adjustment feature of this invention can be used to dynamically adjust the coefficients of the predictive filter to track the instantaneous carrier frequency of the modulated IF or reduce distortion caused by interfering signals in a multi-channel receiver application

- **Pendulum system:** The invention includes a pendulum system with a geophone, shaft, and spherical ball, which allows for a line passing through the center of gravity of the geophone and the center of the spherical ball to be vertically aligned when the geophone is allowed to hang freely at the end of the shaft.
- **Plunger system:** A plunger system is used to lock the geophone and shaft in their assumed orientation when the seismometer is pitched over. The plunger should be positioned so that a line extending through the central longitudinal axis of the plunger shaft also passes through the center of the spherical ball and the center of the open planar area formed within the circumference of the annular seat.
- **Stop ring and mounting plate:** A stop ring is provided in the mounting plate to prevent damage to the seat, and the centers of the open planar areas formed within the circumferences of the annular seat and stop ring should lie along the line passing through the center of the spherical ball when the seismometer is in its normal, up-right position.
- **Plunger shaft and head:** The plunger shaft is adapted to receive a plunger head, which should be constructed of synthetic rubber or other suitable material to cushion the impact of the plunger when it strikes the surface of the spherical ball.
- **Coil springs:** A coil spring is positioned around the plunger shaft, and a second coil spring is positioned around the linearly acting shaft of the solenoid. These springs help to assure that sufficient forces are imparted to prevent the further motion or rotation of the spherical ball.
- **Solenoid and pin:** A solenoid is provided as a means for removing the pin that restrains the plunger away from the surface of the spherical ball. The solenoid is activated by a power source, which supplies electric current through a set of solenoid leads.

• Operation principles of the humidity sensor:
    • The sensor's impedance decreases linearly with the relative humidity due to the combination of increased capacitance from water vapor molecules and temperature-responsive resistance.
    • The sensor's response time is almost instantaneous (1 second) due to the thin and molecularly porous dielectric and second electrode.
    • The sensor is designed for commercial humidity controls in textile mills, with a suitable range of temperatures and humidities.

• Preferred embodiment and limitations:
    • The anodized layer in the bore should be fine machined, roller burnished, and anodized with oxalic acid to achieve the desired thickness and porosity.
    • The calculated thickness of nickel deposited in the anodized layer should be between 5 and 10 Angstrom units to avoid short-circuiting the electrodes.
    • Sulfuric or nitric acid anodized layers are unsatisfactory due to residual ion-forming material, while oxalic acid gives suitable results.

• Manufacturing method:
    • The method includes anodizing the aluminum, depositing nickel particles in the anodized layer, sealing the anodized layer, and depositing a second electrode over the nickel-impregnated sealed anodized layer.
    • The anodized layer should be thoroughly rinsed and dried before depositing nickel particles.
    • The sensor should be placed in a boiling water bath to hydrolize and seal the anodized layer, and then thoroughly dried before depositing the second electrode.

  * Rigorous economic analysis does not generally drive the investment decisions of state and local governments.
  * The federal government also does not possess adequate data to assess outcomes or implement performance measures.
- The solvency of the federal surface transportation program is at risk because expenditures now exceed revenues for the Highway Trust Fund.
  * The current fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has been in place since 1993, and the buying power of the fixed cents-per-gallon amount has since been eroded by inflation.
  * The reallocation to the Highway Trust Fund of 4.3 cents of federal fuel tax previously dedicated to deficit reduction provided an influx of funds beginning in 1997, but this influx has been insufficient to sustain current spending levels.
- A reexamination of the federal approach to surface transportation problems and a restructuring of federal programs to create more focused, performance-based, and sustainable programs is needed.
  * Identifying areas of national interest is an important first step in any proposal to restructure and fund surface transportation programs.
  * Proposals should also clarify specific goals for federal involvement in surface transportation programs and define the federal role in relation to the roles of state and local governments, regional entities, and the private sector.
- An increased focus on performance and accountability for results, promoting the use of the best tools and approaches to improve results and emphasize return on investment, and ensuring fiscal sustainability are key attributes of restructured surface transportation programs.
  * Tracking specific outcomes that are clearly linked to program goals and incorporating specific performance measures into programs can help make the program more outcome-oriented.

	+ Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure to help individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts
	+ Filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay, stopping most lawsuits and collection activities
	+ Equitable treatment of creditors means similar claims are classified similarly and receive the same treatment
	+ Business debtors may seek liquidation or reorganization
	+ Proceedings can be voluntary or involuntary, with the debtor able to defend against involuntary proceedings
	+ Chapter 7 involves court-supervised liquidation of the debtor's assets, while Chapter 11 allows for reorganization

* Resolution regimes for insolvent financial entities
	+ Created to address insolvent financial entities such as insured depository institutions and insurance companies
	+ Goal is to resolve insolvent financial entities in an orderly and efficient manner, protecting depositors and other creditors
	+ Examples include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for insured depository institutions and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for government-sponsored enterprises
	+ These resolution regimes have the authority to take control of and resolve failing financial entities, often through the sale of the entity's assets or the creation of a bridge institution

* Treatment of qualified financial contracts (QFCs) in bankruptcy
	+ QFCs include derivative financial products and repurchase agreements
	+ Safe harbor provisions in the Bankruptcy Code allow nondefaulting counterparties to exercise certain contractual rights, even if doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay
	+ This can include liquidating, terminating, or accelerating the contract and offsetting any termination value, payment amount, or other transfer obligation

* Benefits of TOD: Increased access to opportunities, promotion of transportation options, increased transit ridership, reduced road congestion.
* Stakeholders: Local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, metropolitan-planning organizations, local governments, regional councils, private developers, lenders, business improvement districts.
* Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and TOD: FTA provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD, but does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, FTA has been expanding its role in TOD in recent years through research, coordination with other agencies, and a transit-oriented development planning pilot program.
* Factors Supporting TOD: Market demand for real estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, efficient transit access to job and activity centers.
* Factors Hindering TOD: Higher construction costs, lenders' reluctance to finance TOD, lengthy local-development approval processes, unsupportive local population, undesirable physical features surrounding a transit station, unsupportive land uses.
* Local Government Policies to Encourage TOD: Zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives that align with local residents' preferences and market demand for development.
* FTA Evaluation of TOD for New Starts Funding: FTA evaluates proposed projects for New Starts funding according to criteria including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, economic development effects, land use, and cost-effectiveness.

* The PEBES legislation requires SSA to begin sending the PEBES to eligible workers who have not requested a statement.

* The goals of the PEBES are to inform the public about benefits available under SSA's programs, assist workers in planning for their financial future, and ensure that Social Security earnings records are complete and accurate.
* Accurate earnings records are important because a worker's eligibility for Social Security benefits and the size of the benefit depend on the worker's earnings record.

	• In 1959, Congress amended the TVA Act to provide TVA with the authority to finance its power program through revenue from electricity sales and borrowing, and required it to repay a substantial portion of the annual appropriations it had received.
	• TVA's board, nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, sets TVA’s goals and policies, appoints the CEO, develops long-range plans, and approves TVA’s budget and rate changes.
	• TVA's most recent strategic plan covers fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and outlines its strategic imperatives, including maintaining low rates, living within its means, managing assets to meet reliability expectations and provide a balanced portfolio, and being responsible stewards of the region’s natural resources.
	• TVA plans to reduce its debt to about $22 billion by fiscal year 2023 through increasing revenue, limiting the growth of operating expenses, and reducing capital expenditures.
	• TVA uses a 10-year long-range financial plan to determine the amount of funds that will be available for capital investment, and operating priorities are detailed in business unit plans.
	• TVA has expanded beyond hydropower to other types of power generation such as natural gas, coal, and nuclear plants, and periodically develops an integrated resource plan to guide decisions about the resources needed to meet future demand for electricity.
	• TVA's financial condition worsened in the late 1960s and 1970s due to construction delays, cost overruns, and operational shutdowns in its nuclear program, and the agency continues to invest in nuclear projects while deferring full recognition and funding of pension liabilities.

	* The open bank assistance included a $970 million capital infusion from the FDIC and $500 million of private capital raised by the new bank management. The FDIC received $970 million in preferred stock of a collecting bank and a guarantee for $100 million payable in 1998 towards the retirement of the collecting bank preferred stock.
	
	* Despite the recapitalization, the First City banks continued to engage in high-risk lending practices and experienced problems with the quality of their loan portfolios. By September 1990, the banks reported $183 million in profits and paid $122 million in cash dividends, but by September 1992, the banks incurred total losses of about $625 million and both the OCC and FRS projected the insolvency of the Houston and Dallas banks by the end of 1992.

	* Ultimately, the FDIC rejected a Type A transaction for open bank assistance due to its estimated cost of $240 million, which was higher than the FDIC's estimate of $179 million to liquidate the banks. The FDIC also rejected First City's self-rescue proposals due to concerns about the ability of First City bank management to execute the proposals and the estimated $200 million capital shortfall at the reconstituted banks.

	• The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) requested the Defense Science Board (DSB) to identify DOD activities that could be done more efficiently by the private sector and determine the expected savings from outsourcing.
	• The DSB's first report focused on outsourcing and privatization issues, concluding that DOD could save 30-40% of logistics costs by outsourcing support services. The second report had a broader scope, including other methods for reducing infrastructure costs.
	• The DSB estimated that an aggressive DOD outsourcing initiative could generate savings of $7 billion to $12 billion annually by fiscal year 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions.
	• The DSB suggested that DOD invest about $6 billion but would ultimately save about $30 billion annually by the year 2002, with $6 billion from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities.
	• The DSB's estimate of $14 billion for CONUS logistics costs is considered conservative, as the Navy has reported more than $8.5 billion applied to maintenance programs in fiscal year 1996.
	• DOD has significant opportunities for reducing logistics costs and improving performance by changing its business processes, as found in best practices within the private sector and ongoing work at DOD.
	• Achieving significant cost savings may require up-front investments, the closure of installations, and the elimination of military and civilian jobs, which DOD officials recognize as difficult and painful.

	• Examples of refocused missions include BOR changing its emphasis from water project construction to water resources management, and NASA's Human Space Flight program shifting its focus to research and development
	• Reengineered work processes included consolidating functions into fewer locations, aligning operations with private sector business practices, and increasing reliance on contractors
	• Components took steps to build and maintain skilled workforces, such as retraining employees for additional responsibilities and consolidating expertise in fewer locations
	• Despite concerns about the sufficiency of current or future workforces, most officials, employee representatives, and employees believed that performance had been maintained during downsizing
	• Limited customer survey data generally supported the view that customers remained satisfied, but some customers of the Office of Housing and BOR did not agree
	• Officials, employee representatives, and employees largely believed that open lines of communication and soliciting employee input into the planning process were key to maintaining performance during downsizing

	• The casebuilding process compiles available data to establish the accuracy of information reported by taxpayers on their returns. Classification determines whether an NRP audit is necessary and which items need to be verified through an audit. NRP audits will address all issues identified by classifiers and will not be focused only on substantial issues or cases for which there is a reasonable likelihood of collecting unpaid taxes.
	• IRS designed NRP to minimize the burden on taxpayers by compiling NRP casebuilding materials that allow IRS to verify certain items on tax returns without requesting the information from the taxpayer, classifying returns according to items that need to be verified through an audit, and limiting most NRP audits to items that cannot be verified without an audit.
	• IRS plans to use NRP data to update return selection formulas, allow IRS to design prefiling programs that will help taxpayers comply with the tax law, and permit IRS to focus its limited resources on the most significant areas of noncompliance.
	• IRS conducted two tests of NRP processes prior to implementing the program, testing the casebuilding and classification processes in an NRP simulation in July 2002, and conducted another classification process test during the initial classification training session in September 2002.

		• Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to regulatory requirements and contracting practices designed to protect the government’s interests.
	• The use of franchise funds’ contracting services involves three main parties: the government customer, the franchise fund, and the contractor.
		• DOD program officials are most familiar with the technical requirements for the goods and services they need.
		• DOD contracting officers can place orders directly through many interagency contracts, or DOD can pay the franchise fund to assume many of the contracting responsibilities that normally would have been handled by DOD’s contracting officers.
	• GovWorks and FedSource can either make use of their own or other agencies’ contracts, or they can develop new, customized contracts to satisfy a DOD customer’s needs.

		• The use of other agencies’ contracting services may offer convenience and efficiency, but prior work and agency inspectors general have identified problems with compliance with federal requirements for competition and contractor oversight.

The Foundation received $3 million in surcharge coin proceeds from the Treasury in 1993, which were used for the Memorial Garden. However, the costs of the Memorial Garden have exceeded the amounts provided by the Coins Act, and the Foundation's current financial condition makes it uncertain whether it will be able to fund future costs of operating and maintaining the Memorial Garden.

	* **Establishment and Purpose of ASEAN**: ASEAN was established on August 8, 1967, with the adoption of the ASEAN Declaration in Bangkok, Thailand. The association had five members originally and expanded to its current 10 members during the 1980s and 1990s. The association was created to achieve joint goals including those related to economic growth; regional peace and security; collaboration and mutual assistance in a number of development areas; trade promotion; and linkages with other regional organizations.
	* **ASEAN Secretariat**: The ASEAN Secretariat was created in 1976 to serve as an administrative body consisting of representatives of each ASEAN member nation. The Secretariat is headed by a secretary-general, who serves a term of five years. The secretary-general's main responsibilities include organizing the annual foreign ministers' meeting; initiating, advising, coordinating, and implementing ASEAN activities; serving as spokesman and representative of ASEAN on all matters; and overseeing the operations of the ASEAN Secretariat.
	* **Principles and Challenges of ASEAN**: ASEAN operates on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members, which has led to difficulty in the group operating in formal concert. The expansion of ASEAN to include underdeveloped nations such as Laos, Cambodia, and Burma has created a wide range of interests within the group that make formal security and economic moves difficult to agree upon. However, ASEAN is starting to play a more active role in dealing with its members' differences, particularly over Burma's human rights record.
	* **New ASEAN Charter**: A new ASEAN Charter went into effect on December 15, 2007, which establishes a number of goals for ASEAN, including the maintenance of peace, stability, and security in the region; promotion of greater political, security, economic, and socio-cultural cooperation; preservation of Southeast Asia as an area free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons; creation of a just, democratic, and harmonious environment in the region; formation of a single market and production base; alleviation of poverty and the narrowing of the development gap",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_subpoints': 2, 'symbol': '*'}"

		- Beginning in 2006, 11 states have established alert systems for missing adults, administered by local and/or state law enforcement agencies.
	- **Legal Authority and Target Population**
		- Legal authority to establish the systems varies, with some states passing laws and others using executive orders or resolutions.
		- Target population includes vulnerable adults who may go missing due to cognitive or physical disabilities, natural catastrophes, or crimes.
	- **Administrative Responsibility and Training**
		- Administrative responsibility for the alerts is held by local and/or state law enforcement agencies.
		- Training of law enforcement agencies and other entities about the alerts is provided in many states.
	- **Process for Activating Alerts and Coordination**
		- The process for activating alerts involves meeting certain criteria, such as the individual's status being unknown and the disappearance posing a credible threat to their health or safety.
		- Coordination with other states is done through national or interstate law enforcement communication systems or fusion centers.
	- **System Costs and Use**
		- Costs for operating the alert systems annually range from about $40,000 to $182,000, with no information provided about costs to local law enforcement agencies or other stakeholders.
		- Ten out of 11 states have used the alert system, with the number of alerts activated ranging from one to 82.
	- **Outcomes**
		- Most states reported that the majority of the individuals were found alive, though at least one individual was found deceased in nearly every state, except Rhode Island.
	- **Federal Role**
		- Congress has proposed measures to assist in recovery efforts for missing adults, including the establishment of a grant program to encourage states to establish, expand, and coordinate alert systems for vulnerable adults.
		- The proposed program is similar to a federal grant program that funds training and technical assistance for AMBER Alert systems.

- Background and Context
  * The U.S. Constitution provides the President with two methods of appointing officers of the United States
  * The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to fill vacancies during the recess of the Senate
  * The Recess Appointments Clause has been a source of political tension between Presidents and Congresses
  * President Obama's appointments of Richard Cordray as Director of the CFPB and Terrence F. Flynn, Sharon Block, and Richard F. Griffin Jr. as members of the NLRB have been contentious

- Legal Issues and Analysis
  * The report analyzes the legal issues associated with the President's exercise of his Recess Appointments Clause power
  * The report discusses two legal principles that may impede a reviewing court from reaching the merits of a potential legal challenge to the appointments: standing and the political question doctrine
  * The report examines the constitutional validity of the appointments, potential statutory restrictions on a recess appointee's authority to exercise the powers of the CFPB, and how actions taken by the recess appointees may be impacted by a court ruling that the appointments are unlawful

- Recess Appointments Clause Interpretation
  * The Recess Appointments Clause has been interpreted to encompass both inter- and intrasession recesses of the Congress
  * The commission of a recess appointee expires at the sine die adjournment of the Senate's ""next Session""
  * A recess appointee possesses the same legal authority as a confirmed appointee

- Congressional Attempts to Dissuade Recess Appointments
  * Congress has attempted to dissuade the President from making recess appointments through legislation
  * The President's appointments of Cordray, Flynn, Block, and Griffin Jr. during a three-day recess between pro forma sessions raises significant legal questions

- Justiciability and Standing
  * A reviewing court would first consider a number of preliminary questions of justiciability, including whether the plaintiffs who have brought the claim have standing and whether the asserted claims present matters appropriately resolved by a court

			- Protection of non-federal lands through programs to assist state and local governments and communities.
			- Support for fire research, fire facilities, and improvements in forest health.
		• High wildfire costs and pending legislation are discussed in the last section of the report.
	• **History of Federal Wildfire Programs**
		• The FS was created in 1905 to halt wildfires in the national forests.
		• Aggressive fire control policies were developed in the 1920s and 1930s.
		• In the 1970s, these policies began to be questioned due to the ecological benefits of wildfires.
		• Concerns about fuel loads and catastrophic fires led to the establishment of the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters in 1994.
		• The Clinton Administration directed a review of federal fire policy, and the agencies released the new Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy & Program Review: Final Report in December 1995.
	• **Federal Wildfire Costs**
		• Wildfire funding has continued at relatively high levels since 2000.
		• Severe fire seasons seem to have become more common since 2000.
		• Total wildfire funding for FY2008 was a record high of $4.46 billion.
		• The high costs of firefighting continue to attract attention.
	• **Federal Land Fire Management Appropriations**
		• Total federal land fire management appropriations rose substantially in FY2001 and have since remained relatively high.

		• *Section 218 Agreements*: Social Security coverage is extended to state and local government employees through agreements between states and the Social Security Administration. These agreements cover positions, not individuals, and once coverage is provided, it generally cannot be terminated.
	• **Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of Mandatory Social Security Coverage**
		• *Financial Status of Social Security*: Long-range projections show that Social Security expenditures will exceed income by 16% on average over the next 75 years, and mandatory coverage of newly hired state and local government employees could help close the funding shortfall.
		• *Benefit Protections for Workers and Their Families*: Mandatory coverage could provide better benefit protections for workers and their families through the provision of dependents' and survivors' benefits and full cost-of-living adjustments under Social Security.
	• **Impact on States and Localities**
		• *Pension Systems Outside of Social Security*: Mandatory coverage could mitigate risks for plan sponsors and participants in separate retirement systems and prevent benefit reductions or contribution increases in non-covered pensions.
		• *Administrative Burdens and Constitutional Issues*: Mandating coverage could impose significant administrative burdens on state and local governments and raise constitutional issues, but GAO believes it is likely to be upheld under current Supreme Court decisions.
	• **Social Perspective**
		• *Poverty Reduction and Income Redistribution*: Non-covered state and local government workers do not share in providing poverty reduction through Social Security, placing an extra burden on higher-earning workers within the system.

	+ There are various forestry assistance programs, each with its own purposes, activities funded, eligibility requirements, authorized program duration and funding level, and requested and enacted program appropriations.
	+ Some of the programs include Forest Health Protection, Forest Stewardship, and Cooperative Forestry Assistance.
	+ These programs support a variety of forest management and protection goals, including activities related to planning for and responding to wildfires, as well as supporting the development of new uses and markets for wood products.

- Eligibility Requirements
	+ To be eligible to receive funds for most of the programs, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan.
	+ The State Forest Action Plans are to be reviewed every 5 years and revised every 10 years.
	+ All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 8 territories are covered by a State Forest Action Plan.
	+ Each state must also publish an annual funding report and have a State Forest Stewardship Coordination (FSC) Committee.

- Types of Assistance
	+ The forestry programs may provide technical assistance, financial assistance, or both.

- **History and Functions of Money**
	+ Early forms of money had intrinsic value, such as precious metals like copper, silver, and gold.
	+ Fiat money, such as the US dollar, derives its value from government decree and is used for economic activities like paying taxes or settling debts.
	+ Money serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.
- **Traditional Money Systems**
	+ Governments and intermediaries like banks have played a role in assigning value to money and facilitating transactions.
	+ Banks offer services to accomplish valid transfers of value between parties who are not in physical proximity and do not necessarily trust each other.
	+ Modern monies are generally fiat money, including the US dollar, which is legal tender and maintained by the Federal Reserve System.
- **Electronic Payment Systems**
	+ Electronic payment systems can be subject to the double spending problem, where a payer may wish to send a digital file to multiple payees.
	+ Intermediaries like private banks, government central banks, or other financial institutions are traditionally involved in electronic transfers of money.
	+ Intermediaries store and protect huge amounts of data and are highly regulated to ensure safety, profitability, consumer protection, and financial stability.
- **Cryptocurrencies**
	+ Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin provide an alternative to traditional electronic payment systems.
	+ Cryptocurrency platforms use public ledgers and cryptographic protocols to validate transactions and prevent double spending.
	+ Users mine cryptocurrencies by performing work to extract the scarce unit of value from the platform.
- **Cryptocurrency Risks and Challenges**
	+ The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes identifying authoritative sources of industry data difficult.
	+ The recent proliferation of cryptocurrency adds additional challenges to performing industry-wide analysis.
	+ Cryptographers and computer scientists generally agree that cryptocurrency ledgers are mathematically secure, but hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in certain exchanges and individuals' devices to steal cryptocurrency.

	• Selection Criteria and Performance Indicators: MCA participants will be selected based on their performance measured by 16 economic and political indicators. In most cases, a score above the group median on the indicator would represent a passing ""grade"". The MCABoard of Directors will be guided by the statistical outcomes, but maintain some discretion over the final selection. Corruption measure is ""pass-fail"". To be eligible, a country must score above the median on the corruption indicator, as compiled by the World BankInstitute.

	• Requesting presidential proclamations
• Nonlegislative options:
	• Sending certificates of recognition
	• Making floor speeches
	• Sending flags flown over the Capitol Building to constituents

In the 1960s, initiatives were undertaken to reduce the number of commemoratives proposed through legislation due to concern that the legislative time spent on commemorative measures was excessive. These initiatives included creating an advisory commission to recommend appropriate commemorations and amending congressional rules on the introduction and consideration of commemorative legislation.

Since House Rule XII, clause 5 was adopted in the 104th Congress, it has been waived by unanimous consent on at least one occasion to allow for the consideration of H.J.Res. 71 (107th Congress, 2001-2002), legislation establishing Patriot Day as a day of remembrance for September 11, 2001.

Congress's commemorative options fall into two general categories: legislative options and nonlegislative options. All legislative options require passage of a bill or resolution by the House, the Senate, or both chambers, while nonlegislative options can be accomplished by individual offices without legislative approval.

Legislative options include naming federal buildings, designing postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding congressional gold medals, creating monuments and memorials, designating commemorative observances, establishing federal holidays, and requesting presidential proclamations. Nonlegislative options include creating individual office awards, giving floor speeches, sending official letters, and ordering flags.

* The text discusses the use of protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry to define the composition of complex proteomes and the functions of protein complexes.
	+ Current ion trap mass spectrometers are very sensitive and can identify hundreds of proteins in a single LC-MS/MS analysis.
	+ However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from very complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present in the sample over wide concentration ranges.
	+ Samples are typically fractionated at either the protein level or peptide level, or both, with the final step involving analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS.
	+ Undersampling can occur, where only a subset of the peptides will be identified if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer.
	+ The lists of proteins identified are often variable, raising concerns about the reproducibility of proteomics for most applications.
	+ Strategies for achieving more comprehensive proteome coverage include repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses, prefractionating the proteome based on protein physical properties, improving separation of the peptide mixture at the HPLC separation step, modifying the ESI interface to enhance ionization, or adding an ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) interface before the ion trap.
	+ Proteome coverage can also be improved at the data analysis stage by using high-mass-accuracy data or improved data-process algorithms.
	+ A two-step method and a replay run can also achieve increased sensitivity, but it is difficult to assess the relative importance of strategies that have not been directly compared in a single study.
	+ Direct comparisons of alternative analysis strategies have been conducted to identify the best analysis approaches for specific types of samples such as serum and cell or tissue lysates.
	+ Factors that should be considered when comparing alternative analysis strategies include the amount of total protein required for the analysis and the total amount of mass spectrometry instrument time required by each method.

• Endothelial cells were grown and stimulated with plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to produce EMPs, which were then characterized and quantified using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
• EMPs were introduced into an IV bag containing 0.9% saline and manually agitated, then circulated through a CVVH filter for 70 minutes.
• 0.5 ml aliquots were removed at 10-minute intervals for flow cytometric analysis to record and express EMP levels as a fraction of the starting concentration after mixing occurred.
• The results show that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical CVVH filter and under clinical conditions removes EMPs from the model patient's circulation.
• The study suggests that CVVH could be an effective tool for managing ALI by targeting both the molecular machinery and iatrogenic components of the disease.
• Future studies include assaying patients pre- and post-dialysis to observe EMP concentration effects and examining the efficacy of dialysis in rodent models of EMP-induced ALI.

- **Clinical Governance (CG) in Iranian Hospitals**
	+ CG was introduced in the UK in 1997 as a strategy to improve the quality of healthcare services.
	+ The Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) applied CG as a framework for improving quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009.
	+ MOHME used the definition of CG provided by Scally and Donaldson as a guide to implement the policy.
	+ The CG model developed in Iran consists of seven interlocking components including: clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information.
	+ Systems awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication are considered as a foundation of this model.
- **Barriers and Facilitators in CG Implementation**
	+ Insufficient knowledge and attitude toward CG, lack of resources, inadequate information technology systems, resistance to change, necessity of cultural change, and professional boundaries are the main factors that affect the success of quality improvement activities.
	+ Raising awareness of CG among managers, supportive culture, and sufficient resources are the main facilitators in CG implementation.
	+ Previous literature provides inadequate understanding about senior managers' viewpoint toward facilitators and barriers in CG implementation.
- **Qualitative Research on Senior Managers' Viewpoint**
	+ A qualitative research was employed to capture both facilitators and barriers in CG implementation from the viewpoint of curative deputies in Iranian medical universities.
	+ The research used two main information sources: face-to-face interviews and relevant document reviews.
	+ The sampling continued until reaching data saturation, and finally, 43 deputies were interviewed.
	+ The qualitative thematic framework analysis was used to analyze the data with the assistance of the Atlas-ti, qualitative data analysis software.
- **Findings of the Study**
	+ Most senior managers accepted that improving quality of healthcare should be integral to their role and essential to safeguard patient care.
	+ They believed that quality improvement is a strategic goal to achieve central government targets.
	+ The findings demonstrated the willingness to support and positive attitude towards CG.

- History and characteristics of ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs)
  - First described by Friedrich in 1857
  - Originally thought to be congenital, now suspected to be a detached hepatic diverticulum or abnormal tracheobronchial bud
  - Found most commonly in segment IV of the left lobe, just beneath the hepatic capsule
  - Average age of presentation is 52 years, with slight female predominance
  - Nearly 40% of cases found incidentally on imaging studies
  - Majority of cases (55) reported in the last 25 years
- Diagnosis and imaging findings
  - Typically appear as anechoic or hypoechoic cysts with spotty hyperechoic areas on ultrasound
  - Non-enhancing, rounded lesion of varying density on CT, depending on the contents of the cyst
  - Hyperintense cyst on T2-weighted images and variable appearance on T1-weighted images on MRI
  - Differential diagnosis includes simple cyst, hydatid cyst, biliary cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and bronchogenic cyst
- Treatment options
  - Observation, aspiration, or surgical excision
  - For cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, or asymptomatic lesions with wall abnormalities on imaging, surgical excision is recommended
  - Minimally invasive approach, such as laparoscopic excision, is best suited for lesions in segments II to VI, the anterolateral portion of the liver
  - For lesions in segment VII or VIII, positioning and port placement similar to that used for laparoscopic right adrenalectomy may afford improved exposure

  * Currently, there is no consensus on the appropriate outcomes to monitor for SMIs, making it difficult to determine their cost-effectiveness and clinical impact.
  * The theoretical premises underpinning SMIs are also unclear, making it difficult to maintain intervention fidelity and measure changes effectively.
  * Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are important for evaluating SMIs, but their accuracy is dependent on their ability to reflect the variable in question.
- A recent international Delphi study resulted in the development of the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist, which can be used to assess the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties.
  * The COSMIN checklist has good inter-rater agreement and reliability and is based on the consensus of experts in psychometric theory.
  * It addresses modern psychometric theory methodology, such as item response theory, as well as classical test theory.
  * The COSMIN checklist can be used to assess the internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, content validity, structural validity, hypothesis testing, cross-cultural validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness of SMIs.
- This systematic review aims to examine the outcome measures adopted in stroke SMIs in terms of their methodological quality and psychometric properties for use with stroke populations.

• Factors contributing to obesity:
   • Increasingly sedentary lifestyle
   • Rising consumption of caloric foods
   • Multifactorial etiology, including eating habits, sedentary lifestyle, and genetic predisposition

• Effects of high-fat diet and ovariectomy on rats:
   • Administration of a high-fat diet in rodents promotes metabolic changes, inducing the production of proinflammatory interleukins and a chronic inflammatory process
   • Ovariectomy combined with a hyperlipidic diet causes an increase in body weight gain and high food efficiency
   • Ovariectomy combined with a hyperlipidic diet also causes an increase in serum leptin levels

• Effects of ovariectomy on cytokines content:
   • Administration of a hyperlipidic diet associated with ovariectomy decreases the tnf- content of mes adipose tissues
   • The il-6 content was decreased by the hyperlipidic diet; however, in combination with ovariectomy, this effect was reversed in ret adipose tissues
   • The hyperlipidic diet caused a decrease in il-10 levels, but ovariectomy had the opposite effect, and the tnf- content of ret adipose tissues was high following ovariectomy

• Effects of ovariectomy on energy homeostasis:
   • Ovariectomy promotes hyperphagia and weight gain
   • Estrogen replacement decreases food intake and restores weight in ovariectomized rats
   • Estrogen is involved in the modulation of energy homeostasis by direct action on the appetite and central pathways regulating energy and by controlling the secretion of hormonal signals peripherals such as leptin

		• The study found that AAA treatment rescued RGCs from apoptosis and significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the AOH model. Additionally, AAA treatment significantly increased the number of thy-1-positive RGCs, indicating a rescue of RGCs from AOH-induced apoptosis.
	• To determine if AAA protects against AOH-induced RGC death through modulating Müller cell gliosis, immunohistochemistry for GFAP (a marker for activated glial cells) and GS (Müller cell-specific marker) was conducted.
		• The study found that Müller cells were activated in the AOH model, as indicated by colocalization of GFAP and GS across the inner plexiform layer (IPL). AAA treatment markedly reduced GFAP immunoreactivity across the IPL, indicating attenuation in Müller cell gliosis.
	• To determine if AAA modulates TNF- production, western blot was performed for the investigation of retinal protein levels of TNF-.

- Development and evaluation of a new full-thickness resection (FTR) method for nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms (SDNs)
- Five patients underwent resection of nonampullary SDNs using the new FTR method, named laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFR-L)
- The new method was found to be effective and safe, with no complications, and all resections achieving complete en-bloc resection
- LAEFR-L has advantages over conventional FTR methods, including avoiding peritoneal exposure of tumor cells and not requiring proficient experience in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (ESD)

* Four of the five tumors were located in the second part of the duodenum, and one was located in the duodenal bulb
* Mean operative time was 173 minutes (range 138-217 minutes), and mean tumor size was 9 mm (range 7-11 mm)

- The new method involves laparoscopic mobilization of the duodenum, endoscopic identification of the target lesion, ligation of the lesion using a ligation device, and resection using a snare technique
- After resection, the specimen is retrieved intraluminally using the endoscope, and the defect in the duodenal wall is closed using laparoscopic sutures, preventing exposure of the abdominal cavity to malignant cells

* Inhibitors of gastric acid and protease secretion were administered to the patients during their hospitalizations
* A normal diet was resumed approximately 2 days after the procedure, and the patients were discharged after a 1-week hospital stay

- Tumor size and location are important factors to consider when determining the indication for LAEFR-L
- Lesions smaller than 15 mm in diameter and not close to the ampulla of Vater may be candidates for this procedure

This may be due to the preservation of intrafibrillar mineral, which makes collagen fibrils more stable and less affected by dehydration, improving the infiltration of the luting agent.

• Myosin VA (Myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
 - Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n-terminal motor domains (i.e., heads) connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain.
 - Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis.
 - The motion is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in the motor's processive motion as each head takes 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.

• Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual Myova motors and their subdomains.
 - TPM has been used extensively to characterize the contour length of DNA tethers.
 - The utilization of TPM involved anchoring a Myova-actin complex to a microscope slide and then attaching a visible particle (i.e., fluorescent quantum dot (Qdot)) to a desired location along the motor.
 - Thermal energy caused the Qdot to be randomly displaced within bounds defined by the length and stiffness of the effective tether (i.e., the Myova).

- Study design and participants
* 416 subjects divided into 4 groups based on the presence or absence of renal insufficiency (RI) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
* Participants were local residents of Han ethnicity in Shanghai, China
* Exclusion criteria: type 1 diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, systemic inflammatory disorders, severe heart failure, advanced RI, and malignant tumor

- Measurements and results
* Measured serum vaspin and adiponectin levels, clinical parameters, and biochemical variables
* Patients with RI, regardless of T2DM status, were older and had lower BMI, higher SBP than those without RI
* Serum vaspin showed no significant difference between non-T2DM patients with or without RI, but was significantly lower in T2DM patients compared to non-T2DM individuals
* Serum adiponectin was significantly higher in non-diabetic individuals with RI and in diabetic patients with RI compared to those without RI, regardless of T2DM status
* Multiple regression analyses showed that HbA1c level was independently and significantly associated with vaspin concentration, and creatinine clearance level was associated with adiponectin concentration in all subjects

- Discussion and implications
* Vaspin and adiponectin levels were both higher in women than in men
* Vaspin plays an important role in the metabolic syndrome, and its upregulation can improve insulin resistance, inhibit inflammation, and progression of atherosclerosis
* Decreased vaspin levels in RI patients may increase the risk of coronary heart disease, and measuring adipokine levels in patients with RI may be beneficial for predicting cardiovascular events and patient survival
* Adiponectin has antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and antiproliferative effects in cancer cells, and its plasma levels are reduced in obese humans, particularly those with visceral obesity
* Rosiglitazone can increase serum adiponectin levels in patients with T2DM, and both T2DM and RI were correlated with the serum level of adiponectin in the current study",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"

* Digital mammography (DM) is the most commonly performed procedure for breast cancer detection
- DM is less likely to be lost or damaged, and has slightly higher sensitivity than screen-film mammography (SFM)

- Tomosynthesis, a 3-D procedure, may help solve this problem by decreasing the problem of confusing overlapping tissue
* DM has been in use for over 30 years and has replaced SFM in most practices in the US
- DM enables viewing and manipulation of DM images on computer workstations
- Radiation dose is a concern with mammography, given that it is a screening examination performed on millions of women potentially every year
- A specific digital system using slot scanning with a photon-counting detector has been found to reduce doses by 40%-60% and has shown the lowest mean glandular dose in clinical screening settings in Europe

* One limitation of both SFM and DM is false positives (recall for additional imaging)
- Women have been recalled for additional imaging from the earliest days of mammogram screening
- Recalls can also lead to false-positive biopsies, which are time-consuming for the radiologist and patient, and stressful and inconvenient for the patient
- Recall rates in the US are about twofold higher than in Europe, with guidelines in the US at overall < 10%, compared to guidelines in Europe of 3%-7% (< 5%)

680,"• Nasopharyngeal bursitis is a condition that originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut.
• It is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication that normally disappears during fetal development.
• There are two types of nasopharyngeal bursitis: cystic and crust.
• The cystic type is more common and forms when the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, while the crust type forms when crusts adhere to the orifice without obstruction.
• Symptoms of nasopharyngeal bursitis include space-occupying lesion symptoms (nasal obstruction, eustachian tube obstruction, dysphagia, cranial nerve paralysis) or rhinitis symptoms (choanal discharge, halitosis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, gastritis).
• The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, but it can appear at any age.

• In the US, approximately 20 million adults have gallstones and 1 million new patients are diagnosed with cholelithiasis each year, making it the most costly digestive disease with an estimated annual cost of over $5 billion.
• In 1992, the National Institute of Health convened a conference to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, concluding that it offered substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no increase in morbidity or mortality.
• The reduction in pain and disability with laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in equal or slightly less treatment costs compared to open cholecystectomy, with substantial savings to patients and society due to the shortened period of disability.
• The disability and loss of income following standard open cholecystectomy further increase cost, but these items are generally not measured by traditional appraisal methods. This convalescent period and, consequently, costs have been greatly reduced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
• A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients was conducted to determine the charges for laparoscopy by comparing 35 converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies with 35 open cholecystectomies, matched for age, sex, and similar diagnosis.
• The average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922 (SD=$7,134), and that of open cholecystectomies, $13,042 (SD=$9,715) (p=<0.01). The amount attributed to laparoscopy was $6,880 ($19,922 - $13,042).
• Decision tree analysis showed that, regardless of the rate of conversion, open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective. However, if charges could be reduced to certain levels, depending on the conversion rate, laparoscopic cholecystectomy would become cost-effective.

  - A total of 5,269 participants with these disorders were recruited and randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two-by-two factorial design and followed for a median of 3 years after randomization.
- The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in β-cell function over the course of follow-up.
  - β-cell function was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
  - IGI and PI concentration were divided by HOMA-IR and c-peptide concentration, respectively, to account for the compensatory response of insulin secretion in relation to background insulin resistance.
- Participants receiving rosiglitazone had a significant increase in IGI/IR and a significant decrease in PI/C, while there were no significant changes in participants receiving ramipril.

• Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths.
• Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
• N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have beneficial effects on CVD, including lipid lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects.
• Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease characterized by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions, and endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide and prostaglandins to maintain a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules.
• In the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts, leading to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 1, 2, and 6 and tumor necrosis factor, which can induce oxidative stress and further progression of the disease.
• PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response.
• The human body can produce almost all fatty acids except linoleic acid (LA, c18:2 n-6, precursor to the n-6 series of fatty acids) and -linoleic acid (ALA, c18:3n-3, precursor to the n-3 series of fatty acids).
• The biochemical pathways converting ALA to EPA and EPA to DHA are limited, and tissue and circulating EPA and DHA levels are primarily related to their dietary intake.
• Fish is the major food source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, including EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), while ALA is a plant n-3 fatty acid mainly found in seeds, nuts, and their oils.

	• Pelayo Correa, a Colombian pathologist, published a model for gastric cancer development in 1975, hypothesizing a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over 30-50 years.
	• Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005.
	• Initial investigations into a possible association of H. pylori with gastric cancer provided weak evidence, but later cohort studies with nested case-controls found a significant correlation.
	• The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer declared H. pylori a definite (Group 1) carcinogen in 1994 based on epidemiologic studies, despite a lack of supporting evidence from animal models or basic science research.
	• Subsequent research has confirmed and expanded upon early epidemiologic studies, with key additional clinical findings including:
		- Cardia cancers are not associated strongly with H. pylori infection.
		- H. pylori is just as great a risk factor for diffuse-type gastric cancer as it is for intestinal-type cancers.
		- Measuring H. pylori exposure by ELISA underestimates prior exposure and attributable risk.
		- Caga-positive H. pylori strains increase the risk of gastric cancer to a greater extent than do infections by caga-negative strains.
		- H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer.

  * In proximal airways, tracheal basal cells have been identified as pluripotent and able to give rise to cells of multiple phenotypes in response to injury.
  * In middle airways, mature clara cells have been shown to proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny in response to injury.
  * In distal airways, the cell surface marker phenotype of representative lung stem cells remains under debate.
- The hierarchical or cancer stem cell hypothesis is an important theory in understanding lung tumorigenesis.
  * Relatively rare, multipotent cells gain unlimited proliferative potential and drive tumor growth.

- Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, characterized by specific types of seizures, EEG patterns, and cognitive impairment.
	+ Seizure types: tonic, atonic, atypical absence, myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, or partial.
	+ EEG patterns: slow spike wave discharges (less than 3 Hz) and paroxysms of low voltage fast activity at about 10 Hz during sleep.
	+ Cognitive impairment: moderate to severe mental retardation and behavioral disorders including aggression and autistic features.
	+ Etiologies: cortical maldevelopment, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, CNS infection, or neurometabolic disorders.
- Rufinamide, a novel anticonvulsant drug, has shown promising potential for treatment of LGS and other seizure types.
	+ Mechanism of action: decreased firing of high frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.
	+ Efficacy: rufinamide significantly decreased total seizures and tonic-atonic seizures in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial involving 138 patients with LGS.
	+ Safety profile: rufinamide has an excellent safety profile in animals and lacks obvious cognitive side effects and behavioral toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In a multicenter study of 189 adolescent and adult patients with partial seizures, 12 weeks of treatment with rufinamide failed to cause deficits in several measures of cognitive function.
	+ Pharmacokinetics: rufinamide is well absorbed, has low protein binding, and is eliminated primarily via metabolism.

• Rubella infection during early stages of pregnancy has a 90% potential of passing through the placenta and affecting the fetus, leading to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
• Vaccination of susceptible individuals, especially women in reproductive age, can prevent the disease and its complications. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent CRS, which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.
• In Iran, the rubella and mumps vaccines were added to the national vaccination plan in 2003, resulting in 98% vaccination of the 5 to 25 age group. This has significantly decreased the appearance of measles and rubella.
• A study in Kermanshah, Iran, compared the susceptibility and resistance of Kermanshahi girls at marriage before and after mass rubella vaccination. The study found a significant increase in immunity after vaccination.
• Further studies on rubella seroepidemiology are recommended to monitor the immunity status of vulnerable society members, such as pregnant women, and to ensure timely vaccination if necessary.

• The rubella vaccination was established in Australia in 1971 and in Denmark in 1987, leading to a significant decrease in CRS.
• A seroepidemiological study in Chahar Mahal-va-Bakhtiari province, Iran, in 1997, using the hemoagglutination inhibition (HI) method, indicated 90.5% immunity against rubella.

• Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a technique used to visualize gene expression patterns in biological systems.
• Gene-specific RNA probes are used to detect the expression of specific genes during development, providing valuable information about the role of these genes and the positioning and movement of specific cell types.
• The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts has several advantages over chromogenic methods, including higher quality three-dimensional imaging, multiplexing different RNA species, and covisualization of RNA with proteins.
• However, the use of fluorescent methods for WISH is not yet widespread due to the high endogenous background fluorescence of many embryos and the limited brightness and photostability of organic fluorophores.
• Quantum dots (QDs), a new type of inorganic fluorophore, have ideal optical properties for use in biology and have been used successfully for in situ hybridization in clinical biopsies for the detection of multiple mRNAs.

• QDs have several advantages over organic fluorophores for use in WISH, including a strong fluorescent signal emission, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between the excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching.
• These unique optical properties make QDs an ideal candidate for detecting multiple mRNAs in WISH protocols and their high fluorescence intensity raises the possibility of using them for RNA detection in whole embryos.
• Previous efforts to use QDs for RNA detection in whole embryos have met with aggregation issues and were time-consuming due to the need for RNA to be covalently linked to hydroxylated QDs.
• New methods for creating hydrophilic QDs and the availability of hydrophilic QD conjugates have addressed these issues, but studies have pointed out difficulties in using QDs for fish experiments, including steric hindrance, degradation of QD conjugates, and adherence to tubes and tips.

- The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model is an extension of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and aims to provide quality, coordinated, and cost-effective care to patients.
  - The CCM was developed to address the increasing rate of patients with chronic conditions in the US using team-based care.
  - The PCMH model strives to increase access to services, practice efficiency, provider and patient satisfaction, and reduce healthcare costs while improving patient care quality.
- The transition to PCMH can be challenging, but over 1,500 sites and 7,700 clinicians across the US have successfully completed the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recognition process.
  - Encouraged by the expansion of PCMH across the US, medical practitioners and healthcare administrators met in Alexandria, Virginia, to discuss their experiences with the transition.
  - Carillion Clinic and the Air Force contributed the vast majority of the examples and experiences discussed in the paper.
- To become recognized as a PCMH by the NCQA, a practice must provide documentation of the practice's guidelines for implementation.
  - Practices must create their own written policies that adhere to PCMH principles and fit the specific practice structure.
  - Practices must account for their patient panels, location, and financial resources when creating policies.
- The PCMH model introduces team-based care to primary care practices, requiring staff to address patient treatment decisions collectively.
  - Previous studies show the use of previsit huddles has resulted in improved decision-making and care for patients.
  - Patients provided with team-based care had increases in their satisfaction levels from 5 to 10 points in five out of six satisfaction care scales.
- Implementing the PCMH model requires significant changes in office culture.

	• Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids/proteins, or adipose tissue, forming the glucostatic, aminostatic, and lipostatic hypotheses.
	• More recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as sensory features of food.
	• Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the GI tract.
	• A new formulation explains how aspects of body composition and energy expenditure (EE) regulate hunger and appetite.
	• This formulation is based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects.
	• The major task for any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat and intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signalling and tonic inhibition.

	• The interplay between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI) has led to an alternative approach to appetite control.
	• Any increase in EE is met with an equivalent increase in EI, suggesting that differences in food intake originate in differences in energy expenditure.
	• Edholm's experimental studies revealed no correlation between EE and EI in a single day, but there was a good correlation over two weeks.
	• Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of total daily EE and is quite uniform across the day and between days.
	• RMR could provide a tonic signal of energy demand that could act as a driver of daily EI.

	* **Cell separation techniques** are essential in clinical and basic research, such as in HIV diagnostic tests and stem cell biology.
		+ **Size- and density-based approaches** offer potential for separation of cell subpopulations for which specific markers are not known or can't be used.
		+ **Affinity-based approaches** (fluorescence-, magnetic-, adhesion-, and electrophoretic-based) can provide fast and continuous separation with high specificity.
	* **Microfluidic cell separation devices** have several advantages over conventional techniques, including small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential for integration with analytical techniques.
		+ Many of these technologies are derived from the semiconductor industry or synthetic chemistry.
		+ Cell separation techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: size and density, and affinity (chemical, electrical, or magnetic).
	* **Size-based separation processes** are being employed in micro- and nanoscale devices, which are compact, simple, and usually do not require additional energy sources or equipment.
		+ These devices force a fluid containing a heterogeneous particle population through a series of channels or obstacles of varied size, ensuring laminar flow.
		+ The main advantage of the size-based approach is that it does not require the presence of cell-specific markers or proteins to achieve separation.
	* **Adhesion-based separation systems** are akin to chromatography columns, where a mixture is passed through a column packed with beads or other materials capable of binding to the undesired constituents of the feed.
		+ An important advantage of this technique is that it can be used to separate cell populations that have the same size and/or density, such as subpopulations of human lymphocytes.
		+ Microfluidic adhesion-based systems provide high surface areas per unit volume but their small overall volume keeps residence times short.
	* **Microscale magnetic separation** is of particular interest since it can easily be miniaturized and utilized in applications where small sample volume is required.

		+ MS is a chronic progressive disease affecting the myelin sheath covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, leading to functional impairments such as visual impairment, abnormal walking mechanics, poor balance, muscle weakness, fatigue, and progressive immobilization.
		+ Impaired mobility or lack of weight-bearing physical activity reduces mechanical stress on bone, causing a marked imbalance in bone remodeling with a disruption of osteocytes network.

		+ Several studies have shown that vertebral BMD is affected to a lesser degree than femoral BMD.

		+ The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of the osteoporosis in patients with MS are probably based on the progressive immobilization, long-term GCS treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and possibly on the presence of various cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of MS.
		+ Chronic use of other drugs, such as antidepressants, may contribute to the development of osteoporosis and fractures.

- miRNAs have been found to be expressed in a cell type-specific manner, at specific developmental stages, and in disease states including cancer
- During cancer initiation and progression, miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors
- The miR-200 family, which contains five members, has been implicated in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
- The miR-200 family members are responsible for repressing zeb1 and zeb2 as well as other mesenchymal genes
- A double negative feedback loop exists between mir-200 family members and zeb1, allowing for plasticity between the epithelial and mesenchymal states
- The mutual repression between zeb1 and mir-200c is functional in some, but not all cells, and the decrease in migration and invasion observed when mir-200c is reintroduced to cancer cells that lack it is independent of restoration of e-cadherin

	+ Loss of mir-200c is a marker for chemoresistance and aggressiveness in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers
	+ Members of the mir-200 family can repress zeb1 by degradation of its transcript, and zeb1 can repress expression of the mir-200 family members by binding to e-boxes within their promoter regions
	+ Directly increasing mir-200c levels in hey cells by transfection of a mir-200c mimic results in repression of zeb1 expression
	+ Transient transfection of the mir-200c mimic into mda-mb-231 and hec50 cells causes a marked repression of zeb1 and a restoration of e-cadherin expression
	+ Stable transduction of lentiviral shRNAs targeting zeb1 into these two cell lines causes a re-expression of e-cadherin in both cell lines

	* Development of transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence
		- Delorme first described the transobturator approach using a midurethral sling (MUS) placement to prevent complications associated with the retropubic MUS placement (Delorme, 2001; Ulmsten et al., 1996)
		- De Leval later described a similar transobturator passage using an inside-out approach to further reduce potential injury to the urethra and bladder (De Leval, 2003)
	* Comparison of surgical approaches
		- A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the 3 most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence, namely the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures (Latthe et al., 2010)
	* Anatomical studies
		- Multiple studies have discussed the anatomical trajectories of both obturator approaches and confirmed their anatomical safety from a neurovascular perspective (Bonnet et al., 2005; Achtari et al., 2006; Hinoul et al., 2007; Zahn et al., 2007; Reisenauer et al., 2006)
		- Anatomical studies have focused on the MUS's trajectory in relation to the obturator foramen, the muscles and especially the neuro-vascular structures
		- Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the MUS's configuration in relation to the urethra
	* Cadaveric study
		- The aim of the study was to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach
		- CT-scan image analysis was performed after tantalum wire marked mesh slings were implanted in a series of cadavers
		- The surgical technique for the transobturator MUS procedures were performed according to the instructions for use as provided by the respective manufacturers

870,"	• The last meeting was a recap of the presentation by the Industrial Designer regarding the new remote control.
	• The remote should have a child-friendly design with few buttons, be colorful, and have star-shaped or other shaped buttons. It should also have an oversized design so it's not easily lost.
	• The remote should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, a switch to control features, color contrast, sharpness, and a memory switch. A mute button and speech recognition are also desired features.
	• The Industrial Designer proposed using a strong plastic material for the case, with an integrated circuit board and a temperature-resistant chip. She also suggested including a timer and/or alarm facility, as well as a rechargeable battery.
	• The marketing expert suggested that the remote should be small, easy to use, and eye-catching. She also emphasized the importance of getting to market before competitors do, and focusing on one or two key features for the marketing campaign.
	• The team decided that the special feature they want to include is a speech recognizer, with the energy source being a battery-operated chip. The design will be trendy, compact, and strong, with buttons.
	• The Industrial Designer presented a model of the remote, which is snail-shaped, blue, and has yellow buttons. The material for the case will be plastic, and the buttons will be made of soft rubber. The light emitting diode will be a fluorescent green bulb like an ordinary infrared.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Feedback regarding the prototype of the remote:
	+ Look and design: The prototype has a snail shape, is blue in color with yellow buttons, and is compact and attractive. The material used for the case is plastic, and the buttons are made of soft rubber. The LED is a fluorescent green bulb like an ordinary infrared.
	+ Features: The remote includes a switch on/off button, a mute button on both sides, one to nine buttons for controlling programs, two buttons for increasing or decreasing volume, two buttons for scrolling up or down channels, a menu button, and a swapping button for changing channels. It also has an inbuilt voice recogniser.
	+ Marketing considerations: The remote is easy to use with one thumb, has a prominent on-off button, and has symbols on the buttons for international markets.
	+ Additional feature: A holder for the remote in the shape of a snail shell.

<summary>

• Financing: The energy source is battery, and the electronics use a simple chip on print. The case is double curved, made of plastic with special colors, and has push buttons with symbols, special form, and special material (rubber). The total cost is within budget at eight point two euros.

• Production evaluation: The marketing expert suggests showing the prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups for fine tuning and to avoid any potential issues with the product. The shape, size, color, feel, and functionality of the prototype are all given high ratings.

• Adding voice recognition: There is no room for the voice recogniser in the current budget, but there is still four euros left to spend. The team decides to settle for whatever quality they can get for that price, even if it may not be the greatest quality.

• Evaluation scale: The team evaluates the shape, size, color, feel, and functionality of the prototype, giving each a rating of one (good) or higher. There is room for creativity and more features, such as adding more buttons or consolidating usage. The team is happy with the project process, leadership, team work, and means used. The costs are within budget, and the project has been evaluated.

- Discussion of issues with the PDA microphones:
  • The PDA microphones are often far from the speakers, which can cause issues with room noise and reverberation.
  • There is a pre-emphasis filter in the STRUT implementation, which may affect the high-pass filtering of the microphone input.
  • It is important to check the filtering for any microphone used with the PDA.
- Discussion of spectral subtraction and variance normalization:
  • Spectral subtraction can help reduce background noise, but it can also increase the variance of the signal.
  • Variance normalization can help adjust for differences in energy between different channels, but it can also make the speech and noise portions of the signal more similar.
  • It is important to find the right balance between spectral subtraction and variance normalization to improve voice activity detection and speech recognition.

	+ 70% of individuals who responded to the written consultation do not support the Bill.
	+ Parents who oppose the Bill argue that they understand the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent.

• Deputy Minister Julie Morgan AM believes that the Bill is necessary to update the law and make it clearer for parents and people working with children.

	+ Morgan argues that there should not be an excuse for physical punishment of children in the law.
	+ She also believes that defining acceptable ways of hitting or punishing children sends a confused message.

• The Bill does not create a new offence, but rather removes a defence to an offence of common assault.

	+ Ireland introduced similar legislation through an amendment to a Bill without detailed preparation and has not experienced significant negative impacts or increased workload.
	+ Wales has an implementation group to address issues and set up four work streams to look at parenting advice and support, data collection, evaluation and monitoring, operations, procedures and processes, and out-of-court disposals and diversions.

• The Bill's explanatory memorandum states that there is no definitive evidence that reasonable physical punishment causes negative outcomes for children.

	+ However, the Wales Centre for Public Policy's report found that all physical punishment, under all conditions, is potentially harmful to children.
	+ There is no peer-reviewed research that says physically punishing a child will improve things or have favorable outcomes.

• The Bill's implementation group includes representatives from the police, police and crime commissioners, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, the Association of Directors of Education in Wales, the Welsh Local Government Association, the legal profession, and the third sector.
