0,"1. The transport properties of nonlinear, non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport, and are of interest due to their potential for extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations.
2. Recent research has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, which are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes. The behavior of these systems is complex, with stability islands, chaotic seas, and co-existing attractors that can change significantly as parameters change.
3. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the time-averaged velocity of an ensemble of particles, can be positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics.
4. A later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals can occur in the absence of bifurcations, and proposed an alternative origin for current reversal related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits. However, their arguments are based on the behavior of a single particle, implicitly assuming ergodicity, which is not true for all chaotic systems.
5. The impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current was studied, and it was found that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and that it is important to discard transients in quantifying the current.
6. A bifurcation diagram for individual particles was constructed and it was found that while the broader conclusion of Mateos' conjecture still holds, there are cases of current reversals in the absence of bifurcations and bifurcations without current reversals.
7. A generalized version of Mateos' conjecture was found, that bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the current, but not necessarily current reversals.
8. The study of the behavior of general chaotic ratchets is important, and the approach taken is to consider specific systems in great detail before generalizing. The same one-dimensional ratchet considered previously by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno was chosen, with an",0
1,"1. The discovery of over 200 extrasolar planets has revealed a wide range of eccentricities, with many having moderate to high eccentricities.
2. Planet-planet scattering and merger scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of these eccentric planets.
3. The kozai mechanism, induced by interactions with stellar companions, can also increase a planet's eccentricity.
4. Of the 15 stars hosting a planet with high eccentricity, six also have stellar-mass companions, which could contribute to the kozai mechanism.
5. Test particle simulations are used to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six selected planetary systems.
6. The simulations reveal regions where additional planets could remain in stable orbits, with the duration of high-precision data being a limiting factor.
7. The radial-velocity measurements of six systems are analyzed, with no evidence of additional objects found in the residuals.
8. The tightest companion limits are obtained for hd 3651 and hd 45350, while the limits for hd 37605, hd 80606, and hd 89744 are substantially worse due to poor phase coverage and large intrinsic scatter.
9. The results demonstrate that there is no evidence for additional planets in the six systems and that test particle simulations can help identify regions where additional objects can exist.",1
2,"1. The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z decay into fermion pairs with high precision. The good agreement between LEP data and SM predictions has constrained new physics at the Z pole. A future Z factory could further investigate the properties of the Z boson, especially its exotic or rare decays, which are believed to be sensitive to new physics.
2. Among the rare Z decays, flavor changing (FC) processes have been extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics. Although these processes are severely suppressed in the SM, their branching ratios in new physics models can be greatly enhanced for lepton flavor violation decays and quark flavor violation decays.
3. Another type of rare process that has been widely studied is the Z decay into light Higgs bosons. For example, the decay Z → hA with the particle A denoting a light Higgs boson has been studied in various models, including the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).
4. In the 2HDM and MSSM, the rates of these decays can be as large as the SM prediction, which lies within the expected sensitivity of future Z factories. Recent studies have extended these decays to new models, such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and the Nearly Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM).
5. These non-minimal supersymmetric models can avoid the muon g-2 problem and alleviate the little hierarchy problem by having a light CP-odd Higgs boson with a singlet-dominant component. With the latest experiments, the properties of the light Higgs boson are more stringently constrained than before.
6. In this work, the authors study the rare Z decays Z → hA, Z → hZ, and Z → AA in a comparative way for four models, namely the Type-II 2HDM, the Lepton-Specific 2HDM (L2HDM), the NMSSM, and the NMSSM. They examine carefully the constraints on the light A from many latest experimental results and show the numerical results for the branching ratios of the rare Z decays",0
3,"1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles, with their masses expected to be below the TeV range. Mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology.
2. The no-scale type Kähler potential is a type of Kähler potential in which the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes. This scenario is highly predictive and has various phenomenological consequences with a few parameters. The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and the sequestered sector scenario in a five-dimensional setting.
3. In the no-scale scenario, the degrees of freedom of SUSY particle mass spectrum are limited because only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given. Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, mainly focusing on the mass spectrum. Direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint are considered, and the allowed region in the parameter space is identified.
4. Current limits from the lightest Higgs mass and the branching ratio for h → γγ are used to constrain the no-scale scenario. When universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, almost all the parameter region is excluded. However, when the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale, a relatively large parameter region is allowed. The constraints are also important when the higgsino-like neutralino is the LSP.",0
4,"1. Colliding plane waves (CPW) can result in spacelike singularities, but this strength is weakened by relative cross polarization before collision [1].
2. A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) has a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity [2], which led to studies on horizon stability [3, 4].
3. The CH in CPW spacetimes becomes an essential singularity when perturbed [3, 4], and the electromagnetic field weakens singularity strength [5].
4. The collision of pure electromagnetic (EM) waves may have special significance for singularity formation [5].
5. The Bell and Szekeres (BS) solution describes two linearly polarized step EM waves, with a removable CH singularity in the interaction region [5].
6. However, essential curvature singularities exist on the null boundaries of the BS solution [5].
7. The cross polarized version of the BS (CPBS) solution has regular Weyl scalars in the interaction region but maintains singularities on the null boundaries [6, 7].
8. The CPBS solution is used to test the Helliwell and Konkowski (HK) conjecture on CH stability, which is more economical than traditional perturbation analysis [8, 9].
9. The HK conjecture is applied to the spacetimes of single plane waves with added colliding test fields and colliding plane waves with non-singular interaction regions and added test fields [10].",1
5,"1. X-ray studies of normal galaxies have been extended to cosmologically interesting distances through deep field surveys, such as the CDF surveys, which have reached 1 ms of exposure. These surveys have detected significant numbers of normal galaxies among the population of X-ray sources contributing to the XRB. Normal galaxies contribute as much as 50% of the XRB flux in the 0.52 keV band.
2. The CDF-N survey has reached the depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies to z~1.3, corresponding to a look-back time of 8.2 Gyr. Reaching larger look-back times presents the possibility of detecting the bulk X-ray response to the heightened star formation rate at z~3. The X-ray luminosity per unit optical luminosity is expected to be larger at z~3 due to the increased energy output of X-ray binary populations.
3. Measurements of the X-ray luminosities of typical galaxies can constrain models of X-ray binary production in galaxies. While X-ray emission from individual galaxies is not easily detected at low flux levels, it is possible to estimate the emission at their extremely faint flux levels using statistical methods such as stacking.
4. This study uses the CDF-N survey data to place observational constraints on the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity of normal spiral galaxies up to z~1.3. Spectroscopic redshifts for the galaxies are drawn from catalogs in the range z=0.5-1.3. For the photometric sample, the f814w magnitudes of Fernández-Soto et al. (1999) are used.
5. The study selects galaxies with no X-ray detection within 40 in the 0.58 keV, 0.52 keV, and 2.8 keV bands down to a wavdetect significance threshold of 10^-5 in the restricted ACIS grade set. The catalog is then filtered to keep only classes (2) and (3) as defined by van den Bergh et al. (2001), resulting in a sample of galaxies similar to spiral galaxies in the local universe.",0
6,"1. Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, which can be categorized into different types of non-locality. 
2. Non-separable or entangled states are those that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents. 
3. Bell-nonlocality is the strongest form of non-classicality, where measurement correlations violate a Bell inequality, indicating the violation of local causality.
4. A bipartite state is Bell-local if and only if there is a local hidden variable (LHV) model for any measurements performed by the parties.
5. EPR-steering is a phenomenon where one party can steer the state of the other party using local measurements.
6. A bipartite state is EPR-steerable if and only if it allows for a demonstration of EPR-steering.
7. The logical hierarchy of these concepts leads to a hierarchy for the bipartite states, where the set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non-EPR-steerable states, which is a strict subset of the set of Bell-local states.
8. The steering ellipsoid formalism is used to investigate EPR-steerability of the class of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed.
9. Two sufficient conditions for t-states to be EPR-steerable are obtained via suitable EPR-steering inequalities, and a deterministic LHS model for projective measurements on these states is developed.",0
7,"1. The visionary who first proposed using an electron's spin to encode information is unknown, with Richard Feynman only casually mentioning the idea in the mid-1980s.
2. Encoding information in spin has potential advantages, such as lower power dissipation, reduced susceptibility to noise, and potential for faster operation.
3. In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed.
4. Spintronic NAND gates function by manipulating the spin orientations of confined electrons, with the magnetic field favoring parallel spin alignment.
5. A major challenge with spintronic devices is enforcing unidirectional flow of logic signals, as exchange interaction can cause cells to become stuck in metastable states.
6. In 1996, a solution was proposed to impose unidirectionality in time using a three-phase clock to propagate the input state through a linear array.
7. Despite progress in developing reversible logic gates using spins, challenges remain, such as the need for precise gate placement and energy dissipation during gate potential changes.",1
8,"1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass secondary that transfers mass to the white dwarf. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors has a period gap and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes, but theoretical models have not been able to accurately reproduce these features. The minimum period for CVs is reached when the mass transfer time scale and the thermal time scale are equal, and this minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the rate of orbital angular momentum losses. In this paper, the authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population. They also consider the effect of a form of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) where the angular momentum is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary.
2. The orbital angular momentum loss rate of a CV can be written as the sum of the systemic angular momentum loss rate and an explicit function of the mass transfer rate. The systemic angular momentum loss rate is independent of mass transfer, while the second term depends on the mass transfer rate. The authors consider the general case where the CAML mechanism, along with nova mass ejections, causes a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the system. This fraction may be greater than unity, as the primary may lose more mass during a nova outburst than was accreted since the last outburst. The authors employ a generic prescription of the effect of a CAML mechanism, thus avoiding the need to specify its physical nature.
3. The authors calculate the long-term evolution of CVs and compare the observed short-period CV period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions. They investigate possible solutions to the mismatch between the theoretical and observed minimum orbital period in CVs. They consider the effect of geometrical deformation on the minimum period and mass transfer rate for systems with various deformation factors. They find that with a deformation factor of 1.06, the minimum period increases from around 65 minutes to around 69 minutes, consistent with the observed value of around 78 minutes. However, a deformation factor of around 1.18 is required to raise the minimum period to the observed value. The authors note that magnetic pressure inside the star could cause a deformation",0
9,"1. Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of galaxies with a highly disturbed intragroup medium due to a complex sequence of interactions and harassment. A large-scale intergalactic shock wave has been produced as a result of these interactions.
2. The main shock in SQ is defined by 20 cm radio continuum emission, and is responsible for the shock-heating of the X-ray emitting gas. The high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318b, with the intergalactic medium of the group is believed to have caused this shock wave.
3. The SQ system has been extensively studied using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) instrument onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of the shock region in SQ has been obtained, and spectral mapping has been performed using the short-low and long-low modules.
4. The spectral cubes were used to extract maps of all the pure rotational emission lines of molecular hydrogen that were detected, and specific intensity contour maps of these lines are presented in figure 2. The s(0) and s(1) lines were mapped by the ll modules, while s(2)-s(5) transitions were mapped by the sl modules of the irs.
5. The distribution of warm molecular hydrogen in SQ is found to be along the length of the main north-south (ns) shock ridge and along the 'bridge' structure, demonstrating the remarkable projected coexistence of hot X-ray plasma and warm molecular hydrogen.
6. The s(0) line exhibits a clear correspondence to the X-ray, notably at the center of the shock, where peaks are found at both wavelengths. The intergalactic star formation region, SQ-a, is essentially absent in X-ray emission, but is strongly detected in H2 emission.
7. The study of SQ provides valuable insight into the nature of more distant systems, and the large scale of the SQ shock is well-suited for such a study. The observations and data reduction methods used in this study are presented in section 2, and the mapping results for various detected lines are discussed in section 3.",0
10,"1. The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula and may have been injected into the presolar cloud or solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
2. Initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity caused by SLRI injection can be reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and small particles.
3. Oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation, possibly due to UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the outer solar nebula surface.

11,"1. The analysis searches for new particles with a narrow natural width that decay to dijets, specifically axigluons, excited states of composite quarks, color octet technirhos, new gauge bosons, and scalar diquarks.
2. Data from four triggers in Run 1a and 1b is combined, and jets are defined using a fixed cone clustering algorithm, corrected for detector response and energy loss.
3. The two highest jets are required to have pseudorapidity and a CMS scattering angle, and an acceptance-ensuring cut is applied to reduce QCD background.
4. The dijet mass distribution is presented as a differential cross section, with data systematically higher than a prediction from Pythia plus a CDF detector simulation at high mass.
5. A binned maximum likelihood fit is performed to determine the QCD background and search for new particles, resulting in a 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section for new particles.
6. The analysis also searches for topgluons and topcolor in the bbar channel, excluding topgluons of certain widths in specific mass regions.
7. The search for new particles decaying to dijets, b, and t tbar has resulted in mass exclusions and limits, with upward fluctuations in the 1.8 TeV region across all three channels.",1
12,"1. The first evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was observed through supernovae type Ia (SNIA) being fainter than expected.
2. This finding has been supported by various independent observations, including temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), matter distribution inhomogeneities, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), and gamma-ray bursts.
3. Within the framework of General Relativity, the accelerated expansion is attributed to a new energy density component with negative pressure, known as dark energy (DE).
4. The currently favored model, known as LCDM, suggests that the cosmological constant is the possible origin of the DE driving the accelerated expansion and a cold dark matter (CDM) component responsible for galaxy and large scale structure formation.
5. Although LCDM is consistent with observations, it is theoretically unsatisfactory due to the discrepancy between the observed and estimated values of the cosmological constant.
6. Dynamic DE models have been proposed to address this issue, but they face the coincidence problem, which questions why the matter and DE time variations are so different if their current values are similar.
7. Interacting dark sector models have been introduced to alleviate the coincidence problem, and they can also be constrained by observing the background evolution and the emergence of large scale structure.
8. The interaction between DE and CDM affects the overall universe's evolution, expansion history, growth of matter and baryon density perturbations, temperature anisotropies of the CMB, and the evolution of the gravitational potential at late times.
9. Upcoming and future observational facilities, such as ground-based DE experiments, will help measure or constrain the DE-CDM interaction, test the current period of accelerated expansion, and explain the nature of DE-CDM interactions.
10. Observations of type IA supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), gravitational lensing, redshift-space distortions, and the growth of cosmic structure probe the universe's evolution, while CMB radiation power spectrum and lensing pattern data can help understand the physics of DE-CDM interactions at recombination and lower redshifts.",1
13,"1. Type 1 AGN spectra show a variety of broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized gas near the central massive object. Broad emission lines, like Hβ, are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk acting as the fuel reservoir for the central supermassive black hole. There are two populations of Type 1 AGN: Population A, which shows the smallest broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ=1000-4000), and Population B, which shows larger broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ=4000-12000). Narrow emission lines, like [OIII]5007, are a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame, except in the case of ""blue outliers"" found in sources with FWHM Hβ=1500-3500 and weak [OIII]. Blue outliers show [OIII] blueshifts as large as 10000 km/s. Careful use of [OIII] and Hβ narrow line as rest frame measures suggests that broad Hβ in Population A sources rarely shows a systematic red or blue shift, while Population B sources show more complex line shift properties.
2. Broad FeII emission has been found in Type 1 quasars since the era of photographic spectroscopy in the 1960s. FeII emission blends are almost ubiquitous in a sample of the brightest (usually highest S/N) SDSS quasars. Circumstantial evidence supports the assumption that FeII emission arises in or near the emitting clouds that produce other low ionization lines like Hβ. FWHM FeII appears to correlate with FWHM Hβ over the full range where FeII can be detected. Systematic line shifts place important constraints on models for the geometry and kinematics of the broad line region. A systematic blueshift of high ionization lines relative to low ionization lines, especially in Population A sources, has been observed. Recently, evidence was advanced for the existence of a systematic redshift of FeII relative to [OIII]50",0
14,"1. Nuclear multifragmentation is the study of the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and is currently a topic of intense research both theoretically and experimentally. The similarity between nucleon-nucleon interaction and van der Waals forces has led to the search for a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter.
2. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the ALADIN group, which identified a wide plateau situated at around 5 MeV temperature and lasting from 3 to 10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy. This was associated with the possible existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter.
3. Similar experiments by EOS and INDRA followed, but obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region being absent in the majority of cases. Factors contributing to these discrepancies include the precision of experimental measurements and finite-size effects of the caloric curve, which depend on the reaction type.
4. Recent reevaluations by the ALADIN group have brought corrections of about 10% in the case of the reaction 1au+1au, 600 MeV/nucleon. Moreover, it has been proven that the energies of the spectator parts are growing with approximately 30% in the bombarding energy interval 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon.
5. The universality of the quantity @xmath7 suggests that for the above-mentioned reactions, the equilibrated sources sequence should be the same. However, there is an important nonequilibrium part included in the measured source excitation energies, which may belong to both pre-equilibrium or pre-break-up stages.
6. The SMM calculations suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even in the case of the 600 MeV/nucleon bombarding energy reaction. Therefore, accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and of the sequential secondary particle emission are imperative to distinguish between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies.
7. These approaches should strictly obey the constraints of the physical system, which in the case of nuclear multifragmentation, are purely microcanonical. The present paper describes refinements and improvements brought to the sharp microcanonical multifr",0
15,"1. The solar corona, which appears as a halo around the sun during a solar eclipse, is heated to a temperature of about 12 million kelvins, while the visible surface of the sun, the photosphere, is roughly 250 times cooler.
2. The primary energy source for heating the corona is believed to be located in the convection zone below the photosphere, where there is 100 times as much energy available than that required to heat the corona.
3. The debate over the mechanism for heating the corona centers on whether the energy derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events, known as nanoflares.
4. MHD waves can be generated by the buffeting of magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere by granulation, and can propagate into magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona.
5. In coronal loops, random motions of magnetic loop footpoints can produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines, which generates field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively.
6. The main difference between these processes is that plasma inertia plays a key role in wave propagation, but is unimportant for the dynamics of field-aligned currents along coronal loops.
7. High-frequency MHD waves have been sought as a potential source of coronal heating, and observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations of coronal structures have been made using the Fe XIV green ""line at 530.3 nm.
8. However, the results of these investigations are somewhat contradictory, with both positive and negative observations of oscillations.
9. Space missions capable of comparable time resolution measurements have not been available, so using ground-based equipment is still the only way of making such observations.
10. A new setup will be used to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations, using the mid-sized coronagraph at the Lomnicky Peak Observatory and the SECIS instrument to observe in the Fe XIV green line.",0
16,"1. Water vapor is an important molecule in interstellar and circumstellar clouds, and the 6@xmath8 - 5@xmath9 masing transition of H@xmath3O at 22 GHz has been used to trace high excitation gas around star-forming regions and evolved stars. However, the size of the emitting regions at this frequency is typically small, so no information has been obtained on the role of H@xmath3O at large spatial scales.
2. Other H@xmath3O lines have been detected from ground or airborne-based telescopes, but only the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition at 183 GHz has been used to map the emission of H@xmath3O at very large spatial scales. The Iso satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared, but the poor angular resolution provided by Iso in the far-infrared prevents any detailed study of the spatial structure and physical conditions of the H@xmath3O emitting regions.
3. An important aid in deriving H@xmath3O abundances could come from the observation of another masing transition of H@xmath3O with similar properties to those of the 183 GHz line. The 325 GHz line of H@xmath3O was observed in the direction of Orion Irc2 and other molecular clouds, but no maps were obtained. The present data show the importance of ground-based observations of H@xmath3O in deriving the abundance of H@xmath3O in molecular clouds and in providing useful constraints on the physical conditions of the emitting regions.
4. The observations were performed with the 10.4 m telescope of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory at the summit of Mauna Kea (Hawaii) on April 1@xmath22 1998. The receiver, a helium-cooled SIS mixer operating in double-sideband mode, was tuned at the frequency of the 5@xmath04@xmath1 line of H@xmath23O (325.152919 GHz). The H@xmath3O line was placed in the upper sideband to minimize atm",0
17,"1. Threshold nets are obtained by assigning weights to nodes and connecting those with a combined weight above a certain threshold.
2. They can be produced with various degree distributions, including scale-free, and encompass a wide range of architectures.
3. Hagberg et al. exploit the fact that threshold graphs can be encoded by a two-letter sequence, and introduce fast algorithms to compute structural benchmarks.
4. The idea is to study a broader class of nets constructed from sequences by deterministic rules of connectivity.
5. Each additional letter to the alphabet allows for an increase of one link in the nets diameter.
6. The new classes of two-letter sequence nets can be related to a generalized form of threshold nets, where the difference rather than the sum of the weights is compared to the threshold.
7. The two-letter rules @xmath47 and @xmath57 generate different classes of non-trivial connected graphs.
8. The connectivity rules can be interpreted as directed graphs, with nodes representing the letters of the sequence alphabet, and the direction of self-loops being irrelevant.",0
18,"1. Variable selection methods based on penalty theory have been widely used in high-dimensional data analysis, with the Lasso method receiving significant attention due to its principled approach using the L1-norm penalty.
2. The Lasso estimate can be viewed as the mode of the posterior distribution, and the L1 penalty can be transformed into the Laplace prior, which can be expressed as a Gaussian scale mixture.
3. This has led to Bayesian developments of the Lasso and its variants, as well as work on nonconvex penalization under a parametric Bayesian framework.
4. The LLA algorithm was derived by combining the EM algorithm with an inverse Laplace transform, and it was shown that the L0 penalty with a certain parameter can be obtained by mixing the Laplace distribution with a stable density.
5. Other authors have shown that the prior induced from a penalty, called the nonconvex log penalty, has an interpretation as a scale mixture of Laplace distributions with an inverse gamma mixing distribution.
6. Recently, this class of Laplace variance mixtures was extended by using a generalized inverse Gaussian mixing distribution, leading to related methods such as the Bayesian hyper-Lasso, the horseshoe model, and the Dirichlet Laplace prior.
7. Nonparametric Bayesian approaches have also been applied to variable selection, such as the infinite gamma Poisson model, which uses negative binomial processes to describe non-negative integer-valued matrices.
8. The beta-Bernoulli process provides a nonparametric Bayesian tool in sparsity modeling, and a nonparametric approach for normal variance mixtures was proposed, which is closely related to Lvy processes.
9. Subordinators, which are one-dimensional Lvy processes that are almost surely non-decreasing, have been used in Bayesian sparse learning problems, and the Laplace exponent of a subordinator is a Bernstein function.
10. In this paper, the authors study the application of subordinators in Bayesian nonconvex penalization problems under supervised learning scenarios, by modeling latent shrinkage parameters using subordinators, which are defined as stochastic processes of regularization parameters.",0
19,"1. The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and the possibility of exotic gap symmetry with nodal behavior have led to a renewed effort to find novel experimental probes of order parameter symmetry. One proposal by Sauls and co-workers is to examine the nonlinear current response of d-wave superconductors, which introduces a nonanalyticity in the current-velocity relation at a specific temperature due to the presence of nodes in the order parameter. This results in an anisotropy in the nonlinear current as a function of the direction of the superfluid velocity relative to the position of the node. However, early experimental work did not verify these predictions, suggesting that impurity scattering or nonlocal effects may be responsible. A more recent reanalysis has claimed to confirm the predictions.
2. Another proposal by Dahm and Scalapino is to examine the quadratic term in the magnetic response of the penetration depth, which shows a temperature dependence at low temperatures. They demonstrated that this upturn would provide a clear and unique signature of the nodes in the d-wave gap and that this feature could be measured directly via microwave intermodulation effects. Experimental verification of this has been obtained, confirming that nonlinear microwave current response can be used as a sensitive probe of issues associated with the order parameter symmetry. This has led researchers to consider further cases of gap anisotropy and turn their attention to the two-band superconductor MgB2, which is already under scrutiny for possible applications, including passive microwave filter technology.
3. MgB2 was discovered in 2001, and since then, an enormous scientific effort has focused on this material. It is now thought to be the best candidate for a classic two-band electron-phonon superconductor, with s-wave pairing in each channel. A heightened interest in two-band superconductivity has led to claims of possible two-band effects in many other materials, both old and new. Researchers aim to compare in detail the differences between one-band and two-band s-wave superconductors in terms of their nonlinear response, which would be measured in the coefficients defined by Xu et al. and Dahm and Scalapino. This leads to a reconsideration of the one-band s-wave case, where issues of dimensionality, impurities,",0
20,"1. Time series data mining involves various tasks, with classification being one of the most important. A well-known 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is one of the best classifiers for time series data.
2. The 1-NN classification relies heavily on the choice of distance measure. While the Euclidean distance is commonly used, the DTW distance has been shown to be more appropriate and accurate for time series data.
3. The Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band) was initially introduced to speed up DTW calculations but later became a global constraint. The size of this global constraint, which was initially fixed at 10% of the time series length, has been found to significantly impact classification accuracy.
4. The Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band) generalizes the global constraint model and allows for multi-bands, each representing a class of data. This flexibility enables adjustment of the global constraint according to each class's warping path.
5. However, determining the best multi R-K bands requires a learning algorithm, such as the hill climbing search algorithm with accuracy and distance metrics heuristic functions.
6. To address overfitting issues in the learning algorithm, two new methods, band boundary extraction and iterative learning, have been proposed.
7. The band boundary extraction method obtains the maximum, mean, and mode of the paths' positions on the DTW distance matrix, while iterative learning adjusts band structures in each round of iteration to a silhouette index.
8. The proposed algorithms use dynamic time warping (DTW) distance, Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band), Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band), and silhouette index as fundamental concepts.
9. DTW distance is a well-known similarity measure based on shape, while the silhouette index is a graphical aid for interpreting and validating cluster analysis.
10. The proposed time series classification algorithm is based on 1-nearest neighbor classification using the dynamic time warping distance with multi R-K bands as a global constraint, with the best R-K band selected using the band boundary extraction algorithm and iterative learning.",0

The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles has been successful in describing electroweak nature, and the recent discovery of a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) further strengthens its correctness. However, there is still no explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM reported from the LHC.
2. An anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) has been observed, with estimated discrepancies consistently more than expected, which could potentially hint at new physics beyond the SM. This has led to the pursuit of the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM.
3. The SM interactions that break lepton symmetry and the anomaly against the SM gauge interaction can wash out baryon asymmetry in the early universe. A condition must be calculated to prevent this washout, which depends on the temperature and the parameters in the mass terms. Two possibilities for this condition to be satisfied are that the interaction by a certain term is inefficient or that the Majorana masses are small.",0
22,"1. Quantum entanglement in multipartite systems is a unique property that plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.
2. The dynamical behavior of entanglement under decoherence has been studied extensively due to its importance in quantum information processing.
3. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) has been observed in qubit systems under Markovian decoherence, where entanglement disappears in a finite time.
4. However, further studies have shown that entanglement can revive after ESD or be preserved in the long time limit due to structured environments.
5. A recent study found that the lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics.
6. This transfer of entanglement is always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) in the reservoirs, indicating that entanglement does not disappear but changes location.
7. A similar situation occurs in spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.
8. The distribution of entanglement among bipartite subsystems is dependent on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.
9. A stable entanglement-distribution configuration can be found in non-Markovian dynamics when the reservoirs are photonic band gap media.
10. The identity about the entanglement in the whole system is always satisfied at any time, revealing the profound physics of entanglement dynamics under decoherence.",0
23,"1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful flashes of gamma rays with isotropic distribution in the sky, and their origin remains unexplained. They are observed above the Earth's atmosphere with X-gamma ray detectors aboard satellites.
2. The BEPPOSAX satellite has discovered afterglow emission at lower wavelengths, and at least long GRBs are at cosmological distances with measured redshifts up to 4.5. The most likely candidates for these events are the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) and the coalescence of one compact binary system.
3. In both cases, emission of gravitational waves (GW) is expected to be associated with them. The duration of a GW burst is predicted to be of the order of a few milliseconds for various sources, including coalescing and merging black holes and/or neutron star binaries.
4. At the distances of GRB sources (~1 Gpc), the GW burst associated with a total conversion of 1-2 solar masses should have an amplitude of the order of 10^-21. However, detection of a gravitational signal associated with a single GRB appears hopeless.
5. Therefore, a program was launched to study the presence of correlations between GRB events detected with BEPPOSAX and the output signals from gravitational antennas NAUTILUS and EXPLORER. The analysis uses an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors, coping with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts.
6. The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, EXPLORER since 1990 at CERN laboratories and NAUTILUS since 1995 at INFN laboratories in Frascati. The main characteristics of the two detectors are their two resonant frequencies and bandwidth. The larger bandwidth of EXPLORER is due to an improved readout system.",0

The process of discovering high-quality scientific publications is often facilitated through citation analysis, with the number of citations serving as a measure of a paper's scientific credibility. However, this method is not foolproof, as some publications may be overlooked or forgotten over time. The citation distribution of scientific publications has been extensively studied and found to follow a power-law form, characterized by highly cited papers being more likely to receive further citations.
2. A simple model is proposed to investigate the growth mechanism of two interconnected research areas, with cross-linking between the networks. This model can also be applied to the web of human sexual contacts, where interactions between males and females can be thought of as two coupled growing networks. The model is built by introducing new nodes with a certain number of outgoing links, which attach to pre-existing nodes in each network based on preferential attachment and the initial attractiveness of the nodes.
3. The time evolution of the networks is described by rate equations, and the proposed model can be visualized with a figure illustrating the growth mechanism. The model yields a time-independent recurrence relation for the joint distribution of intra-links and cross-links, which can be used to find all other distributions. The total in-degree distribution is found to be a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes.
4. The distribution of the average number of nodes with a certain number of intra-links in network 1 is also analyzed, which can be thought of as links being issued from the same subject class as the receiving nodes. In the case of human sexual contact networks, they represent homosexual interactions. The distribution is found to have a power-law form that depends on both the average total in-degree and the coupling parameter.
5. The distribution of average number of nodes with incoming cross-links in network 1 is found by summing over all its intra-links. The exponents of the cross-link distribution are inversely proportional to the coupled parameters, unlike the case in intra-links. The model is found to have the flexibility to represent a variety of complex systems, including citation networks and the web of human sexual contacts.",0
25,"1. The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally framed in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron. The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
2. However, this production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions. Instead, recombination of partons is shown to be the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved. At extremely high transverse momentum, fragmentation is still dominant.
3. The purpose of the paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and to determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The subject matter is primarily of interest in high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons.
4. Semi-hard shower partons initiated by a hard parton can either recombine among themselves or recombine with soft partons in the environment. In the former case, the fragmentation function is reproduced, and nothing new is achieved. In the latter case, a very new component emerges in heavy-ion collisions, one that has escaped theoretical attention thus far.
5. The main objective is to quantify the properties of shower partons and to illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons. The actual application of the shower parton distributions developed here to heavy-ion collisions will be considered elsewhere.
6. The concept of shower partons is not new, as attempts have been made to generate such partons in pQCD processes. However, since pQCD cannot be used down to the hadronization scale, the branching or cascading processes terminate at the formation of color-singlet pre-hadronic clusters, which cannot easily be related to shower partons and their hadronization.
7. The fragmentation of a parton to a hadron is not a process that can be calculated in pQCD, although the QCD processes of generating a parton shower by gluon radiation and pair creation can be determined phenomenologically in much the same way as the fragmentation functions themselves are.

2. Nonconvex semidefinite programming problems have various applications in static output feedback controller design and topology optimization.
3. Many attempts have been made to solve these problems using convex semidefinite programming techniques, such as augmented Lagrangian functions, generalized sequential semidefinite programming, and alternating directions.
4. A new method based on convex-concave decomposition of the BMI constraints and linearization technique has been proposed.
5. This paper aims to develop a new local optimization method for solving the nonconvex semidefinite programming problem by approximating the feasible set with a sequence of inner positive semidefinite convex approximation sets.
6. The paper generalizes the inner convex approximation method from scalar optimization to nonlinear semidefinite programming and modifies the algorithm with a regularization technique.
7. The proposed algorithm is straightforward to implement using available standard semidefinite programming software tools and does not require a globalization strategy.
8. The paper provides two particular ways to form an overestimate for bilinear matrix-valued mappings and shows many applications in static output feedback.

27,"1. Discrete differential geometry is used to regularize calculations in continuum vector theories, and a discrete version of the Dirac-Kähler formulation of fermionic field theory has been proposed. However, defining such a scheme has proven challenging due to difficulties with the Hodge star and the wedge product.
2. Several discrete schemes have been proposed, including Becher and Joos' use of a lattice with non-local operators, Kanamori and Kawamoto's use of a lattice with non-commutativity between fields and discrete forms, and Balachandran et al.'s use of a quantized phase space leading to a fuzzy coordinate space.
3. Adams proposed using two parallel lattices to maintain locality and capture the properties of the wedge product, and this proposal has been thoroughly studied. This approach can potentially offer insight into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice.
4. In this paper, the authors build upon Adams' proposal to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Kähler formulation and show how the idea of using more than one lattice can be extended to describe exact flavour projection. This necessitates the introduction of two new structures of lattice and a new operator. The paper also evaluates the path integral for this formulation, considering the effects of chiral and flavour projection.",0
28,"1. Cognitive radio networks, which allow secondary users to transmit on the same frequency band as primary users under certain interference limits, can be susceptible to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions. Information-theoretic security has been studied in the context of wiretap channel models, where the secrecy capacity is defined as the maximum achievable rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver while keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the transmitted messages. This concept has been extended to Gaussian channels and more complex scenarios such as fading multi-antenna and multiuser channels. However, the combination of cognitive radio channels and information-theoretic security has received little attention.

2. This paper investigates collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints in cognitive radio networks. The authors first characterize the secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (AF) cognitive relay channel and formulate the beamforming optimization as a quasiconvex optimization problem, which can be solved through convex semidefinite programming (SDP). Two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes are proposed to reduce computational complexity. The authors consider a cognitive relay channel with a secondary user source, a primary user, a secondary user destination, an eavesdropper, and multiple relays. The source tries to transmit confidential messages to the destination with the help of the relays on the same band as the primary user, while keeping the interference on the primary user below a predefined interference temperature limit and keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the information. The optimization problem for beamforming is formulated and solved using semidefinite programming with a two-dimensional search for both total and individual power constraints.",0
29,"1. The paper discusses the benefits of maintaining conformal invariance when quantizing the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFSs). A classical conformally invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFSs, so the authors propose keeping the invariance during quantization. This allows for a free field in a CFS to behave like it does in flat space, and the Wightman two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts. The authors confirm this assertion in the special case of the Maxwell field in de Sitter space.
2. The paper extends the work to general CFSs and clarifies the quantum structure of the formalism developed in [xcite]. The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism and realize all CFSs as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. Auxiliary fields and the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme are used to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field. A well-suited coordinate system is also used to write down the Wightman two-point functions for the Maxwell and auxiliary fields.
3. The authors explain how to obtain the conformally invariant Maxwell field in a CFS from a six-dimensional one-form using the extended Weyl transformation. The dynamical equations for the Maxwell field are then transported from Minkowski space to the CFS using the extended Weyl transformation. The constraint simplifies the system and leads to the Maxwell equation and a conformal gauge condition on any conformally flat space. The conformal gauge was first derived in Minkowski space and its extension to curved spaces is not trivial. The system is valid only if the constraint is fixed at the end of the quantization process, not at the beginning. The auxiliary field acts as a Faddeev-Popov ghost field and its retention during the quantization process is necessary.",0

The game has been shown to have deep connections in number theory, algebra, and combinatorics, and can simulate classical computer functions and solve theoretically solvable computational problems.
2. The game has been studied on the complete bipartite graph, with lemmas established to limit the number of chips on each vertex in a game with nontrivial period and to find a necessary and sufficient condition for a period to occur. Every possible period for the complete bipartite graph has been found.
3. The game can be used to simulate a pile of particles that falls whenever there are too many particles stacked at any point, a problem in statistical physics known as the deterministic fixed-energy sandpile. This model displays properties of real-life systems, such as noise, fractal patterns, and power law distribution.
4. The game is an example of a cellular automaton, which has implications in various fields from biology to social science. The study of such systems has shown that slight perturbations in initial position can cause large, avalanche-like disturbances, a phenomenon known as self-organized criticality.
5. Further research can be done on bounding the periods of positions on vertex-regular graphs and more general bipartite graphs, and on the relationship between period lengths and lengths of subcycles of the graph. The reduction of the parallel chip-firing game by removing chips from each vertex without affecting their firing pattern may also simplify some games for induction.",1

2. The GRB 090510 was detected as a short and bright burst, with a precursor emission followed by a hard episode, and was the first bright short GRB with an emission detected from the keV to the GeV range.
3. The analysis of the spiky structure of the prompt emission allowed for the inference of the structure of the circumburst medium, and the possibility of the gev emission prior to 0.084 s in the arrival time interacting with the prompt emission was noted.
4. The simulation of the prompt emission following the p-grb was performed to determine the profile of the circumburst medium (CBM), resulting in an average CBM density of 0.0021 particles/cm^3.
5. The low value of the CBM density, typical of galactic halo environments, further justified the interpretation of GRB 090510 as a short GRB originating in a binary NS merger.
6. The theoretical fit of the prompt emission predicted a cut-off at 1.4 MeV, and the spectrum at energy 1.4 MeV could be affected by the onset of the high energy power-law component.
7. The fireshell model allowed for the inference of a theoretical redshift from the observations of the p-grb and the prompt emission, which agreed with the measured redshift of GRB 090510.",0

The authors use the example of predicting the W boson mass in the SM, which is strongly correlated with the experimentally measured top quark mass and increases quadratically as the top quark mass is increased.
2. The strong correlation between the W boson mass and the top quark mass in the SM is used to limit the allowed region for the Higgs boson mass. In models with Higgs particles in representations other than doublets and singlets, there are more parameters in the gauge/Higgs sector than in the SM.
3. When the theory is renormalized at one loop, models with new physics require extra input parameters. These models are often written in terms of the SM Lagrangian plus an extra contribution from new physics beyond the SM.
4. The authors give two specific examples where the procedure of considering the contributions of the SM at one loop plus the tree level contributions of new physics is incorrect. They demonstrate what happens in these models when the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale and show that the SM is not recovered.
5. The authors also discuss the possibility of a heavy Higgs boson that is consistent with precision electroweak data. They show that a large contribution to isospin violation from new physics can offset the contribution of a heavy Higgs boson to electroweak observables such as the W boson mass.",1

The set of points added to S in the completion with respect to the path metric induced by the flat metric is discrete. The map f extends to the metric completion as a L-lipschitz map.
2. A log-Riemann surface of finite type has finitely many ramification points and finitely generated fundamental group. A log-Riemann surface of finite type with at least one infinite order ramification point is of the form (S', f) where S' is a punctured compact Riemann surface and f is meromorphic on S' with exponential singularities at the punctures.
3. An exp-algebraic curve is an equivalence class of log-Riemann surface structures of finite type, where two meromorphic functions on a punctured compact Riemann surface inducing log-Riemann surface structures of finite type are considered equivalent if the meromorphic function is holomorphic on the compact surface. An exp-algebraic curve is given by the data of a punctured compact Riemann surface and equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions with poles at the punctures.",0
34,"1. The text discusses the use of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and local density approximation (LDA) to understand the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems. A method called LDA+DMFT has been developed, which merges these two techniques and is promising due to its simplicity and accuracy in both band and atomic limits. Much effort is being made to develop this method further and apply it to various systems.
2. The text also discusses the importance of using realistic self-consistent electronic structure algorithms in DMFT-based calculations. These algorithms should be able to explore all space of parameters where dopings or degeneracy is not fixed, as different states may appear near the Fermi level during iterations towards self-consistency. This is important for calculating the properties of realistic solid-state systems where the bandwidth and the strength of the interaction are not known at the beginning.
3. The text also proposes an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation. This approach is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem, but rather a follow-up of the ideology of LDA theory where approximations were designed by analytical fits to quantum Monte Carlo simulations for homogeneous electron gas. The authors suggest that even crude evaluations of the self-energy shapes on the imaginary axis may be sufficient for solving many realistic total energy problems.",0

The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in complex systems is a growing area of research, with applications in areas such as contact processes, domain growth, catalysis, phase separation, and transport phenomena. While there is no general theory for these systems, recent progress has been made in understanding their stationary states using approximate analytical methods and simulations.
2. This paper focuses on the phase transitions observed in a surface reaction model proposed by Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad, which describes some kinetic aspects of the oxidation of CO over a catalytic surface. The authors consider a modified version of the model that incorporates a random distribution of inert sites on the catalytic surface.
3. The original ZGB model is an irreversible lattice model for surface reactions based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where reactants must be adsorbed before reacting. The model is a lattice Markov process in which molecules of CO and O2 from a gaseous phase can be adsorbed onto the sites of a regular square lattice.
4. The authors investigate the effects of inert sites on the phase transitions of the ZGB model and find that the first-order transition changes to a continuous one at a critical value of the concentration of inert sites. This result has experimental relevance in the automobile industry, where lead particles are deposited over the catalyst during the exhaust of gases after combustion.
5. The authors perform mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations for different values of the concentration of inert sites and find that the model studied here is a variant of the original ZGB model, where inert sites are randomly distributed over the lattice. They determine the phase diagram for different concentrations and the spinodal and transition lines as a function of the concentration of inert sites.",1

The study of harmonic maps, which are critical points of the energy functional, has been initiated by Fuller, Nash, and Sampson, with the first general existence result due to Eells and Sampson. Harmonic maps are defined between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and have a vanishing trace of the second fundamental form.
2. The tension field of a smooth map is a measure of how far the map is from being harmonic. A map is said to be harmonic if its tension field vanishes identically. The Hessian of a harmonic map is a self-adjoint operator that measures the second variation of the energy functional.

2. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy centers, which grow through accretion of cold material, can deposit energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxy, inhibiting star formation.
3. Indirect evidence of AGN feedback is seen in the relationships between the mass of the SMBH and properties of the host galaxy, suggesting a strong coevolution of the two.
4. Determining accurate estimates of the SFR in AGN host galaxies is challenging due to contamination from the central AGN, leading researchers to focus on the infrared (IR) regime.
5. Dust in the ISM of galaxies plays an important role in heating and cooling, and can constitute roughly half of the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy.
6. The dusty torus around AGN, which absorbs and re-emits the AGN's radiative output, is used to explain the dichotomy of AGN into Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 within a unified model.
7. The _Herschel Space Observatory_ has expanded our knowledge of the IR universe by pushing into the submillimeter range, allowing for better constraints on dust properties and the SFR in AGN host galaxies.
8. Recent studies have shown the power of long wavelength _Herschel_ data to better constrain the SFR, dust mass, and dust temperature in AGN host galaxies.
9. The correlation between the AGN and star-forming luminosity in AGN host galaxies could be due to their shared correlation with galaxy stellar mass.

The fundamental group of the complement of plane curves is a topological invariant used to distinguish between connected components of the moduli space of smooth projective surfaces and to compute the fundamental groups of complements of hypersurfaces. It is also used to find Zariski pairs, which are pairs of plane curves with the same combinatorics but non-homeomorphic complements.
2. Fan proved results about the projective fundamental group of complex line arrangements and conjectured a relationship between the fundamental group and the graph of multiple points. This conjecture was recently proven by Eliyahu, Liberman, Schaps, and Teicher. They also introduced the concept of a conjugation-free geometric presentation for the fundamental group of the affine or projective complements of some line arrangement.
3. The paper aims to determine which line arrangements have a fundamental group with a conjugation-free geometric presentation. This family of arrangements is important because the incidence lattice of the arrangement determines the fundamental group of the complement. The paper also discusses the relation between this family and other well-known families of arrangements, such as nice and simple arrangements.",0

The text discusses the use of flavor symmetries to describe the mass and mixing patterns of fermions, specifically continuous symmetries like U(1) and discrete symmetries like exchange symmetry. A new symmetry, Z(3)A4, was introduced to avoid mass degeneracy under A4 symmetry. This symmetry has been used to fit the tri-bi maximal mixing pattern in the leptonic sector in an extension of the Standard Model.
2. The authors of ref.[xcite] showed that the tri-bi maximal mixing pattern can arise solely from the neutrino sector, with hierarchical masses for the three charged leptons and quasi-degenerate or hierarchical neutrino masses. The non-zero and complex value of θ13 leads to the possibility of CP violation in the leptonic sector, which is the main goal of many future short and long baseline experiments. Non-zero θ13 can be generated through radiative correction or the introduction of higher dimensional mass terms.
3. The authors of ref.[xcite] investigated the generation of non-zero θ13 through the see-saw mechanism with Z(3)A4 symmetry. They found that the exact tri-bi maximal pattern forbids CP violation in the leptonic sector at low energy. The textures of mass matrices in ref.[xcite] could not generate lepton asymmetry.
4. In the present work, the authors investigate the generation of non-zero θ13 through the see-saw mechanism by considering a small perturbation in the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, keeping the same texture of the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix as proposed in ref.[xcite]. They study the detailed phenomenology of neutrino mass and mixing, including CP violation at low energy, neutrinoless double beta decay, and leptogenesis.
5. The authors' approach to obtaining non-zero θ13 is minimal, as they break Z(3)A4 symmetry explicitly by a single parameter in a single element of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix. They consider the model proposed in ref.[xcite], which gives rise to diagonal M2 and M24, along with a competent texture of M25. After the see-saw mechanism and diagonalization, this model generates the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern.

Organic molecular crystals, composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces, are promising materials for fabricating nanoscale devices for electronics and optoelectronics, including solar energy harvesting, surface photochemistry, organic electronics, and spintronics.
2. These devices typically consist of both organic and inorganic components, with the organic component forming the active part of the device and the inorganic component providing electrical contact to external circuitry. The electronic structure of the interface between these two parts plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance.
3. Upon adsorption on a substrate, the electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change from their gas phase counterparts due to the formation of an image charge on the substrate. This image charge alters the addition or removal energy of charge carriers from the molecule.
4. A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle (qp) description, which ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons. The adequacy of the qp description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the homo and lumo.
5. If density functional theory (DFT) is used, it is important to note that except for the energy of the homo, which can be rigorously interpreted as the negative of the ionization potential, the Kohn-Sham orbitals cannot be associated with qp energies. However, the Kohn-Sham qp levels often provide a good approximation to the true removal energies, particularly for metals.
6. For molecules, the local and semi-local approximations of the exchange and correlation functional, such as the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), perform poorly even for the homo level. Hybrid functionals or functionals explicitly including self-interaction corrections can improve the situation.
7. The calculation of the energy levels alignment of a molecule in the proximity of a metal presents additional problems due to the non-local nature of the image charge formation. Unless a given functional is explicitly non-local, it will generally fail to capture this effect.
8. A possible solution is to use an explicit many-body approach, such as the GW approximation, which can capture the energy levels renormalization due to the",0
43,"1. The text discusses the interaction between many particles, which can be described by pair potentials or forces between a single pair if the governing physical equations are linear.
2. Nonlinearities can lead to many-body effects, such as changes in the force acting on a particle or the appearance of stable or unstable configurations.
3. These many-body effects are present in various systems, including nuclear matter, superconductivity, colloidal suspensions, quantum-electrodynamic Casimir forces, polymers, nematic colloids, and noble gases.
4. Integrating out small-scale degrees of freedom generates effective interactions among large particles, which are not pairwise additive.
5. The paper focuses on assessing the influence of many-body effects on critical Casimir forces (CCFs) between colloidal particles in a near-critical binary liquid mixture.
6. To identify many-body forces, a theoretical scheme is used to compute the forces between individual pairs and three-body forces simultaneously.
7. The authors employ field-theoretic mean-field theory to capture universal scaling functions, which are the leading contribution to the systematic expansion in spatial dimensions.
8. The approach yields qualitative features of actual universal scaling functions and reaches a semi-quantitative status when enhanced by renormalization group arguments.
9. The paper calculates the normal and lateral forces acting on colloidal particles using the full three-dimensional numerical analysis of the appropriate MFT.
10. The results show that many-body effects are significant in CCFs, and their influence on the total force depends on the specific configuration and thermodynamic state.",1

2. The SI second is defined by the resonance frequency of cesium 133 atoms at absolute zero temperature, but in practice, a wave function is used to relate measured resonance to the defined resonance.
3. Computer-mediated feedback is used to correct for oscillator drift in atomic clocks, but this requires making assumptions and guesses about the behavior of the clock.
4. The operation of atomic clocks and other digital systems is based on logical synchronization, which involves the interaction between evidence and hypotheses about signal propagation.
5. Logical synchronization is necessary for the communication of logical symbols and is affected by the phase of clock cycles.

46,"1. Research in wireless ad-hoc networks and wireless sensor networks has increased in recent years, with IEEE 802.15.4 targeted for wireless body area networks (WBANs) requiring low power and low data rate applications.
2. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard supports two topologies, star and peer-to-peer, and two modes of operation, beacon enabled and non-beacon enabled, with medium access control (MAC) protocols playing a crucial role in network performance.
3. Contention-based MAC protocols, such as carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), allow each node to contend for access to the medium, while schedule-based protocols, such as time division multiple access (TDMA), allocate specific time slots for each node to transmit.
4. A study in [1] analyzes the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 in WBANs with a star topology and up to 10 body implanted sensors, focusing on long-term power consumption, but not analyzing different data rates.
5. An analytical model for the non-beacon enabled mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol is provided in [2], allowing for the evaluation of an optimum packet size to maximize transmission success probability.
6. A simulation analysis in [3] investigates the unreliability in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, finding that appropriate parameter settings can achieve desired reliability levels.
7. A traffic-adaptive MAC protocol (TAMAC) is introduced in [4], using traffic information of sensor nodes and supported by a wakeup radio for emergency and on-demand events.
8. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is designed for low power, low data rate, and high reliability, with three different frequency ranges and a low power, low cost protocol.
9. There is limited work on analyzing the performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with varying data rates and considering acknowledgement (ACK) and no ACK conditions, which motivated the authors to conduct this study.",1
47,"1. The MOPPED algorithm is a patented method for data compression and speeding up the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis. It is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the model parameters, but it has limitations, such as not accurately representing multimodal or degenerate distributions.
2. The MOPPED algorithm works by compressing data into a set of weighted values, which simplifies the likelihood calculation. This compression is done by generating a set of weighting vectors from a theoretical model and data at a fiducial set of parameter values.
3. The true parameters will not necessarily coincide with the peak of the original or MOPPED likelihood. The weighting vectors must be generated in a specific order to form an orthogonal set with respect to the noise covariance matrix.
4. The MOPPED likelihood function is given by the dot product of the compressed data and compressed signal, which is a much easier likelihood to calculate than the original. However, the peak value of the MOPPED likelihood function is not guaranteed to be unique.
5. The MOPPED algorithm assumes that the covariance matrix is independent of the parameters, which allows for a faster likelihood calculation. However, this assumption can cause a speed reduction and one can iterate the parameter estimation procedure if necessary.
6. The MOPPED algorithm has the additional benefit of only needing to compute the weighting vectors once and the compressed parameters can be stored for re-use.
7. The limitations of the MOPPED algorithm are demonstrated through test cases in the context of gravitational wave data analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
8. In the one-dimensional case, where the only unknown parameter of the model is the central frequency of the oscillation, MOPPED creates the possibility for a second solution that is indistinguishable in likelihood from the correct one.
9. Adding more parameters does not always improve the situation. For example, when the polarisation of the burst is a variable parameter, MOPPED creates a second mode of equal likelihood to the true peak, which is not present in the original likelihood function.",0
48,"1. The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is a major puzzle in particle physics, and consists of several pieces including the existence of dark energy and the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of the cosmological constant.
2. The vacuum energy density can have various sources, such as the zero point energy of each particle, the energy density from the Higgs potential, and the energy density accompanied with the chiral symmetry breaking due to quark condensations.
3. The vacuum energy density can receive large radiative corrections including a cutoff scale, and the experimental value of the cosmological constant is estimated to be around 10^-47 GeV^4.
4. The pieces of the puzzle are not explained in the framework of Einstein gravity and the Standard Model of particle physics, and a new fundamental theory including gravity is needed to disclose the essence of new staffs.",1
49,"1. Spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkali metals have been advanced by high-precision experimental techniques, allowing for straightforward interpretation in terms of electromagnetic fields generated by the valence electron and nuclear moments.
2. Recent precise measurements in higher excited states, accessible through two-step transitions, have renewed interest in improving calculations for other states yet to be tested against experimental results.
3. However, precise measurements in excited states beyond the first one have experimental complications, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and non-availability of detectors at desired frequencies.
4. To address these challenges, the authors present two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studying atomic properties of higher excited states.
5. This method uses two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapor, with one laser modulated before the interaction region.
6. The first step of the transition, the pump, connects the ground state to a resonant intermediate state, while the probe scans over the desired energy manifold.
7. The non-linear interaction of the lasers burns a hole in the atomic ground state population, generating sub-Doppler peaks corresponding to atomic resonances with sidebands at their sides.
8. This technique overcomes the two main inconveniences of direct absorption of the probing laser by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and providing detectors at the desired frequency.
9. The authors illustrate the main features of the technique with two ladder systems in rubidium, demonstrating its applicability and flexibility for various atomic transitions and modulation schemes.",0
50,"1. The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has attracted significant attention, particularly for the central exclusive production (CEP) process where protons remain intact and are separated from the central system by a large rapidity gap.
2. Observation of a particle in the CEP channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers and allow for mass measurement regardless of decay products.
3. Proposals exist to install forward proton detectors at 220m and 420m from the interaction points, which would allow detection of central systems with approximate mass range of 70 GeV to 110 GeV.
4. The CEP process is being studied for the production of the Standard Model (SM) and supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson, with a focus on the mass region around 120 GeV, where the dominant decay channel is to b-quarks, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches due to the large QCD background.",1
51,"1. The text discusses the zero-field hall effect in chiral p-wave superconductors (SCs), which arises from broken time reversal symmetry and can be explained by various mechanisms, including intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs, spontaneous surface current, impurity effect, and multiband SC structure.
2. A new mechanism for this effect is proposed, based on vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition in two-dimensional superfluid or SC films. In this scenario, quantized vortices are topological defects in the condensates, whose dynamics play a key role in understanding phase transition phenomena.
3. The KT transition is described by a phase transition observed in superfluid helium (He) films, which is related to the vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process across a transition temperature. This transition is analyzed using a static theory that relates the phase transition to the renormalization of the logarithmic vortex-antivortex interaction.
4. The renormalization process in the static theory is truncated by vortex dynamics with a characteristic length, resulting in a broadening transition observed in He films and charged fermi systems such as high-temperature SCs.
5. The paper suggests that the KT transition in a broken time reversal symmetry state could have physical consequences in superconducting SrRuO or He-A phase thin films, where pairing of chiral p-wave type is expected.
6. The authors consider a 2D p-wave pairing state with a vector order parameter and derive the response functions for vortex-antivortex bound pair dynamics. These response functions are used to investigate the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor, which describes the total screening effect under time-dependent perturbation.",0
52,"1. The measurement of rotation curves (RCs) in disk galaxies is used to study the nature of dark matter (DM), including its distribution and content relative to baryonic components. Dwarf galaxies are ideal candidates for this investigation due to their kinematics being dominated by DM even at small galactocentric radii.
2. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a valuable test subject for DM density profiles from cold dark matter (CDM) numerical simulations, as it has a reliable measurement of DM's dynamical contribution to the RC.
3. Recent studies show that DM halos in dwarf galaxies are better fitted with a constant density core than a centrally peaked profile, contradicting the NFW profile from pure N-body DM simulations.
4. The Orion dwarf galaxy exhibits a cored DM profile, which is consistent with the kinematic data and challenges the NFW scenario, making it a critical system for understanding DM particle nature and halo evolution.
5. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative scenario that accounts for the inconsistency between the RCs of spiral galaxies and the distribution of luminous matter, without requiring DM.
6. The Orion dwarf galaxy is an attractive candidate for determining the underlying gravitational potential due to its large mass discrepancy, simple baryonic components, and high inclination.
7. The galaxy's kinematics, derived from the intensity-weighted velocity field, show circular motion dominated by a well-ordered rotation throughout the disk.
8. The harmonic decomposition of the velocity field reveals that non-circular motions are not significant, and the circular velocity matches the tilted ring model, supporting the use of the Orion dwarf's RC as a tracer of its mass distribution.",0
53,"1. The trihydrogen dication, consisting of three protons and one electron, has been studied extensively as one of the simplest Coulomb systems. Conroy investigated its potential energy surfaces and concluded that it is not stable.
2. Schwartz, Schaad, Somorjai, and Yue reported single-point calculations of the system but did not address the stability problem. Berkowitz and Stocker searched for this ion through charge stripping experiments and could not find evidence of a stable trihydrogen dication.
3. Later, Shoucri and Darling, as well as Hernndes and Carb, revisited the question of the existence of the trihydrogen dication using the variational linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method and a more compact variational approach. No bound state was determined in these calculations.
4. Ackermann et al. revisited the question about the existence of the trihydrogen dication using the finite element method, which provided much higher accuracy than previously achieved. They treated the stability problem by keeping the nuclear charge as a continuous parameter.
5. Critical values of the charges for the existence of stable or metastable equilateral triangular configurations were obtained, and the authors excluded the possibility of stable trihydrogen dications in the electronic ground state.
6. The present study focuses on a Coulomb system of one electron and three protons, which form an equilateral triangle of a specific size, according to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation at zero order.
7. The Schrdinger equation for the system is written as a function of the electron momentum, the distances from each proton to the electron, and the interproton distance.
8. The goal of the study is to investigate the stability of the molecular ion, which would imply the existence of the ground state of the system.
9. Two methods are used to explore the system: a specialized variational method with physically relevant trial functions and a standard variational method based on using standard Gaussian trial functions.
10. Both methods lead to highly accurate quantitative results for total energy versus the size of the triangle, and the specialized variational method relies on a carefully optimized non-linear trial function.",0
54,"1. Recent investigations have revealed a complex relationship between the properties of galaxies and their environments in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey.
2. Galaxy clustering is found to be a function of both star formation history and luminosity, with low luminosity galaxies clustering strongly by color and luminous galaxies clustering strongly by luminosity.
3. The relationship between galaxy clustering and surface brightness or concentration is independent of color and luminosity.
4. The scale dependence of these relationships is being explored, but it is unclear if galaxy properties on large scales are related to the large scale density field, independent of small scale relationships.
5. A study of the relative bias of SDSS galaxies found that the relationship between color, luminosity, and environment depends on scale.
6. A fair sample of the universe is necessary for evaluating the mean density around galaxies, but this is not always possible for lower luminosity galaxies.
7. The environments of low luminosity, red galaxies continue to become denser as absolute magnitude increases.
8. The strength of the correlation between galaxies and all galaxies in the volume-limited sample is associated with a steeper correlation function on large scales.",1
55,"1. Transverse spin fluctuations are important low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, and they play a crucial role in various macroscopic properties such as long-range order, order parameter magnitude, Néel temperature, and spin correlations. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are significant in both two and three dimensions, where AF long-range order (AFLRO) exists.
2. In the strong-coupling limit, spin fluctuations reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in two dimensions to nearly 60% of the classical value, and they lower the Néel temperature in three dimensions to approximately 70% of the mean-field result for the equivalent quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet (QHAF). Recently, there has been interest in spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet.
3. In the random-tuned model, where the interaction is set to zero on a fraction of sites, the lattice-averaged AF order parameter appears to be enhanced for small fractions, possibly due to an overall suppression of quantum spin fluctuations. However, strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies enhances spin fluctuations, leading to the formation of essentially empty and doubly-occupied sites that act like spin vacancies.
4. The problem of spin vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet is relevant to electron-doped materials, where spin-dilution behavior is observed. A new method has been developed to evaluate transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state in terms of magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
5. This method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is demonstrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: (i) the pure model in the weak and strong coupling limits, (ii) spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and (iii) low-concentration impurities in the strong coupling limit.
6. The RPA approach has been shown to properly interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity and to yield identical results as the spin-",0

The study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory, particularly in cosmology, has been driven by the need to explain the large-scale homogeneity and small-scale inhomogeneity of the universe, with observations now able to directly test the detailed predictions of specific inflationary models.
2. Of particular interest is the dynamics of multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation, leading to a variety of features unavailable in single-field models.
3. The renormalization of time evolution equations in single-field models has been understood for several years, but going beyond tree level in multi-field models requires addressing the issue of renormalization through methods such as dimensional regularization and the closed time path formalism.",1
57,"1. The existence of dark matter (DM) has been established and its thermal relic abundance has been determined by the WMAP experiment. A promising candidate for DM is the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), which can be accommodated in models beyond the Standard Model (SM) by introducing an inert scalar field.
2. The WIMP DM candidate can be stabilized by an imposed Z2 parity, ensuring the candidate's longevity. The phenomenology of such models has been studied in various works.
3. Neutrino oscillation measurements have confirmed that neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses compared to the electroweak scale. The different flavor structure of neutrinos from quarks and leptons suggests that neutrino masses are of Majorana type.
4. Many models have been proposed to explain tiny neutrino masses, with the seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) being the simplest ways to generate them. However, these scenarios do not contain a DM candidate.
5. In models where tiny neutrino masses are generated by higher orders of perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained. In such models, the Yukawa couplings of neutrinos with the SM Higgs boson are forbidden at the tree level by imposing a Z2 parity.
6. The same Z2 parity also guarantees the stability of the lightest Z2-odd particle in the model, which can be the candidate of the DM as long as it is electrically neutral.
7. In this paper, the authors consider an extension of the HTM, where a Z2 parity is introduced, and the DM candidate appears at the one-loop level. The Majorana masses for neutrinos are generated via the Yukawa interaction with a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) of an SU(2) triplet scalar field with the hypercharge of 1.
8. The vev of the triplet field is described by a dimensionful parameter that breaks lepton number conservation at the trilinear term, which is referred to as the μ-term. The mass of the triplet field is assumed to be much larger than the electroweak scale to explain the smallness of neutrino masses.",0
58,"1. Quantum key distribution (QKD) will allow secure communication, but a new quantum-enabled telecommunications infrastructure is required.
2. This infrastructure will include novel components such as quantum memories, quantum repeaters, and quantum channels.
3. To ensure proper quantum functionality, devices must not act as ""measure and prepare"" channels, which destroy quantum correlations.
4. Quantifying quantum behavior can be done through measures like entanglement measures or the secret key rate in QKD.
5. A strong quantum channel preserves all or nearly all quantum correlations, which can be tested in a ""prepare and measure"" picture.
6. The goal is to implement these ideas in a meaningful way, with a testing procedure that is experimentally practical and allows for a finite number of test states and measurements.
7. The paper focuses on optical systems, outlining a quantitative device-testing scheme and giving results for a wide class of optical channels.
8. The method is based on distinguishing a truly quantum channel from a ""measure and prepare"" channel, and estimating the quantum throughput using entanglement measures.
9. The main goal is to estimate the amount of effective entanglement observable in an optical system after transmission through an optical channel.",1
59,"1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided valuable information on subatomic physics over the past 83 years. The discovery of the large anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron led to the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the quark structure of baryons. The magnetic moment of a charged particle with spin is given by the gyromagnetic ratio and the anomaly. Radiative corrections, arising from the internal quark structure of baryons, contribute to the anomaly.
2. The electron anomaly is measured to a precision of four parts in a billion, while the muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million. The relative contributions of heavier particles to the anomaly scale as the mass of the particle to the fourth power. At a precision of 0.24 parts per million, the muon anomaly is sensitive to physics at the gigaelectronvolt scale. The standard model value of the muon anomaly has measurable contributions from QED loops containing leptons and photons, hadronic loops containing hadrons in vacuum polarization loops, and weak loops involving the W and Z weak gauge bosons.
3. The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomaly is likely to provide the ultimate limit to the precision of the standard model value. Measurements of the muon anomaly have placed serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model. Supersymmetric theories predict contributions to the muon anomaly at a measurable level in a broad range of models. The mdm and edm are related to the real and imaginary parts of the diagonal element of the slepton mixing matrix, while the transition moment is related to the off-diagonal one.
4. The search for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the muon is motivated by the violation of lepton flavor in neutrino oscillations and the potential generation of measurable effects in the magnetic and electric dipole moments of the muon. The experimental signal for the muon EDM is the asymmetry in the decay of high-energy positrons (electrons) relative to the muon spin. The experimental results from the e821 experiment show a discrepancy of 2.7 standard deviations when compared to the standard model value. A new experiment to search for a permanent EDM of the muon with a design sensitivity of 10^-",1
60,"1. In a recent paper, Li et al. introduced a new design for an optomechanical system consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which allows for the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling.
2. The reactive coupling originates from the dependence of the microdisk resonator's extrinsic losses on mechanical motion and is enhanced by phase-dependent gradient forces.
3. While cooling the system to its ground state is desirable for observing quantum effects, the authors explore alternative approaches to investigate the effects of strong reactive coupling.
4. They examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields, reporting reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting.
5. This is a departure from previous works that relied solely on dispersive coupling for normal mode splitting.
6. In the proposed system, a microdisk cavity is coupled to a freestanding waveguide, with a strong pump field and a weak Stokes field entering through the waveguide.
7. The waveguide's motion under the optical force exerted by the cavity photons, along with dispersive and reactive couplings, changes the cavity's resonant frequency and decay rate.
8. The authors analyze the system using the Heisenberg equation of motion and find that the expectation values of the system oscillate at three distinct frequencies.
9. They conclude that reactive coupling can lead to normal mode splitting in the output stokes field, and the peak separation increases with increasing pump power. Additionally, the reactive coupling can cause four-wave mixing, generating an anti-stokes component.",0

2. The study reveals that the dynamics of transverse magnetization exhibits oscillatory behavior with an algebraically decaying envelope in the large time limit, and the frequency of oscillation varies monotonically with the transverse field in the ferromagnetic phase and becomes independent of it in the paramagnetic region.
3. The long-time behavior shows that the quantity related to the transverse magnetization exhibits different behavior as a function of the transverse field in the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions, indicating the persistence of inhomogeneity of magnetization at long times.
4. The study highlights the importance of odd-occupation states, which have zero energy and remain nonzero forever, leading to the absence of homogeneous magnetization and the presence of two new quantities that bear the signature of criticality.",1

2. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is known to be in the color superconducting phase, and recent research has shown that the color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, forming bulk matter that satisfies charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium conditions.
3. However, the charge neutrality condition required for bulk matter inside compact stars can lead to a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks, which can eventually destroy the Cooper pairing and lead to a first-order phase transition or the formation of a non-uniform LOFF state.
4. Recent results suggest that homogeneous neutral cold-dense quark matter can exist in the gapless 2SC (g2sc) or gapless CFL (gcfl) phase, depending on the flavor structure of the system, and these gapless phases can exhibit a chromomagnetic instability, which remains an unsolved puzzle.",1
63,"1. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is a widely accepted framework for understanding the melting phase transition in two-dimensional systems, which involves two separate continuous transitions as a solid transforms into a liquid.
2. However, the KTHNY theory assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which contradicts observations of aligned and accumulated dislocations into small angle domain walls.
3. Recent studies have investigated the validity of the KTHNY theory for systems with different pair interactions, including hard sphere, Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, dipole-dipole, and debye-huckel inter-particle interactions.
4. Numerical simulations have revealed the metastable nature of the hexatic phase, and the observation of the hexatic phase is strongly linked with the thermodynamic equilibration of the systems, which depends on the measured quantity of interest and can take significantly longer for long-range or collective relaxations.",1
64,"1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4100 planetary candidates, leading to a better understanding of planet occurrence rates around various types of stars. Small planets, particularly those with sizes between Earth and Neptune, are common. However, accurate and precise planetary radii are crucial for understanding the distribution of planetary structures.

2. The Kepler pipeline treats each host star as a single star, which may not be accurate as a non-negligible fraction of Kepler host stars could be multiple stars. This assumption can introduce systematic uncertainties in planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions.

3. Undetected stellar companions can affect the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii. The primary contaminant within 1 arcsecond of the host stars is bound companions, not line-of-sight background stars. Probabilistic uncertainties of planetary radii have been presented based on expected stellar multiplicity rates and stellar companion sizes.

4. The observed planetary radii will be systematically too small if there are no spectroscopic or high-resolution imaging observations to vet companions. However, if a candidate host star is observed with high-resolution imaging or radial velocity spectroscopy to screen the star for companions, the underestimate of the true planet radius is significantly reduced.

5. The planetary radii are not directly observed; instead, the transit depth is the observable, which is then related to the planet size. The observed depth of a planetary transit is defined as the fractional difference in the measured out-of-transit flux and the measured in-transit flux.

6. The transit depth depends on the brightness ratio of the transited star to the total brightness of the system and the stellar radius, which changes depending on which star the planet is transiting. The Kepler planetary candidate parameters are estimated assuming the star is a single star, which may lead to incorrect planet radius reports if the stellar host is a multiple star system.",0
65,"1. The range of HI column densities in nearby galaxies' neutral gas disks is similar to that of damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) in quasar (QSO) spectra. However, mapping the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission is currently impossible due to the weak line signal and the limitations of present technology.
2. The identification of DLAs as absorbers in QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, but their redshift number density decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts, making it difficult to find DLAs with 21-cm emission within the reach of present-day radio telescopes.
3. There are hundreds of DLA absorption profiles at intermediate and high redshift, but little possibility to bridge these with the wealth of information on cold gas properties in local galaxies. Most observers resort to optical wavelengths to study DLAs, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been mostly unsuccessful.
4. A few positive identifications of DLA host galaxies exist, mostly resulting from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. The success rate for finding low-redshift DLA host galaxies is better because the host galaxies are expected to be brighter and the separation between the QSO and the DLA galaxy is likely larger.
5. Early surveys for low-redshift DLA host galaxies consisted of broadband imaging without spectroscopic follow-up, while later studies aimed at measuring redshifts to determine the association of optically identified galaxies with DLAs. There are now known DLA galaxies at various redshifts, spanning a wide range of galaxy properties.
6. The properties of DLAs and DLA galaxies can be compared with our knowledge of HI in the local universe through statistical studies, as individual galaxies cannot be studied in the 21-cm line. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe have provided an accurate measurement of HI mass density, which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLA studies.
7. High-resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope can be used to constrain the column density distribution function of HI. The sample, known as WHISP, consists of 355 galaxies with a wide range of HI mass and optical",0
66,"1. Star clusters are thought to form in giant molecular clouds, with only a small fraction of the gas turned into stars. During the initial phases of a cluster's life, it is composed of both gas and stars. However, stellar winds and supernova explosions can remove the gas, causing a rapid change in the gravitational potential energy and disrupting the cluster's equilibrium.
2. The effects of this process are well understood theoretically, but have not been considered extensively in observational studies. Some studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by measuring the velocity dispersion and half-mass radius, and assuming virial equilibrium. However, these studies have reported discrepant results, with some finding non-standard IMFs and others finding standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs.
3. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, with all clusters older than 110 Myr being well fit by Kroupa or Salpeter IMFs, while the youngest clusters showed a significant scatter. They suggest that this is due to the youngest (tens of Myr) clusters being out of equilibrium, which undercuts the assumption of virial equilibrium needed for such studies.
4. In the present work, the authors examine the detailed luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters in nearby starburst galaxies, all of which have been reported to have non-standard stellar IMFs. They provide evidence that these clusters are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss, which calls into question claims of a varying stellar IMF.
5. The authors also note that many young clusters are destroyed by what has been dubbed ""infant mortality,"" which is caused by rapid gas expulsion leaving the cluster severely out of equilibrium. They provide additional evidence for this hypothesis in the present work.
6. The paper is structured by first presenting the observations (i.e. luminosity profiles) and models of early cluster evolution, then comparing the observed profiles with the authors' N-body simulations, and finally discussing the implications for the dynamical state and longevity of young clusters.
7. The authors concentrate on F555W (V) band observations of the three clusters taken with the High-Resolution Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space T",0

2. The suppression of chaotic motion by quantum fluctuations is seen in the kicked rotor system, where quantum interference prevents the wave packet from delocalizing.
3. On the other hand, quantum fluctuations can enhance chaotic motion through the tunneling effect, as seen in the kicked double-well model.
4. The relationship between chaotic behavior and tunneling in classically chaotic systems is an important and interesting subject of study in quantum physics.
5. Semiclassical descriptions of tunneling phenomena in classically chaotic systems have been developed by several groups.
6. Lin and Ballentine studied the interplay between tunneling and classical chaos in a particle in a double-well potential with oscillatory driving force.
7. They found that coherent tunneling takes place between small isolated classical stable regions of phase space, which are much smaller than the volume of a single potential well.
8. Hnggi and coworkers studied chaos-suppressed tunneling in the driven double-well model in terms of the Floquet formalism.
9. They found a one-dimensional manifold in the parameter space where the tunneling is completely suppressed by the coherent driving.

The text discusses the importance of understanding dissipative quantum dynamics in various physics and chemistry sub-disciplines, with a focus on bosonic bath models such as the Caldeira-Leggett model and spin-boson model. These models typically represent the environment as a set of non-interacting harmonic oscillators, with the environment's influence on the system encoded in a spectral density.
2. The authors highlight the limitations of bosonic bath models and the need for alternative representations, such as non-interacting Morse or quartic oscillators, or mapping anharmonic environments onto effective harmonic modes with temperature-dependent spectral densities. They also mention the role of fermionic bath models in electronic transport through nanostructures.
3. The text introduces a stochastic formulation of quantum dissipation that incorporates bosonic, fermionic, and spin bath models. The stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) is used to describe quantum dissipative dynamics under the influence of colored noises. Different bath models and properties are distinguished by assigning distinct noise variables and associated statistics.
4. The authors acknowledge the challenges in achieving stable convergences in stochastic simulations and the need for efficient stochastic simulation schemes. They also mention their successful application of stochastic path integral simulations to calculate thermal distributions, absorption/emission spectra, and energy transfer, but note that direct stochastic simulation of real-time dynamics remains formidable.",0
69,"1. The glass transition, a largely unresolved problem in statistical physics, is associated with a sharp increase in relaxation times and a departure from equilibrium during cooling.
2. Theoretical studies propose that the transition from a liquid to a glassy state is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic transition, with an ""ideal"" glass transition believed to occur at the Kauzmann temperature.
3. However, simulated behavior of hard-disk and soft-sphere systems has shown discrepancies, leading to questions about whether these differences are due to fundamental model differences or inappropriate sampling at low temperatures and high densities.
4. Alternative theoretical considerations have attempted to connect glass transition phenomena with the rapid increase in relaxation times near a theoretical critical temperature, known as the mode-coupling temperature.
5. Molecular simulations have supported both viewpoints, with many studies conducted using models introduced by Stillinger and Weber and by Kob and Andersen.
6. The idealized MCT predicts a transition from a high-temperature liquid state to a low-temperature arrested state at a critical temperature, but including transverse currents and thermally activated matter transport results in a smoother transition.

2. Longitudinal dyadic data, which involves repeatedly measuring dyads over time, presents two complications: within-dyad and within-subject correlations, and the missing data problem caused by dropout.
3. Nonignorable dropouts, where missingness depends on unobserved data, can lead to biased estimates in conventional statistical methods.
4. The proposed approach to address nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal dyadic data is a fully Bayesian selection model, which accounts for interdependence between patients and spouses, within-dyad correlation, and missing data.
5. The proposed method is applied to a breast cancer study to characterize the depression experience from both patients and spouses perspectives, and to examine the dyadic interaction and interdependence of patients and spouses over time.",1
71,"1. Quantum fluctuations in electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that never vanishes, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources. In 1948, Casimir predicted that electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other due to a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation. This force arises from the difference in zero-point energy between the plates at close distances and at infinite separation.
2. Lifshitz, Dzyaloshinskii, and Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics, deriving an analytical formula for the force between uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions. At very short distances, their theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force, while at larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction.
3. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been verified in several high-precision experiments, mainly focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum. However, less precise measurements in liquids have been reported, and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids has also been found.
4. The theory has been proposed as a potentially relevant issue for the development of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems. However, essentially no attention has been devoted to the torque between anisotropic materials predicted by Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash. No experimental attempts to demonstrate the effect or numerical calculations to estimate its magnitude have been presented.
5. In this paper, the authors calculate the magnitude of the torque induced by quantum fluctuations for specific materials and discuss possible experimental validations of the effect. They consider a small birefringent disk placed parallel to a birefringent barium titanate plate in vacuum and show that the magnitude of the torque is within the sensitivity of available instrumentation, provided that the plate and the disk are kept at sub-micron distances.",0
72,"1. The study of complex networks has gained significant attention in recent years, with applications in various fields such as computer science, biology, social science, and finance. A central problem in network science is the study of random walks (RWs) on a graph and their relation to the topological properties of the network. This subject has both theoretical and practical implications, including the study of epidemics, classification of web pages through the PageRank algorithm, and algorithms for community detection.
2. In this paper, the authors introduce a new framework for the study of topologically biased random walks (TBRWs) on graphs, which allows for the investigation of community detection and synchronization in complex networks. By using topological properties of the network to bias the RWs, the network structure can be explored more efficiently. The authors are motivated by the idea that biased RWs can be efficiently used for community finding.
3. The authors develop mathematical tools to investigate the ""bias parameters"" space and uncover details in the spectra of the graph transition matrix. They use the relation between spectra and communities to introduce a novel methodology for efficient community finding. The paper is organized into four sections, including the definition of TBRWs, the mathematical formalism used in the paper, the behavior of the spectral gap in biased RWs, and a general methodology for the application of different TBRWs in community finding problems.
4. The authors consider biases that are self-consistently related to graph topological properties, such as vertex properties (network degree, clustering, etc.) or edge properties (multiplicity or shortest path betweenness). They choose a specific form for the weights that tune the strength of the bias and enhance or reduce the probability of a walker moving from one vertex to another based on the property of the vertex.
5. The authors prove that the detailed balance condition holds and introduce a different approach to the problem by symmetrizing the matrix in the vertex-centered case. The symmetric matrix shares the same eigenvalues with the original matrix and forms a complete orthogonal basis, allowing for the definition of a meaningful distance between vertices. This distance can provide important additional information in the problem of community partition of complex networks.
6. The authors test their approach on the Girvan-Newman benchmark and decide if a vertex belongs to a community based on the spectral properties of the transition matrix. They expect vertices belonging to the same community to",0

2. Internet worms have caused massive-scale disruption and damage, and a new type of worms, called p2p worms, pose a serious threat to the internet.
3. P2p worms can be passive or active, with active p2p worms utilizing p2p overlay applications to infect vulnerable hosts and spread throughout the network.
4. The p2p overlay provides an accurate way for worms to find more vulnerable hosts, and the infected p2p hosts can mount attacks to external hosts.
5. A holistic immunity system is being developed to provide mechanisms for both internal defense and external protection against active p2p worms.
6. The system includes a small subset of p2p overlay nodes, called phagocytes, that monitor connection patterns and traffic volume to detect and isolate infected hosts.
7. The phagocytes also provide access control and filtering mechanisms to prevent p2p traffic from leaking to external hosts and to protect against external attacks.
8. A prototype system has been implemented and evaluated on a massive-scale testbed with realistic p2p network traces, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed holistic immunity system.",1
74,"1. Debris disk systems, such as the one surrounding star HD 32297, represent an intermediate stage of stellar system evolution, transitioning between the primordial protoplanetary disk and a mature system like our solar system.
2. Researchers have detected a strong ""stable"" absorption component in HD 32297's gas phase resonance line, which could be caused by either intervening circumstellar or interstellar gas; measuring the interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight is critical for characterizing any ""contaminating"" ISM absorption.
3. High-resolution optical spectra of HD 32297 and stars in close angular proximity reveal two absorption components toward HD 32297, while only one is detected toward its proximate neighbors; the extra absorption component is likely caused by circumstellar material.
4. The ISM absorption is similar among HD 32297 and its two closest neighbors, indicating absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the local bubble; some variation in local bubble absorption is detected toward 18 ori.
5. The measured circumstellar feature toward HD 32297 is the strongest such absorption measured toward any nearby main sequence debris disk, and if the morphology and abundances of the stable gas component around HD 32297 are similar to those around the prototypical edge-on debris disk β Pic, the estimated upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding HD 32297 is 40.3 Mearth.",1
75,"1. Gravity is a universal force that affects anything with energy, and quantum gravity theories predict the existence of a minimum measurable length due to the breakdown of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle at high energies.
2. The generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is a proposed modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that holds at all scales and implies the existence of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum.
3. The GUP has been proposed to have a specific form, represented by equation (uncert1) in the document, which includes the Planck mass and energy.
4. The dimensionless parameter in the GUP equation is normally assumed to be of order unity, but if it is not, current experiments predict large upper bounds on it that may signal the existence of a new length scale.
5. The GUP also implies a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum, which cannot be exceeded.
6. If the dimensionless parameter in the GUP equation is not assumed to be of order unity, then all measurable lengths have to be quantized in units of the Planck length.
7. The energy-time uncertainty principle can be derived from the standard Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the characteristic time of the system under study.

3. The text also discusses the computation of correlation functions at strong coupling using the gauge/gravity duality, including the case of 3-point correlation functions with one extra chiral operator.
4. The computation of the string theory partition function is based on a saddle point approximation to the string path integral, and other chiral operators can be included by realizing that the supergravity fields act as sources in the equations of motion for the worldsheet fields of the heavy string worldsheet.",0
77,"1. The text discusses the development of an embedding scheme for the Dirac equation, which is a relativistic extension of Inglesfield's embedding scheme for the Schrödinger equation. This scheme enables the solution of the Dirac equation within a limited region i that is part of a larger system, with region ii replaced by an additional term in the Hamiltonian for region i. The method is derived using a trial function that imposes continuity in the small component across the boundary between i and ii.
2. The embedding scheme is shown to be stable and convergent, and the Green function for the embedded Hamiltonian is derived. The method is applied to a confined hydrogen atom and a Au/Ag/Au sandwich structure, demonstrating its potential for future applications in defects and surfaces of materials containing heavier elements within the framework of density functional theory.
3. The use of a trial function with a discontinuous small component is discussed, which may be unacceptable for certain applications but still provides valid approximations for estimating the energies of the solutions of the Dirac equation. The non-relativistic embedding scheme has been successful in numerous applications, even those involving discontinuous probability currents, as long as the embedding potential is evaluated at the correct energy.",0

2. Most modeling and analysis techniques are tailored for static networks, but real-world networks constantly evolve over time.
3. The interplay between dynamics on and of networks is not well understood, especially in the context of network adaptation mechanisms.
4. Adaptation mechanisms, like social distancing in epidemiology, can significantly influence the evolution of network structure.
5. A simple adaptive rewiring mechanism was proposed by Gross et al., which induces complex behavior in epidemic models.
6. Extensions of this work assume homogeneous infection and recovery rates, while the adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (ASIS) model accounts for arbitrary contact patterns.
7. Analytical results for the ASIS model rely on assumptions of homogeneous contact patterns and dynamics, leaving a lack of effective methodologies for utilizing adaptation mechanisms.
8. The paper derives a lower bound on the epidemic threshold for the heterogeneous ASIS model and proposes an algorithm for optimally tuning adaptation rates.
9. The proposed lower bounds are confirmed with numerical simulations, and the optimal adaptation rates are compared with popular centrality measures.

79,"1. Open dielectric resonators have received significant attention due to their applications as microlasers, sensors, and paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths. Semiclassical methods have been successful in treating wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength, providing approximate solutions in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system. In the case of dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard where rays travel freely and are partially reflected and refracted when impinging on the boundary.
2. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture, such as the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries, are being investigated for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
3. One of the most important tools in semiclassical physics is the trace formula, which relates the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system. A trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators was recently developed and successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and polymer microlasers of various shapes.
4. However, typical microlasers are three-dimensional (3D) systems, and while trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is little investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators. The main difficulty lies in the numerical solution of the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities. In the case of flat microlasers, they are treated as 2D systems by introducing an effective index of refraction.
5. This approximation has been used in previous studies with good overall agreement between experiments and theory. However, it is known that this 2D approximation introduces uncontrolled errors, and there are no a priori estimates of such errors, even when the c",0
80,"1. The merger of neutron stars or black holes is a significant source of gravitational waves, releasing large amounts of energy in the process. The coalescence rate of double neutron stars (DNS) in the local universe is estimated to be one event every 125 to 148 years for initial LIGO and Virgo, respectively, with up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations.
2. The superposition of unresolved sources at high redshifts will produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Different astrophysical processes, such as distorted black holes, bar mode emission from young neutron stars, and supernovae or hypernovae, can generate various types of noise in this background.
3. A recent study, using the DNS merging rate estimated in a precedent study, has estimated the gravitational wave background spectrum produced by these coalescences. Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods were performed to determine the critical redshift beyond which the duty cycle condition required for a continuous background is satisfied.
4. The study focused on the last few thousand seconds before the last stable orbit is reached, where more than 96% of the gravitational wave energy is released. The signal frequency is in the range of 10-1500 Hz, covered by ground-based interferometers.

The resulting distribution of the number of coalescences as a function of redshift and the corresponding coalescence rate per redshift interval were calculated and compared with the formation rate of DNS systems. The study also discussed the detection possibility with laser beam interferometers and the main conclusions of the research.",1
81,"1. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is a well-studied phenomenon, but some issues like the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock are still under debate. This backreaction occurs when the acceleration process becomes efficient enough to generate pressures comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure. This nonlinear phenomenon changes the spectrum of particles and the structure of the shock.
2. There are three main approaches to account for the backreaction: numerical simulations, fluid approach, and analytical methods. Numerical simulations allow self-consistent treatment of several effects, while the fluid approach treats cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, providing thermodynamics of modified shocks but not information about the spectrum of accelerated particles. Analytical methods can help understand nonlinear effects' physics.
3. A perturbative approach was adopted in [xcite], treating the pressure of accelerated particles as a small perturbation, providing an answer only for weakly modified shocks. Another analytical approach was proposed in [xcite], assuming sufficient energy dependence of particle diffusion, leading to separate solutions for subrelativistic and relativistic particles.
4. Nonlinear backreaction effects on the maximum achievable energy and geometry have been investigated in [xcite]. A practical solution for the acceleration problem in the nonlinear regime was recognized in [xcite], with a simple analytical broken-power-law approximation of nonlinear spectra. Recently, promising analytical solutions of nonlinear shock acceleration have appeared in the literature.
5. Numerical simulations have shown that even a small fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas can channel an appreciable part of the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid, making the test particle approach unsuitable. The most visible effects of backreaction appear in the spectrum of accelerated particles, showing a peculiar flattening at the highest energies.
6. While several calculations exist for nonlinear effects in shock acceleration of quasi-monochromatic particles, there is no description of how these effects appear when the shock propagates in a medium with preaccelerated particles. The backreaction can severely affect the process of re-energization of preaccelerated particles.

2. The dark energy sector, dominated by the cosmological constant, eventually dominates over cold dark matter and drives the accelerating expansion.
3. Several dark energy models have been proposed over the past decade, including quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic dark energy, new agegraphic dark energy, and Ricci dark energy.
4. Modifications of the gravitational sector itself can also induce effective dark energy, such as f(T) gravity, gravity with higher curvature invariants, scalar-tensor gravity, vector-tensor gravity, and gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes.
5. An alternative approach to gravity is based on the Weitzenböck connection, which describes the gravitational field through torsion instead of curvature.
6. Teleparallel gravity, based on the Weitzenböck connection, is equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but has distinct geometrical and physical features.
7. Modifications of teleparallel gravity, such as f(T) gravity, can serve as alternatives to inflationary models and effective dark energy models.
8. The main advantage of f(T) gravity is its second-order field equations, which are simpler than the dynamical equations of other extended theories of gravity.
9. This paper explores the implications of f(T) gravity for the formation of light elements in the early universe, specifically during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).

84,"1. In standard cosmology, the length scale of acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at recombination can be calculated from measurements of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. This ""standard ruler"" scale should also be measurable at low redshifts, such as in large galaxy redshift surveys, to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe. However, any misinterpretation of CMB measurements due to new physics could bias these low-redshift inferences.
2. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB accurately provides the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality. These quantities are precisely measured in the CMB, and only their ratio matters for the calculation. This means that even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted due to undetected relativistic components, dark energy inferences from the combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets remain unchanged.
3. The sound horizon method relies on measuring the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination. Nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination. The sound horizon integral depends on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma. If dark energy is sub-dominant, the sound horizon can be expressed as a function of the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
4. The sound speed depends on the baryon-to-photon ratio and is calculated as a function of this ratio. This produces the sound horizon as a function of the redshift of equality. The epoch of recombination, controlled by atomic physics, is insensitive to changes in cosmology. The baryon-to-photon ratio is also precisely measured in the CMB power spectrum.
5. The baryon-to-photon ratio is determined by the gravitational inertia of baryons driven by potentials near the epoch of recombination. The modulation of the potentials gives a precise measurement of the baryon-to-photon ratio, which, with precise knowledge of the sound speed, fixes the sound horizon.
6. Information about matter-radiation equality is encoded in the amplitudes of the peaks through the manner in which potentials evolve as they cross the horizon. Measurements",0

2. Accelerator and reactor experiments have provided strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters. The LSND experiment at Los Alamos reported evidence for oscillation. New experimental results are expected to help determine neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles, which could potentially lead to a more fundamental theory beyond the Standard Model.
3. Investigating plausible ansatze for the neutrino mass matrix is a useful approach to making progress in this area. The authors propose an ansatz for the 3-generation neutrino mass matrix and examine its consequences. They consider neutrinos to be represented by 2-component spinors, making the mass matrix an arbitrary symmetric complex matrix.
4. This equation can be motivated from an SO(10) grand unified model, where it may be derived with certain assumptions. Physically, it corresponds to the well-known approximate signature of grand unification. The authors also show how this equation can be combined with experimental information to estimate neutrino masses and the ""texture"" of the mass matrix.
5. In the SO(10) grand unification model, each generation contains one light massive two-component neutrino and a very heavy one that is ""integrated out"" according to the ""seesaw mechanism."" The effective neutrino mass matrix takes the form of two terms, with the second term generally considered to dominate. However, the authors assume the first term to be dominant for their derivation.
6. In an SO(10) model where the mass matrices are hermitian, the mass matrix will be real symmetric. The authors investigate this case and the possibility of a more general case. They combine the ansatz with experimentally obtained results on neutrino oscillations to learn more about the mass matrix itself.
7. The free Lagrangian containing three two-component massive fields is given by equation (3.1) in the document. A unitary matrix brings the neutrino mass matrix to real, positive, diagonal form, and the mass diagonal fields are related to the weak interaction by a unitary mixing matrix.

2. The degree distribution, which is the fraction of vertices in the network with a certain degree, is an important property of networks. Scale-free networks, which are common in many real-world systems, show a power-law degree distribution.
3. In the context of disease spread, the heterogeneity of scale-free networks, with many vertices having a low number of contacts and a few vertices with a high number of contacts, can influence the potential risk of spread of acute and chronic diseases.
4. Simulating the spread of diseases on these networks can provide insights on how to prevent and control them. In a previous publication, it was found that networks with the same degree distribution may show very different structural properties.
5. In this work, the impact of different structural properties on the dynamics of epidemics in scale-free networks was studied, where each vertex of the network represents an individual or even a set of individuals.
6. Routines were developed to simulate the spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases in networks with the same degree distribution but different topological structure.
7. The networks were generated using the Barabási-Albert (BA) algorithm and other algorithms such as method a (MA), method b (MB), Molloy-Reed (MR), and Kalisky.

3. For small @xmath0, LC describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass, and becomes flat when @xmath0 is zero; however, circular timelike geodesics exhibit peculiar behavior for certain @xmath0 values.

2. The main result is that any Lindblad-type ME, either Markovian or non-Markovian, with self-adjoint Lindblad operators, can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution.
3. This result has consequences such as a fast method to solve MEs if the unitary solutions are known and the attainability of both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes under the same mathematical formalism.
4. The proposed formalism can easily generalize some intrinsic decoherence models and account for experimental results in optical cavities and ion traps.
5. The paper also discusses the relationship between the proposed formalism and existing models of stochastic evolution in Hilbert space and the possibility of intrinsic decoherence phenomena.
6. The main result is that every Lindblad evolution with self-adjoint Lindblad operators can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution, which can reproduce the Lindblad equation by adequately modifying chosen parameters in the original evolution operator.",1

Left-handed metamaterials (LHMs) are a new class of artificial materials with negative indices of refraction for certain wavelengths, which have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in modern optics and microelectronics. These materials can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, and yield slow light propagation.
2. In disordered systems, the presence of negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) disordered metamaterials strongly suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths. Specifically, a sixth power dependence of the localization length with wavelength has been observed under refractive-index disorder, instead of the well-known quadratic asymptotic behavior.
3. The localization length in disordered metamaterials can also be affected by polarization, oblique incidence, and dispersion. For example, a suppression of Anderson localization of light has been found in 1D disordered metamaterials combining oblique incidence and dispersion, and a fourth-order perturbation theory has been developed to resolve the problem of non-conventional Anderson localization in bilayered periodic-on-average structures.
4. In this article, the authors calculate numerically the localization length of light for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with alternating indices of refraction and thicknesses, introducing disorder by changing the position of the layer boundaries. They study homogeneous stacks (H) composed entirely of traditional right-handed materials (RH) with positive indices of refraction, and mixed stacks (M) with alternating layers of left- and right-handed materials. They find a quadratic dependence of the localization length for long wavelengths in H stacks, while the localization length saturates for lower values of wavelength. In M stacks, the localization length depends linearly on the wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers, for low-disordered systems and wavelengths several orders of magnitude greater than the grating period.",0

The concordance cosmological model, which conforms to various observational data, suggests that only 4% of the total mass-energy is ordinary matter, made up of stars, gas, galaxies, etc. This is inferred from primordial nucleosynthesis of light elements and measurements of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.
2. There is 23% of non-baryonic dark matter, of an unknown nature, and the remaining 73% is in the form of a mysterious dark energy. Dark energy is postulated to explain the observed acceleration in the expansion of the universe.
3. Dark matter is crucial in explaining the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of luminous matter, which includes galaxies and hot, intergalactic gas. It also plays a significant role in the formation of large-scale structures by gravitationally attracting ordinary matter.
4. Simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) support this hypothesis, but require that dark matter be non-relativistic during galaxy formation. This is referred to as cold dark matter (CDM) or ""cold"" dark matter.
5. The origin of dark matter (and dark energy) remains unexplained within the standard model of particle physics, but extensions to the model offer potential candidates for dark matter particles.
6. Neutralinos, introduced in supersymmetry theories, and axions, proposed for CP violation in particle physics, are possible dark matter particle candidates.
7. Dark energy is thought to be a constant energy density in the universe, implying a violation of energy conditions and negative pressure. It could be the cosmological constant that Einstein introduced in his general relativity equations.
8. The CDM-$\Lambda$ model, despite the unknown nature of its components, has been successful in precisely fitting CMB fluctuations and reproducing large-scale structures.
9. Dark matter manifests in galaxies through phenomena like the flat rotation curve, where the rotation speed remains constant beyond a certain distance from the galactic center. This requires a massive, invisible halo of dark matter, which could potentially be made of the same particles suggested by cosmology.",0
93,"1. Long chain macromolecules, or polymers, have been extensively studied due to their ubiquity in nature. While the physical properties of homopolymers are well understood, less is known about heteropolymers of biological significance. From a biologist's perspective, the specific properties of a particular molecule are of interest, as genetic information is coded by specific sequences of nucleic acids that are translated into chains of amino acids. The energy and conformation of a polymer are determined by various interactions between its constituent amino acids.
2. A physicist's approach to studying polymers is to simplify the models by sacrificing specificity in order to gain more general information. There are several statistical descriptions of ensembles of molecules composed of a random linear sequence of elements with various interactions that determine their final shapes. These simple models of heteropolymers are also of interest as examples of disordered systems with connections to spin glasses, with the advantage of faster relaxation.
3. Recent experimental studies have focused on solutions and gels of polymers that incorporate randomly charged groups. Statistical approaches only provide general descriptions of such heteropolymers, so the focus is on simple models that include the essential ingredients. The overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups are most likely controlled by the coulomb interactions that are the strongest and with the longest range.
4. The behavior of quenched pas (polyelectrolyte complexes) is of particular interest. A flexible chain in which each of the monomers has a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches is considered. The long range nature of the coulomb interactions, combined with the randomness of the charge sequence, produces effects quite distinct from systems with short range interactions. The phase diagrams of quenched pas in different dimensions have been explored using the knowledge accumulated in previous studies.
5. In three dimensions, pas with small charges behave similarly to random chains with short range interactions, while those with larger charges exhibit strong dependencies on their excess charge. There is a critical charge such that pas with charges above this threshold cannot form a compact state. The probability of a randomly charged pa to have such an excess charge depends on both the dimension and its length.
6. Previous results for pas in different dimensions indicate that the pa undergoes a transition from a dense (globular) to a",0
94,"1. Half-metallic ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures are ideal for spintronics applications, and much research has been devoted to designing and finding such materials.
2. Cr-doped dilute magnetic semiconductors, particularly CrAs and CrSb in zinc blende structure, have attracted attention due to their potential for complete spin polarization and high Curie temperatures.
3. Experimental studies have shown ferromagnetic behavior in CrAs thin films grown on GaAs substrates, and theoretical calculations have verified the half-metallic character of CrAs.
4. Thin films of CrSb have also been found to be ferromagnetic with high Curie temperatures.
5. Theoretical studies have suggested the possibility of half-metallic behavior in transition metal compounds with certain lattice parameters and surface terminations.
6. However, some of these compounds may be epitaxially unstable or antiferromagnetic at equilibrium lattice parameters, posing challenges for experimental synthesis.
7. Recent experimental successes in growing Cr-based pnictide and chalcogenide thin films have motivated studies on the variation of magnetic properties with lattice parameter.
8. The present study focuses on the volume dependence of exchange interactions and Curie temperatures in Cr-based pnictides and chalcogenides.
9. The study aims to provide guidance for experimentalists in their search for materials suitable for spintronic devices.",1
95,"1. The illuminated material in active galactic nuclei and galactic black holes was initially assumed to be cold and non-ionized, but it was later discovered that photoionization has a significant impact on both the reflected continuum and iron fluorescence lines.
2. The density of the illuminated material is typically assumed to be constant along the vertical direction, but this is only applicable to the simplest version of radiation-dominated Shakura-Sunyaev disks and only for the portion where viscous dissipation is the dominant heating process.
3. Recent studies have relaxed the assumption of constant gas density and determined the gas density from hydrostatic balance solved simultaneously with ionization balance and radiative transfer.
4. Thermal instability allows the coexistence of gas at different phases with very different temperatures and densities, and taking into account thermal conduction and the effects of transition layers between the different stable phases is important for accurately modeling the x-ray reprocessing produced by the deeper, cooler disk.
5. The vertical structure of an x-ray illuminated disk at rest is governed by the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and energy conservation, and the temperature structure in the layers above the accretion disk and the resulting emission lines and reflection due to resonance line scattering have been calculated in a recent study.",1
96,"1. The text discusses the transverse distribution function of a three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation and position of the second end. The authors use the exact solution for the Green's function of the wormlike chain and find that the distribution function for intermediate chain lengths possesses a bimodal shape with maxima at a finite value of the transverse displacement. This is consistent with recent studies for the two-dimensional chain.
2. The authors also present analytical considerations for short and large polymers, which are in complete agreement with classical works. The computation of the three-dimensional distribution function of a free polymer is in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. However, the transverse one-dimensional distribution function of the 3d chain shows only a tiny peak at a certain value of the transverse displacement, which disappears for larger chain lengths.",0
97,"1. The paper discusses the properties of closed graphs and introduces an algorithm for labeling connected graphs. A closed graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. Chordal means it has no induced cycles of length greater than three, claw-free means it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to a claw (a complete bipartite graph $K_{1,3}$), and narrow means that every longest shortest path is at distance at most one from any vertex.
2. The algorithm labels the vertices of a connected graph in a specific order, and the labeling produced by the algorithm has the property that for all $i,j,m$ with $i<j<m$, if $m$ is in the neighborhood of $i$ and $j$, then $i$ and $j$ are adjacent. This property is crucial in proving that the labeling is closed.
3. The paper also discusses the relationship between closed graphs and binomial edge ideals. A binomial edge ideal is an ideal generated by binomials obtained from the edges of a graph. The paper shows that the binomials form a Gröbner basis of the ideal for a specific monomial order if and only if the labeling is closed.
4. The paper also discusses the characterization of closed graphs using the clique complex of the graph. A clique complex is a simplicial complex associated with a graph, where each clique (a complete subgraph) corresponds to a simplex. The paper shows that a graph is closed if and only if its clique complex is shellable.
5. The paper concludes by stating that the goal is to characterize when a graph has a closed labeling in terms of properties that can be seen directly from the graph. The paper proves that every closed graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow, and conjectures that these conditions are also sufficient. The paper also mentions that the conjecture is proved for some classes of graphs, such as cycles and complete graphs.",0
98,"1. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles originating from outside the Earth, discovered in the early 20th century, and are the main source of natural radiation. They have a power law energy spectrum that decreases as the cube of the primary energy.
2. The high-energy tail of the cosmic ray spectrum corresponds to energies up to 3 x 10^18 eV and rates of a few particles per km per century. For energies above a few hundred TeV, extensive air shower techniques are used to study cosmic rays.
3. The detected particles, mainly protons, have arrival directions with a remarkably isotropic distribution, which is understood in terms of diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields. However, for energies above a given value, propagation in the galaxy should cease to be diffusive.
4. There is increasing evidence for a different component of the high energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum, with a clear signal of a change of the spectral slope in the region just above 10^18 eV. Composition studies also indicate a change to light element composition for energies above 10^19 eV.
5. The highest energy events detected present a serious challenge to theory, as they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background over distances of order 50 Mpc. However, no such features are seen in the observed cosmic ray spectrum.
6. The complex puzzle connecting particle physics, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays has attracted the attention of many fields in physics. In a conventional approach, these particles would be nuclei, accelerated through stochastic acceleration.
7. However, few known astrophysical objects satisfy the minimum requirements to accelerate particles to the highest energies. Alternative scenarios include acceleration in young pulsars, gamma-ray bursts, our own galaxy, active galaxies, and the local group of galaxies.
8. The observed flux spectrum is difficult to explain in this conventional approach, and the non-observation of anisotropy complicates the puzzle. Possible configurations of extragalactic magnetic fields could explain many of the ultrahigh energy events as coming from a single source.",1

2. The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute gases led to the observation of the superfluid to Mott insulator (SF-MI) transition, which has opened up the possibility to investigate various phenomena in condensed matter physics by mimicking them with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.
3. The two-mode approximation is used to study spin hamiltonians in optical lattices, which can be considered as two localized spatial modes separated by a barrier.

100,"1. The family of iron pnictides is an important prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with various sub-families exhibiting a phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic crystal symmetry and long-range antiferromagnetic order.
2. Understanding the magnetic fluctuations in iron pnictides is crucial for unveiling the physics underlying superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated due to debates on the description of magnetic moments and the role of correlation effects.
3. ARPES is an essential experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides, but DFT calculations often struggle to reproduce all features correctly, particularly due to strong correlation effects and the connection between magnetic phase and ARPES.
4. The formation of twinned crystals during the phase transition results in mixed magnetic domains, causing macroscopic tools like ARPES or transport measurements to only see averaged information, losing details about anisotropy.
5. Experimentally detwinning crystals by applying uniaxial stress has been successful, but it is rare due to technical difficulties; understanding the electronic properties of iron pnictide superconductors comprehensively requires studying the influence of in-plane anisotropy in the magnetic phase.
6. There is a need for more theoretical work focusing on magnetic anisotropy in ARPES data, as experimental data on detwinned crystals shows clear anisotropy in the Fermi surface.",1
101,"1. The M31 globular cluster GC B158 (also known as BO 158) contains a bright X-ray source called XB158, which has been detected in every X-ray observation of the region since its discovery by the Einstein Observatory.
2. XB158 exhibited strong intensity modulation on a 10017.50 s period during the 2002 January XMM-Newton observation and similar variations were found in folded lightcurves from 1991 June ROSAT and 2000 June XMM-Newton observations.
3. The amplitude of modulation decreased with increasing source intensity and no such modulation was found in the 2001 June XMM-Newton observation, indicating a probable neutron star binary with a low mass donor.
4. However, analysis of the unfolded 2000 June XMM-Newton lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, suggesting that the disk is precessing and the precession period is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon.
5. Superhumps were first identified in superoutbursts of the SU UMa subclass of cataclysmic variables, manifesting as a periodic increase in optical brightness on a period slightly longer than the orbital period.
6. The 2004 July 17 XMM-Newton spectrum of XB158 was best described by a blackbody + power law model, indicating that the accretor is a neutron star.
7. Three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamical (SPH) modeling estimated the disk precession period to be 29±1 times the orbital period, i.e. 81±3 hr.
8. Swift observations of XB158 revealed a super-orbital period of 16 days and the luminosity varied by a factor of 1.5×10^(18) erg s^(-1) over the 30 observations.
9. The suggested super-orbital period is 170% longer than predicted by 3D SPH simulations, likely due to the mass ratio of the donor to the accretor being lower than assumed.",0
102,"1. The complex scaling (dilatation) method can reveal a resonance state by the appearance of an isolated complex eigenvalue on the spectrum of the non-Hermitian complex scaled Hamiltonian. However, the choice of the rotation angle must be large enough to rotate the continuum part of the spectrum beyond the resonance's complex eigenvalue. Moreover, the analysis of numerical results requires the study of numerical data to decide which result is the most accurate due to the use of finite variational expansions and non-linear parameter-dependent basis sets.
2. The density of states (DOS) method can obtain the energy and lifetime of a resonance state in a simple way by using least square fitting parameters. However, there is no single procedure to assess the accuracy of numerical findings and their convergence properties, or which values to pick between the several ""candidates"" that the method offers. Finite size scaling arguments have been used to analyze the properties of the DOS when the size of the Hamiltonian changes, showing critical behavior in the region where a given Hamiltonian has resonances.",0
103,"1. The concept of parity-time symmetric systems was introduced as an alternative to standard quantum theory, with the potential to give rise to real spectra despite non-hermitian Hamiltonians. This is achieved through the introduction of complex potentials that satisfy a constraint. Recent developments in optics have led to experimental realizations of these systems through the controlled imposition of symmetrically set and globally balanced gain and loss in optical waveguiding arrays.
2. The first experimental realizations of parity-time symmetric systems in optics were made using passive couplers, which consist of two waveguides with and without loss, or a pair of coupled waveguides with one carrying gain and the other carrying loss. More general models of linearly coupled active and passive intrinsically nonlinear waveguides have also been considered, and stable solitons have been found in these systems.
3. The stability of solitons in 2D periodic parity-time symmetric potentials has been investigated, and the possibility of creating 2D arrays of optical waveguides with parity-time symmetry has been raised. This work aims to make a basic step in this direction by introducing fundamental 2D plaquettes consisting of typically four sites, which are inspired by earlier works on 2D Hamiltonian lattices described by discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations. These plaquettes are proposed as building blocks for the construction of 2D parity-time symmetric lattices.",0
104,"1. The cataclysmic variable (CV) Hu Aqr consists of a white dwarf and a main-sequence companion star, with two planets orbiting the CV. The planets were discovered through irregularities in the observed-calculated variations of the CV, and their existence has led to a range of explanations, including the presence of circum-binary planets.
2. The two planets have masses of 5.7 and 7.6, and orbit the CV in eccentric orbits. However, numerical simulations have shown that the two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 1000-10,000 year time scale. A small fraction of the simulations, however, exhibit long-term dynamical stability, suggesting that the planets could be real.
3. The presence of the inner planet in orbit around Hu Aqr allows for the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and mass of its core at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) to be broken, which can be used to derive the rate of mass loss in the common-envelope phase. The outer planet can be used to validate this calculation and determine the conditions under which the CV was born.
4. The common-envelope phase causes the reduction of the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude, making it hard to imagine how a planet could survive such a turbulent past. However, the survival of the planet offers unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and the evolution of the system.
5. The presence of the inner planet in orbit around Hu Aqr allows for the calculation of the orbital separation at the moment of RLOF, which can be used to constrain the masses of the two stars and their orbital separation. The observed white dwarf mass provides an upper limit to the mass of the core of the primary star at the moment of RLOF, and therefore also provides a minimum to the companion mass.
6. The response of the orbit of the planet to the mass loss depends on the total amount of mass lost in the common envelope and the rate at which it is lost. Numerical common-envelope studies indicate that for an in-spiraling binary, the entire envelope can be expelled well within one orbital period of the inner planet, which leads to an impulsive response and the possible loss of the planet.

The No-Core Shell Model with Resonating Group Method (NCSM/RGM) is a microscopic cluster technique that treats both structure and reactions in light nuclear systems using realistic interactions and a consistent description of nucleon clusters. It has been successful in studying two-body cluster systems but cannot properly describe three-body cluster states, which are essential for understanding certain nuclear systems.
2. The NCSM/RGM has been extended to include three-body cluster configurations, with initial results presented for the ground state and continuum states of he3 within a he2+n+n basis. This extension involves expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states built from the NCSM wave function of each of the three clusters.
3. The relative motion wave functions and intercluster antisymmetrizer are the unknowns in the system of coupled-channel integral-differential equations obtained by projecting the microscopic N-body Schrödinger equation onto the basis states. These equations are then solved using the microscopic R-matrix method on a Lagrange mesh.
4. The NCSM/RGM has been applied to study the lightest borromean nucleus, he3, which is formed by an he2 core and two halo neutrons. The he2 core is described only by its ground state wave function, and similarity-renormalization-group evolved potentials obtained from the chiral N3LO nn interaction are used.
5. The NCSM/RGM provides wave functions with appropriate asymptotic behavior, unlike other bound-state methods such as the NCSM. The method has been used to study both bound and continuum states of he3 within a basis of he2+n+n, with good convergence and stability.
6. The NCSM/RGM has been successful in studying the ground state and continuum states of he3, and it can also be applied to other nuclear systems with three-body configurations. The method has been used to study nucleon-nucleus scattering, deuteron-he4 scattering, and fusion reactions, and it can be further extended to study unbound nuclei and other reactions.",0

107,"1. The core entropy of a polynomial is a concept introduced by W. Thurston, which generalizes the entropy theory of real quadratic maps. It is defined as the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its Hubbard tree, a forward invariant, finite topological tree contained in the filled Julia set.
2. The core entropy function can be extended to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers, as proven in the paper. This answers a question posed by W. Thurston and displays a rich fractal structure that reflects the underlying geometry of the Mandelbrot set.
3. The core entropy function can be used to study the parameter space of polynomials, as it is monotone along non-real veins of the Mandelbrot set. It also equals, up to a constant factor, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for certain polynomials and the asymptotic stretch factor of rational maps for dendritic Julia sets.
4. The paper also discusses an algorithm, devised by Thurston, to compute the core entropy for rational external angles by considering a larger matrix whose entries are pairs of postcritical angles. This algorithm is then used to prove that the entropy function is continuous and, in fact, Hölder continuous at certain angles.",1

2. However, the degree of beaming in GRBs remains uncertain, making it difficult to determine their energetics, and three methods proposed to determine the degree of beaming have limitations.
3. The discovery of optical orphan afterglows, which are not associated with any detectable GRBs, has been suggested as a way to measure the GRB collimation angle, but this method is difficult to implement due to the low optical flux density of afterglow emission from jets.",1
109,"1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are mysterious events in the universe that last for less than a minute and emit intense bursts of gamma rays. However, since the discovery of GRB 970228 by the BeppoSAX satellite, it has been known that GRBs also produce X-ray afterglows that can be detected for several hours or even days after the burst.
2. The afterglow observations of GRB 011211 and GRB 001025 were carried out by the XMM-Newton satellite. GRB 011211 was detected and localized in the BeppoSAX WFC1 on 2001 December 11, and its afterglow was identified as a new point source in the optical R-band. The optical spectrum of the afterglow showed an absorption line system corresponding to a redshift of z=2.14.
3. GRB 001025 was detected by the RXTE All-Sky Monitor on 2000 October 25 and lasted for approximately 15-20 seconds. The optical afterglow of GRB 001025 has never been detected, making it a ""dark"" GRB. XMM-Newton observed the location of GRB 001025 starting 1.9 days after the burst and detected two X-ray sources in the error box.
4. The X-ray light curve of GRB 011211 can be fit with a power-law decay or an exponential decay, and its spectrum can be described as a simple power law with a photon index of 2.16. No significant spectral evolution was found during the observation. The X-ray afterglow luminosity of GRB 011211 is 2x10^47 erg/s in the rest frame at z=2.14.

2. The Dirac cones in ai3 are tilted and anisotropic, and its average Fermi velocity is about ten times smaller than that of graphene. This smaller Fermi velocity suggests a stronger influence of electronic correlations, which could lead to the study of strongly-correlated Dirac fermions.
3. Additionally, ai3 has recently been found to contain additional massive carriers near the Fermi level. However, the interaction between these massive carriers and the massless Dirac fermions has not been experimentally confirmed.
4. Under high but experimentally accessible pressure, a topological merging of Dirac points is expected. In this study, we present magneto-transport measurements of ai3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure larger than 3 gpa, where Dirac carriers are present.
5. Our measurements confirm the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and reveal the presence of low-mobility massive holes, in agreement with recent band-structure calculations. The interplay between these two carrier types is the main result of our study.
6. The measured mobilities for the two carrier types suggest scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers. The analysis of our data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity and is similar to the one presented in ref. for multi-carrier semiconductor systems.
7. The single crystals of ai3 used in our study have been synthesized by electro-crystallization and have a typical size of 4 x 1 x 0.6 mm. Six nm thick gold contacts were deposited on both sides of the sample, allowing for simultaneous longitudinal and transverse resistivity measurements.

The resistivities were measured using a low-frequency ac lock-in technique, and hydrostatic pressure was applied at room temperature in a nicral clamp cell using daphne 7373 silicone oil as the pressure transmitting medium. The pressure was determined at room temperature using a manganine resistance gauge located in the pressure cell close to the sample",0
111,"1. Fe-based superconductors (FEBS) are a non-cuprate class of high-temperature superconductors with an unconventional superconducting state, the origin of which is still debated. FEBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides.
2. The Fermi surface (FS) in FEBS is formed by Fe-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the Γ point and two electron sheets around the M and X points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
3. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure. The RPA-SF approach suggests an extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets as the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations.
4. Orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have sign-preserving s-wave symmetry. Probing the gap structure can help elucidate the underlying mechanism. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for this purpose, as the measured dynamical spin susceptibility in the superconducting state carries information about the gap structure.
5. There have been many reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems, appearing only for specific q-vectors. The common explanation is that the peak is the spin resonance appearing due to the s± state.
6. However, recent ARPES results and measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy show that there are at least two distinct gaps present in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LiFeAs.
7. The existence of the smaller gap raises the question of what the spin resonance frequency would be in a system with two distinct gaps. The naive expectation is that the frequency shifts to the lower gap scale, but this may not always be the case.
8. The peak in the INS in the BaCo122 system at a frequency above the naively expected spin resonance frequency could be coming from the s± state, where it forms at frequencies above the indirect gap due to the redistribution of the spectral weight upon entering the superconduct",0
112,"1. The presence of impurities can significantly alter the properties of a quantum system, including its coherence and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, if the impurity distribution is completely random, all states of the system are exponentially localized in one and two dimensions. However, a mobility edge exists in three dimensions, where some states can become delocalized.
2. If the impurity positions are correlated, as is the case with a minimum distance between impurities, some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum. This has been demonstrated in one dimension in the context of the random dimer model (RDMD) and the dual random dimer model (DRDMD). The effects of correlated disorder have been studied in various physical contexts in one dimension.
3. In two dimensions, the effect of correlations is less explored, except for the case of a speckle potential and for the case of pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions. Correlations in speckle potentials can mimic the presence of a mobility edge, but in the thermodynamic limit, all states are localized. Random dimers introduce a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2D lattices, as in one dimension.
4. From a statistical point of view, the main difference between these two models is the decay of the correlation function, which is algebraic for the first and exponential for the second. This ""short-range"" feature of the random dimer model is at the basis of the delocalization mechanism.
5. In interacting systems, the presence of disordered impurities gives rise to a remarkable richness of phenomena. For instance, the condensate and the superfluid fraction are modified by the presence of disorder, which can shift the onset of superfluidity and induce exotic phases such as the Bose glass.
6. In this work, the authors study the effect of a short-range correlated disorder on a Bose gas confined on a 2D square lattice. They introduce a 2D generalization of the DRDMD (2D-DRDMD), where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites.

The authors aim to find upper and lower bounds for the independence number (the size of a largest independent set) for this class of graphs. They focus on proving new bounds for even values of k, comparing them with previously existing bounds, and providing exact values for some pairs of p and k.
2. Additionally, the paper proves that the independence number of generalized Petersen graphs with a fixed k can be found in linear time, which is a special case of a more general theorem about graphs with bounded treewidth. The authors show that for every fixed k and any integer n, the treewidth of the generalized Petersen graph is bounded, and provide a tree decomposition of width O(k) for this graph. This allows them to solve the maximum independent set problem for generalized Petersen graphs with a fixed k in linear time using dynamic programming techniques.",1
114,"1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is often considered unconditionally secure, but in practice, it is difficult for devices to meet the requirements for security. Some attacks on QKD have been proposed and demonstrated successfully against practical QKD systems. To combat these attacks, countermeasures such as device-independent security proofs and experimental measures have been proposed.
2. A Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD) scheme has been proposed, where neither Alice nor Bob performs any measurement, but instead sends out quantum signals to a measurement unit (Mu). Mu can be an untrusted network administrator or relay, and can be under the control of an eavesdropper. After Alice and Bob send out signals, they wait for Mu's announcement of a successful detection and proceed to standard post-processing of their sifted data.
3. MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol and is remarkable because it removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing performance. It can cover about twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD, which is comparable to EPR-based QKD. The only assumption needed in MDIQKD is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is (almost) perfect and carefully characterized.
4. The characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit, as it involves the estimation of the response of the devices to unknown input signals sent from Eve. With MDIQKD, there is no need to worry about imperfections of Mu, and attention should be focused more on the imperfections of signal sources.
5. One important imperfection of the sources is the basis-dependent flaw, which stems from the discrepancy of the density matrices corresponding to the two bases in BB84 states. The security of standard BB84 with basis-dependent flaw has been analyzed, showing that it decreases the achievable distance. Therefore, to investigate the practicality of MDIQKD, the security of MDIQKD under the imperfection needs to be generalized.
6. In some situations, MDIQKD with phase encoding rather than polarization encoding may be necessary. Two schemes of phase encoding MDIQKD have been proposed, one employing phase locking of two separate laser sources and the other using the",0

While recent advances in instrumentation have enabled high-resolution imaging at certain wavelengths, the formation process remains uncertain, with two main competing models: accretion and mergers.
2. Recent observations of individual massive protostellar systems have uncovered keplerian disks surrounding four young stellar objects, which suggests an accretion formation scenario. Further discrimination between the two models is possible by examining the properties, particularly the young stellar populations, of hot molecular cores.
3. The mid-infrared (mir) window offers a powerful view of these regions, as the large column densities of material process stellar light to infrared wavelengths, and diffraction-limited observations are readily obtained. Recent observations indicate that class II methanol masers exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are generally either not associated or offset from UCHII regions.
4. A study by m05 found that maser sites with weak radio continuum flux are associated with massive, luminous, and deeply embedded cores, characterizing protoclusters of young massive (proto)stars in an earlier evolutionary stage than UCHII regions. However, the spatial resolution of the observations was too low to resolve the sources inside the clumps.
5. The study observed three of the m05 regions at high spatial resolution to uncover the embedded sources inside the cores at mir wavelengths. The data were obtained with Michelle on the 8-m Gemini North Telescope in queue mode, and the standard chop-nod technique was used to minimize off-field contamination.
6. The resulting deconvolutions showed multiple point sources at close angular separations, which could be physically bound in a keplerian orbit. However, the maximum proper motions of such stars would be too small to be detected on short temporal baselines, and the mass distribution of stars is generally well described as a power law through the initial mass function (IMF). The likelihood of forming the most massive stars in a cluster can be estimated based on the gas mass available and the star formation efficiency (SFE).",0
116,"1. The text discusses the use of modified theories of gravity to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, with a focus on the Lovelock theory of gravity and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The Gauss-Bonnet invariant is a quadratic curvature invariant that is a topological term in 4-dimensions and can be used to study the dynamics of gravitational systems in higher dimensions.
2. The text also introduces a modified theory of gravity known as ""f(R,T)"" gravity, which is a generalization of the Einstein-Hilbert action that includes an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. This theory is used to study the curvature-matter coupling and the resulting non-geodesic motion of massive test particles.
3. The text also discusses the reconstruction technique, which can be used to find the form of the function f(R,T) that reproduces a given cosmic evolutionary history. The stability of cosmic evolutionary models in modified theories of gravity is also discussed, with a focus on the reconstruction and stability of power-law solutions in Horava-Lifshitz gravity.",1
117,"1. Majorana fermions (MFs) are real solutions of the Dirac equation that are their own antiparticles. They were originally proposed as a model for neutrinos but have recently been predicted to occur as quasiparticle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems. MFs obey non-Abelian statistics, making them promising for decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.
2. The possibility of hosting MFs in exotic solid-state systems has focused on topological superconductors. Various platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains, have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect. However, experimentally observing the unique Majorana signatures is still challenging.
3. MFs are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs). ZBPs have been observed in semiconductor nanowires, interpreted as signatures of MFs. However, other mechanisms, such as the Kondo resonance and disorder or band bending in the nanowire, can also cause ZBPs, making it difficult to distinguish MFs from conventional fermionic subgap states.
4. To obtain definitive signatures of MFs, alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFs are necessary. Here, an alternative all-optical scheme to detect MFs is proposed. This scheme benefits from recent advances in nanotechnology and nanofabrication, utilizing quantum dots (QDs) and nanomechanical resonators (NRS) as hybrid systems.
5. The hybrid QD-NRS system can enhance the coherent optical properties, providing an alternative ultrasensitive detection means. The QD is modeled as a two-level system, and the NRS is characterized by a quantum harmonic oscillator. The coupling between the resonator mode and the QD is described by deformation potential coupling.
6. The qd-mf coupling is introduced to describe MFs, and the hamiltonian is rewritten in the regular fermion representation. The qd-mf coupling gives the energy of MFs and the coupling between the nearby MF and the QD. The optical pump-probe technology is applied to the QD of the hybrid QD-NRS system,",0

119,"1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by the absence of hydrogen and strong silicon lines in their spectra at maximum brightness. They are useful as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies due to their high luminosity and uniform light curves.
2. A plausible explosion model for SNe Ia is the accreting white dwarf (WD) model, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from a companion star and explodes when its mass reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit. Recent progress in the accreting WD model includes the introduction of stellar wind from the WD, which helps sustain stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
3. The accreting WD model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. These paths determine the type of companion stars that lead to SNe Ia. However, this evolutionary scenario has not been confirmed by observations.
4. A group claimed to have identified a G2IV star as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) by measuring the velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the SNR's center. They argued that the G2IV star was moving much faster than other neighboring stars and that its distance was consistent with the distance to Tycho's SNR.
5. However, the observed velocity of the G2IV star could also correspond to the velocity of stars belonging to the thick disk population, and the expected stellar mass in thick disk stars within the relevant angular distance from the center of Tycho's SNR is only 2. Therefore, confirmation by other means is necessary.
6. To prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta, a direct method is proposed. Observations of a star called S-M star near a Type Ia SNR 1006 suggest that it is located behind the SNR ejecta, as broad wings are observed in both blue and red sides of the absorption lines. When a star is inside the ejecta of SNe Ia, photons emitted from the star are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward us, resulting in a broad wing present only in the blue side.

120,"1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource that can be manipulated and characterized independently of its physical realization, and obeys a set of conservation laws. It is useful in making quantitative predictions and is regarded as a physical resource. When one has complete information about a bipartite system, the state of the system is pure and there exists a well-established measure of entanglement, the entropy of entanglement, evaluated as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix. However, when quantum systems in nature interact with their environment, the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear.
2. Given an ensemble of pure states with probabilities, a natural generalization of the entropy of entanglement is its weighted average. However, a difficulty arises when one considers that a given density operator may be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for this average entanglement. This problem has led to the proposal of various measures to circumvent this issue, such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation, which satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure set out by Horodecki et al.
3. The entanglement of formation is defined as the minimal amount of entanglement required to form the density operator, while the entanglement of distillation is the guaranteed amount of entanglement that can be extracted from the density operator. These measures give the value zero for certain states, which might be thought counterintuitive, but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state. The problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system is therefore one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment, which is complex and unknown.
4. To characterize the entanglement in a more complete way, Nha and Carmichael recently introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based upon quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics. This approach considers the way in which information about the system is read from the environment, and the evolution of the system conditioned on the measurement record is followed. The entanglement measure is then contextual and dependent upon the kind of measurements made. This idea is applied to the continuous measurement limit, where the system executes a conditional evolution over time, and is used to analyze the entanglement dynamics of a cascaded qubit system coupled through",0
121,"1. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are classified as Type 1 or Type 2 based on the presence or absence of broad emission lines, which is attributed to orientation-dependent circumnuclear obscuration by a dusty medium called the ""dust torus."" This torus absorbs UV/optical radiation and re-emits it in the infrared. Type 1 AGN show more near-IR emission than Type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity due to the face-on view of the torus exposing the innermost hot dust.
2. The anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared has implications for forming isotropic AGN samples based on IR fluxes. The wavelength dependence of this anisotropy can help distinguish between smooth and cloud-based torus models. High-spatial resolution observations or using high-luminosity objects can mitigate host galaxy contributions to the IR.
3. The paper uses a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared. Host-galaxy subtraction and clumpy torus models are employed for analysis. The average Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of obscured (Type 2) and unobscured (Type 1) AGN are presented.
4. The authors find that the anisotropy ratio between quasars and radio galaxies gradually decreases from 20 to 2 from 2 to 8 μm, with a slight increase around the silicate feature. The radio galaxies show more diversity in SED shapes than quasars, and the silicate feature in absorption is observed in radio galaxies, while quasars display a weak silicate emission feature.
5. The results suggest that the anisotropy in AGN emission is related to torus orientation, with a clumpy torus model being consistent with the observed anisotropy. The findings support the idea that the anisotropy is a measure of the intrinsic anisotropy of luminous Type 1 and Type 2 AGN. However, biases in flux-limited mid-IR selected samples and selection effects in the comparison between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN should be considered.",0
122,"1. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has achieved advancements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, with practical implementation systems demonstrating unconditional security. However, the traditional security analysis of the equivalent entanglement-based scheme only includes the signal beam and not the local oscillator (LO), leaving security loopholes. The fluctuations of LO intensity can be exploited by Eve, affecting the secret key rate.
2. In practical CVQKD systems, LO intensity is monitored by splitting a small part with a beam splitter, and pulses with large LO intensity fluctuation are discarded. However, the effect of small fluctuation on the secret key rate is not yet fully understood. Ideally, with a strong LO, a perfect pulsed balanced homodyne detector (BHD) measuring a weak signal would output results proportional to the signal's amplitude and phase. In a practical system, LO intensity fluctuates, affecting the BHD outputs and opening a loophole for Eve.
3. The local oscillator intensity attack (LOIA) is an eavesdropping strategy where Eve intercepts the LO and replaces the quantum channel between Alice and Bob with her own perfect quantum channel, reducing the LO intensity to hide her attack. This can lead to an underestimation of Eve's intercepted information and enable her to get partial secret keys without being detected.
4. To ensure the security of CVQKD systems, accurate monitoring of LO intensity is essential. This involves scaling measurements with instantaneous intensity values of LO or the lowest intensity value if fluctuations are very small. However, using the average intensity value to normalize measurements is not recommended, as it could overestimate the secret key rate. Additionally, highly accurate monitoring of LO is a challenge, especially for reverse reconciliation communication over long distances with very small fluctuation of LO.",0
123,"1. The code for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models was developed with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy. Although simplicity is less evident due to the long development period, the code offers flexibility in integration methods and the ability to determine all frequencies of a given model within a specified range of degree and frequency. The choice of variables for describing the equilibrium model and oscillations was inspired by previous work.
2. The equilibrium model is defined in terms of a minimal set of dimensionless variables, as well as by mass and radius. The model file also defines mass, radius, central pressure and density, scaled second derivatives of pressure and density at the center, and the polytropic index for models with vanishing surface pressure. The code can handle both complete stellar models and envelope models with arbitrary inner boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are obtained from a series expansion, a simple condition of vanishing Lagrangian pressure perturbation, or a condition between pressure perturbation and displacement by matching continuously to the solution in an isothermal atmosphere.
3. The equations for adiabatic stellar oscillations are expressed in terms of specific variables, and the perturbation to the gravitational potential is considered. In the Cowling approximation, the perturbation to the gravitational potential is neglected. The dependent variables in the nonradial case are chosen to vary as a power of the distance from the center for large degree. A new set of dependent variables is introduced to accurately represent the variation in the large degree case. The equations are solved on the interval from the center to the outermost point, which is defined by the surface radius including the atmosphere.
4. The code uses two main techniques for solving the equations: a shooting method and a relaxation technique. The shooting method integrates solutions separately from the inner and outer boundary and matches them at a suitable inner fitting point, while the relaxation technique solves the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions using a relaxation technique. The eigenvalue is found by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point. The programme uses a standard secant technique to find the eigenfrequencies as the zeros of a smooth function of the eigenvalue.",0

2. Exceptionally huge HI arcs and loops, extending across several kiloparsecs, have been identified in edge-on spirals such as NGC 5775, NGC 4631, NGC 3044, and NGC 3556. These are interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like or circular appearance and either a wide velocity range or evidence for expansion in position-velocity space.
3. The two main classes of explanations for supershells propose their kinetic energy source to be internal or external to the parent galaxy. Internal source models involve starbursts, stellar winds, and supernova explosions, while external source models suggest infall of massive gas clouds onto the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies.
4. The main difficulty with the starburst model for HI supershells lies in the required input energies for the largest shells, which often need staggering numbers of supernova events. This energy deficit problem is exacerbated in external galaxies, where only the largest shells are observed.
5. Alternative explanations for HI supershells include gamma-ray bursts and infall of massive gas clouds. The latter resolves the energy problem since input energy is a function of the mass and velocity of the infalling cloud.
6. Recent observations reveal galaxies with extremely large HI supershells but no evidence for interaction or nearby companions, suggesting a new explanation for HI supershells.
7. The proposed explanation is that radio jets plow through the interstellar medium, accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles, providing an internal energy source for the HI shells and resolving the energy problem.
8. This scenario has implications for understanding the role of radio jets in galaxy evolution and the interaction between jets and the disk medium in both radio galaxies and normal spiral galaxies.",0

2. However, Baade noted differences between dSph galaxies and globular clusters, such as extreme red horizontal branches and distinct variable star characteristics.
3. The discovery of carbon stars in dSph galaxies led to the recognition of an intermediate-age population in these galaxies.
4. The CMDs of several dSph galaxies, such as Carina, Fornax, Leo I, and others, show evidence of an intermediate-age population.
5. An old stellar population, traced by a horizontal branch (HB), is observed in all Milky Way dSph galaxy satellites, except Leo I.
6. Leo I is peculiar, with a well-populated red clump (RC) but no evident HB, suggesting a delayed first substantial amount of star formation compared to other dSph galaxies.
7. Leo I's large galactocentric radial velocity and its distance from the Milky Way suggest it may not be bound to the Milky Way.
8. Leo I's morphology and lack of detectable HI make it a dSph galaxy, but it lacks a conspicuous old population and has a larger fraction of intermediate-age and young population than other dSph galaxies.
9. The star formation in Leo I seems to have proceeded until almost the present time without intense, distinct bursts.
10. Further observations are needed to characterize the variable-star population in Leo I, search for rr Lyrae variable stars, and determine whether the HB is missing in the outer parts of Leo I.",1

The authors consider a bounded, regular open set Ω and a bounded, n-dimensional vector field X that is divergence-free in the sense of distributions. They study the principal eigenpair (λ, φ) corresponding to the Dirichlet problem of the operator L = Δ + X.
2. The authors prove that λ remains bounded as t → ∞ if and only if there exists a first integral of X, denoted by ψ, that satisfies certain conditions. Intuitively, functions ψ satisfying these conditions are constant along the flow of the vector field X. The existence of non-trivial first integrals allows for flow lines that are contained in Ω, while the absence of such ψ implies that the flow leaves Ω with speed proportional to dist(x, ∂Ω).
3. The authors discuss the implications of their result in the context of a compact, connected Riemannian manifold and provide a sufficient and necessary condition for λ to remain bounded as t → ∞ in terms of the eigenspaces of the advection operator A.
4. The main goal of the paper is to verify a similar property of the principal eigenvalue when the classical Laplacian is replaced by the fractional Laplacian (−Δ)^α with α ∈ (0, 2). The authors define the set of all nonzero first integrals in the Sobolev space H^s(Ω) equipped with the norm coming from the Dirichlet form of (−Δ)^α.
5. The authors face difficulties in their development due to the roughness of general elements of H^s(Ω) and the non-locality of (−Δ)^α. To overcome these challenges, they use conditioning suggested by Bogdan and Dyda, approximation techniques for flows from DiPerna and Lions, and properties of the Green function and heat kernel of gradient perturbations of (−Δ)^α obtained by Bogdan, Jakubowski, and Chen et al.

2. The cold dark matter cosmological model, which includes dark energy, is successful in describing the growth of structure in the universe, but a direct detection of dark matter particles is still lacking.
3. Some authors have proposed models with a large component of baryonic dark matter, including the possibility of cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds.
4. A major prediction of models featuring dense gas clouds is gamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray interactions, which could contribute significantly to the diffuse flux in the galactic plane.
5. Previous investigations have neglected self-shielding and cascade phenomena, which can alter the emergent gamma-ray spectrum and are relevant to the observed excess galactic flux above 1 GeV.

They can also be used as model systems to study phase transitions and freezing in condensed matter. Recently, it has been shown that the lattice spacing in quasi-2D colloidal crystals can be controlled using a coplanar rotating electric field. This is due to the time-averaging effect of a rapidly rotating field on relatively large particles, leading to circularly symmetric attractions in the plane of the electric field.
2. In this study, the authors use a simple numerical treatment to predict the lattice spacing in a quasi 2D crystal from the electric field strength. They consider a model system of charged colloids in a rotating electric field and combine experimental measurements of the crystal lattice constant as a function of field strength with Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations are based on a screened Coulomb repulsion plus dipolar attraction, where the only fitting parameter is the Debye screening length.
3. The authors find that the simple numerical treatment provides a reasonable description of the system, and that the minimum in the effective potential can be used as a measure of the lattice constant of the crystalline rafts. They also note that deviations from pairwise additivity have been measured in the case of strongly charged colloids and repulsive dipolar interactions, and that many-body effects can lead to a density-dependence in the effective colloid-colloid interactions. However, these effects are neglected in the present work.",0
131,"1. AQL X-1 is a soft X-ray transient (SXRT) that shows properties similar to persistent low mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star when in outburst. The large variations in accretion rate during outbursts allow for the investigation of regimes for neutron stars that are inaccessible in persistent systems. However, the origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in the quiescent state of several SXRTs, including AQL X-1, remains unclear. An intriguing possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) turns on during quiescence, providing a link between persistent low mass X-ray binaries and recycled MSPs.
2. AQL X-1 is the most active SXRT known, with more than 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts detected so far. The outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with type I X-ray bursts discovered during the declining phase, indicating the presence of a neutron star. The X-ray luminosity during outbursts is in the range of 10^36-10^37 erg/s, while in quiescence, it is around 10^33 erg/s. The X-ray spectrum during outbursts is soft, but it changes to a power law with a photon index of ~2 when the luminosity drops below a certain level.
3. The sharp decrease in flux leading to the quiescent state of AQL X-1 is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts. However, there are differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra between the two cases, likely resulting from the different efficiencies in gravitational energy release between white dwarfs and neutron stars. Models of low mass X-ray transient outbursts hosting an old neutron star or a black hole are built in analogy with dwarf novae outbursts, but important differences exist in the outburst evolution.

However, strange spectral features and their evolutions were reported, including a bright blue continuum in the optical spectrum at early epochs.
2. The optical light curve (LC) showed a rapid decline from 50 days after the discovery, while near-infrared (NIR) emissions brightened. The NIR brightness increased from 11 to 12 days after the discovery and then declined. The NIR brightening, as well as the fact that the redder side of the He emission profile declined faster than the bluer side, has been interpreted as evidence of an ongoing dust formation.
3. The IR spectroscopy and photometries are obtained with the AZT-24 and Magnum telescopes (NIR photometries) and the AKARI satellite (NIR spectroscopy and MIR photometries). The IR emission considerably contributes to the bolometric luminosity of SN 2006jc.
4. The mir observation is available at 33 days, and the IR luminosity integrated over 8 μm is estimated from the NIR and MIR observations as 1.1 × 10^43 ergs s^-1. The IR emission is originated from amorphous carbon grains with two temperatures of 1800 K and 320 K.
5. The hot carbon dust is suggested to be newly formed in the SN ejecta and heated by the 44Ti-44Co decay by a dust formation calculation. The origin of the emission from the warm carbon dust is suggested to be a SN light echo of the CSM carbon dust.
6. The X-ray emission, as well as the early bright blue continuum and the narrow lines, clearly indicates an interaction between the SN ejecta and the CSM. The IR spectral energy distribution may be explained by the formation of amorphous carbon grains in the SN ejecta and the CSM.

The extinction curve describes how extinction changes with wavelength and is used to deredden magnitudes and colors of astronomical objects and understand the physical properties of dust grains. Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (CCM) derived a mean extinction law that depends on one parameter, R(V). This law allows for the determination of extinction in one spectral region based on the extinction in a different spectral region, given R(V). The CCM law is widely used to study extinction, with various authors searching for relations between R(V) and other extinction curve parameters, studying its role in regulating radiation penetration in dark clouds, and deriving new estimates of the extinction law in terms of R(V).
2. Fitzpatrick (GS) applied a chi-square minimization to compute R(V) values for a sample of stars with UV extinction data using the linear relation from the CCM law. This method was extended to obtain improved R(V) values for a sample of stars with known extinction data in the UV. The determination of R(V) values is important for understanding the properties of interstellar dust grains and the distribution of dust in the galaxy. The authors use data from the CCDM catalog of ultraviolet color excesses for stars of spectral types B7 and earlier, and compute R(V) and E(B-V) values for their sample using the CCM law and the GS method. They find that the distribution of R(V) values is relatively narrow, with a mean value of 3.1, and that there is some sky anisotropy in the distribution of R(V) values. The authors also consider the effects of systematic errors in the determination of R(V) due to the use of different calibrations of E(B-V).",0

2. The ranking arrangement is shown to contain the exceptional arrangement and a pure codimension 1 arrangement.
3. The exceptional arrangement is described as the union of translates of linear subspaces spanned by faces of the matrix.
4. The ranking slabs of a weakly toric module are defined as strata in the coarsest stratification that respects certain arrangements.
5. The closure of each ranking slab is the translate of a linear subspace of the matrix that is generated by a face of the matrix.

136,"1. Quantum computers can perform certain algorithms much faster than classical computers, such as Shor's algorithm for factorizing numbers, using qubits and quantum logical gates.
2. Semiconductor quantum dots with controlled electron numbers are promising candidates for realizing qubits, which can be encoded using electron charge or spin.
3. Spin qubits have longer decoherence times and can be manipulated using electron spin resonance and read out via currents in spin-polarized leads.
4. An alternative concept for encoding qubits is based on singlet-triplet states in a double quantum dot, which can be controlled electronically without the need for a magnetic field.
5. Decoherence-free subspaces in multi-quantum dot systems have been proposed as a way to protect qubits from decoherence processes, and recent experimental efforts have shown promising results.
6. The symmetry of triangular molecular magnets and spin configurations can be influenced by electric fields, and this effect has been studied in the context of encoding qubits in triangular triple quantum dots.
7. A new detection method for reading out qubit states, based on a doublet blockade effect, has been proposed, which is compatible with electrical manipulations of the qubit.
8. The dynamics of qubits in the presence of decoherence processes caused by interaction with electrodes has been analyzed, and a new method for read-out of the qubit state by current measurement in the doublet blockade regime has been proposed.",1
137,"1. Symbiotic systems (SS) typically consist of a white dwarf (WD), a red giant (RG) star, and circumbinary nebulae. The nebulae emit radiation across a wide frequency range, from radio to X-rays.
2. The Z Andromedae (Z And) binary system, composed of a cool giant and a hot compact component, has shown periods of activity since 1915, including nonuniform eruptions and classical outbursts. Some outbursts occur in pairs or as a series of eruptions with decreasing maximum brightness and different shapes.
3. The 1984-1986 event in Z And is particularly interesting due to its double-peaked structure and low brightness. This event can be explained by the collision of the WD wind with two ejected shells from the RG, causing a drop in the ionization parameter.
4. The minimum between the two peaks is likely caused by the sudden increase in distance between the WD and the downstream nebula, preventing the WD blackbody flux from reaching the nebula. The solar relative abundance of Si/H suggests that grains did not have enough time to develop.
5. The outburst's brightness was exceptionally low, but it was monitored by spectral observations, allowing for detailed modeling of the system's physical conditions. The stellar wind of the cool giant has a velocity of ~25 km/s, and varying this velocity can change the accretion regime and increase the hydrogen burning rate.
6. Collision of the winds from the WD and RG leads to two shock fronts and an optical thick wind from the WD. This wind is revealed by observations of UV and optical spectra during the 2000-2002 outburst.
7. The shocks from the wind collision increase the luminosity of the system, and the absence of evidence for an accretion disk at the 1984-1986 epoch suggests collision episodes.
8. The trend of the spectral observations between 1978 and 1993 provides insight into the 1984-1986 outburst in the context of a longer activity period. The oi 1305 resonance line may be blended with an upper ionization level",0
138,"1. Swcnt networks are emerging as novel electronic materials, and their electrical properties are important for various applications. These networks can be viewed as a two-dimensional system of conducting one-dimensional rods, where the rods are either metallic or semiconducting with a large dimension ratio. The nanotube-nanotube junction resistance is much larger than the nanotube resistance, leading to a system with randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport. For sub-monolayer networks, the junction resistance dominates the overall resistance and shows percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence. For swcnt networks with thickness in the tens of nanometers, the conductance through the metallic tubes dominates the conduction, leading to metallic behavior of the overall resistance.
2. The frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity have been investigated for individual swcnt and some types of swcnt networks. For swcnt networks with 30 nm thickness, the ac conductivity is frequency-independent up to an onset frequency of about 10 ghz, beyond which it increases with an approximate power law behavior. For thicker films with thickness in the range of tens of micrometers, the conductivities at dc and 10 ghz are almost the same. The nonlinearity of the electric field-dependent conductivity has been observed in relatively thick nanotube networks, and the charge carriers can be localized by disorder in the swcnts with an approximate length scale of 1.65m.
3. There is a lack of frequency and electric field dependent conductivity investigation for systematic variation of network densities, and also there is no correlation study between the onset frequency and the length scale determined from nonlinear transport. The frequency- and electric field-dependent conductivity investigation of different network densities is important for the sake of applications of these networks, such as high-speed transistors, transparent shielding materials, and interconnects in circuits. Swcnt networks on polyethylene terephthalate (pet) substrate are prepared by the spraying method, and the network density is controlled by the solution concentration and spraying time.

139,"1. Quantum algorithms, specifically Grover's algorithm, can perform certain tasks more efficiently than classical algorithms due to quantum superposition and interference. Grover's algorithm can search an unsorted database with a quadratic advantage over classical methods. It has been realized using various physical systems, including superconducting qubits in cavity QED.
2. The proposed implementation of the three-qubit Grover search algorithm aims to use four-level superconducting qubits (SQUIDs) in cavity QED. This approach features a three-qubit phase gate, which reduces the number of required quantum gates. The scheme is based on resonant and off-resonant interactions of the cavity field with SQUID transitions and microwave pulses, without requiring adjustments to level spacing or identical coupling constants.
3. The implementation of the three-qubit Grover search involves preparing input basis states in a superposition state, inverting the phase of the desired basis state, and inverting all basis states about the average. The three-qubit controlled phase gate simplifies the implementation and reduces the probability of error compared to using a series of two-qubit gates.
4. The proposed implementation considers the effects of spontaneous decay and cavity decay, as well as the influence of unwanted off-resonant interaction during gate implementation. The results show that the marked state can be searched with high fidelity even in the presence of imperfections in the system. The proposed scheme is faster and more robust than previous approaches, making it a promising candidate for practical quantum computing applications.",0
140,"1. In the 1970s, many-body theory flourished, with many researchers focusing on many-body effects on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra from deep core levels in metals.
2. Related effects included singularities near edges in absorption and emission spectra, caused by conduction-band electrons having various effects on the XPS peak from the core level.
3. If the excitation is adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by conduction-band electrons leads to a shift in the peak to higher kinetic energy (lower binding energy of the core level).
4. However, if the excitation is swift and non-adiabatic, the core hole screening results in a non-equilibrium state for the conduction-band electrons, leading to shake-up effects.
5. These shake-up effects show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum, with the main peak at the adiabatic position and subsequent replicas shifted to lower kinetic energy according to the plasma frequency.
6. In a metal, single-particle excitations can also occur, leading to a deformation and low-energy tail in both the main peak and plasmon replicas.
7. Finite core-hole life-time causes Lorentzian broadening, while experimental uncertainties result in Gaussian broadening of all peaks.
8. In graphene, the low-energy tailing is a characteristic of a metallic system and can be used to determine the core-hole position in a complex sample.
9. In pristine graphene, the chemical potential is not inside an energy band or a band-gap, resulting in a unique system with a low-energy tailing, while doped graphene exhibits collective excitations that contribute to the tail, making quantitative interpretation of graphene core-hole spectra challenging.",0

2. Genotypes, representing an individual's genetic makeup, have a fitness value that determines their expected number of offspring.
3. Frequency-dependent selection, where an individual's fitness depends on interactions with others, has been observed in natural systems.
4. Theoretical and computational studies have used interaction matrices from game theory to model these complex interactions.
5. Nonlinear dependencies in fitness have been observed in experiments, but their impact on coevolutionary dynamics has not been studied.
6. The authors show that nonlinear frequency dependence may induce new stable configurations in evolutionary dynamics.
7. They also investigate the impact of asymmetric mutation probabilities, which was neglected in most models.
8. The study uses the Moran process, a well-established model for evolutionary dynamics, to derive the stationary probability distribution of the system.
9. The authors find that nonlinear frequency dependence and asymmetric mutation probabilities can lead to complex evolutionary dynamics.",1
142,"1. The phase-field method is a popular tool for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity, which avoids tracking moving solid-liquid interfaces or grain boundaries by describing the geometry in terms of one or more phase fields.
2. The phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods. However, the detailed properties of the equations, which are necessary for quantitative simulations, are not always apparent and can be quite involved to analyze.
3. Several challenges and limitations arise in phase-field modeling, such as the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models, the use of orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification, and the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations.
4. The thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness, and the currently available approaches have limitations.
5. Orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification often use a standard equation of motion that is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
6. The inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is challenging, and the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
7. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been greatly enhanced in the last decade, but to be useful for simulating microstructure formation in solidification, phase-field models need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of the physical solid-liquid interfaces and the typical scale of the microstructures.
8. This is achieved by increasing the interface width in the model, sometimes by several orders of magnitude, which magnifies any physical effect that is due to the diffuseness of the interface.
9. To guarantee precise simulations, all these effects have to be controlled and, if possible, eliminated. The so-called ""thin-interface limit"" is used to achieve this by analyzing the equations of the phase-field model under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale present in the problem.",0
143,"1. The fundamental atmospheric and physical parameters of stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and age, are crucial for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group. With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, these parameters are used to infer the characteristics of different populations of stars in the Milky Way. Stellar parameters determined by spectroscopic methods are of key importance, as they allow for accurate metallicity measurements and avoid the problem of reddening inherent in photometry. Spectroscopic parameters can be used alone or in combination with photometric information to fit individual stars to theoretical isochrones or evolutionary tracks to determine the stellar mass, age, and distance of a star.
2. A common method for deriving the spectroscopic atmospheric parameters is to use the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). However, both observational and theoretical evidence suggests that systematic biases are present within such analyses due to the breakdown of the assumption of LTE. More recently, it has been shown that non-LTE (NLTE) effects can have substantial impacts on the determination of surface gravity and metallicity, particularly at low metallicity and/or surface gravity. Therefore, it is important to develop sophisticated methods that reconcile these effects in order to derive accurate spectroscopic parameters. This is the first in a series of papers that aim to determine the fundamental parameters of FGK stars and study the chemical and dynamical properties of the different stellar populations of the Milky Way.",0
144,"1. Weak gravitational lensing, a phenomenon caused by the bending of light around massive structures, has been detected in various cosmic sources such as high redshift quasars (QSOs), intermediate redshift galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It can manifest as angular correlations between these sources and foreground mass inhomogeneities or as a coherent shear effect in the case of galaxies.

2. Another way to detect weak lensing is through the fluxes of standard candles, like Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which are excellent cosmological distance indicators. If the observed magnitudes of SNe Ia are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen as brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess, while fainter ones have mass deficits in their foregrounds.

3. Although weak lensing effects are currently estimated to be small for SNe Ia, they are predicted to be non-negligible for higher redshift sources. The highest redshift SNe Ia, like SN1997ff, have been examined for weak lensing effects due to galaxies along the line of sight. Present-day high-redshift SNe Ia samples, however, are dominated by lower redshift SNe Ia and have not been thoroughly examined for lensing effects.

4. The main goal of the study described in the text is to determine if the observed fluxes of cosmologically distant SNe Ia have suffered significantly from lensing-induced (de-)amplifications. The study uses a large, homogeneous compilation of 74 SNe Ia and estimates distances to the SNe using four different light curve fitting methods.

5. The analysis presented in the text yields values for global cosmological parameters, which are used in the study's analysis. As tracers of foreground mass density, the study uses APM galaxies, which provide near-full coverage of the sky in the northern and southern hemispheres. The study focuses on the central regions of APM plates and uses a sample of 55 SNe Ia, after excluding those that fell in the gaps between plates.",0
145,"1. The text discusses the behavior of lanthanide-based heavy fermion (HF) metals, which exhibit distinct physical properties due to strong spin-flip scattering from localized levels, leading to a large effective mass and low-energy scale indicative of strong interactions. At low temperatures, HF metals transition from a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid state to incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering, before displaying clean metallic behavior.
2. Theoretical treatments of HF metals often rely on the Periodic Anderson Model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo Lattice Model. However, the absence of exact results has prompted the search for approximation schemes, such as Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). DMFT becomes momentum-independent and spatially local in the large-dimensional limit, mapping lattice models onto an effective single-impurity model with a self-consistently determined host.
3. To determine the extent to which DMFT captures the properties of real HF materials, a method to solve the PAM is required. Various techniques have been employed, including Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG), Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), Exact Diagonalization, Finite-Order Perturbation Theory, Iterated Perturbation Theory, the Non-Crossing Approximation, Average Matrix Approximation, Large-N Mean Field Theory/Slave Bosons, Gutzwiller Variational Approach, and the Local Moment Approach (LMA).
4. The LMA, a non-perturbative technique, introduces the concept of local moments and a two-self-energy description, capturing correlated spin-flip dynamics in a straightforward manner. It has been successful in describing dynamics in the single-impurity Anderson model and static magnetic properties in the PAM. The LMA has been extended to the Anderson lattice, providing a rich description of transport and optical properties, particularly in the strong coupling regime.
5. The hamiltonian for the PAM includes uncorrelated conduction and correlated f-levels, with site energies, nearest-neighbor hopping matrix elements, on-site Coulomb repulsion, and local hybridization. The model is characterized by four independent dimensionless parameters, with an equivalent set of bare/material parameters. The system generally exhibits metallic behavior,",0
146,"1. The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied for many years and is particularly important in biology. DNA loop formation is crucial for genetic expression, replication, and recombination. For example, in E. coli, the Lac repressor (Laci)-mediated loop is essential for the repressive regulation of Lac genes. Hairpin loop formation is the elementary step in protein folding and structure formation in RNA folding. A cell is crowded with various subcellular structures, and DNA is constantly interacting with them. DNA fragments about to loop are often subject to temporally fluctuating forces due to their dynamic environment, including other parts of the chain.
2. Recent experiments have shown that the power spectrum of the fluctuating force exerted on the cytoskeleton is an order of magnitude larger than expected from thermal equilibrium conditions. This indicates that the cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium. Single molecule experiment techniques have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation. For instance, Finzi and Gelles observed Laci-mediated DNA loop formation and dissociation by monitoring the nanoscale Brownian motion of a micron-sized particle attached to one end of the DNA.
3. Theoretically, Yan et al. developed a transfer matrix method to calculate the semiflexible polymer end-to-end distance distribution function and loop formation probability. They studied various effects of nonlinear elasticity arising from DNA bending protein-induced kinks or thermal-fluctuation-induced bubbles on the loop formation probability. Their study provides valuable insights into DNA bending on a short length scale, which has attracted much attention recently.
4. Blumberg et al. studied the effects of static tension on protein-mediated DNA loop formation by modeling the DNA conformation to be either one of two states, looped and unlooped states. They found that for loop sizes larger than 100 base pair distances, a tension of 0.5 pN can increase the looping time by more than two orders of magnitude. However, there is room for improvement in their approach, such as evaluating the free energy that can be valid for short end-to-end distances of the chain and describing detailed kinetic processes using the mean first-passage time approach.",0
147,"1. Tidal interactions in close binary systems, such as star-star or star-planet systems, can lead to various phenomena like synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, disruption, and fall of an object onto the star. This paper investigates the tidal interaction of two bodies: a star and a point source, which can be a star or a planet.
2. The evolution time scales of the eccentricity or semimajor axis strongly depend on the orbital period of the binary system and can take values up to 108 yr or more for periods of about 5 days. As the star evolves, the orbital parameters change due to tidal interactions.
3. The study focuses on dynamical tides by taking into account the stellar evolution for three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses. The stars are considered without rotation and magnetic field, and the stellar physics is touched upon superficially.
4. The star of one solar mass at lifetimes of ~10^3 yr closely corresponds to our sun and has a radiative core and a convective envelope on the main sequence. The other two stars of one and a half and two solar masses are more massive and have a more complex structure with a convective core and a radiative envelope on the main sequence.
5. The problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star-planet system. The low-frequency g-modes of the stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides.
6. Tidal interactions are intense at small periastron distances of the planet. For a periastron distance of ~0.04 AU, the dimensionless excitation frequency is ~10^-4, which corresponds to g-modes.
7. A large number of exoplanets in stellar systems have been discovered, including short-period massive planets with an orbital period of a few days, known as hot jupiters. The results of this paper can be directly applied to some of these systems.
8. The paper discusses the possibility of a planet falling onto the star due to quasi-static tides and provides a plot showing the threshold as a function of planetary mass and orbital period. The tidal quality factor",0

2. Early work in nano-optics focused on near-field optical microscopy, but recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have pushed the resolution of far-field imaging down to the nanometer range.
3. These subwavelength imaging methods rely on the accurate localization of individual fluorescent markers, which are isolated based on their optical characteristics or by selective activation.
4. The location of an isolated fluorescent marker is limited only by photon noise, not the diffraction barrier.
5. A key issue affecting these subwavelength imaging methods is the optical transparency of the media surrounding the light emitters.
6. Fluorescence microscopy provides noninvasive imaging of the interior of cells and allows the detection of specific cellular constituents through fluorescence tagging.
7. However, certain biological tissues or soft-matter systems can appear turbid due to intense scattering of photons, which can produce a blurred image with no apparent information about the source position.
8. Techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used to measure the distance between individual nano-objects without imaging their position.
9. The paper proposes a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment, based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light.
10. This approach could be useful for sensing conformational changes in biomolecules in living tissues, and could provide an alternative to green function retrieval techniques based on the correlations of ambient noise.",1
149,"1. The text discusses the use of the wormlike chain (WLC) model to describe the mechanics of an isolated semiflexible polymer in an isothermal viscous solvent. The WLC model assumes that the polymer is a flexible rod with a persistence length that determines its bending stiffness. The model can be extended to include the effects of interactions with the surrounding network, such as excluded volume interactions or sticky contacts, by altering the mode relaxation spectrum. This extended version of the WLC model can be used to study the mechanical properties of networks of semiflexible polymers, which are important in many biological contexts.
2. The text also discusses the use of the glassy wormlike chain (GWL) model, which is a phenomenological extension of the WLC model that includes the effects of self-avoidance and other non-linearities. The GWL model can be used to describe the viscoelastic behavior of biopolymer networks over a wide range of time scales with a minimum of parameters. However, recent studies have shown that the mechanical response of living cells is more complex than simple viscoelasticity, and may also exhibit glassy, fragile, and inelastic behavior.
3. The text presents a theoretical framework for modeling the inelastic nonlinear mechanical behavior of sticky biopolymer networks. The framework is based on a mean-field description of the polymer network as a test polymer with a dynamically evolving thermodynamic state variable that characterizes the network of thermo-reversible sticky bonds. The model can predict a pronounced fluidization response, which develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers. The theory is in qualitative agreement with experimental results obtained for living cells, and a more quantitative comparison with dedicated measurement results for cells and in vitro biopolymer networks will be the subject of future work.",0
150,"1. Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with non-trivial topological invariants and robust surface metallic states, typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction. However, all known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements, which poses constraints on the search for topological materials. A proposed solution is to generate effective spin-orbit couplings from ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons.
2. An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been proposed to generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI). However, realizing this proposed topological phase in real materials or theoretical models has proven challenging due to competing orders and quantum fluctuations.
3. A study found that reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones tends to stabilize the TMI in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. By suppressing the Fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the TMI emerges in an extended parameter region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking even when many-body and quantum fluctuations are taken into account.",0

2. The realization of a gate-induced band gap in bilayer graphene brought the possibility of a graphene-based transistor closer to reality. However, the sub-gap conductance measured in these experiments, which had weak temperature dependence and was large compared to the optically measured gap, introduced a new puzzle.
3. The gapped bilayer was not as insulating as it should be, and dominant transport along the physical edge of the samples, which had been proposed earlier, was ruled out by Corbino geometry measurements. These measurements observed two-dimensional variable range hopping type temperature dependence, independent of geometry.
4. In this paper, the authors predict the existence of a topological gapless channel of transport along a recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary network. This predicted topological edge state would be the first realization of a topological surface(edge) state hosted by a structural topological defect.
5. Although there has been much theoretical interest in topological gapless modes hosted by structural topological defects, none have been observed so far. Lattice dislocations in three-dimensional crystals, which occur deep in the sample and are not directly accessible, have been discussed previously.
6. The tilt boundary of interest is a structural topological line defect along which each neighboring layer is displaced by one inter-atomic spacing. It can occur due to the third dimension added by the stacking of the graphene layers and forms a boundary between two inequivalent stacking structures frequently referred to as AB and BA.
7. The authors show that the tilt boundaries host gapless modes of topological origin and form the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states. These findings have implications for the classification and understanding of topological insulators and superconductors, and may enable the detection and manipulation of topological edge states in graphene systems.",0

Polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes are classified based on the acidic or basic properties of their monomers. Polyelectrolytes have a single sign of charged monomers, while polyampholytes bear charged monomers of both signs. These charged polymers have numerous industrial and medical applications and are often water-soluble.
2. In a polyelectrolyte chain, intra-chain electrostatic interactions are repulsive and tend to swell the chain. In contrast, a polyampholyte chain has attractive interactions between charged monomers of opposite signs, which decrease the chain size. The behavior of a single polyampholyte and the solution of polyampholytes depends on the sequence of charged monomers on the chains.
3. The sequence of charged amino acids along ionically complementary peptides affects the aggregation behavior and self-assembling process in the solution of such peptides. Charged monomers sequence of charge-symmetric polyampholytes affects their adsorption properties to a charged surface.
4. Polymers anchored on a surface have great interest in industrial and biological applications. With a sufficiently strong repulsion between the polymers, the chains become stretched, forming a polymer brush. Planar and curved brushes formed by grafted homopolymers have been extensively investigated.
5. Anchored polymers of a brush may consist of charged monomers, forming a polyelectrolyte or a polyampholyte brush. In a brush of charged polymers, electrostatic interactions introduce additional length scales such as Bjerrum length and Debye screening length to the system.
6. In a polyelectrolyte brush, the repulsion of electrostatic origin between the chains can be sufficiently strong even at low grafting densities, making it easy for the system to access the brush regime. At high enough grafting densities and charge fractions of polyelectrolyte chains, most counterions are trapped inside the polyelectrolyte brush, and competition between osmotic pressure of the counterions and elasticity of the chains determines the brush thickness",0
153,"1. The light flavor scalar mesons present a challenge to the naive quark model, and their structures have not been definitively determined. Some candidates for these mesons are thought to be glueballs, molecular states, or tetraquark states. The mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 are good candidates for molecular states, but their counterparts @xmath7 and @xmath8 are more difficult to identify as such. There may be different dynamics that dominate the mesons below and above a certain energy, resulting in two scalar nonets below a certain energy. The strong attraction between diquark states in relative S-wave may result in a nonet of tetraquark states that manifest below a certain energy, while the conventional @xmath3 nonet has masses around @xmath18. The well-established @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath3 nonets with masses @xmath21 and @xmath22, respectively, lie in the same region. There are enough candidates for the @xmath17 @xmath3 nonet mesons, @xmath23, @xmath24, @xmath25, @xmath26, and @xmath27.
2. The ""single-pole + continuum states"" model works well for conventional mesons and baryons, but for light flavor multiquark states, it is not possible to obtain a Borel window that satisfies the two criteria of the QCD sum rules. In a study using the QCD sum rules, the authors take the quarks as the basic quantum fields and study the scalar mesons as diquark-antidiquark states. They are unable to obtain a Borel window that satisfies the two criteria and resort to a compromise between the two criteria. For heavy tetraquark states and molecular states, the two criteria can be satisfied, but the Borel windows are small. The authors propose taking the colored diquarks as point particles and describing them as basic scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor fields to overcome this issue. They construct color singlet tetraquark currents with scalar diquark fields and perform the standard procedure of the QCD sum rules to study the nonet scalar mesons below a certain energy. The QCD sum rules are ""new"" because the",0

Time-domain simulation is important for power system dynamic analysis, but it can be expensive due to the large number of differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) required to represent different components of the system, each with different time scales. Intense efforts have been made to accelerate the simulation of long-term stability models, including the use of larger time step sizes and the implementation of the quasi steady-state (QSS) model. However, the QSS model suffers from numerical difficulties and can't provide consistent approximations of the long-term stability model.
2. This paper applies pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) method, a theoretically-based numerical method, to power system long-term stability analysis. PTC can accelerate simulation speed in the long-term stability model and overcome possible numerical difficulties in the QSS model due to its good stability property. The paper is organized into four sections, including a review of PTC in DAE systems, an introduction to power system models and the implementation of PTC in the long-term stability model and the QSS model, numerical examples, and conclusions.",0
155,"1. The study of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2D) has gained significant interest due to the potential for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases. Recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps has made it possible to realize phenomena such as anisotropic superfluidity, 2D dipolar fermions, and few-body dipolar complexes.
2. The theory of elementary quantum two-body systems and processes in the plane has been developed, with special consideration given to the anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction. Usual partial-wave analysis becomes inefficient for describing the dipole-dipole scattering due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial-waves in the asymptotic region.
3. Recent progress has been made in the analysis of 2D and quasi-2D scattering of dipoles, with studies on the threshold and semiclassical regimes of 2D dipolar scattering when the dipole polarization is directed orthogonally to the scattering plane. An arbitrary angle of polarization has also been considered.
4. The quantum scattering on an anisotropic potential in the plane is described by the 2D Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates with the scattering boundary conditions in the asymptotic region and the Hamiltonian of the system. The interaction potential can be anisotropic, leading to a more complex problem that requires solving for all possible orientations of the scatterer.
5. To solve the problem, the method suggested in [xcite] is used, which involves reducing the 2D Schrödinger equation to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations of the second order in the angular-grid representation. The scattering boundary condition is then applied in the asymptotic region, and the system is solved using standard computational techniques such as the sweeping method or the LU decomposition.
6. The scattering amplitude is constructed according to the equations and the wave function obtained by solving the boundary value problem. The method has been applied to the 2D scattering on a cylindrical potential barrier with an elliptical base, and the results confirm the convergence of the scattering amplitude to the analytical value at zero energy. The asymptotic formula for the scattering length has also been obtained in the limiting case of an infinitely high potential barrier with a circular base.",0
156,"1. G65.2-0.5, also known as G65.3+5.7, was identified as a supernova remnant (SNR) and the subject of several observational papers. However, it was later ignored until recently, when it became interesting again due to its connection to an unusual class of SNRs called thermal composite SNRs or mixed morphology SNRs. These remnants have a shell-like radio continuum morphology and a centrally bright X-ray morphology caused by thermal, rather than synchrotron, processes.

2. G65.2-0.5 is now considered a thermal composite SNR because it meets two of the three requirements: it has a shell-like radio continuum morphology and emits thermal X-rays. The third requirement, a centrally filled X-ray morphology, was established through the analysis of archival ROSAT observations, which showed that the remnant has a centrally filled X-ray morphology and a temperature that peaks in the center and decreases mildly with radius.

3. The remnant's size and distance have been estimated using various techniques, including the use of the Δ-d relation and the galactic kinematic relationship. These estimates place the remnant at a distance of approximately 900 parsecs above the galactic disk and give it an age of around 20,000 years.

4. The remnant's X-ray emission is slightly harder in the interior than near the edges, and it is assumed to be in collisional ionization equilibrium. The best-fit temperatures range from 2.5 to 3.4 keV and decrease slightly with radius. The remnant's apparent flux of 0.11 to 2.04 keV photons is 1.6 x 10^-10 ergs s^-1 cm^-2, and its luminosity is around 1.5 x 10^35 ergs s^-1, assuming a distance of 900 parsecs.

5. The remnant's thermal composite morphology and the lack of X-ray bright shells can be explained by the evolutionary hypothesis, which suggests that these remnants have evolved beyond the adiabatic phase into the radiative phase. This scenario is supported by",0
157,"1. Permutations are a fundamental building block in the succinct encoding of various data structures such as integer functions, strings, and binary relations. A permutation can be trivially represented in a number of bits that is close to the information theory lower bound.
2. Efficient computation of both the permutation and its inverse is often required in many applications. The lower bound on the number of bits needed to represent a permutation yields a lower bound of a certain number of comparisons to sort it in the comparison model.
3. Many sorting algorithms have been developed that take advantage of the specificities of each permutation to sort them more efficiently. These algorithms can be used to create encoding schemes for permutations, with the number of comparisons performed by the algorithm determining the number of bits needed to encode the permutation.
4. Compression schemes based on sorting algorithms do not necessarily support the inverse of the permutation or the application of the permutation in a reasonable amount of time.
5. The entropy of a sequence of positive integers is a measure of the randomness or disorder in the sequence. Succinct encodings of sequences are data structures that support certain operations on the sequence while using close to the minimum number of bits needed to represent the sequence.
6. Bitmaps are a type of sequence where the alphabet is limited to two symbols. Succinct encodings of bitmaps support certain operations such as counting the number of set bits and finding the position of the nth set bit in constant time.
7. The Hu-Tucker algorithm is a prefix-free code generation algorithm that produces a prefix-free code from a sequence of frequencies. It can be used to encode a permutation by first determining the distribution of run sizes and then applying the Hu-Tucker algorithm to the distribution.
8. The distribution of run sizes in a permutation can be used to encode the permutation more efficiently. A run is a maximal range of consecutive positions in a permutation that does not contain any down steps.
9. A down step in a permutation is a position where the current element is followed by a smaller element. The number of runs in a permutation and the sequence of the lengths of the runs can be used to encode the permutation using at most a certain number of bits.",0
158,"1. Chimera states, which are the coexistence of coherent and incoherent oscillators, have been observed in populations of identical phase oscillators under nonlocal symmetric coupling.
2. These states have been found in various models such as Kuramoto phase oscillators, periodic and chaotic maps, Stuart-Landau oscillators, and coupled chemical oscillators.
3. Recent studies have shown that chimeras emerge naturally in mechanical experiments involving two subpopulations of identical metronomes coupled in a hierarchical network.
4. In the context of neuroscience, chimera states might explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in many birds and dolphins.",1
159,"1. Kauffman networks are disordered dynamical systems used to model genetic regulatory systems. They were studied using mean field theory and found to have a dynamical phase transition. The number of relevant elements in the network, which determine the attractors, was studied and found to have a probability distribution. These relevant elements can be subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules. The phase transition in random Boolean networks can be described in terms of the scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size or as a percolation transition in the set of relevant elements.
2. The annealed approximation, introduced by Derrida and Pomeau, was used to compute the properties of the attractors, but it was found to be reliable only in the chaotic phase and exact for a random map. A new approximation scheme was proposed to work better in the frozen phase and on the critical line, which is the most interesting region in parameter space as it reproduces some features of real cells. The distribution of the number of relevant elements was studied and found to have a well-defined probability density in the infinite size limit. The average length of the cycles increases exponentially as a function of the number of relevant elements, and the average weight of the attraction basins has a non-monotonic behavior versus the number of relevant elements.",0
160,"1. Turbulence in quantum fluids (QT) exhibits unpredictable behavior due to multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinearity, with quantized vortices forming tangles in contrast to classical turbulence (CT) without quantized circulation.
2. Recent studies on turbulence in multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) reveal novel turbulence with both velocity and spin fields disturbed, generating various topological excitations and providing new observations not found in conventional systems.
3. In a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, the spin field interacts with the velocity field, leading to a coupled turbulence (ST) with a Kolmogorov spectrum, which is related to vortex dynamics and considered essential for understanding the turbulence addressed.
4. The paper focuses on the energy spectra for superflow kinetic and spin-dependent interaction energy in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, and derives hydrodynamic equations to discuss the possibility of a Kolmogorov spectrum in spin-superflow turbulence (SST).",0
161,"1. Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) are thought to have low luminosities due to very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes, and are often explained by the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model.
2. The ADAF model predicts a ""submillimeter bump"" in the spectral energy distribution and a high brightness temperature in radio bands, suggesting that future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments could provide evidence for the model.
3. However, there is a gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum at low-frequency radio bands, indicating the existence of additional unknown emission that may be buried under putative emission from the accretion disc.
4. About half of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and LINERs, as well as at least 25% of transition objects, hold a compact radio core.
5. Most of the cores show nearly flat spectra in 0.5-arcsec resolution, indicating jet domination, while slightly inverted spectra have been found in unresolved compact cores of several LLAGNs in milli-arcsec resolutions of VLBIs.
6. To explain this radio excess, an jet-ADAF model has been proposed, suggesting that contamination from jets has prevented the ADAF from being revealed at centimeter bands.
7. High-frequency observations are promising for detecting the inverted spectrum of the ADAF due to less interference from non-thermal jets and larger flux densities predicted by the ADAF model.
8. However, contamination from diffuse dust may be harmful at high frequencies when using a poor spatial resolution, requiring the use of a beam as small as possible and estimations of every conceivable contamination.",0
162,"1. Dust grains in the interstellar medium affect the propagation of starlight through scattering, absorption, and reradiation, playing a crucial role in regulating the energy balance. Studies of these processes have provided insights into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains.
2. Disentangling the effects of intervening dust is important for various astronomical observations, including photometry, spectroscopy, and mapping small-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation.
3. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, which can be quantified using the normalized dust extinction law (or reddening law). The ratio of total to selective extinction is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.
4. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with an average R0 value of 3.1, although this is not universal. Significant deviations from this canonical value and corresponding differences in the overall shape of the extinction/reddening law are known to exist for various interstellar dust clouds.
5. These variations appear to be generally correlated with environment, with R0 ranging from 4 to 5 in dense molecular clouds and as small as 2.5 in more diffuse, high-latitude cirrus clouds.
6. Measurements are necessary along many sight lines through a broad range of cloud types to improve our understanding of the dependence of R0 on environment. Clusters with differential extinction/reddening have been used to measure the R0 of intervening dust.
7. The study presented in the text focuses on the use of broad-band photometry to measure the R0 of dust in the foreground of differentially-reddened globular clusters, proposing three methods that rely on accurate three-band optical photometry or two-band optical photometry and a map of the dust thermal emission.",0
163,"1. Heavy fermion systems are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, with the Kondo scale marking the screening of local magnetic moments through a many-body effect that entangles the spins of conduction electrons and local moments. Below the coherence temperature, a paramagnetic heavy-fermion liquid emerges, characterized by a large fermi surface with Luttinger volume including both magnetic moments and conduction electrons.
2. The Kondo screening competes with the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which indirectly couples local moments via the magnetic polarization of conduction electrons. The competition between Kondo screening, favoring paramagnetic ground states, and the RKKY interaction, favoring magnetically ordered states, is central to quantum phase transitions.
3. Two scenarios describe this quantum phase transition: the standard Hertz-Millis picture, where quasi-particles of the heavy-fermion liquid remain intact and undergo a spin-density wave transition, and alternative scenarios where the quantum critical point is linked to the breakdown of the quasi-particle state and a topological reorganization of the fermi surface.
4. Recent experiments show that a change in fermi surface topology can occur on either side of the magnetic order-disorder quantum critical point, and can be shifted via application of positive or negative chemical pressure. The authors address these questions through an explicit calculation of the fermi surface topology in the framework of the Kondo lattice model.",0
164,"1. The discovery of a resonance at 125 GEV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a significant step towards understanding the origin of mass for fundamental particles. This discovery may also affect the field of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
2. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature could make the Higgs responsible for inflation and suppress the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields. Upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons from LHC experiments have been discussed, and bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity can be obtained from strong-gravity astrophysical objects.
3. The presence of strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, affecting the mass of fundamental particles like the electron. Nucleons are minimally affected, and peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions but are strongly suppressed for molecular transitions.
4. Attention has been focused on the Kreschmann invariant, a non-null curvature invariant, which plays an important role in quadratic theories of gravity and modified theories of gravity. White dwarfs have been proposed as a quieter environment to search for the putative Higgs shift, as they have both molecular and atomic lines in their spectra.
5. White dwarfs have played a prominent role in fundamental physics since the early 20th century, with the first attempt to verify general relativity by measuring the gravitational redshift of Sirius B and studies on the consequences of Fermi-Dirac statistics for stars. Bounds on the distance dependence of the Newtonian gravitational constant have been discussed using observations and models for white dwarfs.
6. Recent studies propose using white dwarfs to study the dependence of the fine structure constant on gravity. Here, the authors show that white dwarfs can be used to obtain limits on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant by analyzing spectroscopic observations of a carbon-rich white dwarf, BPM 27606, using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT).
7. The analysis is complemented by considering data taken from the HST archive on a second white dwarf, Procyon B, which shows caii and mgii lines in addition",0

166,"1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium. Star formation is restricted to cold dense gas and is strongly correlated with the molecular gas content. However, the presence of molecules may not be the cause of star formation, but rather a marker of the right conditions for gravitational collapse. Understanding the links between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution requires identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas is able to develop. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores that develop in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Tracking molecular chemistry is crucial to accurately represent small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations of star-forming clouds.
2. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensity far below its mean. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, called photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively both numerically and theoretically. The outer, unshielded layers of a PDR are composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon. As column density increases, the atomic-to-molecular transition begins to occur, with the C-CO transition occurring interior to the HI-H2 one. Deeper still, when external FUV photons have been entirely absorbed, the chemistry and thermodynamics become dominated by the presence of deep penetrating cosmic rays and the freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains. Simply understanding the structure of a non-dynamic, one-dimensional PDR is of limited utility. The ISM is a dynamic environment where a variety of non-linear, coupled processes determine the global distribution and state of gas. Star forming complexes are continually assembled through self-gravity, while stellar feedback acts to disperse the structures. Turbulent motions, ubiquitous in the ISM, dissipate through radiative shocks but are continually replenished through a combination of supernovae and stellar winds. Thermal processes, such as dust grain photoelectric heating and molecular line cooling, further influence the state of the ISM and are sensitive functions of ambient radiation fields, column density, and the",0
167,"1. The discovery of an overdensity of stars, labeled as the VRC, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been interpreted as an intervening population of stars or tidal debris sheared from a small Milky Way satellite.

168,"1. The text discusses the relationship between star formation and cluster mass in galaxy clusters. It uses data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study this relationship in 69 local galaxy clusters. The study finds that the fraction of star-forming galaxies and the mean specific star formation rate (mSSFR) of cluster galaxies increase with projected distance from the cluster center, but the fraction of star-forming galaxies remains below the field value even at three times the cluster virial radius.
2. The study also investigates the impact of cluster mass on star formation by presenting the total cluster star formation rate normalized by cluster mass as a function of cluster mass. It finds no evidence of a correlation between the cluster specific star formation rate (cssfr) and cluster mass, indicating that transformation mechanisms which scale strongly with cluster mass may not play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in clusters.
3. The study suggests that strangulation, a mechanism that quenches star formation in galaxies as they enter the cluster environment, is a plausible candidate for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies. This mechanism is less dependent on cluster mass than other mechanisms such as ram pressure or harassment.
4. The study's results suggest that the dominant process for regulating star formation in dense environments does not depend on cluster mass, and hence must be efficient in small groups or filaments. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution and the role of environment in shaping galaxy properties.",0
169,"1. The Bishop-Phelps theorem states that every bounded linear functional on a Banach space can be approximated by norm attaining functionals, but this result does not hold for bounded linear operators in general. The Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás theorem is a numerical version of this theorem, and Kim and Lee proved a characterization of uniformly convex Banach spaces in terms of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property.
2. The strong Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property (SBPP) is a variant of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property for bounded linear operators, where the functional that almost attains its norm at some point is the same as the one that attains its norm at the new vector that is close to the original point. Kim and Lee's theorem can be restated in terms of the SBPP for Banach spaces.
3. The paper studies the SBPP for bounded linear operators and proves some positive results when the real number that depends on the norm of the operator and the functional is allowed to vary. However, when this number is required to depend only on the norm of the functional, the paper shows that there are uniformly convex Banach spaces and infinite-dimensional Banach spaces that fail the SBPP.
4. The paper also provides a complete characterization of the SBPP for the pair of Banach spaces (X,Y) when X is uniformly convex and Y has finite dimension. Specifically, the pair (X,Y) satisfies the SBPP if and only if every bounded linear operator from X to Y attains its norm.",0
170,"1. The importance of multi-nucleon events in neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections has been suggested in many calculations, with two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations now considered essential for a proper description of data. There is growing interest in implementing 2p-2h models into Monte Carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations, but the high computational time is a challenge due to the large number of nested integrals involved. Approximations such as choosing an average momentum for nucleons, neglecting exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations can be made to speed up calculations. A new method called the frozen nucleon approximation has been developed to efficiently calculate inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model (RFG), reducing the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1.
2. The frozen nucleon approximation assumes that the momenta of initial nucleons can be neglected for high enough momentum transfer. This reduces the response function to a single integral over the polar angle, with the sum running over possible values of the momentum of the first particle for a given emission angle. The validity of the frozen nucleon approximation has been investigated by comparing response functions computed in the approximation with exact calculations, showing similar shapes but slightly different widths and peak positions. The approximation can be improved by adjusting parameters in the averaged denominator of the Δ-propagator. The frozen approximation is found to be well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux, making it helpful for implementing 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo codes currently available.",0
171,"1. The accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the nucleus of galaxies is believed to be the source of activity in quasars and Seyfert galaxies, collectively known as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Several studies have suggested a correlation between the mass of the SMBH and the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the host galaxy. This correlation may imply an evolutionary relation between the growth of the SMBH and the host galaxy. To study the dependence of various observed phenomena of AGNs on the black hole mass and the cosmic evolution of black holes, independent and reliable estimates of the mass of the black holes are required. One independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole is using the reverberation mapping technique. In this method, the size of the broad line region (BLR) is estimated by measuring the time lag between the continuum variations and the broad emission line variations. The mass of the black hole can then be estimated using the velocity dispersion of the broad component of the emission lines and assuming virial equilibrium.
2. The reverberation mapping technique has been used to make estimates of SMBH masses over a large range of redshift. However, the technique is observationally taxing, as it demands an enormous amount of telescope time. To date, the BLR radius of only about three dozen AGNs (Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars) have been determined. Using these estimates, a correlation was found between the BLR size and the optical continuum luminosity at 5100 Å. This relation can be useful for estimating the SMBH masses from single-epoch spectra and calibrating other surrogate relations used for black hole mass estimates. However, estimates of the BLR size for a larger number of sources are required, especially for low luminosity sources. The extrapolation of the known BLR-luminosity relation to low luminosities suggests that the time lag between the variations of the broad line and that of the continuum will be of the order of hours to days, as compared to several months for high luminosity sources. Therefore, monitoring programs of short durations, but fast sampling, are required to estimate the reverberation time lags for low luminosity sources.",0
172,"1. Broad emission iron lines are common features in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating near the black hole due to radiation reflection on the accretion disc. The black hole's spin plays a significant role in shaping these lines.
2. The Laor model, which assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used to describe these lines, but newer models like * have been developed to allow spin fitting and better handle emissivity parameters.
3. The paper compares the Laor and * models using current XMM-Newton satellite data and artificial data for the upcoming X-ray mission, focusing on two sources with skewed iron lines: the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15 and the black hole binary GX 339-4.
4. The Laor model tends to overestimate spin values and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the determination of the broad line's high-energy edge. These discrepancies are more visible for lower spin values.
5. Correctly re-binning data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution is crucial for obtaining statistically relevant results.

The ""displace, cut and reflect"" method is used to generate static disks made of perfect fluid, i.e., with radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, and disks of perfect fluid surrounded by an halo made of perfect fluid matter. This method is applied to spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates. The article presents the basic equations used to calculate the main physical variables of the disks and applies the formalism to obtain the simplest model of disk based on Schwarzschild's vacuum solution in isotropic coordinates.
2. The article also discusses some models of disks with halos obtained from different known exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates. Examples of disks with halo generated from spheres composed of fluid layers are presented. The matching conditions at the boundary of adjacent spherical fluid layers in isotropic coordinates involve four continuity conditions: the two metric functions, the first derivative of the radial coordinate, and the pressure should be continuous across the boundary.
3. The article applies the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method to generate disks discussed in the previous section to the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates. The total mass of the disk is calculated, and it is shown that the disk's surface energy density is always positive (weak energy condition). Positive values (pressure) for the stresses in azimuthal and radial directions are obtained if the strong energy condition is satisfied. These properties characterize a fluid made of matter with the usual gravitational attractive property.
4. The article also discusses the stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane using an extension of Rayleigh's criteria of stability of a fluid at rest in a gravitational field. The tangential velocity measured by an observer at infinity is calculated, and it is shown that the tangential velocity goes as the Newtonian circular velocity for small radii. The specific angular momentum and the velocity of sound propagation are calculated, and it is shown that the condition for no tachyonic matter imposes inequalities on the pressure and the sound velocity.",0

7. The effects of symmetry and symmetry breaking are more pronounced in two-component systems, with condensation corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of two global U(1) symmetries.
8. In the presence of a coupling drive, the number of atoms in each species is not conserved separately, leading to the lifting of degeneracy and the formation of a domain wall.
9. A sufficiently small violation of the U(1) symmetry corresponding to the relative phase leads to the existence of a nontrivial static configuration, a domain wall inside which the relative phase changes by π.
10. This domain wall is not topologically stable and can decay, but the rate of spontaneous decay is exponentially suppressed due to an energy barrier.",1

2. Ionospheric modification experiments in Platteville, Colorado, and Arecibo, Puerto Rico, demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation in ionosonde records, and the excitation of spread F after the HF transmitter was turned on. The triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionosphere was first observed in 1970 at Arecibo.
3. A decade later, strong, systematic, structured, wide-band secondary HF radiation was found to escape from the interaction region under similar experimental conditions in Tromsø, Norway. Complex interactions, including weak and strong EM turbulence and harmonic generation, are excited in these experiments.
4. Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence. Examples include analytical and numerical studies of Langmuir turbulence and upper-hybrid/lower-hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas.

A full-scale simulation study of the propagation of an HF EM wave into the ionosphere was conducted, with ionospheric parameters typical for the high-latitude EISCAT heating facility in Tromsø, Norway. This is the first simulation involving realistic scale sizes of the ionosphere and the wavelength of the EM waves.
6. The results suggest that such simulations will become a powerful tool to study HF-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level for direct comparison with experimental data.

The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid-Mott insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. Recently, the transition has been observed and studied in a system of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, leading to renewed interest and research activity. The possibility of manipulating and testing the many-body behavior of trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice has potential applications in quantum computation, such as creating controlled multiparticle entanglement using a Mott state of bosonic atoms.
2. The Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition is driven by the interplay of repulsive interactions between bosons on the same lattice site and their kinetic energy. The ratio of the onsite energy to the bandwidth is the key parameter in the system, and can be easily controlled and varied in optical lattices. Probing the system by taking absorption pictures to image the expansion patterns after a reasonable expansion time yields information about the momentum distribution of the state, and was used to experimentally confirm the Mott transition in an optical lattice.
3. The essential physics of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic Mott-Hubbard model describing the competition between hopping and on-site interaction. Approximation schemes such as the Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz, density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), exact diagonalization (ED), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) have been used to study this model analytically and numerically. In this article, the authors study short-range correlations not included by the Gutzwiller ansatz using perturbation theory, with the goal of finding corrections to the short-range behavior of the one-particle density matrix, which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns.
4. The authors use Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory to improve the Gutzwiller approximation by perturbatively including short-range correlations between lattice sites. They calculate perturbative corrections to observables up to second order, and find important modifications to single-site observables and the correlation function. These observables describe local properties and are less sensitive to correlations between lattice sites, so values for single-site observables obtained from the Gutzwiller wavefunction already provide a good approximation in most cases.

Compactification on a compact hyperbolic manifold with a time-dependent volume modulus results in a flat expanding universe that undergoes transient acceleration. This behavior is common to all compactifications involving compact hyperbolic spaces or non-vanishing flux. The positive scalar field potential produced by both hyperbolic and flux compactifications explains this transient acceleration.

2. The paper aims to generalize the analysis to multi-scalar models and determine the model-independent behavior of cosmologies with more general scalar potentials. A new formalism is developed to visualize cosmological solutions, which applies to any potential. Exponential potentials serve as reference potentials in determining the late-time behavior of cosmologies arising in a large class of models with other potentials. The analysis is based on the observation that flat cosmological solutions of gravity coupled to scalar fields with potential can be viewed as null geodesics in an augmented target space.",1

182,"1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a phase of quantum chromodynamics where quarks and gluons are mostly liberated from hadrons. Its phase transition structure is a central aim of research in hot and dense QCD. Experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have tried to create the QGP, with tentative confirmation and the formation of a quark-gluon liquid at low viscosity in 2005. The QGP can also be created in the initial stage of a ""little big bang"" through relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions in heavy ion accelerators.
2. The Landau Fermi liquid theory describes relativistic systems such as nuclear matter, quark matter, and quark gluon plasma. The energy density of weakly interacting quarks in QGP can be evaluated using formulas from this theory. The total energy of interacting quarks can be calculated by summing the kinetic and potential energies and the Fermi-Dirac liquid distributions of quasiparticles.
3. The thermodynamic quantities of the QGP, such as the energy density, entropy, and free energy, can be evaluated from the partition function. These quantities are obtained as a function of chemical potential and temperature, but can be rewritten as a function of temperature and baryon density for experimental purposes. The bag pressure and vacuum energy contributions should be included in the quark and gluon contribution energies.
4. The phase diagram of the QGP can be extracted by solving an equation involving the quark and hadronic pressures. The hadronic pressure can be calculated using the excluded volume effect for the nuclear matter equation of state. The interaction energy between quarks can be calculated using the Landau Fermi liquid model, and the potential energy density of interacting massless up or down quarks is always positive, making it easier for quarks and gluons to penetrate from the bag and transition to the QGP phase.",0
183,"1. A conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies was proposed, where quarks and gluons are confined to an Anti-de Sitter universe with a finite radius in flat space-time, and confinement is described through the introduction of two scalar fields that spontaneously break the symmetry.
2. The model was further simplified to describe the flavor-independent oscillations of quarks and gluons, which reveal themselves through the structures observed in hadronic mass distributions, and the coupling of quark-antiquark components to real and virtual two-meson decay channels gives a clue about the size of the mass of the scalar field associated with confinement.
3. An apparent interference effect was observed in the invariant-mass distribution of BABAR collaboration data, which could be due to interference between the typical oscillation frequency of the quark pair and that of the gluon cloud, and was suggested to be a signal of a narrow Breit-Wigner resonance with a mass of about 38 MeV, possibly mediating quark-pair creation and associated with the above-discussed scalar field for confinement.",1
184,"1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the 1980s to describe the effect of nonmonotone dependence of a system's response on noise, particularly in the study of periodic advance of glaciers on earth.
2. Stochastic resonance is the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by the addition of noise, and it has been observed in various fields of applications.
3. The optimal level of noise, which maximizes the Fisher information quantity, is called stochastic resonance, and if several local maxima are present, it is called stochastic multi-resonance.
4. In this paper, the authors study the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model with a threshold, a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal, and a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process.
5. The authors propose two schemes of observations: observing the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.
6. The authors present two different estimators for the schemes and study their asymptotic properties, and they show that the estimators proposed are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators.
7. The authors also solve the problem of testing the simple hypothesis against the simple alternative by applying the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion and show that the overall probability of error is nonmonotonic dependent on the noise level.",0
185,"1. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have been found to have mainly d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant d-gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature. Thermal transport measurements support this symmetry, showing a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO planes. This oscillation can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles. However, deviations from the expected angular pattern have been attributed to the effect of pinning of vortices.
2. The variation of the thermal conductivity as a function of angle between the heat current and the magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO planes depends mainly on the heat transport by quasiparticles, their interaction with the supercurrents (vortices), and the symmetry of the order parameter. An angular pattern showing properties of the order parameter symmetry can only be achieved when the temperature is low enough so that the quasiparticle momentum is close to the nodal directions of the gap. Thermal activation would induce quasiparticles at different orientations from those of the nodes, reducing the sensitivity of the probe to measure gap characteristics.
3. The first question addressed in this paper is related to the temperature range at which the nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity. The second question is whether the thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature can explain the experimental results in the whole temperature range, in particular the change of symmetry of the gap as a function of temperature. The paper calculates numerically the thermal conductivity at different angles and temperatures at a fixed magnetic field, assuming an Andreev reflection model for the scattering of quasiparticles by supercurrents.
4. The experimental results show that the overall results agree with the theoretical model and confirm the predominance of the d-gap up to the critical temperature. The measurements provide new results that improve our knowledge of the thermal transport at temperatures at which the nodal properties of the gap are not directly observable. The paper also discusses the influence of pinning of vortices, oxygen vacancies, and impurity centers on the measurements.",0
186,"1. Dehn surgery is an operation that modifies a three-manifold by drilling and then regluing a solid torus. Two Dehn surgeries along a knot with distinct slopes are called purely cosmetic if they result in orientation-preserving homeomorphic three-manifolds.
2. The cosmetic surgery conjecture posits that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic. In this paper, the authors study purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere.
3. They show that for most knots in the three-sphere, distinct slopes result in non-homeomorphic oriented manifolds. A knot admits no purely cosmetic surgery if it has certain properties related to its Jones polynomial.
4. The authors use the Jones polynomial and its derivatives to characterize purely cosmetic surgeries, improving upon previous results by Boyer and Lines.
5. Knots with genus greater than one, or those with a particular concordance invariant, are known not to admit purely cosmetic surgeries.
6. Lescop's surgery formula, which involves a knot invariant satisfying a crossing change formula, plays a crucial role in the proof of the main result.
7. The authors observe that this knot invariant is a finite type invariant of a specific order, allowing them to reformulate the main theorem in terms of finite type invariants.
8. As an application, they prove the nonexistence of purely cosmetic surgery on certain families of two-bridge knots and Whitehead doubles.
9. An explicit formula for the canonically normalized finite type knot invariant of order three is derived for two-bridge knots in Conway forms, which could be of independent interest.",0
187,"1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attracted attention due to their desirable properties, such as calculable soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking terms and renormalization group invariant soft terms. However, they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be solved by adding a universal scalar mass term. The minimal AMSB (mAMSB) model has a parameter space given by the universal scalar mass m\_0, the gravitino mass m\_3/2, and the sign of the Higgsino mass parameter.
2. An alternative setup for AMSB is hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB), a string-motivated scenario where SUSY breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, separated from the visible region. The warping suppresses tree-level gravity mediation, allowing anomaly mediation to dominate the visible sector. The bino mass can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation, leading to a small or large perturbation in the spectrum depending on its size.
3. The minimal AMSB model predicts a negative mass squared for sleptons and heavy squarks, while pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a wide range of relative contributions.
4. The hCAMSB superpartner spectrum is calculated using the ISASUGRA subprogram of the ISAJET event generator, which implements an iterative procedure to solve the MSSM RGEs, minimize the RG-improved 1-loop effective potential, and compute physical sparticle masses with 1-loop corrections. The weak scale sparticle mass spectrum is typically in close accord with other sparticle spectrum generators.
5. The hCAMSB model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if the gluino is not too heavy, due to the presence of gluino cascade decays in hCAMSB. The hCAMSB model also predicts a wino-like LSP and dominantly Higgsino-like NLSPs, while the mAMSB model has a bino-like LSP and dominantly Higgsino-like NLSPs.

188,"1. The zero range potential (ZRP) approach has been developed as an extension of the traditional treatment by Demkov, Ostrovsky, Albeverio et al. The ZRP can be represented as a boundary condition on the wavefunction or as a pseudopotential. Darboux transformation (DT) can be used to construct exactly solvable potentials and correct the ZRP model. The DT technique can also define the ZRP based on the covariance property of the Schrödinger equation.
2. In the context of the ZRP model, the radial Schrödinger equation describes the scattering of a particle with energy E. The wavefunctions at infinity have the form A(θ)exp(ikr), where A(θ) is the amplitude, k is the wavevector, and r is the radial distance. The ZRP is conventionally represented as a boundary condition on the wavefunction, and the potential and wavefunctions can be expressed in terms of spherical functions. The bound states correspond to the poles of the J-matrix, which lie on the imaginary positive semi-axis of the complex plane.
3. The DT can be used to define the free parameters of the solutions and introduce a short-range core of centrifugal type in the potential. The dressed potential is regular on the semiaxis only if certain conditions are met. The ZRP can also be introduced in terms of DT. The DT introduces complex poles of the J-matrix, which correspond to quasi-stationary states (resonances). Darboux transformation can be used to add or remove poles of the J-matrix.",0

3. The differential quadrature method (DQM) is a numerical technique for approximating derivatives of a function using weighted sums of functional values at certain nodes. It has been used to solve the convection-diffusion equation with modified cubic b-splines as base functions, resulting in the modified trigonometric cubic-b-spline DQM (MTB-DQM), modified exponential cubic-b-spline DQM (MEXP-DQM), and third modified extended cubic-b-spline DQM (MECDQ). These methods have been shown to be accurate and efficient for solving the convection-diffusion equation.",0
190,"1. Surveys using bolometer arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have discovered dusty objects at extreme redshifts, which are not detected in surveys at shorter and longer wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavorable @xmath11 corrections. The discovery of ""scuba galaxies"" in the late 1990s significantly changed the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, revealing a large source density of dusty, starburst galaxies at flux levels accessible to the first generation of bolometer arrays. However, the initial excitement was replaced by pessimism when early efforts to study these galaxies in the optical and infrared (IR) wavelengths suggested that the majority of the submm population had no plausible optical counterparts. This led to the development of various redshift engines and broadband photometric techniques, resulting in only a handful of detailed studies of extreme and possibly unrepresentative galaxies.
2. Recent progress in the study of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) has been made through radio imaging of submm survey fields, which has enabled the detection of roughly half of the submm sources observed and provided a rough estimate of redshift when combined with submm flux density. Radio data has also allowed for the refinement of submm samples, increasing the detection fraction to two-thirds of SMGs at 0.85-mm flux density levels in excess of @xmath35mjy. These bright SMGs have been found to be a diverse population, including quasar-like galaxies with broad lines and X-ray detections, morphologically complex galaxies, extremely red galaxies, and galaxies with the signatures of obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds. Spectroscopic redshifts have been difficult to determine, but accurate redshifts reported by Chapman et al. (2003, 2005) have facilitated the first systematic measurements of molecular gas mass for SMGs and constraints on gas reservoir size and dynamical mass. These data suggest that SMGs are massive systems and provide some of the strongest tests of galaxy-formation models to date. However, a detailed understanding of SMGs remains a distant goal, and confusion currently limits investigations to the brightest SMGs. Selection biases may also have skewed the understanding of SMGs, as around half of all known SMGs remain undetect",0

2. Several deep, faint galaxy redshift surveys have been conducted, and while there is broad agreement that the population of blue, star-forming galaxies has evolved strongly since z~1, the population of red galaxies shows at most modest signs of evolution. However, there are inconsistencies in the LFs derived by different groups, which are attributed to selection effects and systematic errors. The local LF also has considerable uncertainties, with differences in normalization, characteristic luminosity, and slope at low luminosities among surveys.",0
192,"1. Rapidity gaps, regions without hadronic activity in high-energy collisions, have been observed at the HERA collider and the Fermilab Tevatron. They are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, with the simplest model being the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets, indicating that color singlet exchange effects in QCD events are relevant at high momentum transfers.
2. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent, which is the product of the fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and the survival probability of rapidity gaps. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event, i.e., without soft interactions between the other partons in the scattering hadrons.
3. In the two-gluon exchange model, the color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons. This model predicts a substantial decrease in the observable gap fraction as the contribution from gluon-induced dijet events is reduced, such as by increasing the average transverse momentum of the observed jets. However, recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations show no such effect and even a slight increase in the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum, casting doubt on the validity of the two-gluon exchange model.
4. To study unitarity constraints, the amplitude must be diagonalized in both momentum/coordinate space and color space. This can be achieved by transforming to impact parameter space and decomposing the color factors into a linear combination of projection operators onto the irreducible color representations accessible in the s-channel. The color decomposition, combined with the transformation to impact parameter space, diagonalizes the unitarity relation for elastic scattering amplitudes.
5. The dependence of the gap fraction on the color structure of the scattering partons would be reflected in a variation with the transverse energy and pseudorapidity separation of the two jets. Bjorken's two-gluon exchange model predicts a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon-initiated processes, leading to a decrease in the gap fraction with increasing transverse energy or pseudorapidity separation.

194,"1. Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole, is orbited by a low mass star. The secondary star transfers mass to the compact object via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk that emits X-rays.
2. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z sources and atoll sources. Z sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and have high accretion rates, while atoll sources have lower accretion rates and display fragmented island-like regions in their color-color diagrams.
3. The main physical differences between Z sources and atoll sources are thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.
4. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB located in the Large Magellanic Cloud that shows the properties of a Z source, indicating a high accretion rate around the Eddington limit.
5. Despite being one of the most X-ray luminous LMXBs known, its X-ray flux is low due to its extra-galactic nature. Its optical counterpart is a blue star, but little is known about the system parameters of LMCX-2.
6. Researchers have developed a technique using phase-resolved spectroscopy to detect a signature of the donor star in persistent LMXBs, which has led to constraints on the system parameters of several other LMXBs.
7. In this study, the researchers applied the bowen fluorescence technique to LMCX-2 and detected a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset, which they identified as the orbital period. They also identified narrow emission lines in the bowen region, giving the first constraints on the system parameters of LMCX-2.
8. The study also found that the radial velocity curve of the heii emission line shows a periodic variability that could suggest the orbital period, but the doppler maps show that the heii emission is dominated by a bright spot due to the warped accretion disk, making it difficult to determine the orbital phasing of the primary.",0
195,"1. The axial anomaly, a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, has been analyzed using the renormalization procedure and the path integral formalism. An alternative approach by Dolgov and Zakharov interprets the anomaly as an infrared phenomenon caused by a singularity in the chiral limit of the triangular diagram.

The Dolgov and Zakharov approach has been extended to study the radiative pion decay, and the axial anomaly plays an essential role in interpreting spin-dependent parton distribution.

206,"1. The present invention relates to a device and algorithm for a combined cardiomyostimulator and cardiac pacer-cardioverter-defibrillator, aimed at treating patients with chronically low cardiac output due to cardiac arrhythmias.
2. The system includes an implantable pulse generator that senses heart contractions via one or more sensing leads and stimulates the appropriate nerves of a surgically-modified muscle tissue, such as the latissimus dorsi, to contract in synchrony with the heart.
3. The muscle tissue, wrapped around the heart, assists in its contractions, raising the stroke volume and thus cardiac output. The pulse generator also delivers therapeutic electrical pulses to the heart.
4. Patients with chronic cardiac output deficiencies face an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmic episodes, which may be life-threatening.
5. To address these potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, some cardiac assist systems combine a muscle stimulator and a cardiac pacer-cardioverter-defibrillator.
6. However, muscle stimulation may interfere with the reliable sensing of cardiac events, especially during ventricular arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
7. The present invention temporarily stops or inhibits skeletal muscle stimulation once the onset of an arrhythmia is sensed, allowing for accurate detection and diagnosis of arrhythmias while also managing cardiac assistance.",0

2. The first lens portion is an elastically deformable lens chamber filled with a fluid or gel, while the base lens is made of a substantially rigid material.
3. Radially compressive forces exerted on the IOL are transferred onto the lens chamber to cause deformation and change in curvature, thereby restoring the eye's natural range of accommodation.
4. The lens chamber has a gradually increasing thickness profile from the peripheral to the central regions, encouraging deformation and preventing buckling upon application of radially compressive forces.
5. The base lens is substantially thicker than the opposing sides of the lens chamber, ensuring effective transfer of radially compressive forces onto the lens chamber.
6. The lens periphery comprises a radial portion and a circumferential hinge, facilitating the transmission of radially compressive forces onto the lens chamber.

208,"1. This text describes an esophageal-stomach displacement electrode, which can be used for various medical procedures such as pacing, defibrillation, and ECG pickup. The electrode can be moved close to the organ of the body being treated, like the ventricles of the heart, for more efficient and noninvasive patient care.
2. The device consists of a semi-rigid plastic tube with an electrode at the distal end, and a mechanism that allows the user to bend the last few inches of the tube back on itself, approximately 135 degrees from its original position. This mechanism enables the electrode to impact on the stomach wall and displace it towards the heart, positioning the electrode in its operative position closest to the ventricle.
3. The control mechanism for the electrode is located at the proximal end of the tube outside the mouth when the esophageal-stomach displacement electrode is placed in the stomach. The tube is crimped to form a hinge, which enables it to bend readily at that point, and a rigid pin is disposed in the tube, extending generally parallel to the tube axis.
4. A pair of cords are connected to the proximal and distal ends of the pin and extend proximally in the tube out its proximal end and into the control mechanism. The location of the pin may be changed by pulling one or the other of the cords in a proximal direction.
5. The electrode can be used in the following manner: the tube is inserted into the esophagus, and the operator moves the slide to the right, which will cause the pin to move downwardly in the tube so that its distal end is immediately adjacent the port. Further movement of the slide will cause the distal portion of the tube to deflect and place the electrode in proximity to the upper stomach wall near the heart ventricle.",1

210,"1. The invention relates to a device and method for treating tissues and open wounds, promoting directed tissue growth, and achieving tissue regeneration. Wounds that cannot be sutured edge to edge are a significant health issue, often becoming chronic due to poor blood supply, infection, or dehydration. Prolonged institutional care is usually required, with non-surgical treatment followed by reconstructive surgery using skin grafts, composite tissue transfers, or tissue regeneration.
2. Occlusive, pliable film dressings prevent dehydration and facilitate healing in superficial wounds, while ""active"" dressings that supply saline or therapeutic agents and/or remove wound surface fluids improve healing in deeper wounds by reducing tissue swelling, aiding contraction, and stimulating healing. Continuously administered solutions influence the wound through diffusion processes, with therapeutic agents potentially including antibacterial substances, enzymes, growth factors, genes, or cells.
3. A device allowing intermittent or continuous fluid supply and/or suction drainage through a spacer made of a matted polyester fiber or polyurethane foam pad placed between the wound and the covering sheet has been developed. This device was used for continuous wetting and suctioning (−150 mmHg and −40 mmHg) in wounds, and a similar invention was used for tissue regeneration by applying the open polymer dressing pad on a cell growth substrate and supplying growth substances.
4. During fluid supply and suctioning through an occlusively applied open pore dressing, the fluid volume forced by suctioning from capillaries and wounded tissue is added to that administered through the supply port. The functional aspects of this treatment include a direct correlation between drainage fluid flow rate and suction pressure, and the dressing pad remaining partially saturated even when treatment fluid is supplied at a rate of 7,200 mL/24 h.
5. Malfunctions and limitations of open pore dressings used for combined fluid supply and wound suctioning on a continuous or intermittent basis include hydrostatic pressure issues with fluid bags and pressure pumps, as well as gradual blocking of hydrophilic, capillary-active dressing pores by viscous or particulate material. Known open pore dressings lack reliable intermittent administration of sal",0

The compound is a key intermediate in the synthesis of pyrazolotriazoles, which are useful magenta couplers in photographic products.
2. The traditional synthesis of pyrazolotriazoles involves the preparation of triazolothiadiazines through two methods: reaction of 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-substituted-1,2,4-triazoles with alpha-haloketones or reaction of 2-hydrazino-5-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazines with acyl halides and subsequent dehydrative ring closure.
3. The desulfurization of triazolothiadiazines to pyrazolotriazoles is typically achieved in two steps: a ring contraction reaction in acetic anhydride, followed by hydrolysis and desulfurization with hydrochloric acid. However, this process generates elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities, which can interfere with subsequent reactions and cause potential fogging in photographic systems.
4. The use of hypophosphorous acid in the deacylation and desulfurization step reduces the formation of these impurities, making the process more straightforward and increasing the yield of the desired pyrazolotriazole.
5. The hypophosphorous acid also results in the formation of hydrogen sulfide by-product, which is readily removed from the reaction zone due to its gaseous nature and chemical reactivity.

The EH mode generates a shock and acoustic wave, while the EM mode generates controlled flux compression without the coupled effect of the EH strong acoustic wave.
2. The pulsed power method can generate high-frequency acoustic stimulation of the reservoir separately from the direct acoustic response of the EH shock wave generated by the plasma discharge in the wellbore. This is due to the unique ability of pulsed power to induce a coupled acoustic vibration at very high frequencies in geologic materials like quartz, causing stimulation at multiple scales in the reservoir body.

The invention uses a coupled process of direct EH acoustic vibrations and electromagnetically-induced high-frequency acoustic vibrations to effectively mobilize the oil and increase production.

This can also be achieved by using multiple pulse sources in multiple wells, allowing the electromagnetically-induced vibrations to continue for a longer time.

The current disclosure relates to Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) structures, which are reinforced earthen structures used for various applications such as retaining walls, bridge abutments, dams, seawalls, and dikes.

2. A typical soil reinforcing element used in MSE structures includes a welded wire grid with longitudinal wires and transverse wires joined at their intersections. The wall end of the soil reinforcing element may include connective means to connect it to a facing element, such as a wire, concrete, or steel facing. Once secured, the soil reinforcing element provides tensile strength to the vertical facing, reducing outward movement and shifting.

3. However, single soil reinforcing elements often cannot be manufactured or transported to the required lengths for adequate reinforcement. Therefore, there is a need for a system and method to splice a soil reinforcing element to extend its length.

4. The disclosure provides a splice for a soil reinforcing element, which includes a first wave plate with transverse protrusions for receiving and seating a corresponding number of transverse wires, a second wave plate with similar protrusions for a grid-strip, and a connective device extending through perforations in the wave plates to couple them together. A portion of longitudinal wires of the soil reinforcing element and the grid strip are interposed between the first and second wave plates and are thereby prevented from removal.

5. The disclosure also provides a composite soil reinforcing element, which includes a soil reinforcing element, a grid-strip, and a splice that couples the reinforcing end of the soil reinforcing element to the splicing end of the grid-strip. The splice includes wave plates with transverse protrusions that receive and seat the transverse wires of the soil reinforcing element and the grid-strip, and a connective device that clamps down on the longitudinal wires of both elements.

6. The splice can effectively extend the length of a soil reinforcing element into adjacent backfill, thereby reinforcing a vertical facing",0

The invention describes a jointing structure in vehicle traveling path joints with an expansion function, which is adaptable for various tire configurations, ensures high slip resistance, prevents tire fall-in/stuck-in situations, and allows easy maintenance. It comprises multiple steps with an expansion gap, elastic members, and a joint block mounted on the elastic members across the gap. The joint block remains centered in the gap due to elastic member deformation, ensuring smooth vehicle traveling even with vertical/lateral displacements or kinked joints caused by earthquakes.

2. The elastic members are made of a material hard to deform vertically and easy to deform horizontally, and are joined together using a joint block or backing plate. They can be easily subjected to deformation by pressing them toward the bridge girder axis using an oil hydraulic jack. Supporting blocks can be mounted inside the steps with the joint block between to protect the traveling path ends from damage due to tire impingement and/or impact responses.

3. The expansion gap can be decentralized into multiple smaller gaps by mounting intermediate joint blocks inside the steps, reducing the size of each individual expansion gap and preventing tire fall-in/stuck-in situations. The use of concrete or high-strength fiber-reinforced concrete for the joint block, supporting blocks, and intermediate joint blocks ensures minimal differences in level between joint portions, facilitating difference-in-level management.

4. The expansion gap width can be set at a median between the greatest and smallest expansion gap widths to minimize the greatest width and avoid bringing bridge girder ends into contact with each other. The elastic members can be easily joined together and deformed using a joint block or backing plate and an oil hydraulic jack, preventing tire fall-in/stuck-in situations and ensuring smooth vehicle traveling.

5. The components are fitted in a detachable fashion, allowing for easy maintenance. The expansion gap can be obliquely provided in the joint portion between each traveling path end and the joint block, preventing tire fall-in/stuck-in situations for small-sized vehicles with small-diameter tires while ensuring a required expansion gap. This structure also eliminates problems such as rust development, degradation, and scattering of members, enhancing in-traveling safety for vehicles.",0

290,"1. The invention describes a vibratory tool used in downhole operations that can selectively allow passage of other tools through it. This tool is designed to dislodge stuck objects, known as fish, from downhole locations and to allow pulling forces to be transmitted from the surface to a fish in a deviated wellbore.
2. Earlier vibratory tools operated on a similar principle, where an overpull is applied to the string supporting the tool, and pressure is applied within the string. A piston then travels against the bias of a spring, stretching the string while compressing the spring. When the force applied by the spring becomes higher than the pressure applied from above, the valve member moves off its seat, relieving the pressure and allowing flow through the tool.
3. However, these earlier designs had limitations, such as not having a central passageway clear for a wireline to run through the tool to determine conditions in the vicinity of the fish. The dump valve that relieved pressure was located in the center of the tool, preventing a clear run through the tool for a wireline or other tools.
4. The new design includes a drop in dart that incorporates the working components of the vibratory tool, allowing for wireline access through the tool body. The dart can be retrieved after the vibration operation, but it requires miniaturization of the vibratory tool's key components, limiting the power delivery of the generated vibrations.
5. The new design also includes a dump valve that is reconfigured into an annular shape, keeping the middle of the tool free and clear for a central passage. This allows a wireline operation through the tool when it is not set up to be in vibratory mode.
6. The mandrel is powered by stacked pistons in the tool body to magnify the delivered power from the vibratory tool. The essential parts of the vibratory tool are in the housing, and only the delivery of the plug is required to initiate operations.
7. The tool can be run in a manner where high amplitude low-frequency oscillating forces are delivered to the stuck fish without impacts of the pistons on the housing. The tool can also be operated to apply up oscillating forces with or without impacts, depending on how the tool is operated by rig personnel.
8. The tool has an outer body with a lower end attached to a stuck object or fish. Within the outer body, and extending",0

The face panel and counterfort are connected to the base using a shear key filled with grout. This system eliminates the need for temporary shoring and allows for taller walls and shorter bases, reducing installation and transportation costs.
2. The counterforts can have openings for drainage to limit pressure on the wall and improve stability. Reinforcing bars (rebar) can be cast within the counterfort and base for additional strength. The base is generally a rectangular or trapezoidal platform, precast concrete, and can have openings to accept downward-extending rebar ends from the counterfort.
3. The connection between the face panel and base is made by inserting an end of a piece of rebar of one module into an opening in the other module and then sealing the connection with grout. This arrangement allows for quick and easy installation with no temporary shoring required.
4. In case of poor soil conditions, H-piles can be driven into the ground and the base set on top of these piles for added stability. A pocket can be created in the base to allow the pile to extend up into the base, and the connection can be filled with grout.
5. The invention also describes a method for creating a cast-in-place vehicle impact barrier on top of or behind the wall by exposing rebar on the face or rear surface of the face panel and casting concrete around it.

The invention relates to a mechanism for installing and retrieving downhole objects in wells, specifically designed to connect to and disconnect from downhole objects or ""fish"" that may become stuck or lost in a wellbore. This mechanism is an improvement on U.S. Pat. No. 4,061,389 and is applicable to wire line operations. Downhole devices, such as those used for controlling well operations, often have API Standard fishing necks with undercut shoulders for standard installation and retrieval tools. However, these fishing necks can become corroded or eroded, leaving only a stub pipe without the usual undercut shoulder. In such cases, an overshot type grappling device with internal teeth can be used to establish a gripping relation with the worn fishing neck. The problem with such tools is that disconnection from the worn fishing neck can be difficult, often requiring substantial jarring or violent mechanical movement. The invention aims to provide a mechanism that can easily and reliably connect to and disconnect from downhole objects.
2. The invention features an expandable collet type device for establishing internal connection with an object to be pulled from the wellbore. The collet structure is part of an outer tubular body having an inner body structure disposed in movable relation therein. Telescoping movement of the inner and outer body structures causes the overshot or spear to selectively move into gripping relationship with the object that is to be removed from the wellbore. The tubular outer body is secured about the inner body by means of a catch mechanism having a locking position and an unlocking position, depending on the relative positions of the inner and outer body structures. A pin structure forming a part of the catch mechanism is selectively positioned within pin receiving grooves and a control spring is employed to ensure that the pin alternately enters one or the other of a pair of unlocking or locking grooves each time the inner and outer body structures are cycled linearly relative to one another.

2. The ladder attachment includes a brace with an extension arm and a U-bolt that secures the brace to the ladder rung. A resilient pad assembly is pivotally connected to the extension arm to provide a non-slip gripping portion that grips the work surface without damaging it.
3. The large contact area brace assemblies attached to the siderails of the ladder increase the contact area with the work surface, improving lateral stability and preventing damage to the work surface. The brace assemblies can be adjusted to accommodate different sizes of ladders.
4. The resilient pad assembly can pivot horizontally or vertically, allowing the ladder to straddle corners and providing stability on both flat and corner work surfaces. The clamp exerts a force against the siderail to prevent any motion of the arm toward or away from the siderail.
5. The construction of the brace assembly may be of heavier gauge material or use alternative bolt arrangements to resist forces tending to move the arm toward the center of the ladder. These modifications can be useful in less substantial ladders where there is a limit on the amount the U-bolt can be torqued.
6. The ladder attachment provides a non-slip gripping portion, increases the contact area of the ladder with the work surface, improves lateral stability, and allows the ladder to straddle corners, all while preventing damage to the work surface.

Collated nails are assembled in strips that are inserted into a magazine of the tool, with the nails held parallel to one another in a staggered or stepped manner. Presently known collated nails are assembled using tape strips or an extruded plastic material, but these methods can result in debris and shattering of the plastic material as the nails are driven into the workpiece.
2. The invention aims to reduce the tendency for the plastic to generate debris and minimize the amount of plastic that separates from the nail shank. This is achieved through the use of a collation system that reduces the tendency for the nail strip to corrugate or advance on itself in the tool magazine, minimizes the strip's flexibility, and maximizes the adhesion of the plastic to the nail shanks. The system is also designed to permit the collation to be coiled for use in driving tools that accept collations in this manner.
3. The fastener assembly includes a row of fasteners arranged parallel to each other, with a collation system formed from a plastic material that is molded onto and adhered to the fasteners. The plastic material defines a collar portion that captures or at least substantially encircles the fastener shank and a connecting portion extending between and connecting adjacent collar portions. The plastic material is formulated from an adhesive polymer such as a polyolefin, a polyolefin blend, an epoxy, or the like. When the fastener is driven from the driving tool, the collar portion remains adhered to the fastener such that the collar portion penetrates the substrate with the fastener.

The invention describes a position sensor that modifies an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer into a conditioned sensing signal by removing unneeded power, which can be used for multiplexing multiple sensors with a minimum number of wires and energy required from each sensor monitoring system.
2. A window reference circuit constantly compares a desired conditioned sensor signal output to an existing conditioned sensor signal output and adjusts the conditioned sensor signal output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal.
3. An error correction generator, which includes a comparator, controller, and signal processor, provides an error correction signal to the waveform generator to modify the unconditioned sensing signal. The error correction generator determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about the position of an object being sensed.
4. The error correction generator constantly compares the value of the conditioned sensing signal to a desired minimum value and generates a correction signal that is subtracted from the offset and error signal to deliver a sensor signal output that is close to a desired minimum value.
5. The signal processor generates a relatively small reference signal that is large enough to eliminate small values of drift in a negative going direction yet is small enough not to generate a significant amount of signal due to the discrete nature of calibration voltages from a DAC and counter combination employed thereby.
6. The error correction generator generates a relatively large reference signal that substantially exceeds the largest voltage encountered by the sensor as an object being monitored moves its maximum amount, allowing rapid recalibration due to sudden changes in an offset voltage caused by rapid temperature or other changes.",0

The invention uses waveguide holograms (WGH) for the controlled illumination of objects with specific illumination requirements, such as display holograms or spatial light modulators (SLM).
2. WGHs are based on thin substrate waveguides, which are characterized by the relationship between the width w of an incident laser beam coupled onto an optical waveguide having a thickness t, controlled by λ, the wavelength of the incident lightwave.

The integration of non-SiO2 based oxides directly or indirectly on Si is difficult due to the strong reactivity of Si with oxygen, leading to the formation of a SiO2 or silicate layer at the Si//oxide interface. This layer is generally amorphous and has a low dielectric constant, degrading the usefulness of non-SiO2 based oxides with Si.
2. High-dielectric constant oxide (e.g. a ferroelectric oxide) can have a large dielectric constant, a large spontaneous polarization, and a large electrooptic properties. Ferroelectrics with a large dielectric constant can be used to form high density capacitors but cannot be deposited directly on Si because of the reaction of Si to form a low dielectric constant layer.
3. Putting the high dielectric material on a conductive layer has not solved the problem, as none of the previously suggested materials provides for the epitaxial growth of high dielectrical materials on a conductor or semiconductor. These materials generally either form a silicide, which allows the diffusion of silicon into the high dielectric materials, or react with silicon or react with the high dielectric oxide to form low dielectric constant insulators.
4. The large spontaneous polarization of ferroelectrics when integrated directly on a semiconductor can be used to form a non-volatile, non-destructive readout, field effect memory. However, the formation of the low dielectric constant SiO2 layer acts to reduce the field within the oxide, and the oxide can either poison the Si device or create so many interface traps that the device will not operate properly.
5. Ferroelectrics also have interesting electrooptic applications where epitaxial films are preferred in order to reduce loss due to scattering from grain boundaries and to align the oxide in order to maximize its anisotropic properties. The epitaxial growth on Si or GaAs substrates has previously been accomplished by first growing a very stable oxide or fluoride on the Si or GaAs as a buffer layer prior to growing another type of oxide.

388,"1. The invention is a multiorifice wafer structure and a method for making it. The structure is made by fusing concentric layers of solid rods interspaced with cylindrically shaped members, where each successive layer of rods is disposed at a progressively larger angle with respect to the axis of the fused assembly. The fused assembly is then cut into thin wafers, and the interstices formed between the fused layers of rods and the cylindrical members form a plurality of angularly disposed passageways. The thickness of the wafer is sufficient to impart to the fluid passing through the interstices a directional component parallel to the angular displacement of the rods with respect to the common axis of the structure.

2. The structure comprises a plurality of layers of rods separated by cylindrical members. The interstices between the individual rods and the cylindrical members form a plurality of generally triangularly shaped passageways through the structure, which constitute the orifices through which the fluid to be dispersed or atomized flows. The thickness of the multiorifice structure is selected such that the fluid passing therethrough will, upon exiting the structure, have a directional component parallel to the axis of the interstices.

3. A simple and economical method for fabricating the disclosed multiorifice structure is illustrated in the document. The method involves twisting rods or wires about a core rod and sheathing them in a cylindrical member. A second layer of rods is twisted about the external surface of the cylindrical member and sheathed in a second cylindrical member. The process is repeated until the composite structure of rods and cylindrical members has a diameter equal to the diameter of the desired multiorifice structure. The composite structure is then fused or sintered to form an integral structure. To facilitate the fusion of the rods and the cylindrical members, the rods and cylindrical members may be coated with a thin layer of material having a lower melting temperature than the materials of the rods and cylindrical members. The fused assembly is sliced or cut to produce a plurality of thin multiorifice structures having the desired thickness.",0

The invention provides a method of fabricating a semiconductor device with improved controllability of the width of the oxide portion on the gate sidewall and the ability to form an LDD structure by a low-temperature process. It also prevents degradation of the transconductance and increases in resistances due to hot-carrier injection into the oxide portion on the gate sidewall.
2. The method involves forming an insulating film on the gate electrode, substrate, and sidewall, and then forming a conformal layer on the insulating film and anisotropically etching it away using RIE, leaving a portion on the gate sidewall. The low density region of the source/drain region is formed by ion injection of an impurity using the oxide film of the gate and the insulating film on the gate as a mask. The high density region of the source/drain region is formed by ion injection of an impurity using the insulating film and the insulating film on the gate as a mask. The oxide film portion on the sidewall of the gate is formed of a high melting point metal or a silicide of such a metal. A conductive layer or polycrystalline semiconductor layer is formed after formation of an insulating film on a gate electrode, which is then anisotropically etched away using RIE to form the portion on the gate sidewall. The method also includes siliciding a desired portion of the gate electrode or the gate electrode and the source/drain region in fabricating the insulated gate field effect semiconductor device having the LDD structure.",0

2. Wave energy converters (OWECs) have been proposed but commercialization lags due to high cost and low energy capture efficiency.
3. Most OWECs are near-shore and made of heavy steel, causing low efficiency and high cost.
4. The invention proposes using gas-filled or evacuated containers that deform in response to overhead swell and trough induced static pressure changes.
5. The invention also captures both hydrostatic (heave) and hydrokinetic wave energy (surge or pitch) and enhances energy capture with overhead floating bodies.
6. Prior art devices like Gardner and Van Den Berg use two variable volume gas-filled containers to drive hydraulic turbines or motors.
7. The invention differs from prior art devices like AWS in several ways, including the use of a flexible elastomer bellows, direct or indirect atmospheric venting, and overhead surface floating buoys.
8. The invention also avoids the use of heavy, high maintenance, marine debris fouled ectoskeleton/cage and flexible rolling membrane seal.

The blade has a first side, a second side, a scraper edge, a hinge edge, and at least one mounting hole extending through the blade body near the hinge edge.
2. On each side of the blade, there is an L-shaped locking track with an entry track and an intermediate track that extends to the mounting hole. The locking tracks interfere with the pin to lock the blade against longitudinal movement while permitting pivoting movement relative to the drive shaft.
3. A representative pin includes an inner finger, an outer finger, and a base mounted to the drive shaft. The pin is inserted into the mounting hole, and the fingers slide into the entry tracks and intermediate tracks of the locking tracks.
4. The blade is placed at an angle relative to the pins, and the fingers of the pin align with the entry tracks of the locking tracks. The inner fingers then slide into the entry tracks, holding the blade at an angle.
5. The blade is moved longitudinally so that the inner fingers align with the mounting holes, and the outer finger has traversed the intermediate track. The intermediate slot on one side extends only as far as the hole, while the intermediate slot on the other side extends past the hole to accommodate the width of the outer finger.
6. The blade is then angularly rotated downward into an installation position, where it is at a sufficiently shallow angle to fit within the outer tube of the heat exchanger. The blade cannot travel downward due to interference present on both sides.
7. The entry track on one side is a different width than the entry track on the other side, ensuring that the blade is installed with the correct side facing up. The only way to remove a blade is to raise it until it reaches the positions where it can be slid off the pins.
8. The locking tracks are provided on both sides of the blades to preserve structural rigidity and reduce wear over time. The blade tracks on the fingers are dimensioned with clearance to permit sliding and sufficient interference to prevent out-of-track movements.",0

The device aims to simplify the connection system for high voltage cables with ratings up to 400 KV and above. The invention provides a common cable connection system for all accessories and interconnections, resulting in advantages such as factory pretesting, reduction of installation time and cost, reduction of tools, and simplified field testing.
2. The text illustrates three interface methods, including the inner cone concept, the outer cone concept, and the no cone or slight inner cone concept. The interface could also be obtained by using plane contacting surfaces. The outer cone concept separates the cable connection further from the apparatus it is connected to, making it less likely for a fault at one side to affect the other side. The inner cone concept allows for a shorter solution outside an SF6 cubicle, but may face problems with coned surfaces made by different suppliers.
3. The text also describes various applications of the invention, including SF6 terminals, transformer terminals, out-door terminals, straight through joints, transition joints, and joints between two apparatus. The invention aims to replace conventional terminals with a compact design, lower material and installation cost, and complete independence between gas insulated switch gear and cable installations.

The mechanism comprises a tool, a frame, and a tool holder in the frame of a machine tool. The tool can be a cutting, punching, molding, or forming blade, and the tool holder can be a bushing-like component with clamps.
2. The mechanism uses a curvilinear connecting surface, such as a spherical surface, to connect the tool frame and the tool holder. The curvilinear surface is designed to fulfill the formula r^2 = D^2 + d^2, where r is the radius of curvature, D is the radius of the contact surface, and d is the distance between the center of the radius of curvature and the contact surface. The diameter of the inlay of the connecting element is substantially H=2*r.
3. The tool frame is moved in an inclined position in relation to the mounting direction, and the clamps fixed in connection with the frame draw the tool frame towards the tool holder. The tool frame can then be revolved along the connecting surface to the position where the first contact surface and the second contact surface are in contact with and against each other, ready to receive forces in the mounting direction.
4. The tool frame is released by a propulsive force of the clamps. The clamps comprise a nose provided at their ends and extending in the radial direction towards the tool frame. A groove is provided on the outer surface of the frame of the tool, surrounding the same and functioning as a mounting element.

The invention utilizes switching regulator circuits with multiple circuit paths that carry current in opposite directions to cancel out radiated noise.
2. Conventional charge pump circuits can provide energy without noise but have lower current driving capability due to high internal resistance. Switching regulator circuits, on the other hand, can supply high current but generate radiated energy as part of the switching process.
3. The invention provides a solution for generating relatively large amounts of current for driver circuits of large displays, such as the Apple iPhone display, without incurring typical EMI or noise penalties.
4. In one embodiment, parallel source and drain paths are configured in an alternating relationship, causing EMI generated in source paths to be cancelled by EMI generated in drain paths. This is achieved by placing a source path to ground between each two drain paths configured to provide the output voltage.
5. In another embodiment, the reduction in EMI is more pronounced by using a terminal lead at the periphery edges of the circuit. These terminal leads act as RF antennas to pick up any leaking fields generated by the last fully-connected paths in the circuit.
6. The invention allows for the production of sufficient current to drive circuits for relatively large displays without generating the electromagnetic interference (EMI) typically associated with such circuits. The reduction in EMI can be increased through the use of terminal leads.
7. Media player apparatus operating in accordance with the methods and circuits of the present invention are also provided. The invention produces current sufficient to drive relatively large digital displays, such as the touch screen on the Apple iPhone, without generating the negative effects of high EMI radiation.",0

Vehicle battery rebalancing is a process that corrects cell voltage imbalance conditions by measuring the voltage of each cell, identifying the cell with the minimum voltage, and bleeding down the other cells until their voltages are approximately equal. This process continues until all cell voltage readings are approximately equal, upon which the battery is charged.
2. A power system may include a battery with multiple cells, and a controller that causes the cells to acquire charge for a period of time so that at the end of that period, the voltages of the cells are approximately equal. The rate at which charge is acquired by the cells may differ among at least some of the cells for a determined portion of the period of time.
3. Rebalancing a battery can take up to 50% of the total time required to rebalance and charge a battery. Certain embodiments provide systems and techniques to reduce the time spent rebalancing and charging vehicle batteries, which may be of particular interest to owners of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) or battery electric vehicles (BEVs) who wish to minimize this time.",1

2. After the September 11 attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was passed, creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and establishing security requirements for the agency. However, many of these initiatives were not linked to specific deadlines, making it difficult to monitor and oversee their implementation.
3. In the two years following the ATSA's enactment, TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have taken major steps to increase aviation security, including implementing congressional mandates, exploring technology and information options, and enhancing the security of air traffic control systems and facilities.
4. However, vulnerabilities remain in air cargo, general aviation, and airport perimeter security. TSA has taken some actions to address these potential vulnerabilities, but a comprehensive plan for air cargo security and ongoing work to improve general aviation security are still needed. Additionally, TSA faces longer-term challenges in the areas of risk management, funding, coordination, strategic human capital management, and building a results-oriented organization.",0
401,"1. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) have different definitions of lobbying activities and contacts. LDA only covers lobbying at the federal level, while IRC covers lobbying at federal, state, and local levels. LDA covers a broader range of federal officials for nonlegislative matters, while IRC covers more executive branch officials for legislative matters.
2. Grassroots lobbying, which aims to influence legislation by influencing the public's views, is covered under IRC but not under LDA. Both IRC section 4911 and IRC section 162(e) cover grassroots lobbying at federal, state, and local levels, but IRC section 4911 has a narrower definition than IRC section 162(e). LDA does not require lobbyists to report expenses for contacts with state and local government officials, while IRC lobbying definitions do.
3. The LDA lobbying definition covers only contacts with federal government officials, while IRC definitions require expenses for contacts with state officials to influence state legislation to be included in lobbying expenses. The IRC definitions cover contacts with local government officials to influence local government legislation, but coverage is limited under IRC section 162(e) due to an exception for contacts with local councils on legislation of direct interest to the organization. The amounts spent lobbying state governments can be significant, as seen in 1997 reported spending on lobbying state government officials in California, Washington, and Wisconsin.",0
402,"1. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been assessing strategic sourcing in federal acquisitions for over a decade, finding that leading companies use a strategic approach to services acquisition that includes developing knowledge of spending, establishing commodity managers, and leveraging buying power.
2. Strategic sourcing can encompass various tactics such as leveraged buying, managing demand, standardizing acquisition processes, evaluating total cost of ownership, and managing supplier relationships.
3. GAO reports that the federal government is not fully leveraging its buying power due to decentralized procurement, resulting in agencies acting like unrelated businesses and relying on numerous contracts with varying prices.
4. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implemented strategic sourcing practices in 2005, directing agencies to develop and implement strategic sourcing efforts based on spend analysis results.
5. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) was established in 2005 to address government-wide opportunities for strategic sourcing and eliminate duplication of efforts across agencies.
6. In 2012, GAO found that most agencies leveraged a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing, with only $25.8 billion managed out of $537 billion in federal procurement spending.
7. Agencies reported achieving savings when strategically sourced contracts were used, with savings ranging from 5% to over 20% of spending through these contracts.
8. Realizing cost savings and benefits from strategic sourcing depends on the utilization of contracts, but only 15% of government-wide spending for covered products and services went through FSSI contracts in fiscal year 2011.
9. Challenges to strategic sourcing in the federal setting include obtaining and analyzing reliable data, securing expertise, leadership support, and developing metrics, as well as addressing disincentives for participation.
10. Companies have saved 4% to 15% over prior year spending by strategically sourcing services, emphasizing the importance of analyzing all procurement spending with equal rigor and tailoring tactics to fit the situation.",0
403,"1. The current surface transportation programs in the United States are not effectively addressing the nation's transportation challenges. These programs have been established over half a century without a clear vision of the national interest and federal role, and many are not linked to performance or needs. Additionally, the fiscal sustainability of these programs is in doubt due to increased spending without commensurate increases in revenues. Since the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, the federal role in surface transportation has expanded to include broader goals, more programs, and a variety of program structures. However, this expansion has resulted in a lack of clarity in federal goals and roles, and many programs lack links to needs or performance.
2. Many federal surface transportation programs are not effective at addressing key transportation challenges due to unclear federal goals and roles, and the lack of links to needs or performance. The goals of these programs are numerous and sometimes conflicting, and most highway, transit, and safety grant funds are distributed through formulas that only indirectly relate to needs and may have no relationship to performance. The largest safety grants are more likely to be focused on goals rather than specific transportation systems, and several highway safety and motor carrier safety grants allocate incentive funds on the basis of performance or state efforts to carry out specific safety-related activities. However, since the majority of surface transportation funds are distributed without regard to performance, it is difficult to assess the impact of recent record levels of federal highway expenditures. Mechanisms to link programs to goals also appear insufficient, and surface transportation programs often do not employ the best tools and approaches to ensure effective investment decisions. The solvency of the federal surface transportation program is at risk due to expenditures exceeding revenues, and increased federal funding may not necessarily lead to a commensurate increase in the total investment in highways. A fundamental reexamination of the federal approach to surface transportation problems and a restructuring of federal programs to create more focused, performance-based, and sustainable programs is needed.",0

Robby's Law, enacted in 2000, promotes the adoption of MWDs after their military service, giving first priority to former handlers, then to others capable of humanely caring for the MWD, and finally to law enforcement agencies.

2. The DOD is not liable for any veterinary expenses associated with an adopted MWD's condition before transfer, and while they can establish and maintain a veterinary care system for adopted MWDs, no federal funds may be used for this purpose. The disposition process of MWDs can be initiated at any military location with an MWD program, following Air Force Instruction 31-126 policies and procedures.

3. Handlers interested in adopting an MWD must communicate their interest to the Kennel Master where the MWD is located, and in case of multiple handlers interested, the Unit Commander determines which handler is in the best interest of the MWD. The Army Veterinary Service has the lead responsibility for the medical care of all DOD-owned animals, including MWDs.

4. During the MWD disposition process, Army Veterinary Corps Officers provide a recommendation letter and a consultation/referral form describing each MWD's medical condition and suitability for adoption. The Army maintains a veterinary care system for privately owned animals of individuals with access to medical services at a military installation.

5. The DOD uses three systems to track different types of information about MWDs, including WDMS, the Central Repository, and ROVR. WDMS documents the MWD’s status when it is removed from service, the Central Repository stores copies of records for MWDs that have been removed from service, and ROVR provides medical information for consideration of an MWD’s removal from service.

3. States have used various options and waivers to increase access to food stamps, support working families, and simplify eligibility determination, but some officials have noted difficulties with categorical eligibility and the variation from state to state.",1
414,"1. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for housing assistance, community development, housing finance, and regulatory issues. In 1999, HUD had 9,386 employees and a proposed budget of $28 billion for fiscal year 2000. This represents a 9% increase from the previous fiscal year and is intended to support about $34 billion in discretionary outlays.

2. HUD's housing assistance programs are limited by budgetary constraints and only benefit about one-fourth of those who are eligible. The department provides public housing assistance and private-market housing assistance through section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. HUD also provides community development funds through grants to states, cities, towns, and counties for local economic development, housing development, and assistance to the homeless.

3. HUD's regulatory responsibilities include regulating interstate land sales, home mortgage settlement services, manufactured housing, lead-based paint abatement, and home mortgage disclosures. The department also supports fair housing programs and is partially responsible for enforcing federal fair housing laws.

4. HUD's fiscal year 2000 budget request includes 19 new initiatives and programs, totaling $210 million, and seven set-asides within existing programs. However, there are concerns about HUD's capacity to manage such an increase due to a significant organizational reform and the need for dedicated resources to plan, implement, and manage new initiatives and programs. Additionally, there are questions about the accuracy of HUD's budget proposals for the Section 8 housing assistance program, with inconsistencies identified in past funding requests.",0

The readiness mission provides medical services to the armed forces during contingency operations, while the benefits mission provides medical services to members of the armed forces, their families, and others eligible for DOD health care.
2. DOD's health care mission is carried out through military treatment facilities and civilian health care providers. Military treatment facilities are directly operated and maintained by DOD, while civilian health care providers are contracted through TRICARE.
3. In 2009, DOD conducted a cost-benefit analysis and determined that consolidating the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) and the 86th Medical Group (MDG) clinic into a single facility would be more efficient and cost-effective.
4. The replacement medical center will be operated and maintained by the Army, with the Air Force providing clinical services currently offered at the 86th MDG clinic.
5. The facility requirements for the replacement medical center were determined in 2010, and the process included the preparation of project proposals by the military departments and the identification of types of documentation needed to support the project proposal.
6. The documentation includes the current and projected beneficiary population served in a military treatment facility's catchment area, as well as current and projected staffing and workload data.
7. Army Medical Command, with input from the Air Force Medical Support Agency, developed a report summarizing the projected health care requirements for Military Health System beneficiaries in the areas served by the proposed medical center.
8. The combination of workload data and staffing requirements are key considerations for determining the size and configuration of military treatment facilities.
9. DOD officials considered beneficiary population data, contingency operations, and changes or expected changes in troop strength known at the time when developing the facility requirements.
10. However, recent posture changes, such as the removal of a second brigade combat team currently stationed in Europe, are currently being assessed by military medical officials for their impact on the replacement medical center.",0

This population has grown in recent years, with DHS estimating an increase of half a million from January 2005 to January 2006. The removable alien population also grew by 24% from 8.5 million in January 2000 to 10.5 million in January 2005.
2. ICE investigations resulted in 102,034 apprehensions in 2005, which is about 8% of the total 1.3 million DHS apprehensions. The four main categories that constituted the basis for aliens removed by DHS in 2005 were aliens entering without inspection, aliens attempting to enter the United States without proper documents or through fraud, aliens with criminal convictions or believed to have engaged in certain criminal activities, and aliens who are in violation of their terms of entry.
3. Officers in OI and DRO field offices exercise discretion throughout various phases of the alien apprehension and removal process. However, the initial phases of the process, such as initiating removals, apprehending aliens, issuing removal documents, and detaining aliens, involve the most discretion. Officers typically encounter two types of aliens: those who are the target of an investigation and those who are not the target of an investigation but are encountered through the course of an operation and are subject to removal.
4. Officers have more latitude to exercise discretion when they encounter aliens who are not fugitives or criminals and are not targets of ICE investigations, particularly when encountering aliens with humanitarian issues. The alien apprehension and removal process encompasses six phases, and officers have the most discretion from the time they encounter aliens as part of an operation to the time they determine whether to detain an alien.
5. ICE has updated some of the training it offers to officers responsible for making alien apprehension and removal decisions, including worksite enforcement training, supervisory training for OI supervisors, and Spanish language training for newly hired DRO officers. However, ICE guidance on",0

Medicare payments for ambulance services consist of a service-level payment and a mileage payment. Providers may be affiliated with institutions, be independent, and have different staffing types such as volunteers or paid staff. They may offer basic or advanced life support services. Revenue sources include community tax support, charitable donations, state and federal grants, subscription programs, and payments from Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance companies.
2. In 2010, the costs per transport for ground ambulance providers ranged from $224 to $2,204, with a median cost of $429. Providers with lower transport volumes tended to have higher costs per transport due to fixed costs for maintaining readiness. Other factors affecting cost per transport include level of volunteer staff hours, percentage of Medicare transports that are BLS, percentage of Medicare transports that are super-rural, and level of community tax support.
3. The median Medicare margin, including add-on payments, was about positive 2 percent in 2010 for the 153 providers in the sample. However, when add-on payments were removed, the median Medicare margin decreased to negative 1 percent. From 2004 to 2010, ambulance transports for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries in the nation increased by 33 percent, with transports per 1,000 beneficiaries in super-rural areas growing the most (41 percent).
4. The increase in ambulance transports from 2004 to 2010 is primarily attributable to an increase in BLS nonemergency transports, which rose by 59 percent. Super-rural areas experienced the largest increase in BLS nonemergency transports (82 percent). The increase in Medicare beneficiaries’ use of ambulance services did not appear to be caused by changes in the demographic characteristics of beneficiaries.
5. Representatives from one ambulance provider organization suggested that some of the increase in ambulance transports was attributable to increased billing for Medicare ambulance services at the local-government level",0

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics & Materiel Readiness is responsible for leading the development of DOD supply chain policies and improving accountability, visibility, and control of critical assets, including SRC I ammunition. The Army has a significant role in managing SRC I ammunition, as it procures a majority of the department's ammunition and provides wholesale storage for other military services.
2. DOD policy requires SRC I ammunition to have a higher level of protection and security than other conventional ammunition. DOD and the military services have policy and guidance on how to account for, safeguard, conduct physical inventories, adjust if necessary, track, and ship SRC I ammunition within and between services and to contractors for repair.
3. The military services maintain accountability of SRC I ammunition at various locations in the continental United States, but there are gaps in service-level guidance and procedures for how SRC I ammunition is accounted for across locations. The Air Force does not track SRC I ammunition by serial number and has plans to revise its guidance, while the Navy and Marine Corps track SRC I ammunition by serial number.
4. The military services have automated information systems for managing accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition, and DOD is evaluating various systems to designate as the DOD-wide authoritative source of data for conventional ammunition, including SRC I ammunition.
5. DOD policy calls for continuous program and policy oversight to ensure protection of sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives, and DOD components are required to track and conduct physical inventories of SRC I ammunition by serial number. However, DOD has experienced challenges in implementing hazardous materials regulations and other guidance.
6. In March 2014, DOD found some limitations of the military services' use of automated information systems that affected their ability to facilitate efficient management of conventional ammunition. DOD concurred with the recommendation to select an authoritative source of department-wide ammunition data to improve DOD's ability to provide total asset visibility over conventional ammunition.
7. The military services have generally recorded shipment and receipt of SRC I ammunition in their accountability systems, but the Army and Marine Corps do not have guidance",0

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is the largest collector and user of personal information in the US, responsible for issuing Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and maintaining wage and earnings information. SSA's disclosure policy is designed to protect individuals' privacy rights while allowing for the exchange of records required for administrative and program responsibilities.
2. The Privacy Act of 1974 is the primary law governing the protection of personal privacy by federal agencies, regulating the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information in a system of records. At the time of collection, agencies must inform individuals of the authority for collection, the principal purpose for collection, routine uses for the information, and consequences of not providing the information.
3. SSA's disclosure policy has been revised to comply with about 25 statutes, including the Privacy Act. The policy imposes additional requirements as a condition for disclosure to protect tax information and maintain the pledge of confidentiality made before the Privacy Act was enacted. SSA's policy is more restrictive than most federal agencies regarding disclosures to law enforcement.
4. SSA's disclosure policy allows for the sharing of nontax information with law enforcement under certain conditions, requiring SSA officials to consider factors such as the nature of the alleged criminal activity, requested information, and the agency making the request. The policy is more restrictive than both the law enforcement exception specified under the Privacy Act and the disclosure policies of most federal agencies.
5. SSA's disclosure policy is contained in 20 C.F.R. Part 401 and implemented through regulations in the Program Operations Manual System (POMS) and Emergency Messages. POMS is the primary tool for field offices to make appropriate disclosure decisions when receiving requests from law enforcement agencies.
6. SSA's OIG, the law enforcement component of SSA, is authorized to handle disclosures through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SSA. The OIG investigations staff conducts and coordinates activity related to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of SSA programs and operations.
7. Under the MOU, the OIG can disclose whether a given name and SSN match the name and SSN in SSA records, referred to as SSN verification. The MOU delegates authority to OIG employees at all levels",0

2. RCRA regulates hazardous waste from generation to disposal, and lists specific types of hazardous waste by source or characteristic.
3. Remediation waste, including waste from Superfund cleanups, must be managed under RCRA's stringent requirements if it contains a hazardous component.
4. EPA has considered proposals to amend RCRA's requirements for remediation waste, but stakeholders disagree on many remediation waste issues.
5. EPA's 1996 proposed rule for alternative ways of managing remediation waste was withdrawn due to stakeholder disagreement.
6. EPA plans to issue regulations covering four specific elements affecting remediation waste, but cleanup managers cite three RCRA requirements that create disincentives for industry to clean up previously contaminated sites.
7. Land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and requirements for permits primarily add costs and time to cleanups, and can discourage the cleanup of some sites.
8. Complying with land disposal restrictions and their associated treatment standards can be costly and complex, and may drive parties to use more stringent and costly cleanup technologies.
9. Exempting contaminated soil from RCRA's requirements could reduce treatment costs by up to 80%, but applying the three requirements to remediation waste has led parties to choose less aggressive remedies.",1

However, funding constraints reduced Medicare contractors’ ability to conduct audits and review medical claims. In response, HHS advocated for a dedicated and stable amount of program integrity funding outside of the annual appropriations process. In 1997, HIPAA established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) and provided CMS with dedicated funding to conduct program integrity activities, which increased about 63% from fiscal years 1997 through 2005. MIP funds are used to enter into contracts to promote the integrity of the Medicare program, and CMS allocates MIP funds primarily to support its contractors’ program integrity efforts for the traditional Medicare program.
2. CMS contracts with intermediaries, carriers, and MACs to perform two types of activities: claims processing and program integrity. Their claims processing activities include receiving and paying claims, while program integrity activities include audits, medical review, secondary payer, benefit integrity, provider education, and support for these activities. CMS increased the amount of funding for each of its five program integrity activities from fiscal years 1997 through 2005, with provider education receiving the largest percentage increase. However, CMS officials stated that they generally allocated MIP funds based predominantly on historical funding, but sometimes considered high-level priorities.
3. From fiscal years 1997 through 2005, CMS generally increased the amount of MIP funds spent for each of its five program integrity activities. Increased spending for provider education stemmed from provider concerns about an increased burden on them in the medical review process. CMS developed a more data-driven approach for conducting medical review and increased its emphasis on provider education to focus on individuals’ specific billing errors. CMS also began to use MIP funds for what the agency called provider outreach, which focuses on communicating with groups of providers about Medicare policies, initiatives, and significant programmatic changes that could affect their billing.
4. CMS tracks dollars saved in relation to dollars spent for its medical review and secondary payer activities, which is a quantitative measure called a return on investment (ROI). However, CMS tracks the ROI for audit, but by fiscal year 2002,",0

Screeners' abilities to detect dangerous objects declined further in the late 1990s as testing objects became more realistic. In April 2004, it was found that screeners' performance continued to be a concern, with weaknesses identified in their ability to detect threat objects. The 9/11 Commission also identified the need to improve screener performance and better understand the reasons for performance problems.
2. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was signed into law, creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and giving it responsibility for securing all modes of transportation, including aviation. TSA oversees security operations at the nation's more than 450 commercial airports, including passenger and checked baggage screening operations. TSA classifies airports into one of five security risk categories based on various factors, such as the total number of takeoffs and landings annually, the extent to which passengers are screened at the airport, and other special security considerations.
3. To prepare screeners to perform screening functions, TSA provides three categories of required screener training: basic training, recurrent training, and remedial training. However, TSA has faced challenges in providing access to recurrent training due to insufficient staffing and a lack of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity at some training facilities. TSA has acknowledged these challenges and is taking steps to address them, but does not have a plan for prioritizing and scheduling the deployment of high-speed connectivity to all airport training facilities once funding is available.
4. TSA has enhanced its basic screener training program by updating the training to reflect changes to standard operating procedures, deploying a new dual-function (passenger and checked baggage screening) basic training curriculum, and allowing the option of training delivery by local staff. However, a recent study by the DHS OIG found that while incorporating the standard operating procedures into the curricula was a positive step, a number of screener job tasks were incompletely addressed in or were absent from the basic training courses. In April 2004, TSA developed and implemented a new basic screener",0

It does not buy or sell loans or issue MBS, but instead guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on MBS backed by these loans. Ginnie Mae has several different products, including Ginnie Mae I, Ginnie Mae II, and Multiclass Securities Program, which offer varying levels of customization and risk management for investors.
2. Ginnie Mae's market share of new MBS issuance has declined significantly over the past 20 years, from 42% in 1985 to 7% in 2004, due to rapid growth in the conventional MBS market. However, Ginnie Mae continues to finance the great majority of FHA and VA loans, and its securities represent roughly 90% of the market for FHA and VA loans. Ginnie Mae's market share of outstanding MBS has also declined, from 54% in 1985 to 10% in 2004.
3. Ginnie Mae faces potential competition from other secondary market entities, such as FHLBanks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, state and local government agencies, and private label issuers. However, Ginnie Mae has consistently captured 90% or more of the market for FHA and VA loans due to the difficulty of competing with the government guarantee of timely payment.
4. Ginnie Mae's share of the total MBS market has declined due to the growth of the conventional MBS market and the decline in FHA and VA loan origination.

The U.S. government supported the DNS's implementation and began transitioning technical responsibility to the private sector in 1998. ICANN, a not-for-profit organization, was established to manage the DNS, with a focus on increasing competition, stability, security, representation, and private, bottom-up coordination. However, ICANN has faced challenges in accomplishing the transition and implementing the White Paper's guiding principles.

2. ICANN made significant progress in promoting competition by increasing the number of registrars from one to over 180, reducing the cost of securing names, and expanding the pool of available domain names. However, efforts to address the security and stability of the Internet, ensure representation of the Internet community in domain name policy-making, and use private, bottom-up coordination have been slower. ICANN's president concluded that ICANN faced serious problems and established an internal committee to recommend reform options.

3. The White Paper designated the stability and security of the Internet as the top priority of the transition. ICANN and the Department were tasked with developing operational requirements and security policies to enhance the stability and security of the root servers. However, several efforts to address the security and stability of the Internet are behind schedule, including developing operational requirements, security policies, and formalizing relationships with other entities involved in running the DNS. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of the DNS to the stability and security of the entire Internet.",0

2. Once electricity is generated, it is sent through high-voltage transmission lines to local distributors, then transformed into a lower voltage and sent through local distribution lines for consumption. The operation of an electric power system requires constant balancing of generation and consumption.
3. Utilities and others own electricity assets, such as generation plants, transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations. System operators manage electricity flows using control systems, which monitor and control sensitive processes and physical functions.
4. For many years, the electricity network lacked technologies, such as sensors, to monitor electricity flow, communications networks to integrate parts of the grid with control centers, and computerized control devices to automate system management.
5. As the electricity industry has matured and technology has advanced, utilities have begun updating the electricity grid by integrating new technologies and IT systems and networks.
6. A broader, more integrated vision for transforming the electricity grid, known as the smart grid, has emerged. The smart grid would increase the use of IT systems and networks and two-way communication to automate actions that system operators formerly had to make manually.
7. Smart grid initiatives have commonly involved installing advanced metering infrastructure on homes and commercial buildings, adding ""smart"" components to provide detailed data on transmission and distribution systems, and improving overall condition observation of the grid.

The decision to extend TARP was made at the highest levels within the Treasury Department and involved considerable deliberation on the effectiveness of existing government actions and potential policy options.

2. The Treasury Department used a variety of quantitative indicators, such as surveys, financial market prices and quantities, and measures of program utilization, to inform its decision-making process. However, the performance of these indicators and their impact on program decisions were not always clear. Treasury has yet to identify clear program objectives for small business lending, which raises questions about when government assistance can be removed.",0

439,"1. The baby boomer generation, those born between 1946 and 1964, are beginning to reach retirement age, which will lead to significant changes in the ratio of working-age individuals to retirees, known as the ""aged dependency ratio."" This ratio is projected to increase from 21% in 2000 to 35% in 2030, meaning there will be fewer than three working-age individuals for every person aged 65 or older.
2. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is due not only to the growing numbers of older individuals but also to the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers. From 1950 to 1990, the labor force under 55 grew at an average annual rate of 1.9%, but from 1990 to 2000, the growth rate slowed to 1.0%, and it is projected to further slow to 0.3% from 2000 to 2025.
3. Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy, such as the elimination of the practice of reducing Social Security benefits for beneficiaries who have earnings and have reached the normal retirement age, and the increase in the delayed retirement credit, may encourage older individuals to work longer.
4. The aging of the baby boomer generation and a general trend in greater labor force participation among older individuals will lead to a substantial increase in the number of older workers over the next two decades. In 2000, 18.4 million persons over age 55 were in the labor force, and this number is projected to increase to 31.8 million in 2015.
5. The labor force participation rates of older workers, especially women, are expected to increase in the coming years. The labor force participation rate of women between the ages of 55 and 64 has been steadily increasing and is projected to further increase to 61% by 2015. The labor force participation rate of women age 65 and older is also expected to increase to 10% by 2015.",0

The program aims to boost international business and tourism, as well as airline revenues, and create economic benefits to the United States.
2. The VWP has expanded from 8 to 36 countries since its inception, with current member countries shown in Figure 1. To qualify for the VWP, a country must offer reciprocal visa-free travel privileges to U.S. citizens, have a low refusal rate for business and tourism visas, issue machine-readable passports, and meet other requirements.
3. In 2008, DHS created the Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating countries' adherence to program requirements. DHS also established an interagency working group to help fulfill its responsibilities.
4. Since the 9/11 attacks, Congress has passed several laws to strengthen border security policies and procedures, including the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 and the 9/11 Act.
5. The 9/11 Act increased the frequency of assessments of each country's continued participation in the VWP and added security requirements for all VWP countries.
6. DHS implemented ESTA in 2008 to assist in assessing passengers' eligibility to travel to the United States under the VWP by air or sea before they board a U.S. bound carrier.
7. ESTA requires passengers to provide biographical information and answer eligibility questions before traveling to the United States. DHS uses ESTA to electronically collect VWP applicants' biographical information and responses to eligibility questions.
8. DHS has taken steps to minimize the burden associated with ESTA's use, such as reducing the requirement that passengers provide biographical information to DHS officials from every trip to once every 2 years.
9. However, DHS has not fully analyzed the risks of carrier and passenger noncompliance with the ESTA requirement, and most travel industry officials have expressed dissatisfaction over ESTA fees.",0
441,"1. State child welfare systems, which receive funding from the federal government, are responsible for protecting children and have seen a significant increase in the number of children in foster care over the past decade.
2. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes and to provide services to families and children with the goal of reuniting them.
3. Federal law requires that a state develop a case plan for each child in foster care and that a permanency hearing be held within 18 months to determine the child's future status.
4. In response to the prolonged stays of children in foster care, 26 states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing.
5. These state laws, like federal law, do not require that a final decision be made at the first hearing, but some states, like Ohio and Minnesota, have requirements for earlier permanency decisions.
6. States have implemented various operational and procedural changes to expedite and improve the permanency process, including low-cost, creative methods for financing and providing services that address specific barriers to reuniting families.
7. Some states are experimenting with concurrent planning, which involves working towards reunification while also developing an alternate plan for permanently removing the child if reunification efforts fail.
8. The success of these initiatives is often dependent on local leadership involvement, consensus building, and sustained resources, but the lack of evaluation information can hinder the ability to fully understand their overall impact.",0

3. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury have taken steps to implement the DATA Act, but challenges remain.
4. OMB and Treasury have issued additional guidance and improved the design of the pilot program, but implementation issues persist.
5. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified areas where improvements are needed, such as clarifying data definitions and aligning the release of technical guidance.
6. The GAO has also recommended that OMB and Treasury establish processes to determine the complete population of agencies required to report spending data under the DATA Act.
7. OMB has not yet provided a list of agencies that have determined they are exempt from reporting under the DATA Act, nor has it established procedures for ensuring non-exempt agencies are reporting spending data as required.
8. The GAO has identified the need for OMB and Treasury to request updated implementation plans from non-Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies required to report federal spending data under the DATA Act.

443,"1. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has an agreement with the Administrative Resource Center (ARC) to provide contracting support for a fee. ARC is a part of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt and operates as a self-supporting franchise fund.
2. The agreement between OSC and ARC is a mechanism for interagency contracting, which typically involves three parties: the requiring agency, the ordering agency, and the contractors. The requiring agency determines the goods or services needed, and the contracting officer at the ordering agency awards and administers the contract.
3. OSC recently used 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to hire intermittent consultants to assist with its primary mission of protecting federal employees from prohibited personnel practices. This authority allows agencies to appoint experts or consultants without regard to competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements.
4. In contracting with MPRI for an organizational assessment, OSC failed to follow proper procedures, such as seeking competition among Schedule vendors and demonstrating the necessity of a sole-source order. OSC officials also performed duties reserved for the contracting officer without authorization or training.
5. GSA's Schedule program is considered a competitive procedure, and ordering offices are required to promote and provide full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding government contracts. However, sole-source orders can be approved if supplies or services are available from only one responsible source.
6. ARC approved a written sole-source justification prepared by OSC, but the justification did not contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify a sole-source order. OSC officials also communicated the requirement orally to vendors instead of using a documented request for quotes or other solicitation tool.
7. OSC officials stated that MPRI offered a ""no-frills"" approach that met their needs, but the absence of a solicitation instrument makes it impossible to determine whether MPRI and the other vendors were responding to the same set of requirements.
8. OSC employees may seek redress for alleged prohibited personnel practices through OSC, MSPB, or EEO complaints. However, addressing allegations against the Special Counsel or Deputy Special Counsel within OSC is unworkable due to conflicts of interest.
9. Current OSC policy and procedures do not provide for special handling of complaints against the Special Counsel",0

It is the second largest federal department and has three major components: Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA).
2. VA's IT infrastructure is critical to delivering benefits and services to veterans, with approximately 340,000 employees using 167 medical centers, 800 community-based outpatient clinics, 300 veterans centers, 56 regional offices, and 221 national and state cemeteries. The department operates around 240 information systems, managing 314,000 desktop computers, 30,000 laptops, and nearly 460,000 network user accounts.
3. VA's VBA provides benefits such as disability compensation, educational opportunities, assistance with home ownership, and life insurance, while VHA offers health care services and performs research to improve veterans' needs. NCA provides burial and memorial benefits to veterans and their families.
4. VA's IT systems, like VBMS, are essential for determining benefits, processing claims, admitting patients, and accessing health records. However, some systems are outdated, such as the 53-year-old Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system and the 51-year-old Benefits Delivery Network (BDN).
5. In 2014, VA issued a 6-year strategic plan to increase veterans' access to benefits and services, eliminate the disability claims backlog, and end veteran homelessness, emphasizing improved technology and coordinated data entry systems.
6. VA spent around $3.9 billion on IT resources in fiscal year 2015, with $548 million on new systems development, $2.3 billion on maintaining existing systems, and $1 billion on payroll and administration. The department requested approximately $4.3 billion for IT in fiscal year 2017.

2. The Medicare program is divided into two parts: hospital insurance (Part A) and supplementary medical insurance (Part B), with different coverage and premium requirements.
3. HCFA has been granted increased authority and responsibility to combat fraud and abuse in the Medicare program through recent legislation, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
4. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced new health plan options and payment reforms, and expanded health plan choices available to Medicare beneficiaries.
5. HCFA is facing challenges in implementing these legislative reforms, including modernizing its information systems, addressing computer problems, and managing the transition from paper claims processing to electronic claims processing.
6. HCFA managers have expressed concerns about the distribution of agency resources, the need for specialized expertise, the loss of institutional experience, and reorganization issues.
7. The agency is facing a shortage of staff dedicated to contractor oversight, which is a concern in light of past reports of inadequate oversight and improper Medicare payments.
8. HCFA is also facing a loss of experienced staff, which is making it difficult to implement multiple new payment systems concurrently and may impact the agency's ability to carry out other Medicare program objectives.",0

However, the administration's reauthorization proposal aims to change FAA's financing system to one based more on cost-based charges.
2. Under the proposed system, funding for the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) would come primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft, while contributions from the General Fund would cover ATO costs of providing services to military and other public aircraft. Funding for Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Essential Air Service (EAS), and part of Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) would come from an equal fuel tax on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers.
3. The administration's proposal also calls for changing FAA's budget structure by establishing two new budget accounts—Air Traffic Organization and Safety and Operations—to align with FAA's lines of business and proposed funding. These two new accounts would replace the Operations and F&E accounts, while the AIP and RE&D accounts would be retained.",1

They have implemented the FTS2001 program to provide long-distance telecommunications services, with two contracts awarded to Sprint and MCI WorldCom in 1998 and 1999, respectively.
2. The FTS2001 contracts guarantee each firm minimum revenues of $750 million over the life of the contracts, which run for four base years and have four 1-year-extension options. Federal agencies spent approximately $614 million on FTS2001 services during fiscal year 2003 alone.
3. GSA is now planning its FTS Networx acquisition program, which aims to replace the existing FTS2001, Federal Wireless Telecommunications Service, and FTS Satellite Service contracts. The Networx program has five goals, including meeting agency needs, obtaining best value, encouraging competition, responding to the changing marketplace, and providing expanded opportunities for small businesses.
4. The Networx program calls for two acquisitions: Networx Universal and Networx Select. Networx Universal seeks to ensure the continuity of services and prices found under expiring contracts, while Networx Select provides agencies with leading-edge services and solutions with less extensive geographic and service coverage.
5. GSA faces significant challenges in finalizing the Networx program strategy, including ensuring adequate inventory information, establishing measures of success, structuring and scheduling the contracts, and initiating implementation planning actions.
6. GSA has not yet established a comprehensive set of corresponding performance measures for the Networx acquisition program, which is important for making properly informed acquisition planning decisions and for enabling accountable program management.

These grants were awarded through standard review processes and were distributed across three categories, with varying award sizes, geographic distribution, award durations, and research methods.
2. Recipients of Recovery Act funding, including NIH grantees, are required to report on the number of jobs supported by the Recovery Act on a quarterly basis to the nationwide data collection system at www.federalreporting.gov. The reported number of jobs is expressed in terms of full-time equivalents (FTEs), which are calculated based on the total number of hours worked and funded by the Recovery Act within a reporting quarter.
3. NIH has processes in place for reporting the use of Recovery Act funds and assesses the quality of reports filed by NIH Recovery Act grantees. NIH and NIH Recovery Act grantees collect information about the FTEs supported by NIH Recovery Act funding from various sources, including the www.federalreporting.gov Web site and annual progress reports submitted by grantees.
4. NIH is also participating in the development of a multiagency collaboration called Star Metrics to track the employment, scientific, and economic impacts of its funded research projects, including Recovery Act grants. NIH gathers information from principal investigators working on priority research areas and prepares publicly available reports about the potential scientific impacts of NIH-funded research.
5. According to NIH officials, Recovery Act funds could eventually support a total of approximately 54,000 FTEs. This estimate is projected based on the quarterly expenditure of funds reported by grantee institutions and the projected number of FTEs that NIH expects that these funds could support over the life of the Recovery Act.
6. NIH officials reported that the Star Metrics program is expected to release preliminary results regarding jobs in 2012. Like other NIH Recovery Act grantee institutions, data reported by the five grantee institutions in this study also showed a general increase in FTEs supported by NIH Recovery Act funding.

TODs can increase access to opportunities, promote transportation options, and reduce road congestion. They can vary in size and scope and are influenced by a variety of factors, including local government policies, real estate market conditions, and construction costs.
2. A range of stakeholders are involved in TOD planning and implementation, including local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, metropolitan-planning organizations, local governments, regional councils, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD but does not have a discrete TOD program. However, the FTA has been expanding its role in TOD through research, coordination with other agencies, and a transit-oriented development planning pilot program.
3. FTA considers several factors when assessing proposed projects for New Starts funding, including local government financial commitment, mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, economic development effects, land use, and cost-effectiveness. Two of these criteria, economic development effects and land use, require documentation related to whether current and future land use is supportive of transit. FTA evaluates many of the same factors that support TOD when assigning ratings for these criteria.
4. Local officials and a developer noted that the strength of the real estate market is critical for TOD, but market conditions can change significantly between FTA’s assessment and the beginning of transit operations. Factors such as Houston’s “car culture” and housing preferences of millennials can also be challenging to quantify and evaluate.
5. Among the case studies assessed for New Starts funding, the amount of TOD realized and the factors that local stakeholders told us supported or hindered TOD were generally consistent with FTA’s pre-construction evaluation and rating of factors related to TOD. However, the actual ridership performance of the transit lines when compared to ridership expectations or historical ridership varies.
6. To support TOD, local governments can use a variety of policies, including zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. These tools are most successful when they align with local residents’ preferences and market demand for development. FTA’s assessment of",0

2. The PEBES will provide workers with benefit estimates, help them plan for their financial future, and ensure accurate earnings records, which are crucial for determining Social Security benefits eligibility and size.
3. The PEBES estimates are based on assumptions about workers' future employment and earnings, and while generally reasonable, they may over- or understate benefits for certain individuals, such as federal workers eligible for both Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security benefits.
4. SSA has conducted surveys and focus groups to gather feedback on the PEBES, resulting in revisions like adding an early retirement estimate and making the statement understandable at a seventh-grade reading level.
5. Overall, public reaction to receiving an unsolicited PEBES has been positive, with most respondents indicating they were glad to receive the statement and found the information helpful.
6. However, the current PEBES still provides too much information, potentially overwhelming readers, and its design and organization could be improved to make it more user-friendly.
7. SSA officials have acknowledged the need for improvements and have revised the Commissioner's message for the 1997 PEBES, but concerns remain about the statement's complexity and the public's understanding of the information presented.
8. To enhance the PEBES' value, SSA should consider factors beyond printing costs, such as ensuring effective communication, addressing public confusion, and fostering public confidence in SSA and its programs.",1
452,"1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two disability programs: Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs use the same definition of disability, but have different program purposes and requirements for entitlement. DI is an insurance program for individuals who have a work history and have paid into the system, while SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources. Concurrent beneficiaries, who receive benefits from both programs, make up about 14% of SSA's disability population and are more likely to have mental impairments and be female.
2. Both programs have work incentive provisions to encourage beneficiaries to return to work, but the provisions differ in terms of the level of safeguards for continuing eligibility, income, and medical coverage. Earnings can affect an SSI beneficiary's cash benefit immediately, while earnings do not affect a DI beneficiary's cash benefit for a period of time known as the trial work period. However, benefits will eventually stop completely if a DI beneficiary's earnings exceed a specified level. SSA has faced challenges in serving concurrent beneficiaries effectively due to the complexity of its programs and the specialization of most field office staff in either the DI or SSI program. SSA has taken steps to improve service to concurrent beneficiaries and increase the accuracy of their payments by better coordinating the administrative process related to work activity, but these initiatives are still being tested and evaluated.",0

However, a 2013 survey found that most federal managers lacked recent evaluations of their programs. Managers who had evaluations reported that they contributed to understanding program performance, assessing program effectiveness, making changes to improve program management, and sharing what works with others.
2. A 2014 survey of Performance Improvement Officers (PIOs) found that about half the 24 agencies had committed resources to obtain credible evaluations, but only six of these agencies had stable funding or agency-wide evaluation plans. GPRAMA, a law established in 2014, requires agencies to establish priority goals and report on their progress quarterly, and charges the PIO with promoting the agencies’ use of evaluation and other evidence to improve program performance.

About 40 percent of federal managers reported having access to recent evaluations of their programs, while another 39 percent reported that they did not know if an evaluation had been conducted. Managers who had evaluations reported that they contributed to improving program management or performance and assessing program effectiveness, but fewer reported that they contributed to allocating program resources or informing the public. An estimated 18 percent of managers reported not having any evaluations, while twice as many managers reported that they did not know if an evaluation had been conducted.",0

Federal efforts to promote the employment of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce include special hiring authorities, such as the Schedule A excepted service hiring authority and appointments for veterans with disabilities. To qualify for a Schedule A appointment, an applicant must provide proof of disability and a certification of job readiness.

2. Executive Order 13548 requires federal agencies to develop plans for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities, designate a senior-level official to oversee these efforts, and improve return-to-work outcomes for employees who sustain work-related injuries and illnesses. The executive order also calls for OPM and Labor to oversee the successful implementation of these goals. The federal government tracks the number of individuals with disabilities in the workforce through OPM’s Standard Form 256, Self-Disclosure of Disability (SF-256).

3. In July 2010, the Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) Initiative was established to improve agency return-to-work outcomes by setting performance targets, collecting and analyzing injury and illness data, and prioritizing safety and health management programs. OWCP reviews FECA claims and makes decisions on eligibility and payments. A GAO forum identified leading practices that agencies could implement to help the federal government become a model employer of people with disabilities, including top leadership commitment, accountability, regular surveying of the workforce on disability issues, better coordination within and across agencies, training for staff at all levels, career development opportunities, a flexible work environment, and centralized funding at the agency level for reasonable accommodations.

4. OPM issued a memorandum in November 2010 outlining the key requirements of the executive order and what elements must be included in agency disability hiring plans. OPM contracted with a private firm to recruit and manage a list of Schedule A-certified individuals from which federal agencies can hire.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for managing public lands and resources, and it has been working on the ALMRS/Modernization project to automate land and mineral records and case processing activities. The project includes three main components: ALMRS Initial Operating Capability (IOC), Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and technology modernization and rehost of selected systems.
2. The ALMRS IOC component will support case processing activities and provide information for land and resource management activities. The GCDB component will contain geographic coordinates and survey information for land parcels, and other databases will be integrated with GCDB. The technology modernization component involves installing computer and telecommunications equipment and converting selected management and administrative systems to a relational database system.
3. The ALMRS/Modernization project has faced funding limitations, and BLM has had to delay the initial hardware installation for the Alaska and Wyoming state, district, and resource area offices to stay within the fiscal year 1995 limit. The project is also expected to exceed the fiscal year 1996 limit by $25.2 million.
4. The development of ALMRS IOC software is currently on schedule, with about 270,000 lines of code developed so far. The GCDB component is behind schedule in one state office, Montana, but the final test of the software to convert existing data files to INFORMIX is scheduled to be completed by January 12, 1996.
5. The administrative systems rehost effort is on schedule, with all 13 of the planned software applications and related databases converted from COBOL to INFORMIX. Three of these applications have been rehosted to the ALMRS/Modernization equipment and are operational.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an independent organization affiliated with the United Nations that promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy and ensures the security of nuclear materials. It is governed by the General Conference and the Board of Governors, and its activities are overseen by the Director General. The IAEA derives its authority from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other regional nonproliferation treaties, as well as bilateral agreements with states.
2. The NPT, which came into force in 1970, requires non-nuclear weapon states to conclude an agreement with the IAEA that applies safeguards to all source and special nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the state's territory, jurisdiction, or control. The five nuclear weapons states that are parties to the NPT are not obligated to accept IAEA safeguards, but they have voluntarily entered into legally binding safeguards agreements with the IAEA.
3. The IAEA's safeguards objectives are to account for the amount of a specific type of material necessary to produce a nuclear weapon and to detect any diversion of nuclear material from peaceful use to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes. The IAEA uses a set of activities, such as inspections, material-accounting measures, containment measures, and surveillance devices, to meet these objectives.

The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), established in 1975, is a group of countries that seeks to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons by controlling the export of nuclear materials and technology. The NSG guidelines require member countries to accept IAEA safeguards at facilities using controlled nuclear-related items and to require countries receiving nuclear exports to agree to IAEA safeguards as a condition of supply.
5. The IAEA has taken steps to strengthen safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program. The first strengthened safeguards steps, which began in the early 1990s, increased the agency's ability to monitor declared and undeclared activities at nuclear facilities. The second series of steps began in 1997 with the approval of the Additional Protocol, which broadened the IAEA's authority and the requirements on countries under existing saf",0

The Year 2000 computing crisis poses a significant risk to critical services provided by the government and private sector, potentially causing disruptions in financial transactions, flights, power supply, and national defense. The problem is further compounded by the interdependencies among various economic sectors and governments. Key economic sectors at risk include information and telecommunications, banking and finance, health, safety, and emergency services, transportation, power and water, and manufacturing and small business. The information and telecommunications sector is particularly important, as it is critical to the operations of most organizations.

Agencies are also required to establish administrative mechanisms for affected persons to seek correction of information and report on IQA complaints.
2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) are responsible for developing governmentwide IQA guidelines and assisting agencies in meeting the act's requirements. However, communication and outreach efforts were concentrated on cabinet-level and regulatory agencies, leaving many independent agencies without IQA guidelines.
3. IQA requests declined from over 24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004, primarily due to changes in how the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) addressed flood insurance rate map correction requests. In fiscal year 2004, over half of the substantive IQA correction requests originated from businesses, trade groups, or other profit-oriented organizations.
4. The implementation of IQA has not been overly burdensome for agencies, but it has increased workloads for certain program staff or units involved in creating IQA guidelines and addressing IQA correction requests. Agencies do not have mechanisms in place to track the effects of implementing IQA, making it difficult to determine the impact on agency operations.",1
464,"1. Both mutual funds and banks act as financial intermediaries, but mutual funds invest primarily in securities while banks make loans or invest in debt securities.
2. The importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with companies increasingly turning to securities markets for their financial needs.
3. Securitization, where banks provide initial financing for loans that are then sold as securities, has further diminished the role of bank loans.
4. Nonbank financial intermediaries, such as securities firms and insurance companies, have also increased their provision of direct loans.
5. The growth of mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, with sizable amounts of money being attracted away from deposits.
6. The total impact of mutual funds on deposits is estimated to be sizable but probably less than $700 billion for the period 1990 through 1994.
7. The shift from deposits to mutual funds has not affected the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy.
8. The funds' purchases of securities have become a greater source of new finance to the economy than bank lending.
9. The availability of finance for different borrower sectors could be disproportionately affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds.
10. Securitization has had indirect effects on the availability of credit for residential, consumer, and business sectors, but these effects cannot be quantified.",1

The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 requires specific activities related to bioterrorism preparedness and response, including increasing coordination and planning for such events, developing priority countermeasures, and improving state, local, and hospital preparedness and response. The Act also calls for the establishment of an integrated system or systems of public health alert communications and surveillance networks among federal, state, and local public health officials, public and private health-related laboratories, hospitals, and other health care facilities, and any other entities that the Secretary determines are appropriate.
2. Since fiscal year 2002, HHS has funded over $2.7 billion for public health preparedness efforts through grants administered by CDC and just over $1 billion for hospital preparedness grants administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. HHS has also encouraged the integration of health care system response plans with public health department plans by incorporating both public health preparedness and hospital performance goals into the agreements that the department uses to fund state and local public health preparedness improvements.
3. Federal actions to encourage the use of IT for health care delivery and public health have been accelerated, including the President's goal that health records for most Americans should be electronic within 10 years and the appointment of a National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. The President's executive order also called for the development of a strategic plan to guide the implementation of interoperable health IT in the public and private health care sectors.
4. HHS has identified seven key areas for improvement in public health preparedness: preparedness planning and readiness assessment, surveillance and epidemiology capacity, laboratory capacity for handling biological agents, laboratory capacity for handling chemical agents, health alert network/communication and IT, risk communication and health information dissemination, and education and training.
5. State health departments have primary responsibility for disease surveillance in the United States, but total responsibility is shared among health care providers, local county, city, and tribal health departments, state and territorial health departments, public and private laboratories, and public health officials from multiple federal agencies. Health care providers play an important role in disease surveillance by helping to identify and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

These changes include revising benefit formulas, converting some plans to hybrid plans, and freezing others. A significant number of sponsors reported increasing the generosity of their DB plan formulas for bargaining employees, while decreasing it for nonbargaining employees.
2. The main reasons cited for changing the benefit formulas of plans covering nonbargaining employees were unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements, while global or domestic competitive pressures were the key reasons for changes to plans covering collectively bargained employees. Sponsors were more likely to convert DB plans covering nonbargaining unit employees to hybrid plan designs than to convert DB plans covering collectively bargained employees.

467,"1. The Refugee Act of 1980 provides a systematic and permanent procedure for admitting refugees to the United States and encourages them to become self-sufficient as quickly as possible. The federal government, in coordination with state and local governments and private organizations, determines the maximum number of refugees that can be admitted each year, with the number actually resettled typically below this maximum.

2. Refugees are assigned to live in communities throughout the United States based on an evaluation of the communities' capacity to serve them. Nine national voluntary agencies, with a network of about 350 affiliates, determine where individual refugees will live. The number of refugees arriving in each state varies, with the top 20 countries of origin including Iraq, Burma, and Bhutan.

3. Receiving communities have had to adjust their language capabilities and services to meet the needs of diverse refugee populations, which can include individuals who have lived in refugee camps for years, have little formal education or work experience, or have untreated medical or mental health conditions.

4. Three federal agencies are involved in the refugee resettlement process: the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) approves refugees for admission to the United States, the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) processes refugees overseas and partially funds services to meet their immediate needs, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides temporary resettlement assistance to refugees.

5. ORR funds cash and medical assistance as well as social services to help refugees become economically self-sufficient. ORR provides these funds through grants to state refugee coordinators, who may be employed by a state agency or by a nonprofit organization. States also receive funding from ORR to award discretionary grants to communities particularly affected by large numbers of refugees.

6. National voluntary agencies consider a variety of factors when proposing the number of refugees to be resettled in each community, including the community's capacity to serve refugees and the refugees' employment goals. Local affiliates of these agencies typically consider both their own internal capacity and community-based factors, such as housing availability and employment opportunities.

7. However, national voluntary agencies may adjust the numbers proposed by local affiliates, and local affiliates have an incentive to maintain or increase the number of refugees they resettle each year due to funding",0

2. Over the years, Congress has enacted legislation to strengthen NFIP, including mandatory purchase requirements and grant programs for properties with repetitive flooding losses.
3. NFIP offers subsidized and full-risk premiums, with about 40 to 45 percent of policies having subsidized rates, but these subsidies have led to long-term risk and financial challenges.
4. Increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss, including catastrophic losses, would result in more accurate premium rates, decrease costs for taxpayers, and encourage private market participation.

4. The 287(g) program is currently managed by ICE’s Office of State and Local Coordination (OSLC) and is part of the ACCESS program.
5. There are three models for state/local law enforcement participation in the 287(g) program: jail model, task force model, and joint model.
6. The 287(g) program has grown rapidly in recent years, with funding provided by DHS appropriations acts since fiscal year 2006.
7. Participating state/local law enforcement agencies may apply for financial assistance to cover some costs associated with the program.
8. The 287(g) program lacks certain management controls, such as documented program objectives and specific program information.
9. ICE has not consistently articulated how participating agencies are to use their 287(g) authority or described the nature and extent of ICE supervision.

472,"1. In the late 1970s, First City Bancorporation of Texas, a principal lender in the Southwest's energy industry, experienced financial difficulties as the industry struggled. By 1986, First City was reporting operating losses. In 1988, FDIC and First City entered into a recapitalization agreement, which included a $970 million capital infusion from FDIC and $500 million of private capital. The agreement aimed to reduce the number of subsidiary banks and create a collecting bank to dispose of troubled assets.
2. Between 1988 and 1990, the recapitalized First City banks pursued an aggressive growth policy, increasing assets from about $10.9 billion to $13.9 billion. However, the banks' loan portfolios included high-risk loans, and by September 1990, problems with the quality of the loan portfolios caused operating losses and eroded capital. OCC criticized the lending practices of First City's lead bank, First City-Houston, and required changes in senior executive management and formal supervisory agreements.
3. Despite improvements in underwriting criteria, reduced aggressive high-risk lending practices, and actions to recapitalize, the First City banks failed between September 1990 and October 1992. Problems in the loan portfolios, the continued decline in the Texas economy, weaker-than-anticipated loan portfolios in the recapitalized banks, questionable lending activity by First City management, and high bank operating expenses contributed to the banks' financial difficulties.
4. In early 1991, OCC and FDIC representatives began working on a plan for early intervention and resolution of First City-Houston. They considered three types of transactions: Type A (acquisition by a stronger institution), Type B (major capital infusion by an outside investor), and Type C (a self-rescue by the banking organization). First City initially favored a Type B transaction but later pursued a Type A transaction almost exclusively.
5. In October 1991, OCC, FDIC, and First City developed a proposal for the banks' acquisition by a stronger institution, with the possible need for FDIC financial assistance",0

The act aimed to replace multiple grant audits with a single audit of an entity as a whole, promoting sound financial management and effective internal control.
2. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 further refined the act, establishing uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients, ensuring a more cost-beneficial threshold for requiring single audits, and focusing audit work on programs with the greatest financial risk to the federal government.
3. The Single Audit Act requires state and local governments receiving at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance to have a single audit conducted annually, with grantees addressing material noncompliance and internal control weaknesses in a corrective action plan.
4. The PCIE report, released in 2006, identified concerns with single audit quality, including insufficient evidence related to audit planning, internal control and compliance testing, and adherence to GAGAS. The report recommended revising and improving single audit standards, criteria, and guidance, as well as establishing minimum continuing professional education for auditors.

The PCIE report emphasized the need for hands-on training covering critical and unique parts of a single audit, such as determining major programs for testing, reviewing and testing internal controls over compliance, compliance testing, auditing procedures applicable to the SEFA, and using the OMB Compliance Supplement.",0
474,"1. Medicare, a federal health insurance program, currently uses health insurers to process and pay claims, as using only health insurers for this purpose was deemed necessary to win acceptance when the program was created.
2. However, the number of health insurers willing to serve as Medicare contractors has declined, and the potential for Medicare to use new types of business entities for claims processing has increased due to advancements in information technology.
3. Allowing Medicare to contract with a broader array of entities and offering financial incentives for high-quality performance could lead to improved program operations and lower administrative costs.
4. Medicare contractors are currently reimbursed for necessary and proper costs but cannot earn profits, and the program cannot terminate contractors without cause or hold public hearings before termination.
5. The Social Security Act generally stipulates that payments be based on costs, preventing the program from offering financial incentives to contractors.
6. The number of contractors has dropped significantly since 1980, leaving the program with fewer choices when a contractor withdraws or is terminated.
7. The agency has submitted legislative proposals to repeal the provider nomination authority and make explicit its authority to contract for claims administration with entities other than health insurers.
8. Allowing Medicare to have separate contractors for specific claims administration activities and terminating contracts more efficiently when performance is inadequate could result in better program management.
9. Implementing performance-based contracting and offering financial incentives will not be without significant challenges, and careful planning would be required to ensure adequate resources are in place to prevent disruptions in services.",0

2. A Defense Science Board (DSB) report from 1996 suggested that DOD could save 30-40% of logistics costs by outsourcing support services, estimating potential annual savings of $7-12 billion by fiscal year 2002.
3. The DSB's second task force report expanded on the first, proposing that DOD outsource all activities except warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy-making, and oversight, aiming for $30 billion in annual savings by 2002.
4. Of these savings, $6 billion was expected from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities, with $4.2 billion from outsourcing and $1.8 billion from improved inventory management and equipment reliability.
5. The DSB's $14 billion estimate for CONUS logistics costs is considered conservative, as the Navy alone applied over $8.5 billion to maintenance programs in fiscal year 1996.
6. DOD has been advised to expand contractor logistics support and rely on prime vendors for all commodities, streamlining its business processes and focusing on core activities.
7. Public-private competition studies have shown that competition leads to increased efficiency and cost reduction for both public and private sectors.
8. Private companies have been successful in reducing logistics costs by using accurate information systems, consolidating activities, streamlining processes, and outsourcing when appropriate.
9. The DSB's savings estimates have been criticized for overstating inventory management savings, assuming overly optimistic outsourcing savings rates, and underestimating the challenges in outsourcing all logistics functions.

476,"1. The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 and the National Performance Review drove federal employment level reductions from 1993 to 1999, aiming to cut 272,900 FTE positions government-wide. Agencies were required to streamline operations, reduce management control and headquarters positions, and improve government operations through reinvention and quality management techniques.

2. Between 1993 and 1996, the federal civilian workforce was cut by about 12 percent, with certain agencies experiencing larger reductions, such as 14 percent at HUD, 13 percent at DOI, 22 percent at GSA, 13 percent at NASA, and 42 percent at OPM. Selected components within HUD, DOI, GSA, NASA, and OPM were examined to determine downsizing extent and impact on performance.

3. Actions taken to maintain performance amid downsizing included refocusing missions, reengineering work processes, and building and maintaining employee skills. Components generally took steps to ensure skilled workforces, such as retraining employees and consolidating expertise in fewer locations. However, concerns remained about the sufficiency of current or future workforces for some components.

4. Most component officials, employee representatives, and employees believed that efforts to maintain performance had been successful, but some expressed concerns about maintaining performance with additional downsizing. Customer satisfaction varied, with some customers agreeing with the positive views and others expressing dissatisfaction due to factors unrelated to downsizing. Officials, employee representatives, and employees largely believed customers remained satisfied, but limited customer survey data supported this view.",0

The 2010 Census, a decennial head count of the U.S. population, is crucial for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives, redrawing congressional districts, allocating federal funds, and providing data for various public and private sector uses. The Census Bureau's planning for the 2010 Census has improved compared to the 2000 Census, but certain information gaps remain, such as incomplete life cycle cost estimates and unresolved methodological questions about the American Community Survey (ACS), which is intended to replace the long form.

2. The Bureau's three-legged stool strategy for the 2010 Census includes updating the MAF/TIGER database, conducting a short-form-only enumeration, and implementing the ACS. Each leg is dependent on the others, and the Bureau plans to complete all three by 2008. However, the Bureau has no contingency plans other than to revert to a traditional census, and the failure of any one leg could jeopardize the Bureau's goals.

3. The Bureau's cost projections for the 2010 Census continue an escalating trend, with the estimated $9.3 billion cost in constant 2000 dollars representing a tenfold jump over the $920 million spent on the 1970 Census. The major cost for the 2010 Census is field data collection and support systems, which account for over half of decennial census life cycle costs.

4. The Bureau's planning for the 2010 Census can benefit from greater transparency, including more robust information on the likelihood of key cost drivers differing from those initially assumed and the impact of any differences on the total life cycle cost. Timely cost information and supporting documentation are also important for congressional decision making.

5. To ensure a cost-effective enumeration, the Bureau should consider meticulous planning, including developing a project plan with clear and measurable goals, evaluating human resource implications, involving stakeholders, analyzing and mitigating risks, and monitoring progress. The Bureau has made progress in some of these areas but could improve in others, such as crafting an overall project plan and translating key goals into measurable, operational terms.",0

2. In electronic prescribing, a licensed healthcare provider uses a computer or hand-held device to write and transmit a prescription directly to the dispenser, requesting the patient's eligibility, formulary, benefits, and medication history.
3. To transmit prescription drug data electronically, multiple entities need access to an individual's identifiable health information in an electronic format, subject to federal laws and regulations that dictate acceptable use and disclosure activities.
4. Electronic health information can be held by covered entities that perform treatment functions for directly providing clinical care to a patient through electronic prescribing, and these entities and business associates work together to gather and confirm patients' electronic health information.

The Military Health System (MHSS) is responsible for medical readiness of active-duty military personnel, including providing medical support during combat and maintaining the health of the active-duty force during peacetime. The MHSS also supports nonactive-duty beneficiaries when resources are available, and purchases services for them from the civilian health care sector when their need for health care exceeds MHSS resources. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in the MHSS provide mental health care to help military personnel perform their duties before, during, and after combat. Both psychiatrists and clinical psychologists can diagnose mental conditions and treat them with psychotherapy, but only psychiatrists can prescribe medication due to their medical training.
2. The MHSS created the Prescribing Psychologist Demonstration Project (PDP) in response to a conference report in 1988 to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists in the military so they could treat their patients with psychotropic medication when needed. The PDP was established to train military psychologists to issue appropriate psychotropic medications under certain circumstances. The Army's Office of the Surgeon General was tasked with designing and implementing the PDP, and a blue ribbon panel was formed to determine the best method for implementing the PDP. The panel endorsed a training model that included course work at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences (USUHS).
3. The PDP began in August 1991 with four participants and consisted of 2 years of training, including 1 year of classroom and 1 year of clinical training. Classroom training included courses at USUHS in subjects such as anatomy, pharmacology, and physiology. PDP participants' clinical experience took place on inpatient wards and outpatient clinics at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., or the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. After their clinical year, participants received a certificate of ""Fellowship in Psychopharmacology for Psychologists"" and became known as ""prescribing psychologists.""

It is dependent on software to deploy and control various components and relies on three main contractors for its development. JWST's major segments include the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment.

2. JWST's organizational structure consists of various elements and major subsystems, including the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), sunshield, cryocooler, and spacecraft. The project is divided into five separate integration and test periods, with some risks being mitigated and others being accepted as residual risks.

3. JWST's sunshield and primary mirror are designed to fold and stow for launch, and its science instruments are required to operate at extremely cold temperatures to observe faint infrared sources. A multi-layered sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat, and each element and major subsystem has been allocated schedule reserve.

4. The MIRI instrument, one of the four instruments within ISIM, requires a dedicated cryocooler subsystem to cool the infrared light detector to about 6.7 Kelvin. This cooler is a two-stage system that moves helium gas through refrigerant lines located on the sun-facing surface of the JWST observatory to the colder, shaded side where the ISIM is located.

5. JWST's development has faced numerous technical challenges and cost overruns, with early technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low level cost reserves, and poorly phased funding levels contributing to significant delays. In response, NASA commissioned an Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which concluded that JWST was executing well from a technical standpoint but that the baseline funding did not reflect the most probable cost with adequate reserves. Following the panel's report, the JWST program underwent a replan in September 2011, and Congress placed an $8 billion cap on the formulation and development costs for the project.",0

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates about 15,000 facilities that produce, use, or store specific chemicals that pose the greatest risk to human health and the environment.
2. These facilities, known as Risk Management Plan (RMP) facilities, fall within various industries and produce a variety of products. Some RMP facilities are part of critical infrastructure sectors other than the chemical sector, such as community water systems.
3. Federal requirements address security at some U.S. chemical facilities, including a small number of facilities subject to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and certain community water systems required to conduct vulnerability assessments under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.

2. Disabled workers and dependents receive an average of $995 and $979 a month, respectively, and these benefits can be particularly important for those facing hardships due to disabling conditions.
3. Social Security was designed to provide a base income, with lower income beneficiaries receiving higher benefits relative to wages and beneficiaries with higher lifetime income receiving benefits in accordance with their contributions.
4. The program initially only provided retirement benefits, but over time expanded to include dependents and disabled workers, with dependents' benefits set as fractions of the benefits owed to the person upon whom beneficiaries depend.
5. Disability Insurance (DI) was established in 1956, providing cash benefits to permanently disabled workers, and later expanded to include younger disabled workers.
6. Benefits for widows, widowers, and children were introduced in the 1939 amendments, and widows' benefits were increased in 1961 and 1972, with eligibility extended to divorced spouses and the spouses and children of disabled workers.
7. Despite fiscal concerns, eligibility for certain dependents' and disability benefits has been expanded since 1975, indicating an interest in protecting vulnerable populations.
8. Recent reform proposals have focused on improving solvency, but there is ongoing interest in protecting some or all DI and dependents' benefits from potential benefit reductions.

These programs include the American International Group (AIG) Investment Program, the Asset Guarantee Program, the Capital Assessment Program, the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), and others.
2. Many of these programs have ended or are winding down, with Treasury recovering all debt and equity investments made in the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) as of September 30, 2014. The AIG Assistance Program, the Asset Guarantee Program, the Capital Assessment Program, the SBA 7(a) Securities Purchase Program, and the Targeted Investment Program (TIP) are no longer active.
3. Treasury still holds investments in CPP, CDCI, and AIFP, and the housing assistance programs remain active. The housing programs include Making Home Affordable (MHA), which consists of several programs such as the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) Program, Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA), and Second Lien Modification Program (2MP).
4. The Hardest Hit Fund seeks to help homeowners in states hit hardest by unemployment and house price declines, and the FHA Short Refinance program enables homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their homes to refinance into more affordable mortgages. Treasury continues to wind down CPP, the largest TARP investment program, which has produced, or will produce, a lifetime income.",1

2. Without annual determinations, FSA cannot identify estates being kept open primarily to receive payments and ensure they are proper, which is essential for management control.
3. Estates can continue to receive program payments if they meet the active engagement in farming requirement and the local field office determines they are not being kept open primarily for payments.
4. FSA did not consistently make required annual determinations for 181 estates reviewed, and the longer an estate was kept open, the less likely it was to receive all required determinations.
5. FSA did not conduct any program eligibility determinations for 40 percent of the 181 estates that required a determination from 1999 through 2005.
6. Sixteen of these 73 estates received more than $200,000 in farm program payments, and 4 received more than $500,000 during this period.
7. FSA's lack of management controls, such as computer matching, makes it difficult to verify that it is not making payments to deceased individuals.
8. FSA paid $1.1 billion in farm program payments in the names of 172,801 deceased individuals from fiscal years 1999 through 2005.
9. The shortcomings identified underscore the need for improved oversight of federal farm programs to ensure program funds are spent as intended and benefit those engaged in farming.",0

3. Modernization projects have caused delays in replacing FAA's aging equipment, especially automation equipment in en route and terminal facilities, leading to the implementation of interim projects costing about $655 million.
4. Two key modernization components, WAAS and STARS, have encountered delays and cost increases, with FAA assessing the Host computer's microcode and preparing to purchase new hardware for each of its 20 en route centers before January 1, 2000, to resolve year 2000 date requirements.",1
489,"1. From 1993 to 1998, the United States invested over $970 million in rule of law programs worldwide.
2. The annual funding increased from $128 million in 1993 to $218 million in 1998, although there was a significant decrease in 1996 due to issues with USAID's automated information system.
3. The Latin America and the Caribbean region received the largest share of the funding, accounting for approximately 36% of the total.
4. Africa, Central Europe, and the former Soviet Union states each received around 15% of the global funding.
5. Over the five-year period, funding for Central Europe grew significantly from $9 million to over $67 million, becoming the largest recipient in 1998.
6. Conversely, assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean declined from $57 million in 1993 to $42 million in 1998, and aid to Africa also decreased from $38 million to $29 million in the same period.",0
490,"1. Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting enterprises that provide common administrative services, such as payroll processing and information technology support, to federal agencies. The review focuses on DOD’s use of the franchise funds’ contracting services. DOD primarily uses two franchise funds, GovWorks and FedSource, for contracting services. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to regulatory requirements and contracting practices. Three main parties share responsibilities for ensuring that proper procedures are followed: government customer, franchise fund, and contractor.
2. Franchise funds are required to recover their full costs of doing business and are allowed to retain up to 4 percent of their total annual income. To cover their costs, the franchise funds charge fees for services. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized the Office of Management and Budget to designate six federal agencies to establish the franchise fund pilot program. The original operating principles for franchise funds included offering services on a fully competitive basis, using a comprehensive set of performance measures to assess the quality of franchise fund services, and establishing cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors.
3. Although there are five franchise funds currently in operation, DOD primarily uses two for contracting services—GovWorks, operated by the Department of the Interior, and FedSource, operated by the Department of the Treasury. Figure 1 shows the revenues for GovWorks and FedSource and the percentage of revenue derived from doing business with DOD in fiscal year 2004. DOD program officials are most familiar with the technical requirements for the goods and services they need. DOD contracting officers can place orders directly through many interagency contracts.
4. Alternatively, DOD pays the franchise fund to assume many of the contracting responsibilities that normally would have been handled by DOD’s contracting officers if the customers had relied on them to purchase the goods or services. Whether DOD makes purchases directly or through another agency, regulatory procedures and requirements are the same, such as ensuring competition, determining fair and reasonable pricing, and monitoring contractor performance. Table 1 shows the basic steps to acquire a good or service through GovWorks or FedSource.
5. GovWorks and FedSource can either make use of their own or other agencies’ contracts, or they can develop new, customized contracts to satisfy a DOD customer’s needs. G",0
491,"1. Wildland fires play an important ecological role in the United States, but land use and management practices have reduced the normal frequency of fires and the resiliency of ecosystems to fire. These practices have contributed to abnormally dense, continuous accumulations of vegetation that can fuel large or severe wildland fires and threaten lives, health, property, and infrastructure. Changing climate conditions, including drier conditions in certain parts of the country, have also increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons.
2. Federal and nonfederal entities collaborate in various ways to reduce the risk of wildland fire before a potential wildland fire incident occurs, through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. Individuals and communities may also take action to mitigate fire risk by using fire-resistant building materials or building in low-risk areas. Fuel reduction can occur through mechanical treatment or planned ignitions, which often replicate the positive effects of naturally occurring wildfire. Federal agencies have collaborated with nonfederal entities to prioritize, plan, and conduct fuel reduction activities.
3. Preparedness activities can help communities protect themselves during a wildland fire by ensuring they have access to fire suppression equipment, personnel, and emergency dispatch services. Prevention activities can reduce the likelihood of fires caused by humans, which accounted for approximately 85 percent of wildfires in the United States from 2001 through 2011. Education activities can help reduce risk by helping homeowners and communities understand actions they can take to reduce risk, such as creating defensible space and using fire-resistant building materials.
4. Federal officials and stakeholders identified federal authorities, agency initiatives, joint community-level planning, leadership, community engagement, and agency resources for collaboration as directly affecting federal-nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities. They also identified factors that indirectly affect collaboration, such as community education, fire prevention messaging, and state and local requirements for private property owners to reduce risk. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that certain federal legal authorities that allow federal agencies to work across jurisdictions with nonfederal entities facilitate federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk.",0

The Battle of Normandy Foundation is a private nonprofit organization that received $3 million in surcharge coin proceeds from the U.S. Treasury in 1993 for the design and construction of the Memorial Garden in Normandy. However, the Foundation has experienced significant managerial, financial, and internal control problems, with liabilities substantially exceeding its assets, causing uncertainty about its ability to continue operations. The Foundation's 1993 audited financial statements show a financial deficit of about $727,000, and it has used approximately $1.1 million of the $2.5 million in contributions for its Wall of Liberty project for other projects' costs and operating expenses.

2. The Foundation spent approximately 63% of its revenues for stated program activities from 1986 to 1992 and 83% in 1993. It contracted with a travel agency for travel services related to the 50th anniversary of D-Day commemoration, which is allowed by the Coins Act. A private company owned by the Foundation's former president, Anthony C. Stout, owed rent to the Foundation, and Stout had the Foundation's records altered in 1991 to substitute a rent receivable with a pledge for contributions. The Foundation adjusted its books to reduce the rent due from GIM Corp. and canceled the sublease with GIM Corp., which was approved by the Board. Stout then pledged $120,000 to the Foundation over four years, with $90,000 paid through December 1993.",0
493,"1. Pension plans, both public and private, invest in defined benefit (DB) plans which promise to pay retirement benefits based on an employee's salary and years of service. The financial health of these plans depends on adequate contributions and prudent investments that preserve principal and yield an adequate rate of return. DB plan managers invest in various asset classes, including stocks and bonds, to balance risk and return. Private sector pension plan investment decisions must comply with ERISA, which sets fiduciary standards. Public sector pension plans are not subject to ERISA but must follow state laws, which often follow ERISA's prudent man standard.
2. Hedge funds are pooled investment vehicles that invest in various types of securities and other assets, often using leverage and complex trading strategies. They have grown rapidly in recent years and are typically exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Private equity funds are privately managed pools of capital that invest in companies, often seeking long-term appreciation based on corporate stewardship and improved operating processes. They have also grown in recent decades and are not subject to SEC examinations. Pension plans typically invest in private equity through limited partnerships, with the general partner developing an investment strategy and limited partners providing the majority of the capital. Hedge funds and private equity funds may be structured to qualify for exemptions from certain registration and disclosure requirements of federal securities laws.",0
494,"1. The United States territories of American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have some discretion in setting Medicaid and CHIP eligibility standards and provider payment rates, but there are significant differences in how these programs are funded compared to states. The federal matching rate for territories is fixed at a lower end of the range available to states, and federal Medicaid funding in territories is subject to a statutory cap.
2. Territories have flexibility in administering their Medicaid and CHIP programs, leading to differences in program eligibility and benefits among them and from states. For example, Puerto Rico uses its CHIP funds to cover additional children in its Medicaid programs, while Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands base program eligibility on local poverty levels that are more restrictive than federal standards. Additionally, the territories vary in the range of benefits covered by their respective Medicaid programs, with some not covering all mandatory benefits due to limited funding and infrastructure.",0
495,"1. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) established the Superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites, with EPA overseeing cleanups and performing them when responsible parties cannot be identified or are unable to pay.
2. As of October 1997, there were 3,036 sites awaiting a National Priorities List (NPL) decision, but only 1,789 of these were potentially eligible for the Superfund program.
3. EPA's database of potentially contaminated sites, CERCLIS, inaccurately listed some sites as awaiting an NPL decision, while other sites were unlikely to become eligible due to already being cleaned up or not requiring any cleanup action.
4. Of the 1,789 potentially eligible sites, 1,739 were nonfederal and 50 were federal facilities, with many posing risks to human health or the environment, particularly to drinking water sources and groundwater.
5. Responding officials characterized about 27% of the potentially eligible sites as currently posing high risks or potentially posing high risks in the future if not cleaned up.
6. EPA, other federal agencies, and states have conducted some cleanup activities at 38% of the potentially eligible sites, but 45% of the sites with high current risks and 47% of the sites with high potential risks have not had any cleanup activities.
7. As of 1998, EPA had investigated over 40,000 potential hazardous waste sites and made final decisions about whether or not to include almost 35,000 sites on the NPL, with 1,400 sites placed on the list and cleanup studies or construction completed at over 5,500 sites.",1

3. Visa demand has increased significantly in recent years, with countries like India and China experiencing substantial growth, leading to delays and long wait times for visa interview appointments at some consular posts.
4. State has acknowledged the need to provide applicants with an interview within 30 days and has taken steps to improve wait times, but inconsistencies in reporting visa waits data and limited enforcement of weekly reporting requirements impact the reliability of visa waits figures.

2. The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) was passed in 1968 to educate students with limited English proficiency and was reauthorized in 1994 to create four bilingual education grant programs.
3. These grant programs, administered by Education's Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs (OBEMLA), are the only federal programs specifically targeting instructional services to children with limited English proficiency.
4. In fiscal year 2000, Education funded approximately 28 percent of the 665 applications it received for the four bilingual education grant programs.
5. The four bilingual education programs share the same performance goals and measures, possess similar eligibility criteria, and allow similar uses of program funds.
6. The effectiveness of these programs on a national level is unknown due to the lack of comparable data on student outcomes, as locally collected data are not uniform and grantees use different assessment tests.
7. Education officials have recognized the potential for consolidating the four bilingual education programs, which may provide benefits such as reducing applicant burden and allowing for more effective use of staff resources.",0

3. The NCIC system is managed cooperatively by the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) division and state and local agencies that access the system.
4. An Advisory Process, consisting of an Advisory Policy Board and working groups, is responsible for establishing policy for NCIC use by federal, state, and local agencies.
5. Local level governance of NCIC use is performed by the Criminal Justice Information Services Advisory Board (CSA), which is responsible for the administration and usage of NCIC, including providing quality assurance and training and assuring LEA compliance with operating procedures within its jurisdiction.
6. CJIS shares with the CSAs the responsibility for monitoring compliance with NCIC policy, including conducting triennial audits of each CSA to assess the CSA’s compliance with NCIC policies, including the 2-hour entry requirement for reports of missing children.
7. During its audits, CJIS assesses the timeliness of missing children records and the reasons for any untimely entries, and provides recommendations to CSAs to address non-compliance issues.
8. CSAs are required to establish a system to audit all LEAs that enter data into NCIC within their jurisdiction, and CJIS and the Board have taken steps to help ensure that LEAs implement the 2-hour entry requirement.
9. However, officials from eight of the nine LEAs interviewed reported facing challenges entering missing children information into NCIC within 2 hours due to custody disputes and coordination with child welfare agencies, raising questions about the extent to which LEAs are well-positioned to comply with the 2-hour entry requirement.",0
500,"1. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for reducing traffic crashes and minimizing their consequences. Different types of cars and drivers have higher fatality rates, but it is difficult to determine if some types are more dangerous due to the relationship between driver and automobile characteristics.
2. This report aims to isolate the independent effects of important crash-related factors on the likelihood of injury in a collision. The report focuses on the most important predictors of occupant injury: crash type and severity, automobile size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender. The report considers both crashworthiness and aggressivity.
3. The report is one of three GAO reports examining automobile safety. The other two reports examine the independent effects of driver characteristics and automobile size on crash involvement and the reliability and validity of DOT crash tests.
4. Since the mid-1960s, traffic fatalities and the fatality rate per registered vehicle have decreased in the United States. The fatality rate for automobile occupants has declined by 36% since 1975. Continued emphasis on reducing drunk driving, increasing safety belt use, and introducing safety enhancing features is expected to continue this favorable trend.
5. Different models of automobiles appear to make very different contributions to the fatality toll. For instance, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has reported that the most ""dangerous"" automobile models have occupant fatality rates more than nine times higher than the ""safest"" models.
6. Automobiles, and federal automobile safety regulations, are designed to protect occupants from dangers in several ways, such as reducing deceleration forces, encasing occupants in a protective compartment, and keeping occupants both in the vehicle and away from interior surfaces. Cars from recent model years are safer than older ones, and some of this improvement can be attributed to federal government safety regulations.",0

The Coast Guard has several acquisition programs, including the Deepwater program, a 25-year, $24 billion effort to upgrade or replace existing vessels and aircraft, and the National Automatic Identification System and Rescue 21 programs to identify and track vessels and improve search and rescue communications.
3. The Coast Guard's fiscal year 2008 budget request is $8.73 billion, with $5.9 billion for operating expenditures and $949 million for acquisition, modernization, and improvement, reflecting a decrease from the previous year due to a slower pace of new acquisitions and a reorganization of internal operations and support command infrastructure.",1
502,"1. DOD's personal property program, which manages household goods moves for military servicemembers and DOD civilians, has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. The program involves a complex process of qualifying carriers, soliciting rates, distributing moves, evaluating moving companies' performance, paying invoices, and settling claims.
2. In an effort to address some of the program's challenges, DOD previously evaluated three pilot programs and submitted recommendations to Congress in 2002, including reengineering the liability and claims process, changing the acquisition process, and implementing information technology improvements.
3. To respond to these recommendations, DOD developed the Families First program, which aims to improve the quality of household goods moves for servicemembers, DOD civilian employees, and their families. The program is executed by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, an Army service component command.
4. However, DOD's legacy data management system, TOPS, is being phased out due to its lack of supportability, inability to meet technology standards, poor reporting and data capabilities, and incompatibility with the Business Management Modernization Program.
5. DOD expects that TOPS will need to be functional for a large part of the Families First rollout, but the system is not feasible for upgrading to support the program's goals.
6. Under the current program, servicemembers are provided with basic claims coverage using depreciated value for losses or damages incurred during a move. Additional coverage options are available for the servicemember to purchase.
7. DOD has taken steps to achieve the goals and benefits of the Families First program, including establishing three goals for the program: improving the quality of service from moving companies, streamlining the claims process, and developing an integrated information management system.
8. However, DOD has experienced delays and missed milestones in developing and implementing DPS, the new information management system for the program, which has put achieving the program's goals and benefits at risk.

2. User fees are related to voluntary transactions for government goods or services, while taxes arise from the government's sovereign power and need not be related to specific benefits.
3. The boundaries between fees and taxes can be unclear, and the design elements of user fees have tradeoffs that can also apply to taxes.
4. Agencies derive fee-setting authority from the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 or specific statutory authority, with fees based on costs, value, public policy, and other relevant factors.

506,"1. Agencies often fail to link budgets to strategic goals and may not consider resource limitations, leading to unrealistic capabilities and requirements.
2. The defense department and other agencies have a history of overpromising and underdelivering on major systems, often due to requirements instability and inadequate funding.
3. The use of lead systems integrators and increased reliance on contractors can lead to additional risks and the need for greater government oversight.
4. The acquisition workforce faces challenges such as declining numbers, increased workload, and the need for new skills due to more complex contracting approaches.
5. Inadequate oversight and high turnover among key staff can reduce accountability and lead to recurring and systemic problems.
6. The use of cost-plus contracts and incentive fees based on contractor attitudes rather than results can contribute to waste.
7. Lack of high-level attention and insufficient business cases for program managers can hinder the success of acquisition, contracting, and other key business areas.
8. The government should seek the best return on investment in goods and services by making strategic choices between wants and needs, and balancing expediency, best value, and oversight in contracts.

The crude oil price is forecasted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and adjusted for refinement and nonproduct costs.
2. The standard price is intended to remain unchanged until the next budget year to shield military services from market price volatility. However, actual fuel prices can fluctuate, leading to differences between estimated and actual costs.
3. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DOD's actual costs for bulk fuel differed considerably from its budget estimates, primarily due to fluctuations in fuel price. DOD underestimated bulk fuel costs by about $3 billion in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and overestimated costs by about $3 billion in 2009 and $2 billion in 2013.
4. The difference between estimated and actual costs is primarily due to fluctuations in the market price of fuel (74%) and differences between the services' estimated and actual fuel consumption (26%).
5. DOD has taken actions to manage fluctuations in the cash balance of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund caused by differences between its estimated and actual fuel costs, including transferring funds into the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund and adjusting the standard price.
6. DOD has not updated its current approach for setting the standard price to reflect current market conditions or documented its rationale for the assumptions it uses in estimating the standard price.
7. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on fuel rate and cost projections used in the DOD budget presentation. DOD elected to maintain its current approach because OMB's forecasts were comparable to or better at estimating the actual crude oil price than alternative forecasts.
8. DOD has not accounted for changes in market conditions for crude oil, such as differences between crude oil benchmarks, differences between domestic and international crude oil prices, and the decreasing relationship between crude oil and refined prices.",0

USCIS is responsible for processing immigration benefit applications and determining eligibility, with a staff of about 3,000 permanent adjudicators in 4 service centers and 33 district offices. In fiscal year 2005, USCIS received about 6.3 million applications and adjudicated about 7.5 million, with service centers processing about 67% and districts processing about 33%.
2. USCIS has taken actions to detect fraud, including establishing FDNS in 2003 to receive fraud leads from adjudicators and determine which leads should be referred to ICE's Office of Investigations. FDNS has Fraud Detection Units (FDU) at all four USCIS service centers and the National Benefits Center to further develop suspected immigration fraud referrals. ICE's Office of Investigations created four new Benefit Fraud Units (BFU) in 2005 to review, assess, and refer immigration fraud leads to ICE field offices for possible investigation.
3. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman to assist individuals and employers in resolving problems with USCIS, identify areas in which individuals and employers have problems in dealing with USCIS, and propose changes in the administrative practices of USCIS. Other federal agencies also play important roles in the immigration benefit application process, including the Department of State and the Department of Labor's Division of Foreign Labor Certification.",0
510,"1. The IRS' performance during the 1994 filing season was assessed, focusing on the agency's ability to process income tax returns and refunds accurately and efficiently and to provide taxpayers access to forms, information, and electronic filing methods. The assessment included validating the results of a service center's test of refund accuracy and timeliness, analyzing filing season-related data, reviewing IRS reports, and interviewing IRS officials.
2. The 1994 filing season had both positive and negative aspects. While the number of individual income tax returns filed increased and IRS' computer systems performed well, there were issues with the Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) leading to errors and fraudulent refund claims. The IRS also experienced difficulties in meeting its projections for the number of returns filed, and taxpayers faced challenges in reaching IRS' telephone assistance.
3. The IRS faced an unexpected drop in the number of individual income tax returns filed in 1993, which led to a revision in the projection model for the 1994 filing season. The number of filings in 1994 was still short of IRS' revised expectations, although taxpayer use of alternative filing methods generally increased. The IRS offered three types of filing alternatives, with electronic and TeleFile use increasing and 1040PC use declining slightly.
4. The IRS' computer systems generally performed well during the 1994 filing season, but some systems problems occurred, causing minor delays in refunds and downtime for IRS employees. IRS' goals for refund issuance and accuracy were met, with an average issuance time of 36 days and an average accuracy rate of 98.6 percent. However, the IRS identified a growing number of fraudulent refund claims, with 58,828 returns identified by the end of June 1994.
5. The IRS took steps to improve check processing and deposit tax receipts more timely, including testing the use of lockboxes and requiring service centers to develop procedures for depositing revenues. IRS also required priority handling for large dollar remittances during the peak filing season and deposited $41.5 billion in tax payment revenues from individuals between April 15 and May 2, 1994.

2. Each state designs and administers its own Medicaid program, deciding which optional services to cover and how much to reimburse providers.
3. In recent years, escalating Medicaid costs have led some states to seek to move their Medicaid population into capitated managed care systems.
4. However, certain provisions of the Medicaid law, such as freedom of choice and the ""75-25"" beneficiary requirements, can inhibit states' use of managed care.

The 1980s crack cocaine epidemic in the United States was not identified until the late 1980s due to limitations in drug detection mechanisms, including gaps in populations surveyed and the reliance on self-reported data. The federal public health response primarily focused on cocaine in general instead of on crack specifically. NIDA's research activities did not differentiate between powdered cocaine and crack, and there was no significant change in block grant funding for state drug prevention and service delivery activities.
2. In the 1980s, NIDA developed public education campaigns against drug use in general and cocaine use in particular, but did not initially target its education and outreach efforts to address the use of crack. NIDA's research activities included testing medications for reducing cocaine craving and withdrawal symptoms, and investigating approaches for treating cocaine abuse.
3. The 1981 Anti-Drug Abuse Act consolidated categorical and formula grant programs into a substance abuse and mental health block grant, limiting the federal role in service delivery to overseeing the administration of the program and providing less direct assistance to states. The 1982 initial appropriation for the ADMS block grant was $428 million, and total funding varied by less than 10 percent from fiscal years 1982 through 1988. However, starting in fiscal year 1989, a greater proportion of block grant funding began to shift to substance abuse.
4. In response to the crack cocaine epidemic, NIDA modified its drug detection mechanisms and new federal mechanisms were created to address some of the coverage, timeliness, and methodological concerns raised by the Congress. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 created ONDCP and charged it with developing and coordinating a national drug control strategy. SAMHSA was created 4 years later and charged with establishing and implementing a comprehensive program to improve the provision of prevention- and treatment-related services for substance abuse. NIDA was transferred to NIH to allow NIDA to concentrate on research, research training, and public health information dissemination related to the prevention and treatment of drug abuse.",0
513,"1. In the mid-1970s, major structural changes in the American economy led to the dislocation of thousands of workers, resulting in the need for demonstration projects to identify those likely to experience long periods of joblessness. The Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993 required states to establish a system of profiling all new claimants for UI regular compensation, identifying those likely to exhaust regular compensation and refer them to reemployment services. Profiling tools consider factors such as whether the claimant has a date for being recalled to work, union status, first unemployment benefit payment, and previous industry or occupation of employment. Reemployment services include an orientation session, assessment of specific needs, and development of an individual plan for services.

2. Labor's 2006 survey of state profiling techniques revealed that many states had not updated their profiling models for many years, potentially leading to a loss of predictive accuracy. The worker-profiling program is required by law, and if there is to be a continued federal mandate, it may be necessary to ensure the integrity of those models through a more assertive federal role. The national data on the worker-profiling initiative is of very limited usefulness as a measure of program activity, outcomes, and effectiveness, and the reliability of claimant outcomes data is limited. To better ensure that claimants who need and could benefit from reemployment services are referred, and to ensure that resources are not unnecessarily expended on claimants not needing them, the Secretary of Labor is recommended to reevaluate the agency’s worker-profiling data collection, ensure the accuracy of state profiling models, encourage states to adhere to Labor’s vision for in-depth reemployment services, and evaluate the impact of the worker-profiling program on the reemployment of UI recipients.",1
514,"1. The Military Health System (MHS) has three missions: maintaining the health of active-duty service members, maintaining readiness, and providing care to military personnel's dependents, retirees, and their families. In FY 1999, DOD's annual appropriations included about $16 billion for health care, with over $1 billion funding the care of seniors. The TRICARE framework was implemented in the mid-1990s to improve access, quality, and cost containment. TRICARE offers three options: Prime, Extra, and Standard, covering inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing, and prescription drug services. Medicare is a federally financed health insurance program for the elderly, some disabled individuals, and people with end-stage kidney disease. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees.
2. TRICARE and Medicare have different financing and benefit structures. TRICARE is primarily funded through DOD's annual appropriations, while Medicare is financed through federal taxes and premiums. Medicare enrollees receive part A benefits and are eligible for optional part B benefits if they pay a monthly premium. Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries choose their own providers, and Medicare reimburses those providers on a fee-for-service basis. Beneficiaries who receive care through traditional Medicare are responsible for paying a share of the costs for services.
3. Older military retirees who enroll in Medicare+Choice plans may choose to supplement the care they receive through the plan with space-available care provided by MTFs in their areas. This arrangement saves the plan money if it otherwise would have provided the care. Similarly, MTF care provided to older retirees who are in traditional Medicare reduces Medicare spending. Today, there are about 1.5 million retired military personnel, dependents, and survivors aged 65 or older residing in the United States who are eligible for certain military health care services.
4. Retirees have access to all MTF and network services through TRICARE until they turn age 65 and become eligible for Medicare. Subsequently, they can only use military health care on a space-available basis, that is, when MTFs have unused capacity after caring for younger beneficiaries. In the 1990s, down",0

2. The CIM strategy has shifted over time, initially focusing on eliminating separate service systems and providing integrated systems across DOD, and later expanding to include all DOD functional areas such as procurement, logistics, finance, and command and control.
3. The CIM initiative has its origins in the recommendations of the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management, with the objective of streamlining and restructuring DOD business operations.
4. Despite initial projections of significant cost savings, recent studies have found that the DMR and CIM projections were overly optimistic, and DOD now acknowledges that the $36 billion estimate is obsolete.

519,"1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has faced challenges in transitioning technologies from labs to real-world use, often due to insufficient demonstration of potential, lack of funding, or difficulties with the budgeting process. To address these issues, DOD and Congress have established various technology transition programs, such as the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program and the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program. However, these programs represent a small portion of DOD's overall spending on research and development.
2. More recent initiatives include the Tactical Technology Office's (TTO) Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP), and the Quick Reaction Fund, all managed by DOD's Office of Defense Research and Engineering. These programs aim to speed up technology transition, introduce innovative and cost-saving technologies, and field test technology prototypes, but their combined budget is relatively small compared to other transition programs.
3. While these programs have shown benefits in improving performance, affordability, and operational capability, it is too early to determine their overall impact on technology transition due to limited performance measures and few completed projects. Additionally, the three programs have varying levels of structure and discipline in their management processes.
4. To ensure effective transition of new technologies, transition programs need to establish robust selection, management, and oversight processes, including verifying technology readiness levels and maintaining open communication between labs and acquisition programs. Developing appropriate performance measures and tracking the impact of program funding over time are also crucial for long-term success.",0

521,"1. The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963 and substantially overhauled in 1970 and 1990, sets national ambient air quality standards for pollutants and directs states to achieve and maintain compliance with these standards.
2. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act established a detailed program for attaining and maintaining air quality standards, expanded regulations of hazardous air pollutant emissions, and created an acid deposition control program to reduce the adverse effects of acid rain.
3. EPA has identified 452 actions required to meet the objectives of Titles I, III, and IV of the 1990 amendments, with about half of these actions included under Title III and the largest number of requirements having statutory deadlines.
4. States and local governments are responsible for carrying out certain portions of the Clean Air Act, including developing implementation plans to achieve and maintain compliance with national standards.
5. Between 1970 and 2004, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 54 percent, despite increases in gross domestic product, vehicle miles traveled, energy consumption, and U.S. population.
6. However, large numbers of Americans continue to live in communities where pollution sometimes exceeds federal air quality standards for one or more of the six principal air pollutants.
7. EPA has completed most of the 452 actions required by the 1990 amendments related to Titles I, III, and IV, but varying timeliness in implementing these requirements has led to varying deadlines being met.
8. EPA officials have cited several factors for missing deadlines for so many requirements, including stakeholder involvement during regulatory development, setting priorities among new requirements, competing demands caused by lawsuits, and the emergence of new scientific information.

2. The Study Group reviewed over 1,000 documents and identified 61 programs specifically targeting girls' delinquency, which were then assessed for methodological quality using DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP)’s What Works criteria.
3. The Study Group's methods for assessing studies and involving practitioners were consistent with generally accepted social science research practices and standards.
4. However, 8 out of 18 experts interviewed stated that the What Works criteria created an unrealistically high standard, causing the group to overlook potentially promising programs.
5. The initial Study Group consisted of 12 academic researchers and 1 practitioner, which led to a focus on researching theories rather than gathering actionable information for practitioners.
6. In response, OJJDP added a second practitioner as a member and involved two other practitioners in study group activities.
7. The Study Group found that few girls’ delinquency programs had been studied and that the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs.
8. OJJDP plans to provide technical assistance to help programs prepare for evaluations of their effectiveness and issue a solicitation in fiscal year 2010 for funding to support evaluations of girls’ delinquency programs.

523,"1. Before 1991, the military services maintained separate finance and accounting operations that were duplicative and inefficient. DFAS was created to standardize DOD finance and accounting policies, procedures, and systems.
2. The military services and defense agencies generally use operations and maintenance appropriations to pay for DFAS services. Before fiscal year 1991, each service and agency had its own financial management structure.
3. DOD officials became convinced they needed to improve the economy and efficiency of their finance and accounting operations due to variances in the interpretation of finance and accounting policies, incompatibility and lack of standardization in financial management systems, and the inherent inefficiency in having multiple organizations perform virtually identical functions.
4. DFAS was established in January 1991 by consolidating into a single agency under DOD’s Comptroller, the large finance and accounting centers that belonged to the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency. DFAS was later directed to assume control of existing finance and accounting operations and personnel at the command and installation levels within the military services.
5. DFAS was designated a Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) business area in fiscal year 1992 to promote total cost visibility and encourage managers to become more conscious of operating costs and make fundamental improvements in how DOD conducts business.
6. DOD’s finance and accounting organization and management structure has undergone major changes, including the development of a new concept of operations that involves performing most of its finance and accounting operations at consolidated sites rather than at local bases and installations.
7. DFAS and the military services are jointly responsible for carrying out DOD finance and accounting activities, with DFAS performing finance and accounting operations and the military services retaining certain functions to support local commanders and customers.
8. DFAS has assumed control of many of the finance and accounting activities at 332 offices and has plans to consolidate these activities at a limited number of DFAS locations. DFAS currently has 23,500 employees, and there is some uncertainty about the number of finance and accounting personnel employed by the military services due to the lack of central budgeting and management.",0

The distribution of prescription drugs in the United States involves multiple entities, including wholesalers, independent pharmacies, Pharmacy Services Administrative Organizations (PSAOs), and third-party payers with their Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). Wholesalers purchase drugs in bulk from manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies, while independent pharmacies dispense medications to consumers.
2. Independent pharmacies, which accounted for 34% of retail pharmacies in the United States in 2010, purchase drugs primarily from wholesalers and represented slightly over 15% of wholesalers' total sales to retail pharmacies in 2010. These pharmacies provide patient-care services and spend most of their time dispensing prescription drugs and providing patient education.
3. PSAOs negotiate contracts with third-party payers or their PBMs on behalf of independent pharmacies, which often lack the legal expertise and time to adequately review and negotiate these contracts. The reimbursement rate that third-party payers or their PBMs pay pharmacies significantly affects pharmacy revenues.
4. Pharmacies participating in a PBM's network are reimbursed for prescriptions below the level paid by cash-paying customers, and they must undertake additional administrative tasks related to transactions for customers covered by third-party payers. Most independent pharmacies rely on PSAOs to negotiate contracts with third-party payers or their PBMs.
5. At least 22 PSAOs were in operation in 2011 or 2012, representing or providing services to between 20,275 and 28,343 pharmacies. PSAOs provide a broad range of services to independent pharmacies, including negotiating contractual agreements, providing communication and help-desk services, and assisting with administrative tasks.
6. PSAOs may negotiate various contract provisions, including reimbursement rates, payment terms, audits, price updates and appeals, and administrative requirements. However, many PBM contracts contain standard terms and conditions that are largely nonnegotiable.

530,"1. East Asian nations, including China, Japan, and South Korea, have had exchange rate policies that have caused tension with the United States due to allegations of currency manipulation. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the Department of the Treasury to analyze the exchange rate policies of major trading partners. In its 2017 report, Treasury found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for being labeled a currency manipulator, but it did identify six major trading partners on its ""Monitoring List,"" including China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Switzerland, and Taiwan.
2. Different types of exchange rate policies include a ""free float,"" where a country allows the value of its currency to fluctuate in international foreign exchange markets, and a ""pegged"" exchange rate, where a nation fixes the value of its currency relative to another currency or a bundle of currencies. A ""managed float"" is another common exchange rate policy, where a country allows the value of its domestic currency to fluctuate in international forex markets until certain designated economic indicators reach critical levels.
3. A ""free float"" policy allows a nation more autonomy with its domestic monetary policy but has disadvantages such as greater exchange-rate risk, potentially destabilizing balance sheet effects, and possible rapid shifts in capital flows. A pegged exchange rate policy can virtually eliminate exchange-rate risk but has disadvantages such as the loss of autonomy in domestic monetary policy, potentially rapid changes in domestic prices, and exposure to speculative attacks on the pegged exchange rate.
4. According to the International Monetary Fund, as of April 30, 2016, Japan is the only country in East Asia that allows its currency to float freely on international foreign exchange markets. Five nations allow their currencies to float but reserve the right to intervene in forex markets to maintain stability. Seven countries manage their exchange rates according to certain economic objectives, such as domestic price stability or moderate swings in the forex rate relative to one or more currencies.
5. Categorizing a government's exchange rate policy can be complicated, particularly during periods of financial turbulence. For example, South Korea's official exchange rate policy has been a free floating system since December 1997, but there have been reports of intervention in forex markets to maintain stability.

532,"1. China's economy is heavily dependent on global trade and investment, with exports and FDI playing significant roles in its growth. In 2007, China became the world's second-largest merchandise exporter, and FDI flows to China have been a major factor in its productivity gains and rapid economic growth.
2. The Chinese government estimates that the foreign trade sector employs more than 80 million people, with 28 million working in foreign-invested enterprises. However, the current global economic slowdown, particularly among China's major export markets, is negatively impacting its export sector and FDI flows.
3. China's economy slowed sharply in 2008 and early 2009, with GDP growth rates declining to 6.8% and 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, respectively. This slowdown could lead to social unrest, as an estimated 20 million people seek jobs annually.
4. China's exposure to the global financial crisis, particularly from the fallout of the U.S. subprime mortgage problem, is unclear. While restrictions on capital flows limit the exposure of Chinese private sector firms and individual investors, Chinese government entities may have been more exposed to troubled U.S. mortgage securities.
5. China's foreign exchange reserves, which have grown from $403 billion in 2003 to $2.1 trillion as of June 2009, are largely invested in overseas assets, including U.S. securities, to earn interest. As of June 2008, China held $1,205 billion in U.S. securities, making it the second-largest foreign holder of such securities.
6. China's holdings of U.S. securities, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, are likely to have been more substantial but less risky, especially after these institutions were placed in conservatorship by the Federal Government in September 2008.

4. The Secretary of the Interior cannot issue any lease for National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain if the Secretary of Agriculture objects.
5. The U.S. Forest Service has issued separate regulations governing certain aspects of leasing and permitting for oil and gas development on lands within its jurisdiction.
6. The Secretary is authorized to withdraw public lands managed by BLM so that some or all potential land uses are proscribed on those lands.
7. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop and revise ""land use plans"" for the public lands, which serve as the initial determinant of which lands may be subject to leasing.
8. The Secretary must provide opportunities for the public and various levels of government to participate in the development of RMPs, and regulations require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA) when producing an RMP.
9. The Secretary's mandate to formulate and revise RMPs extends to all BLM-managed public lands, no matter how they had been classified before the enactment of FLPMA in 1976.

However, fewer filers in the highest income group claimed the home mortgage interest deduction, possibly due to cash home purchases or preferred mortgage investments.

535,"1. The Pacific Islands region, also known as the South Pacific or Southwest Pacific, is strategically important and includes U.S. territories. The region has attracted Chinese diplomatic and economic attention, and the U.S. has economic interests in the area, particularly fishing. The U.S. provides foreign assistance to Pacific Island countries for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The region covers 20 million square miles of ocean and 117,000 square miles of land, with 14 sovereign states and approximately 9 million people.
2. The region's gross domestic product (GDP) is around $32 billion, and per capita incomes range from lower middle income to upper middle income. Many Pacific Island countries have experienced greater political than economic success since gaining independence. Human rights are generally respected, and elections are considered free and fair. However, political institutions are often weak, and civil unrest occurs occasionally. Many Pacific Island countries have limited natural and human resources for sustained development.
3. The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) seeks to foster cooperation between member states, including Australia, Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The PIF addresses key issues such as climate change, regional security, and fisheries. American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Marianas have observer status with the PIF.
4. The U.S. has friendly relations with Pacific Island countries and has benefitted from their support in the United Nations. The U.S. has worked with Australia to advance shared strategic interests, maintain regional stability, and promote economic development. China has become a diplomatic force, major source of foreign aid, and leading trade partner in the region. Other nations, including Russia, India, and Indonesia, have also increased their engagement in the region. The Pacific Islands can be divided into spheres of influence, with the American sphere extending through parts of the Micronesian and Polynesian subregions. U.S. security interests in the Micronesian subregion include military bases on Guam and Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.",0
536,"1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a federal law that aims to protect and recover species facing extinction by limiting activities that could harm them and penalizing the taking of listed species. Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine if a project may jeopardize a listed species or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.
2. If a project could jeopardize a species, the agency must implement reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoid jeopardy. In rare cases, an exemption to the ESA restrictions may be granted if the project cannot proceed without jeopardizing the species, and if economic factors justify overriding jeopardy to the species. The exemption process is used sparingly, with only two instances of granting an exemption in over four decades.
3. The ESA exemption process involves several steps, including consultation between the federal agency and the Secretary of Commerce or Interior, submission of a complete application, determination of whether the applicant has met certain criteria, and a formal hearing to collect evidence. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) makes the final decision on granting an exemption, taking into account the availability of reasonable and prudent alternatives, the benefits of the action, and the impact on the species and its critical habitat.
4. Mitigation and enhancement measures are required for approved exemptions, and the exemption applicant is responsible for carrying out and paying for the measures. Exemptions are permanent unless the Secretary later finds that the exemption would result in the extinction of a species not identified during consultation. The ESC cannot grant an exemption if it would violate a treaty or other international obligation of the United States.
5. The ESA exemption process is complex and time-consuming, taking up to 280 days. The applicant must fund any required mitigation measures, and the burden of conservation may fall more heavily on other areas where the species inhabits or on other resources that the species requires. The consultation and negotiation stages provided for in the ESA may accomplish the purpose of modifying proposed actions early in the planning and development stages and avoid harm to listed species.",0
537,"1. The net capital loss limitation was enacted to prevent taxpayers from manipulating the timing of their capital gains and losses realizations to minimize their income tax liabilities. The limitation restricts the amount of capital losses that can be deducted against other income in a tax year, currently set at $3,000. Without the limitation, taxpayers could significantly reduce their taxes by altering the timing of their realizations of gains and losses. The limitation reduces the tax savings in the worst-case scenario by approximately $882 in present value terms.
2. The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed repeatedly over the years, with some legislative changes attempting to reestablish symmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses. Under current law, asymmetries remain, such as the deductibility of net long-term losses against net short-term gains without limit, and the different tax rates for ordinary income and long-term gains. Some analysts have suggested increasing the net capital loss limitation as a means of softening the impact of the recent downturn in the stock market. However, this could increase the dichotomy between the tax treatment of gains and losses and may not be an effective device to stimulate aggregate demand. The restoration of the value of the loss limitation to its 1978 level is more complicated, as it requires addressing the growing asymmetry between loss and gain, which has been increasingly important through recent tax changes. Achieving full symmetry in the system requires accounting for the tax rate differential between short and long-term gains and losses during the netting process.",0
538,"1. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) guarantees the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of their choosing, with the goal of mitigating and eliminating labor-related obstructions to the free flow of commerce. The NLRA applies to ""employees,"" excluding those with supervisory authority.
2. The NLRA defines a ""supervisor"" as an individual who, in the interest of the employer, has authority to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or to direct them, adjust their grievances, or effectively recommend such action. The term ""independent judgment"" is not further defined in the NLRA.
3. In the case of NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that ""independent judgment"" does not exclude judgment informed by professional or technical training or experience. The Court maintained that the NLRB's interpretation of ""independent judgment"" as not including ""ordinary professional or technical judgment"" was inappropriate.
4. The NLRB has the discretion to clarify the meaning of the term ""independent judgment,"" but the Court believed that the NLRB's reference to ""ordinary or technical judgment"" established a ""startling categorical exclusion"" that was not suggested by the NLRA's statutory text.
5. In Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., the NLRB revisited the issue of supervisory status, defining the terms ""assign,"" ""responsibly to direct,"" and ""independent judgment"" as they are used in section 2(11) of the NLRA. The NLRB concluded that the term ""assign"" should refer to the act of designating an employee to a place, appointing an employee to a time, or giving significant overall duties or tasks to an employee.
6. The NLRB interpreted ""responsibly to direct"" to apply to individuals who are held accountable for the performance of the work being performed. To establish accountability, it must be shown that the employer delegated to the putative supervisor the authority to direct the work and the authority to take corrective action.
7. The NLRB maintained that at a minimum, an individual must act or effectively recommend action that is ""free of the control of others and form an opinion or evaluation by discerning and comparing data",0
539,"1. Banks play a crucial role in the economy by connecting borrowers and savers, but banking is also a risky activity that can result in significant societal and economic benefits or losses.
2. Over time, a regulatory system has developed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks, and both banks and regulation have co-evolved as market conditions have changed.
3. Recent years have seen significant transformations in the banking industry, including the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010.
4. This report provides an overview of selected banking-related issues, including prudential regulation, consumer protection, ""too big to fail"" banks, community banking, regulatory agency structures and independence, and recent market and economic trends.
5. The report is not an exhaustive look at all bank policy issues, but rather a concise background and analysis of certain prominent issues that have been the subject of recent discussion and debate.",1
540,"1. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (S. 2499) was signed into law on December 29, 2007, extending funding and making changes to the nation's major health programs.
2. The Act suspends the Medicare physician payment cut and provides SCHIP funding through March 2009, redistributing unspent FY2006 funds to states facing shortfalls.
3. The Act also extends expiring provisions and programs, affecting Medicare plans, providers, and Medicaid payments, and includes funding for miscellaneous activities.
4. Regarding Medicare Advantage plans, the Act allows Medicare Special Needs Plans to continue restricting enrollment and cost-based plans to operate in areas with two local or two regional Medicare Advantage plans.
5. Extensions for Medicare payments include adjustments for certain providers and services, reimbursement for rural hospitals, and exceptions to annual per beneficiary payment limits for outpatient therapy services.
6. Medicaid extensions include increased payments for Medicaid disproportionate hospital share allotments, continued benefits for certain low-income families, and coverage of Medicare part B premiums under the Qualifying Individual program.
7. The Act also includes provisions for additional funds under the State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, grants for Area Agencies on Aging and Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and extends the Title V Abstinence Education block grant through June 30, 2008.",1

542,"1. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a 10-member grouping of Southeast Asian nations with a combined population of 580 million and an annual gross domestic product (GDP) of around $1.5 trillion. Established in 1967, ASEAN has grown into one of the world's largest regional fora, representing a strategically and economically important region.
2. The Obama Administration has expressed an intent to pay greater attention to Southeast Asia, listen more carefully to regional concerns, and work with multilateral organizations, particularly ASEAN, to cooperate on issues of mutual interest. The United States has deep-seated interests in Southeast Asia, such as maritime security, the promotion of democracy and human rights, the encouragement of liberal trade and investment regimes, counterterrorism, and the combating of illegal trafficking of narcotics and human trafficking.
3. Engagement with ASEAN has presented the United States with an important foreign policy dilemma. Despite considerable U.S. security, economic, and foreign assistance initiatives in the region, particularly at the bilateral level, in recent years a perception has developed among Southeast Asian elites that the United States has placed relatively little priority on ASEAN itself and has, thereby, demonstrated a lack of commitment to Southeast Asia as a whole.
4. ASEAN's most critical external relations continue to be with the United States, Japan, and China. Many analysts argue that China's ""soft power""—global influence attained through economic, diplomatic, cultural, and other non-coercive means—has grown significantly in the past decade, and that China's diplomatic outreach, including building links to ASEAN, has surpassed that of the United States during the past several years.
5. U.S. assistance for Southeast Asian multilateral efforts focuses on trade facilitation, counterterrorism, security sector reform, and the environment. U.S. funding for East Asia Pacific regional programs, a large portion of which supports ASEAN, ARF, and APEC objectives, totaled an estimated $20 million in 2009.
6. The development of ASEAN's human rights body may also merit attention. Congress has frequently considered legislation and resolutions concerning human rights conditions in Southeast Asia",0
543,"1. Cuba has been on the ""state sponsors of terrorism"" list since 1982 due to its repeated provision of support for acts of international terrorism.
2. This designation results in various trade benefits, foreign aid, and other benefits being restricted or denied to Cuba.
3. The Reagan Administration added Cuba to the list in 1982 due to its ties to international terrorism and support for armed insurgencies in Latin America.
4. Cuba was added to the list for its support of the M-19 guerrilla group in Colombia and for providing support to other terrorist organizations in Latin America.
5. The State Department maintains that Cuba continues to support terrorist groups and provide safe haven for members of several Foreign Terrorist Organizations.
6. Cuba has been accused of hosting U.S. fugitives from justice and not being responsive to U.S. requests for their return.
7. Some observers argue that Cuba should be removed from the terrorism list due to its ratification of international counterterrorism conventions and offers of support to the United States after the 9/11 attacks.
8. Others maintain that Cuba should remain on the list due to its history of supporting terrorist acts and armed insurgencies in Latin America and Africa.",1
544,"1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax calculation with a broader base than the regular tax, including certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions. The first $175,000 of AMT income is taxed at 26%, and the remainder at 28%, with exemptions not indexed to inflation.
2. In 1987, 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but this number grew to 823,000 by 1999 and is projected to reach 9 million by 2009, primarily affecting joint returns and returns with tax liability.
3. The AMT does not include certain benefits, such as lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds, leading to a shift in exposure from the highest income classes to the middle and upper middle income classes.
4. Indexing AMT exemptions and eliminating the credit limit provision would cost billions of dollars, but not indexing exemptions has led to an increase in the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT.
5. The AMT can significantly impact the effectiveness of tax cuts and other tax provisions, particularly those aimed at reducing taxes for joint returns, as the interaction between the AMT and regular tax can restrict tax cuts and create marriage penalties.",0
545,"1. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate are responsible for drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six related agencies.
2. The DOT's budget is primarily for grants to state and local government agencies for transportation infrastructure, while HUD's programs address housing problems faced by low-income households, including rental assistance and community development activities.
3. The THUD bill also funds other transportation and housing-related agencies, and its funding for DOT and HUD declined in real terms from FY2010 to FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested a reduction of $2 billion for DOT and $7.5 billion for HUD, while the House-passed bill would provide a slight reduction and the Senate-reported bill would provide a slight increase in funding compared to FY2017.",0
546,"1. The U.S. and India have established a ""global partnership"" with increased cooperation in various sectors, while the U.S. aims to isolate Iran and ensure its nuclear program is purely civilian. India, which has traditionally had positive relations with Iran, has a strategic partnership with Tehran, but it is not a strategic alliance.
2. India is unlikely to abandon its relationship with Iran due to energy commerce interests, including long-term contracts for purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and support for a proposed natural gas pipeline from Iran to India through Pakistan. The Bush Administration opposes the pipeline project, but top Indian officials insist it is in India's national interest.
3. Some analysts believe that geostrategic motives, including great power aspirations, drive India's pursuit of closer relations with Iran. Indian officials downplayed the significance of Iranian naval ships visiting India's Kochi port, but Secretary Rice expressed concerns, including the proposed gas pipeline.
4. India's relations with Iran are underlined by historical, civilizational, and multifaceted ties, with cooperation in energy, trade, information technology, and transit. During 2006-07, relations with Iran were further strengthened through regular exchanges.
5. New Delhi intends to bring its Iran policy into closer alignment with that of the United States, but it faces domestic challenges from a sizeable constituency urging resistance to any U.S. pressure that might inhibit New Delhi-Tehran relations. India has aligned itself with international efforts to bring Iran's controversial nuclear program into conformity with Non-Proliferation Treaty and IAEA provisions.
6. India's main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has voiced its approval of the present government's policy toward Iran's nuclear program. In 2005, India voted with the majority in an IAEA resolution finding Iran in noncompliance with its international obligations, despite criticism from opposition parties and independent analysts. In February 2006, India again voted with the majority in referring Iran to the Security Council, even as it insisted that its vote should not be interpreted as detracting from India's traditionally close relations with Iran.",0
547,"1. The importation of milk protein concentrates (MPCs) has been a topic of interest in Congress due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes. MPCs are derived from raw milk and are used in various food products, animal feed, and industrial products. Currently, U.S. imports of MPCs have limited or no trade restrictions while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas.
2. Advocates for stricter import controls on MPCs argue that it would prevent the unlimited importation of milk protein and encourage the use of domestically produced protein, raising milk prices for dairy farmers. However, opponents argue that it would increase their costs and result in higher retail food prices. Additionally, major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports.",0
548,"1. In 2000, democratic parties defeated Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, leading to a transition towards democratic and free market standards.
2. Serbia has held largely free and fair elections, but organized crime, high-level corruption, and economic problems persist, with the EU integration process hindered by Kosovo-related issues.
3. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) made significant gains in the 2012 elections, leading to a new government with the SPS's Ivica Dacic as Prime Minister.
4. The new government has taken steps to fight corruption, but concerns remain about the powers of the autonomous region of Vojvodina and the Presevo Valley region's ties to Kosovo.
5. Serbia's economy has been affected by the global economic crisis, with high unemployment and low net salaries, leading to pressure from the IMF for privatization and fiscal reforms.
6. Serbia's relations with Kosovo remain strained, with EU-mediated talks focusing on technical issues and the status of the four Serbian-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo.
7. The US has recognized Kosovo's independence, causing tensions with Serbia, but overall US-Serbian relations have improved, with a focus on EU integration, regional stability, and economic ties.",1
549,"1. The Florida Supreme Court decided that a dog sniff at the front door of a suspected grow house by a trained narcotics-detection dog is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause.
2. The court distinguished this case from previous Supreme Court decisions by emphasizing the private nature of the home and the potential for discrimination or arbitrariness in the use of drug-detection dogs.
3. The court also placed the burden on the state to establish the dog's reliability in detecting drugs.
4. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Florida court's decision, finding that the dog's alert, when viewed through the lens of common sense, would lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that a search would reveal contraband.
5. The Court clarified that a defendant must be afforded the opportunity to challenge a dog's reliability, but the prosecution had presented substantial evidence of the dog's proficiency at detecting drugs in this case.",1
550,"1. The federal government has supported energy storage and electric power system technology since the 1970s, before the establishment of the Department of Energy (DOE). Initially focused on energy storage, the program has expanded to include support for large coal and nuclear power plants and the integration of renewable energy sources.
2. The advancement of computer technology has improved the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows, reducing the risk of blackouts. However, the increasing use of Internet-connected networks has introduced new cybersecurity challenges, such as unwanted computer-driven intrusions and disruptions.
3. The nation's energy infrastructure is diverse and interdependent, consisting of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically. Coordinating the security and resilience of these assets is complicated by the predominantly privately-owned infrastructure and the need for cost control, physical security, and cybersecurity.
4. Key challenges and opportunities facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure, modernizing and securing communication networks, accommodating new end-use technologies, planning for increased interdependencies of natural gas, water, and electricity systems, and devising business models to manage these challenges.
5. The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is responsible for supporting more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure. OE supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through research and development, demonstration projects, partnerships, modeling and analytics, and emergency preparedness and response.
6. OE is the federal government's lead entity for energy sector-specific responses to national energy security emergencies due to hardware or software problems. OE's goal for the future grid is to support economic growth and energy innovation through delivery of reliable, affordable, and clean electricity to consumers where, when, and how they want it.
7. The largest share of OE funding goes to research and development on technology development, while the remainder goes to a variety of planning and operational areas. OE divides these responsibilities into five general areas: R&D and Deployment, Modeling and Analytics, Institutional Support and Technical Assistance, Coordination of Federal Transmission Permits, and Emergency Preparedness and Response.
8. OE's mission is guided by two key",0
551,"1. The creation of commemorative works in the District of Columbia has evolved since Congress approved an equestrian statue to George Washington in 1783. Before 1986, statutory criteria for authorizing commemorative works did not exist, and Congress established site locations and approved memorial designs.
2. In 1986, Congress passed the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) to guide the memorial creation process in the District of Columbia, aiming to preserve the integrity of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans, ensure public use and enjoyment of open space, and maintain limited open space. The CWA defines commemorative works and lists exceptions, such as military properties and Smithsonian land.
3. The CWA was introduced in the House in 1986 by Representative William Hughes and passed through committees and the House with support and reservations from various members. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Public Lands, Reserved Water, and Resource Conservation held a hearing on both S. 2522 and H.R. 4378, eventually reporting H.R. 4378 with the Senate text.
4. The CWA, as enacted, contains 10 sections addressing the purposes of the bill, definitions, congressional authorization for memorials, creation of the National Capital Memorial Commission, conditions for memorial placement, site design and approval, issuance of construction permits, creation of a temporary memorial site, and other administrative provisions.
5. In 1991, Congress realized that many authorized sponsor groups were not able to complete memorial construction within the allocated time period, leading to the introduction of H.R. 3169 to extend the time to seven years. The bill was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush on December 11, 1991.
6. Further extending legislative authority, Representative Nancy Johnson introduced H.R. 2947 in 1993 to grant nine years to the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation, Women in Military Service for America Memorial, and the National Peace Garden. The bill also included technical amendments to the CWA at the request of the National Capital Memorial Commission.

552,"1. The America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, S. 1796, aims to reform the private health insurance market, set minimum standards for health benefits, and provide financial assistance to certain individuals and small employers.
2. The bill requires individuals to maintain health insurance and imposes a tax on certain employers with more than 50 employees who do not provide insurance.
3. Market reforms include modified community rating, guaranteed issue and renewal, and a requirement for essential health benefits coverage.
4. Qualifying coverage includes QHBPs offered in or out of an exchange, new group or individual coverage, grandfathered employment-based plans, and other coverage like Medicare and Medicaid.
5. Exchanges, established by states or the HHS Secretary, will provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to private plans.
6. Certain individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level can qualify for premium credits and subsidies towards cost-sharing, only available through exchanges.
7. States have flexibility to establish basic plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid.
8. Existing plans offered by employers and in the individual market will be grandfathered, but small group plans must meet applicable private market reforms by July 1, 2013.
9. New plans can be sold in both the individual and group market outside of an exchange, but only those that meet minimum requirements specified in the bill will satisfy requirements for individuals and employers.",1
553,"1. High risk health insurance pools (HRPs) are established by 35 states to provide health insurance coverage to individuals who cannot obtain or afford coverage in the private market due to preexisting health conditions. HRPs cover people who have been denied coverage, received high quotes, or received offers with preexisting condition exclusions in the individual market. HRPs also help states comply with HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions.

2. State HRPs generally enroll a small percentage of the uninsured, with approximately 200,000 individuals enrolled in 2008. Limited enrollment is due to the narrow focus on individuals with preexisting conditions who are ineligible for public or group health insurance and seek coverage in the private, non-group market. Federal grants have been provided to state HRPs, with the Trade Act of 2002 authorizing $20 million in seed grants and $80 million in operational grants for FY2003 and FY2004.

3. HRPs are designed to assist individuals with health conditions that limit their private health coverage options. By removing high-risk individuals from the individual market and placing them in publicly subsidized insurance pools, coverage in the individual market becomes more affordable, promoting competition and retaining insurance carriers. However, some argue that HRPs are underfunded and may not substantially reduce the number of uninsured, particularly those with serious medical conditions.

4. State HRPs have discretion in establishing and operating pools, including covered benefits, eligibility requirements, pre-existing condition exclusion periods, and funding sources. Most states cap HRP premiums between 150% and 200% of standard risk rates and tap other sources of funding to cover operating expenses. Health benefits provided through HRPs generally reflect coverage available in the private nongroup market, with deductibles, cost-sharing requirements, and preexisting condition exclusions varying by state.

5. States establish eligibility criteria for HRPs, allowing HIPAA-eligible persons, individuals with specific medical conditions, those denied or restricted coverage, and Health Coverage Tax Credit recipients to enroll. HRP participation varies significantly across states, with average enrollment ranging from 265 in Florida to 27,187 in Minnesota in December ",0
554,"1. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a program that provides the Department of Defense (DOD) with additional airlift capabilities during times of crisis. It is a partnership between the DOD and U.S. airline industry, with the DOD and Department of Transportation (DOT) working together to manage the program. CRAF participants are U.S. carriers that commit a portion of their fleet to the program and meet strict safety and maintenance standards.
2. The CRAF has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the aircraft performance characteristics needed.
3. The CRAF has been activated twice in its history, during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In FY2007, the guaranteed portion of DOD's CRAF contract was $379 million, while AMC expected to award $2.1 billion in additional business. The CRAF program provides cost advantages to the DOD, as the use of CRAF aircraft during an activation is less expensive than acquiring and supporting additional military aircraft. However, commercial aircraft have operational limitations when compared to DOD's organic airlift fleet.",0

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is a U.S. Department of Commerce agency that advises on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology policies, represents the Administration in telecommunications and information policy activities, and manages spectrum used by federal agencies.
2. NTIA's responsibilities include overseeing the transfer of radio frequencies from the federal to the commercial domain, administering grants programs, and establishing a $135 million grant program for states to plan for participation in a nationwide public safety broadband network. The NTIA also collaborates with other agencies on matters concerning spectrum access, technology, and policy, and participates in interagency efforts to develop Internet policy.
3. The NTIA's Office of Spectrum Management (OSM) ensures the effective, efficient, and equitable use of the spectrum both nationally and internationally, while the Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) supports NTIA's role as principal adviser to the Executive Branch on telecommunications and information policies. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) develops policies to enhance U.S. companies' ability to compete globally in the information technology and communications sectors.
4. The NTIA's Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) provides technical support to advance telecommunications and information infrastructure development, and the Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) administers grant programs that further the deployment and use of technology in America. Many decisions regarding the use of federal spectrum are made through the Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC), which comprises representatives of various federal agencies. Enacted legislation for FY2012 provided $45.6 million to the NTIA for salaries and expenses, an increase over the previous year but less than requested by the Administration. The Administration had requested new funding for the NTIA to support efforts to foster new wireless broadband technologies and address Internet-based privacy principles.",0
556,"1. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, also known as the ""Electric Reliability Act of 2005,"" was enacted to improve the reliability of the U.S. bulk power system as it undergoes restructuring. The Act grants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction over activities that support reliability and establishes an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) with the authority to develop and enforce reliability standards, including cybersecurity protection.
2. The ERO is required to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system, with all ERO standards approved by FERC. Penalties can be imposed on users, owners, or operators of a bulk power system that violate any FERC-approved reliability standard. FERC can also enforce penalties for entities that do not comply with reliability standards.
3. The Secretary of Energy is required to conduct a study of electric transmission congestion every three years and is authorized to issue construction permits in designated congested areas. The Department of Energy (DOE) is given new authority to prepare environmental documents and make decisions on rights-of-way and siting on federal lands.
4. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) are able to participate with other entities for the design, development, construction, operation, maintenance, or ownership of transmission facilities in designated National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors.
5. FERC is directed to encourage deployment of advanced transmission technologies and establish an Advanced Power System Technology Incentive Program to provide incentive payments to owners or operators of advanced power generation systems. A program is also established to provide incentive payments to owners or operators of qualifying advanced power system technology facilities.",0
557,"1. The Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) of 1936 was enacted to enable small businesses to compete with larger companies in the purchase of commodities, particularly in the grocery store industry. The law prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality"" to different purchasers. The RPA applies only to the sale of goods and not services, and only where each sale is of goods purchased for resale within the United States.
2. The RPA has been enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but its enforcement has been inconsistent. The RPA has been criticized for having adverse effects on the economy and for limiting the extent of discounting, which has likely caused consumers to pay higher prices than they otherwise would.
3. The RPA has an exemption for nonprofit institutions, which was broadened by the 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act to include purchases of supplies for their own use by schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions not operated for profit. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the exemption strictly, limiting it to purchases made in order to enable the institution to meet the needs of the institution and those of staff physicians, medical and nursing students, and their dependents.
4. The RPA has two primary affirmative defenses: the ""meeting competition"" defense and the ""cost justified"" defense. The ""meeting competition"" defense allows a seller to charge different prices to meet the prices of a competing seller or to enable the buyer to meet the competition of one of the buyer's competitors. The ""cost justified"" defense allows a seller to make only due allowance for the costs incurred in producing or delivering the goods.
5. The RPA has been challenged in several court cases, including Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Association, Inc. (1976), Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Ass'n., Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories (1983), and De Modena v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (1984). These cases have further clarified the scope of the RPA and its exemptions.
6. In recent years, there have been efforts to modify or repeal the RPA, including hearings held by the House Small Business Committee in the mid-19",0

2. The clause has been interpreted as preventing the President from disregarding or suspending laws enacted by Congress.
3. The Supreme Court has established that executive branch officials, including the President, must comply with the law.
4. In Marbury v. Madison, the Court recognized the obligation of executive branch officials to execute congressional directives and the power of courts to enforce specific duties.
5. The Kendall case reinforced the distinction between Congress's role in creating law and the President's role in executing it.
6. The Youngstown case further emphasized the President's limited role in lawmaking and the importance of the Take Care Clause.
7. The courts have interpreted the Take Care Clause as ensuring presidential control over those who execute and enforce the law.
8. The Bowsher and Buckley cases demonstrate the invalidation of laws undermining the President's ability to oversee the execution and enforcement of the law.
9. The Printz case suggested that vesting state and local officers with the authority to enforce federal law may intrude upon the President's duty to oversee those that execute the law.",0
559,"1. The official U.S. poverty rate in 2013 was 14.5%, a statistically significant drop from 15.0% in 2012, marking the first decline since 2006. However, the number of people below the poverty line remained statistically unchanged at 45.3 million. The poverty rate tends to follow the economic cycle, with higher poverty rates during recessions and lower rates during economic growth.
2. The poverty rate increased over the past decade due to two economic recessions, reaching a peak of 15.1% in 2010. The strong economy in the 1990s contributed to a record-tying low poverty rate of 11.3% in 2000. The most recent recession, which ended in June 2009, was the longest recorded post-World War II period, causing the unemployment rate to increase from 4.9% in January 2008 to 10.0% in October 2009.
3. The poverty rate among non-aged adults (persons aged 18 to 64) reached a high of 13.8% in 2010, while the poverty rate among children (under 18) fell from 21.3% in 2012 to 19.5% in 2013. However, the 2013 child poverty rate is still well above its pre-recession low of 16.9% (2006). Children living in single female-headed families are especially prone to poverty, with nearly half of them living in poverty in 2013.
4. The poverty rate among the aged (65 and over) was statistically unchanged at 9.5% in 2013, although the number of poor aged individuals rose by an estimated 305,000. The current official U.S. poverty measure, developed in the early 1960s, is based on the concept of a minimal standard of food consumption and is not adjusted for changes in living standards over time.
5. The poverty thresholds are updated each year for changes in consumer prices and reflect the amount of money individuals or families need per year to purchase a basket of goods and services",0
560,"1. The U.S. agricultural sector heavily relies on trade, with exports accounting for about 20% of total U.S. agricultural production. The U.S. farm policy is subject to intense scrutiny for compliance with WTO rules and its potential impact on future multilateral negotiations. The farm bill, which is renewed every five or six years, locks in U.S. policy behavior for an extended period, making it difficult to accept new restrictions on domestic support programs.
2. The WTO commitments are crucial in determining U.S. domestic farm policy choices. The WTO agreements, particularly the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), set country-specific aggregate spending limits on the most market-distorting policies and define general rules covering trade among member countries.
3. The AoA categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs according to their potential to distort commercial markets. Programs that have the greatest potential to distort agricultural markets, known as amber box subsidies, are subject to spending limits. In contrast, more benign outlays are exempted from spending limits under green box, blue box, de minimis, or special and differential treatment exemptions.
4. The AoA contains detailed rules and procedures to guide countries in determining how to classify its programs in terms of which are most likely to distort production and trade, in calculating their annual cost, and in reporting the total cost to the WTO. The WTO uses a traffic light analogy to group programs, with green box programs being minimally or non-trade distorting and not subject to any spending limits.
5. Blue box programs are described as production-limiting, with payments based on a fixed area or yield, or a fixed number of livestock, and are made on less than 85% of base production. Amber box programs are the most market-distorting programs and are subject to a strict aggregate, annual spending limit. The United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays subject to certain de minimis exclusions.
6. The SCM details rules for determining when a subsidy is ""prohibited"" or ""actionable"" based on the degree to which a domestic support program engenders market distortion. The SCM evalu",0
561,"1. The campus-based programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, including the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs, are unique in that the mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined according to institution-specific award criteria.
2. These programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, but their authorizations of appropriations expired in FY2015, with the exception of the Perkins Loan program, which was amended and extended through FY2017.
3. The campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort, with only 2% of the approximately $125 billion of federal aid made available to students in FY2016 going to these programs.
4. The FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, most recently through the Continuing Appropriations Act 2018, while the Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015.
5. The Extension Act prohibits future appropriations for the Perkins Loan program and prohibits an automatic extension of it under the General Education Provisions Act.
6. The campus-based programs are among the oldest of the federal financial aid programs, but as federal aid has largely transitioned to a system that allows for portability in receipt of student aid, these programs have come to play a relatively smaller role.
7. As lawmakers consider reauthorization of the HEA, several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered, including the extent to which they provide types of aid to students that are not provided via other postsecondary aid programs.
8. Other issues that may be considered include whether the current formula for allocating funds to institutions is optimal and the potential role of the campus-based aid programs in a redesigned federal aid system.
9. Provisions specific to each program, such as requirements for community service under FWS and terms and conditions of Perkins Loans, are also likely to be considered.",0

2. It highlights the proposed measures by Congress to assist in recovering vulnerable missing adults, including the establishment of a grant program to encourage states to establish, expand, and coordinate alert systems for missing adults.
3. The document also provides an overview of existing state alert systems in 11 states, including legal authority, target population, administrative responsibility, training, process for activating alerts, interstate coordination, system costs, use of the systems, and outcomes.",1
563,"1. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) FY2017 appropriations were enacted through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), which included $41.3 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. This was an increase of $426 million from the FY2016 enacted level and $578 million above the President's request. The act also included $6.7 billion in funding for the costs of major disasters under the Stafford Act and $163 million in funding for overseas contingency operations.
2. The act also included a provision allowing DHS to obligate funds in the account and budget structure of the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) as laid out in a report submitted to the appropriations committees prior to the start of FY2017. The CAS structure was originally laid out in the FY2016 Department of Homeland Security Act, and Section 130 allowed modifications to the structure developed since that time. The act also included a provision extending special procurement authorities for research and development activities at DHS, known as ""other transaction authority.""",0
564,"1. The water supply and water quality infrastructure in the United States have been recognized as potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks, which could disrupt the delivery of vital human services and threaten public health or the environment.
2. Water infrastructure systems are highly linked with other infrastructure systems, such as electric power and transportation, and a disruption in one system can have a domino effect on others. For example, during the August 2003 electricity blackout in the Northeast United States, wastewater treatment plants and drinking water plants lost power, leading to the discharge of untreated sewage and boil-water advisories in many communities.
3. Water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources, dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, pipes, treatment facilities, finished water reservoirs, distribution systems, and wastewater collection and treatment facilities. Across the country, these systems comprise approximately 77,000 dams and reservoirs, thousands of miles of pipes, aqueducts, water distribution, and sewer lines, 168,000 public drinking water facilities, and about 16,000 publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities.
4. Ownership and management of water infrastructure systems are both public and private. The federal government has ownership responsibility for hundreds of dams and diversion structures, but the vast majority of the nation's water infrastructure is either privately owned or owned by non-federal units of government.
5. The federal government has built hundreds of water projects, primarily dams and reservoirs for irrigation development and flood control, with municipal and industrial water use as an incidental, self-financed, project purpose. Many of these facilities are critically entwined with the nation's overall water supply, transportation, and electricity infrastructure.
6. The largest federal facilities were built and are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) of the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) of the Department of Defense. Reclamation reservoirs supply water to millions of people in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada via Reclamation and non-Reclamation aqueducts.
7. The potential for terrorism is not new, and the federal government has been involved in water infrastructure security for decades. In 1941, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote about the vulnerability",0
565,"1. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III) was amended and reauthorized by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV). Perkins IV authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for FY2007-FY2012 for Perkins Act programs and activities, and it changes the terminology from ""vocational and technical education"" to ""career and technical education"" (CTE). The act retains the overall structure of the Perkins Act, with Sections 1 through 9 dealing with overarching provisions and Title I, Title II, and Title III authorizing and specifying the central provisions, tech-prep program, and general provisions, respectively.
2. Perkins IV makes changes in the reservations of funds for certain purposes, such as reducing the amount reserved for assistance for outlying areas from 0.2% to 0.13% and increasing the amount of direct grants to outlying areas. The act also changes the state allotment formula when there are ""additional funds"" above the amount allotted to states for FY2006, and it requires states to distribute at least 85% of state grant funds to the local level, with up to 10% reserved for eligible recipients in rural areas and in areas with high percentages or high numbers of CTE students.
3. Perkins IV establishes six explicit core indicators of performance at the secondary level and five core indicators at the postsecondary level, which both eligible agencies and eligible recipients are required to establish measures for. The core indicators of performance include student attainment of challenging academic content standards and student academic achievement standards, student attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies, student rates of attainment of a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, student graduation rates, student placement in postsecondary education or advanced training, placement in military service or employment, and student participation in and completion of CTE programs that lead to employment in non-traditional fields.
4. Perkins IV includes greater specification of membership on the independent advisory panel that advises the Secretary on the evaluation and assessment of CTE programs funded under the act. The act also adds additional requirements to the assessment, such as examining teacher preparation",0

2. The gross estate for estate tax purposes includes all property owned by the deceased, as well as certain property transferred during their lifetime.
3. Deductions from the gross estate include administrative expenses, debts, and certain transfers to a surviving spouse or charity.
4. The estate tax is computed by applying a progressive tax rate schedule to the taxable estate, which is the gross estate minus deductions.

567,"1. Border and Transportation Security (BTS) is a critical function in protecting the American people from terrorists and their weapons.
2. The federal government has implemented multiple programs and policies to achieve BTS, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the USA PATRIOT ACT.
3. Congress has shown continuous interest in terrorism and border security, with legislative measures aimed at understanding the terrorist threat, structural changes, and specific actions to protect against immediate threats.
4. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated many federal agencies responsible for BTS into the Department of Homeland Security.
5. CBP, the Coast Guard, and the TSA's airline security component are primarily responsible for current border security activities.
6. Border security policies have evolved to address issues before they reach the border, harden the border through technology and agents, make the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel, strengthen the border through intelligence, and engage other actors in enforcement efforts.
7. Technological advancements, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and non-intrusive inspection technologies, are being used to enhance border security.
8. The U.S.-VISIT program, biometric identifiers, and the Automated Targeting System are crucial in tracking and preventing potential threats at U.S. ports of entry.

568,"1. Cabo Verde is a small island nation with historical ties to the United States, located off the coast of West Africa. It is considered a success story in Africa due to its democratic governance, high per capita income, high literacy rate, and positive social indicators.
2. The country is of strategic significance to the U.S. due to its location as a transshipment point for Latin American cocaine bound for Europe and as a key refueling stopover for trans-Atlantic air traffic. U.S.-Cabo Verdean cooperation focuses on counternarcotics efforts, military professionalization, and development projects.
3. Cabo Verde's political system takes into account its large expatriate population, who can vote in national elections and elect six parliamentarians of the 72-member legislature. The country became a democracy in 1991, following increasing demands for a multi-party political system.
4. The MPD, which came to power in the 1990s, pursued an economic reform-focused agenda, seeking to privatize state-owned firms, reform public spending, alleviate poverty, boost social services, and promote exports. This policy agenda continues to define the MPD and is broadly shared with the PAICV.
5. In the most recent parliamentary elections, in March 2016, the MPD won 40 seats, the PAICV 29, and the small Independent and Democratic Cabo Verdean Union three. The MPD victory ended 15 consecutive years of PAICV parliamentary majorities.
6. The new government has prioritized economic expansion and job growth; poverty reduction; infrastructure and business environment enhancements; expanded foreign direct investment; crime reduction measures; and national security, in part by countering drug trafficking.
7. Cabo Verde faces some rule of law and human rights challenges, but its record is far better than that of most other African countries. It is classified as a lower-middle-income economy and ranks within the medium tier of human development under the annual U.N. Human Development Index.
8. The country's economy has been growing in recent years, but weak economic growth in Europe and ongoing sluggishness in the United Kingdom have contributed to a sluggish economy. Cabo Verde is continuing efforts to diversify its aid",0
569,"1. The United States and New Zealand have re-established a close security partnership, following New Zealand's nuclear policies in the 1980s that led to restricted bilateral defense cooperation. This partnership is demonstrated by New Zealand's invitation to the Nuclear Summit in 2010 and the lifting of the ban on New Zealand naval ship visits to U.S. ports in 2012. Various organizations promote bilateral ties between the two nations, including the U.S.-N.Z. Council, the Friends of New Zealand Congressional Caucus, and the Pacific Partnership Forum.
2. The Wellington Declaration of 2010 and the 2012 Washington Declaration on Defense Cooperation have further strengthened this partnership, focusing on practical cooperation and political dialogue. Both nations are Pacific countries with shared democratic values and common interests, and they cooperate in areas such as maritime security, counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief. New Zealand's defense forces participated in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) military exercise in 2012 for the first time in 28 years, signaling closer defense cooperation.",0
570,"1. The U.S. Constitution's Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to appoint officers during Senate recesses, with the appointee's commission expiring at the end of the next session.
2. The Recess Appointments Clause has been interpreted to apply to both inter- and intrasession recesses, with the shortest duration for an intrasession recess appointment being 10 days.
3. Recess appointees possess the same legal authority as confirmed appointees, but Congress has attempted to discourage recess appointments through legislation restricting salary and other benefits.
4. President Obama's appointments of Richard Cordray, Terrence Flynn, Sharon Block, and Richard Griffin Jr. during a three-day recess between pro forma sessions raised legal questions regarding the scope of the President's authority and potential statutory restrictions.
5. To challenge the appointments, plaintiffs must establish standing and address potential justiciability issues, including the political question doctrine.
6. The political question doctrine, which can prevent courts from resolving certain disputes, may apply to questions about the President's recess appointment power due to its political nature.
7. For a plaintiff to have standing, they must demonstrate an injury in fact, causation, and redressability, as well as satisfy prudential standing requirements.
8. Private plaintiffs, such as individuals or businesses impacted by the actions of the CFPB or NLRB, are more likely to have standing than congressional plaintiffs.
9. Congressional plaintiffs, however, may still challenge the appointments, but they face a more rigorous standing inquiry and must show a personal or institutional injury.
10. The Supreme Court has not held that the Recess Appointments Clause, by its very subject matter, precludes judicial review, and lower federal courts have considered challenges to presidential appointments made pursuant to the Clause.",0

573,"1. The U.S. federal government has three categories of wildfire protection programs: protecting federal lands, assisting state and local governments to protect non-federal lands, and supporting fire research, facilities, and forest health. The Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) manage wildfires on federal lands, while state and local governments are responsible for non-federal lands. Federal funding for wildfire protection has increased since 2000, with a record high of $4.46 billion in FY2008.
2. The FS, created in 1905, initially focused on halting wildfires in national forests. Aggressive fire control policies were developed, such as the 10-acre policy and the 10:00 a.m. policy, to keep wildfires small and control them during cooler hours. However, in the 1970s, these policies were questioned due to the ecological benefits of wildfires in some situations.
3. Concerns about fuel loads and catastrophic fires led to the establishment of the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters in 1994. The Clinton Administration then altered federal fire policy to give equal priority to private property and federal resources based on values at risk.
4. The National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act were enacted in response to severe fire seasons in 2000 and 2002, respectively. The FLAME Act of 2009 insulated other agency programs from high wildfire suppression costs.
5. Federal funding for wildfire protection is primarily allocated to the FS and DOI, with different activities included in their accounts. Preparedness, suppression operations, and other operations are the three fire appropriation accounts used by the agencies.
6. Wildfire management appropriations have risen over the past 15 years, with fluctuations due to the severity of fire seasons. The FY2012 appropriations law substantially reduced suppression appropriations but increased supplemental, contingency, and emergency funds.
7. FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Accounts were established in 2010 to allow both FS and DOI to pull from a reserve account to continue routine wildfire suppression and protection efforts if funds from other accounts are depleted. However,",0

2. Under current law, public employees who have a pension plan but are not covered by Social Security can hold a referendum to elect Social Security coverage.
3. Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all newly hired state and local government employees have been debated for many years.
4. Social Security coverage for state and local government employees is extended through ""Section 218 Agreements"" between a state and the Social Security Administration.
5. The Bipartisan Policy Center and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform have recommended mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees.
6. The Social Security Trust Funds are projected to have a long-range funding shortfall, and mandatory coverage of newly hired state and local government employees could help address this issue.
7. Opponents of mandatory coverage argue that it could result in reduced pension benefits for workers and higher payroll taxes and lower benefits for current workers.
8. Some observers argue that non-covered state and local government workers should contribute to the poverty reduction provided by the Social Security system.",1
575,"1. TAA is a federal program that provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to foreign competition, including funding for training and reemployment services, income support, and a tax credit for health insurance premiums.
2. The program was reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA) and is jointly administered by the federal government and the states.
3. TAA eligibility is limited to workers who can establish that foreign trade contributed importantly to their job loss, and the structure of the eligibility criteria may not cover workers affected by reductions in international trade.
4. Obtaining TAA benefits involves a two-stage process of group certification and individual application for state-administered benefits.
5. TAA training programs are decentralized and vary in duration and cost, with no federal limit on individual funding; DOL reported that 89% of workers who completed training in FY2015 earned an industry-recognized credential.

The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) was established in 2004, offering supplemental dental and vision benefits to federal employees, Members of Congress, annuitants, and dependents. Enrollees pay 100% of the premiums, and there are no preexisting condition exclusions, but waiting periods for orthodontia apply.
2. FEDVIP enrollment can be done through the Internet or by phone, and individuals can choose from various self-only, self +1, or family plans. Unlike FEHB plans, individuals enrolled in a FEDVIP dental plan pay different premiums depending on their location.
3. There are four nationwide dental plans and three vision plans available, with varying premiums and benefits. The dental plans cover Class A (Basic) to Class D (Orthodontic) services, while the vision plans offer both nationwide and overseas coverage.
4. Eligible individuals can enroll during the standard open season for FEHB plans or following a qualifying life event. New employees have 60 days to enroll, and individuals may change plans each year.
5. FEDVIP enrollees can use in-network services to reduce out-of-pocket costs, and the program allows for more stringent waiting periods for individuals who do not enroll at their first enrollment opportunity. However, no additional restrictions have been imposed for 2008.",1

The Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) Act, first enacted in 1999, mandates price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine, and allows USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales. The LMR authority was reauthorized until September 30, 2020, in the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015. The Act also amended swine reporting requirements and revised definitions in lamb reporting. USDA is required to conduct a study of the price-reporting program for cattle, swine, and lamb by March 1, 2018.
2. The LMR data are crucial for livestock producers, processors, and industry analysts to make marketing decisions. The cattle, swine, and lamb industries urged USDA to deem mandatory reporting an ""essential"" service to avoid the loss of livestock price information during a government shutdown. The House-passed version of the Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015 contained such a provision, but it was not included in the final bill. The enacted legislation established the new negotiated formula purchase reporting category for swine and amended swine LMR by requiring the reporting of the low and high range of net swine prices, and the number of barrows and gilts within the ranges. The act also requires that next-day reports include transaction prices that were concluded after the previous day's reporting deadlines.",0

A sitting United States Senator who is indicted for a felony or convicted of a crime that constitutes a felony does not automatically forfeit their office or rights and privileges under the Constitution, statutory law, or Senate Rules. However, they may temporarily step aside from leadership or chairmanship positions due to internal party rules.
2. Conviction of certain crimes may lead to internal legislative disciplinary proceedings, including resolutions of censure, and expulsion from the Senate upon approval of two-thirds of the Members. Expulsion does not result in the forfeiture of one's federal pension, but the Member's conviction of certain crimes may lead to such forfeiture of retirement annuities.
3. Indictment and/or conviction of a crime that is a felony does not constitutionally disqualify one from being a Member of Congress, unless a Member's conviction is for certain treasonous conduct committed after taking an oath of office. There are only three qualifications for congressional office: age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state when elected.
4. No specific Rule of the Senate exists concerning the status of a Senator who has been indicted with respect to chairmanships or ranking Member status on committees of the Senate. Political parties in the Senate may adopt internal conference and caucus rules that may affect a Senator's leadership and committee positions and assignments.
5. The Senate has significant discretion to discipline misconduct that the membership finds to be worthy of censure, reprimand, or expulsion from Congress. The conduct historically involved either disloyalty to the United States or the violation of a criminal law involving the abuse of one's official position.

The majority of the 766 million acres of forestlands in the United States are privately owned, with the federal government providing numerous programs to support forest management on both private and public forests. These programs are primarily administered by the Forest Service (FS) in the USDA and often assisted by state partner agencies. The report focuses on current forestry assistance programs funded and administered through the State and Private Forestry (SPF) branch of the FS.

* There are approximately 445 million acres of privately-owned forestlands in the US, making up 58% of the total forestlands.
* The federal government provides programs to support a variety of forest management and protection goals, including wildfire planning and response, and the development of new uses and markets for wood products.
* These programs are primarily administered by the Forest Service (FS) in the USDA and often with the assistance of state partner agencies.
* The report describes the purposes of the programs, types of activities funded, eligibility requirements, authorized program duration and funding level, and requested and enacted program appropriations.

2. Providing federal assistance for non-federal forest landowners has been a component of USDA's programs for over a century, with the creation of the USDA Division of Forestry in 1881. The FS has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. The Senate and House Agriculture Committees have jurisdiction over forestry in general, forestry assistance, and forestry research programs.

* The USDA Division of Forestry was created in 1881 to complement forestry research, which began in 1876.
* Forestry assistance and research programs grew slowly, and in 1901 the division was upgraded to the USDA Bureau of Forestry.

2. The physical terrain and ethnic tensions in Burma's border regions create difficulties for government control, making these areas similar to other ""ungoverned spaces"" around the world. The SPDC's efforts to coopt ethnic groups have resulted in widespread collusion between criminal organizations and junta military, police, and political officials.
3. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on Burma due to its role in transnational crime, including the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, which prohibits the indirect import of Burmese gems and imposes further sanctions on SPDC officials. The 111th Congress may continue to focus on oversight of U.S. policy toward Burma, including the country's criminal activity.
4. Transnational criminal networks, such as the United Wa State Army (UWSA), Shan State Army-South (SSA-S), Shan State Army-North (SSA-N), and Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DBKA), operate in Burma and have links to past or ongoing ethnic insurgencies. These groups have criminal networks stretching from India to Malaysia and up into China.
5. Corruption is rampant in Burma, with widespread collusion between criminal organizations and the bureaucracy, military, and business communities. Burma is ranked as the third-most corrupt country in the world, according to Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index.
6. The SPDC has been accused of involvement in trafficking-related corruption, with high-level officials and military officers benefitting financially from the earnings of transnational crime organizations. Reports suggest that Burmese military officials may be directly involved in opium poppy cultivation in Shan state, and that the SPDC allows and encourages traffickers to invest in domestic businesses, including infrastructure and transportation enterprises.",0
582,"1. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has significantly impacted federal mandatory spending, with most of the projected spending going towards expanding health insurance coverage.
2. The Internal Revenue Service reported that spending on premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions totaled $79.2 billion for the first three fiscal years of ACA exchanges operation.
3. In 2014, 27 states that implemented the Medicaid expansion spent a total of $36.7 billion on newly eligible adults, paid for entirely with federal funds.
4. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that gross spending on insurance coverage expansion under the ACA will total $1.938 trillion over the 10-year period FY2017 through FY2026.
5. The ACA includes numerous appropriations providing billions of dollars in mandatory funds to support new and existing grant programs and other activities.
6. The ACA also includes provisions requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to transfer amounts from the Medicare Part A and Part B trust funds for specified purposes.
7. The ACA's impact on discretionary spending is discussed in a separate Congressional Research Service report.
8. Discretionary spending under the ACA falls into two broad categories: specific grant and other programs pursuant to explicit authorizations of appropriations in the ACA, and costs incurred by federal agencies responsible for administering and enforcing the ACA's core provisions.
9. Table 2 in the report summarizes all the ACA provisions that include an appropriation of funds or a transfer of amounts from the Medicare trust funds.
10. The ACA appropriated significant amounts to support short-term health care programs for targeted groups prior to the health insurance exchanges becoming operational in 2014.",1
583,"1. The increasing number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and in the scientific workforce has been a concern in the scientific community.
2. The number of foreign students in these programs has outpaced the enrollment of U.S. citizens, and a significant number of faculty and industry positions are held by foreign nationals.
3. Critics argue that foreign students use U.S. graduate education as a stepping stone for immigration, with approximately 56% remaining in the U.S. after earning their degrees.
4. In 2007 and 2008, about 6 in 10 new permanent residents were admitted through adjustments of status, and 15.0% were employment-based preferences.
5. U.S. universities and industry rely on foreign talent, with foreign scientists and engineers serving in major roles, particularly at the doctorate and master's levels.
6. There are claims that U.S. workers are negatively affected by the entry of foreign scientists and engineers, who reportedly accept lower wages.
7. Between 2006 and 2016, employment in science and engineering fields is projected to grow at a faster rate than other professional groups.
8. The H-1B temporary admissions program has been a focus of debate, with the NSF reporting a nationwide shortage of scientists and engineers in the late 1980s, leading to the expansion of the skilled-labor preference system in the Immigration Act of 1990.
9. The scientific community is divided over imposing stricter immigration limits on people with scientific and technical skills, balancing workforce needs and job opportunities for U.S. scientific personnel.
10. Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, there was a slowdown in non-U.S. citizen enrollments in U.S. colleges and universities, but a 2009 report showed an 8.0% increase in foreign-born students for the 2008-2009 academic year.",0

2. Abe's new Cabinet, formed shortly after his victory, includes one woman, down from two in his previous Cabinet, and retains members in charge of foreign affairs and U.S. relations.
3. Abe's next electoral test will be in July 2019, when half the seats of Japan's Upper House will be chosen, with the LDP expected to maintain its majority due to the disarray of Japan's opposition parties.
4. The U.S.-Japan relationship has been strained by Trump's shift on North Korea and his statements critical of alliances, as well as by U.S. trade policy aimed at reducing bilateral trade deficits.
5. Japan, a close U.S. ally, has taken issue with the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962, which are based on an investigation into the potential threat to national security posed by the imports.
6. An ongoing Section 232 investigation on motor vehicles may pose a larger threat to the Japanese economy, as U.S. imports of Japanese autos and parts were nearly $56 billion in 2017.
7. In September 2018, the United States and Japan announced their intent to start new formal bilateral trade negotiations, with Japan likely seeking to avoid the possible increased U.S. motor vehicle tariffs.
8. Despite an ongoing territorial dispute in the East China Sea, Japan and China have sought stability in their bilateral relationship, with Abe scheduled to visit Beijing in late October 2018.",0
590,"1. The medical care provided to noncitizens in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized in congressional hearings and the press, leading to increased interest in detainee health care and the introduction of related legislation. The appropriate standard of health care for foreign nationals in immigration detention is a topic of debate. While standards exist, there are concerns about their implementation, as reported by the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center and the National Immigrant Justice Center. The U.S. government has admitted negligence in the death of a former ICE detainee, Francisco Castaneda.
2. ICE's National Detention Standards outline the medical care required for detainees, and the Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS), detailed from the U.S. Public Health Service to ICE, is responsible for detainee health care. However, detainees have reported issues with accessing medical care. As of October 2007, 65% of noncitizen detainees were held in state and local prisons, 19% in contract facilities, 14% in ICE-owned Service Processing Centers, and 2% in Bureau of Prisons facilities. ICE contracts with Creative Corrections, L.L.C., and the Nakamoto Group Inc. for detention facility inspections and quality assurance.
3. ICE's Detention Operations Manual outlines health services for detainees, including medical care, hunger strikes, suicide prevention, and terminal illness management. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Immigration Law Center have criticized ICE for lacking written guidelines on rating facility adherence to Detention Standards and for not including detainee interviews in annual reviews. ICE's semiannual reports on agency-wide adherence to National Detention Standards began in May 2008. The Detention Standards ensure timely and efficient health care for detainees, and facilities must provide initial medical screening, primary medical care, and emergency care. All detainees have access to sick call and must receive an initial health screening, health appraisal, physical examination, and mental health screening within specified timeframes.",0
591,"1. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a foreign aid initiative that aims to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in low and lower-middle income countries by providing funding to those that demonstrate a commitment to sound policies in three areas: ruling justly, investing in people, and pursuing sound economic policies. The MCA is a performance-based system, where countries are selected based on their past and current performance, and programs are evaluated on their measurable achievements. The MCA represents a significant shift in how the United States designs, implements, and monitors development assistance to low and lower-middle income nations.
2. The MCA was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and is managed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The MCC is a new entity, headed by a CEO who reports to a Board of Directors, which includes the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the U.S. Trade Representative, the USAID Administrator, and four others nominated by the President. The MCA has a budget of $5 billion, which is nearly twice the size of the FY2003 USAID ""core"" development aid budget. The MCA is intended to focus exclusively on development goals, without being influenced by other U.S. foreign policy and geo-strategic objectives. However, many issues, such as country eligibility, performance indicators, and organizational structure, have not yet been decided and remain under review by the Executive branch. Congress plays a key role in the approval of the initiative by way of considering authorization and funding legislation, and in confirming the head, or CEO, of the MCC. Congress will also maintain continuing oversight of the program as it is implemented and additional funding is sought in subsequent years.",0

2. Both bills would reshape the structure of farm commodity support, expand crop insurance coverage, consolidate conservation programs, revise the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and extend authority to appropriate funds for USDA discretionary programs through FY2017.
3. The Senate-passed bill, S. 3240, would reduce spending by $23.1 billion over 10 years compared to the current baseline, while the House Agriculture Committee-reported bill, H.R. 6083, would reduce it by $35.1 billion.
4. Both bills make significant changes to dairy policy, including elimination of the dairy product price support program and the Milk Income Loss Contract program, and replace them with a new program that makes payments to participating dairy producers when the national margin falls below $4.00 per hundredweight.",0
593,"1. Inland waterways are a significant component of the nation's marine transportation system, carrying approximately one-sixth of the national volume of intercity cargo.
2. The Inland Waterway System (IWS), managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, includes approximately 12,000 miles of fuel-taxed federal waterways and handles half of all inland waterway freight.
3. The Corps develops, operates, and maintains the infrastructure of these commercial waterways, with costs shared between the Corps and the commercial user industry.
4. The current revenue source, a set tax on fuel, is insufficient to cover nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures, resulting in federal taxpayers covering more than half of these costs.
5. Proposals for future financing include phasing out the fuel tax in favor of lock usage fees or increasing the existing fuel tax combined with an increased overall federal share for inland waterway costs.
6. Inland waterways remain an important transportation route for specific commodities, especially in regions that rely on movement of bulk goods over long distances.
7. Although previous estimates projected an increase in inland waterway traffic, actual traffic has remained flat over the last 20 years.
8. The Department of Transportation projects that overall freight tonnage will double over the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic projected to increase at a rate significantly less than that projected for rail and highway shipping.
9. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) was established in 1978 to hold revenues from a fuel tax on commercial barges and fund investments in construction, but annual appropriations were not authorized until 1986.",1
594,"1. Congress has used commemoratives to express gratitude, dramatize virtues, perpetuate remembrance, and name buildings, scholarships, and historic sites since its inception. Commemorative options are divided into legislative and nonlegislative actions.
2. Legislative options include naming federal buildings, creating postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding Congressional Gold Medals, authorizing monuments and memorials, establishing commemorative commissions, and requesting presidential proclamations. Nonlegislative options comprise sending certificates of recognition, making floor speeches, and sending flags flown over the Capitol Building to constituents.
3. Several initiatives since the 1960s have aimed to reduce the number of commemoratives proposed through legislation due to concerns about excessive legislative time spent on commemorative measures. These initiatives include creating an advisory commission and amending congressional rules on commemorative legislation introduction and consideration.
4. The Commission on National Observances and Holidays was proposed in 1966 to review national observance proposals and report to the President. Although passed by the House in the 89th and 90th Congresses, no further action was taken by the Senate.
5. The House adopted a new rule in the 104th Congress to reduce commemorative bills and resolutions, prohibiting the introduction and consideration of date-specific commemorative legislation and establishing commemorations. This rule remains in effect and applies to both the introduction and consideration of measures, including those received from the Senate.
6. The House Republican Conference adopted Rule 28 (6) in the 104th Congress, generally prohibiting the scheduling of any bill or resolution expressing appreciation, commending, celebrating, recognizing, or acknowledging a period of time for an entity, event, group, individual, institution, team, or government program.
7. Committee rules and protocols may reflect a general reluctance to schedule legislation with commemorative intent, although they are not enforceable by points of order on the House floor.

600,"1. Protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry have improved, enabling the identification of hundreds of proteins in a single LC-MS/MS analysis. However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present over wide concentration ranges. To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at either the protein or peptide level, and the final step involves analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS. Undersampling, where only a subset of peptides is identified, can occur if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer.

2. The reproducibility of proteomics has been a concern, but typically, the identifications of abundant proteins are reproducible, while most of the variability is observed in lower-abundance proteins. Strategies for achieving more comprehensive proteome coverage include repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses, prefractionating the proteome based on protein physical properties, improving separation of the peptide mixture at the HPLC separation step, modifying the ESI interface to enhance ionization, or adding an IMS (FAIMS) interface before the ion trap. Proteome coverage can also be improved at the data analysis stage by using high-mass-accuracy data or improved data-processing algorithms. Direct comparisons of alternative analysis strategies have been conducted to identify the best analysis approaches for specific types of samples, considering factors such as the amount of total protein required for the analysis and the total amount of mass spectrometry instrument time required by each method.",0

The study found that the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was significantly higher in patients who underwent tonsillectomy (5.05%) compared to those who underwent submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy (smuppp) (1.45%). The postoperative bleeding rate of the tonsillectomy group was similar to the rates mentioned in the literature (1.5%-18.0%, more commonly between 3.0% and 5.0%). However, the bleeding rate after smuppp (1.45%) was lower than the range encountered in the literature (0.6% to 14.0%).
2. The study suggests that suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in smuppp decreases the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Bipolar cauterization followed by tacking with 3 - 0 vicryl sutures may also have decreased the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence. The study recommends routine use of the suturing technique for smuppp in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.",0

2. The group has explored the synthesis of -lactams using aryl-, thioaryl-, and cyano-substituted anhydrides.
3. One-pot four-component reactions (4CRs) are possible with thioaryl substitution.
4. Computational studies suggest that cyanosuccinic anhydride reactions proceed by a Mannich-like mechanism via the enol tautomer.
5. Related reactions reported by Castagnoli, Cushman, and Haimova likely proceed by this mechanism.
6. The anhydrides used are poorly enolizable and require forcing conditions.
7. The group has explored Mannich-type reactions and related 4CRs of variously substituted anhydrides.
8. Aryl-substituted succinic anhydrides showed variation in reactivity, with higher reactivity when an electron-withdrawing group was directly attached.
9. The diastereoselectivity was reversed in the case of cyanosuccinic anhydrides and could be controlled by resident stereogenic centers.

603,"1. The morbidity of breast cancer is increasing, and early detection and analysis of molecular biology characteristics are crucial for treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as playing oncogene or anti-oncogene roles in breast cancer. Specifically, mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 function similarly to anti-oncogenes, while mir-21 and mir-10b act like oncogenes.
2. In a study of 35 breast cancer patients, the expression levels of mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 were lower in cancer tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues. Low expression of mir-125a was unrelated to tumor size, patient age, menstruation, negative ER, and PR expression. Mir-206 was highly expressed in patients with small tumors, negative ER, negative PR, and negative Her-2.
3. Mir-145 was negatively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis, and was correlated with negative ER, negative Her-2, and negative Top 2a. Mir-21 exhibited high expression in older, postmenopausal patients with various symptoms, such as lymph node metastasis and positive Her-2. The expression of mir-10b was related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and positive Top-2a.
4. Recent studies have shown that the expression of miRNAs is closely related to various types of human cancer, and they can effectively regulate and control hundreds of genes, including oncogenes and anti-oncogenes. Mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 have been identified as tumor suppressor genes and may be involved in the suppression of breast cancer invasion and metastasis.
5. Mir-10b expression may indicate the invasion and development of breast cancer, and mir-21 may be correlated with old patients with lymph node metastasis. Mir-21 and mir-125a are significant to developing new anti-Her-2 drugs and overcoming Herceptin resistance in drugs. Mir-145 and mir-206 are expected to be",0

Transplantation is limited by organ shortage and chronic allograft injury (CAI), which is caused by chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV), glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA). The pathogenesis of CAI is not well understood, but acute rejection episodes are a significant risk factor. A rat model of human CAI is the transplantation of kidneys from Fischer-344 (F344) to Lewis rats, and a severe but reversible acute rejection episode occurs 9 days after transplantation.

2. Acute rejection is characterized by a strong mononuclear infiltration of the allograft interstitium and an increase in intravascular leukocytes. After resolution of acute rejection, the number of intravascular leukocytes decreases but remains elevated compared to healthy kidneys. A majority of blood leukocytes in day 9 allografts are monocytes displaying a unique state of partial activation regarding cell surface antigen and cytokine expression. These cells interact with graft endothelial cells and might trigger CAV, which is characterized by intimal hyperplasia.

3. To identify factors contributing to the pathogenesis of CAI during reversible acute rejection, a gene array experiment was conducted to compare the transcriptome of mononuclear leukocytes isolated from renal allografts to isografts 9 days after transplantation. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) was found to be upregulated by mononuclear leukocytes accumulating in the lumina of allograft blood vessels. TG2 is a protein that catalyzes posttranscriptional modifications of proteins, resulting in cross-linking of proteins and modifications via amine incorporation into proteins and via deamidation.

4. TG2 is widely expressed and localizes to virtually all compartments of the cell, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. It can also be attached to the surface and secreted into the extracellular space, where it can cross-link itself to extracellular proteins. TG2 is involved in numerous cellular",0
605,"1. Endothelial cells were grown, stimulated, and supernatant was ultracentrifuged to obtain extracellular vesicles (EVs), which were then characterized and quantified using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy.
2. EVs were introduced into a model patient circuit, and the decline in EV levels due to dialysis was rapid, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes.
3. At the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis, the dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EV concentration.
4. These findings suggest that counter-current dialysis can remove EVs from a model patient's circulation, supporting the idea of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) as a therapeutic intervention in acute lung injury (ALI).
5. The experimental conditions achieved plasma EV levels similar to those seen in human clinical disease.
6. However, there are limitations to the model, including the potential for saturable filter EV-binding and the absence of convection and pressure gradient forces.
7. Emp sequestration within the CVVH filter or tubing is likely, and frequent changing of the filter may overcome this limitation.
8. More efficient and selective EV clearance can be achieved by conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to commercially available specialty CVVH filters.
9. Clinical data suggest that CVVH can have protective effects in ALI management, and future studies will examine the efficacy of dialysis in rodent models of EV-induced ALI.",1

2. Candida species are dentinophilic and can survive despite a lack of nutrients or resistance to intracanalicular treatment materials, leading to treatment failures.
3. In 20% of endodontic treatment failures, C. albicans is present, which may be due to coronal leakage after or contamination during the treatment.
4. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a commonly used root-end filling material with excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, and antimicrobial effects.
5. MTA Angelus has been reported to have good marginal adaptation, good sealing, sealing ability in mineralized tissues with complete closure, and is inflammation-free in most cases.
6. Both white and gray MTA Angelus have arsenic in their structures, but white MTA Angelus contains arsenic levels below the limit set by the ISO 9917-1 standard.
7. A limited number of studies have compared the antifungal effects of Proroot MTA and MTA Angelus, but such studies have been conducted using the agar diffusion test, which may not be appropriate.

2. Ipsilateral motor deficits emerge during the acute phase of stroke and persist chronically. The reasons for these deficits are unclear, but several mechanisms have been suggested, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere and dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract.
3. Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to detect ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination function on the ipsilateral side.
4. Recent studies have also found kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb during specific motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination.
5. These tasks include tracking tasks, goal-directed movements, and tapping tasks. Possible mechanisms for these deficits include disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, and the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.
6. Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have focused on motor deficits, rather than sensory deficits.
7. A recent study investigated the presence of both motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb of stroke patients using a tracking and reposition sense test.
8. The study found that stroke patients had lower accuracy in a tracking task and higher error scores in a joint reposition test compared to sex- and age-matched normal subjects. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between motor and sensory deficits, indicating that stroke patients have difficulty performing complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions.
9. These findings suggest that stroke patients may experience difficulty in task performance using the ipsilateral upper limb due to both motor and sensory deficits. Future studies are needed to determine more detailed mechanisms of other movement and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb of patients with unilateral brain injury.",0

2. A post-coupling methodology has been developed to introduce integrin-targeting peptide motifs onto liposome and nanoparticle surfaces, enabling integrin receptor-mediated cellular uptake of agents to cells.",1
610,"1. The Millennium Cohort Study is the largest prospective study conducted by the Department of Defense, aimed at collecting and evaluating data on various factors related to military service that may be associated with adverse health outcomes.
2. The study began in 2001 and included 77,047 participants from the first enrollment cycle. Approximately 71% of the participants responded to follow-up surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007.
3. The surveys included questions on self-reported provider-diagnosed medical conditions, mental health symptoms, physical and functional status, alcohol and tobacco use, occupational status, military exposures, sleep patterns, and demographic information.
4. The study was approved by the Naval Health Research Center Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all study participants.
5. The study found that participants who newly self-reported diabetes during follow-up were significantly more likely to have reported trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours, and sleep apnea at baseline.
6. Military service characteristics, such as no deployment, enlisted pay grade, administration/supply occupation, and having separated from the military since baseline, were significantly related to the outcome of new-onset diabetes.
7. Binge or problem drinking and current smoking were also significantly associated with new-onset diabetes after adjustment.
8. Screening positive for depression, panic, other anxiety disorder, and PTSD were all significantly associated with higher odds of new-onset diabetes in adjusted models.
9. Sleep characteristics, including reported trouble sleeping and sleep apnea, remained significantly and independently associated with higher diabetes odds, even after adjusting for other covariates.",0
611,"1. The study retrospectively reviewed the radiological and clinical findings of 13 patients with pathologically confirmed mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver, and classified each tumor into one of three types based on the extent of the cystic component on CT scans.
2. The study found that the tumor can present as a multiseptated cystic, mixed solid and cystic, or solid tumor, with the solid tumor type being rare and accounting for 31% of the cases.
3. The study also noted that in children with a solid mesenchymal hamartoma, radiological differential diagnosis should include various hepatic tumors such as hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, infantile hemangioendothelioma, hepatic adenoma, or focal nodular hyperplasia.",1
612,"1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects people of all ages, but its prevalence increases with age and is more common in women. The prevalence of RA in Northern Europe and North America is estimated to be 0.5-1%, while in Southern Europe, it is estimated to be lower, at 0.45-0.66%. The annual incidence of RA is also lower in Southern European countries. However, estimates of prevalence and incidence can vary due to factors such as the time period of the study, age distribution of the population, healthcare organization, and source of information.
2. RA is associated with a significant economic burden for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The cost of RA is affected by methods of calculation, reimbursement policies, availability of drugs and social services, and country-specific treatment guidelines. In Italy, the healthcare costs associated with age-related diseases like RA are expected to increase due to the aging population. The introduction of newer costly therapies may further contribute to the economic burden of RA in Italy.
3. A review of the literature on the economic impact of RA in Italy over the past two decades found that the costs of RA before and after the introduction of biological agents were not significantly different. However, the review predicted that the future costs of RA in Italy would increase, and would be higher than those in other European countries.
4. The review also identified several factors that contribute to the variation in costs of RA across European Union countries, including macroeconomic conditions and treatment guidelines. In Italy, the high proportion of elderly people is expected to contribute to the increasing costs of RA in the coming years. Therefore, accurate pharmacoeconomic analyses are needed to guide treatment decisions and ensure effective spending without compromising the quality of care delivered.",0
613,"1. Limited mouth opening, also known as microstomia, is a common occurrence in prosthodontic practice and can be caused by various factors such as surgical treatments, trauma, and certain medical conditions. This can make prosthetic treatment challenging, as a maximal oral opening smaller than the size of a complete denture can make it difficult to take impressions and insert prostheses.
2. The document describes the case of a patient with microstomia caused by oral submucous fibrosis, who was treated with sectional maxillary and mandibular final impression procedures and the fabrication of maxillary hinged and mandibular sectional and hinged complete dentures. The trays were sectioned and reconnected using press buttons, and hinge assemblies were incorporated into the dentures to allow them to collapse at the midline.

614,"1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly cancer, with a disproportionate impact on developing countries and males. Risk factors for HCC include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C, alcohol use, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The prognosis for HCC is poor, with a median overall survival of 58 months for metastatic or locally advanced disease. HCC is often resistant to chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes and p53 mutations.
2. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Met, play critical roles in the development and progression of HCC. HGF is secreted primarily by mesenchymal cells and is upregulated by inflammatory modulators. Circulating pro-HGF is converted into an active two-polypeptide chain heterodimer by extracellular proteases. HGF binding to c-Met induces autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues and activates downstream signaling pathways, promoting cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion.
3. Dysregulation of the HGF-c-Met pathway is implicated in HCC through multiple mechanisms, including aberrant paracrine or autocrine ligand production, overexpression of HGF and c-Met, and c-Met gene mutations leading to ligand-independent kinase activity. Overexpression of HGF and c-Met is observed in a significant portion of human HCC samples. The prognostic utility of c-Met and HGF overexpression is uncertain, with some studies showing no correlation and others demonstrating an inverse relationship with survival.
4. Crosstalk between c-Met and other receptor tyrosine kinase families, such as EGFR and VEGFR, is also implicated in promoting tumor survival. C-Met-c-Src has been shown to mediate EGFR phosphorylation and cell survival in the presence of EGFR inhibitors. C-Met is both an independent angiogenic factor and interacts with angiogenic survival signals promoted through VEGFR. Dual VEGF and c-Met",0

The long-acting insulin analogue, glargine, is one of the most commonly used agents in managing type 2 diabetes, and several studies have demonstrated its potential mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on cultured cancer cells.
2. However, the clinical implications of these findings remain controversial, and it is unclear whether glargine is associated with increased cancer risk compared with other commonly used forms of insulin. Some studies suggest an increased risk, while others do not, and the overall quality of the statistical analyses has been criticized. Further research is needed to define the risk and explore the relationship between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues and secretagogues, and cancer.",0

The most common site of metastasis is the lungs, but regional lymph node metastases are rare and not well-documented. This summary will discuss two cases of tibial adamantinoma with inguinal lymph node metastases.
2. Case 1 involves a 29-year-old female who presented with a swelling in her left inguinal area. Initially diagnosed as a cutaneous eccrine carcinoma, it was later reinterpreted as metastatic adamantinoma based on the patient's clinical history and histopathological examination. The specimen showed similar findings to the previous histology, confirming inguinal lymph nodal metastases from adamantinoma of the tibia.
3. Case 2 is a 58-year-old female who presented with a painful swelling on the mid-shaft of her left tibia. In 2008, she was diagnosed with fibrous dysplasia, but a 2009 histopathological examination revealed occasional clusters of plump epithelioid appearing cells amidst a fibrous spindle background, which were strongly positive to pankeratin antibodies on immunohistochemical examination. This suggested a reclassification to adamantinoma of the tibia.
4. A literature search revealed 10 cases of inguinal lymph node metastases from adamantinoma of the tibia reported in the English literature since 1930. The table summarizing these cases includes details such as reference number, year reported, author, sex, age at diagnosis, bone involved, location in bone, character and duration of symptoms, latent period, treatment, and outcome.
5. Adamantinoma of the tibia can be divided into two main groups based on their histology and biological behavior: classical adamantinoma and differentiated adamantinoma. Classical adamantinoma has a predominance of epithelial tumor cells and is associated with a destructive growth pattern on radiology, while differentiated adamantinoma has a predominance of an oste",0

2. ZnO NWS can be fabricated on silicon solar cells through a seeding and growth two-step process in zinc salt and amide mixed solutions, resulting in better antireflective properties compared to other oxide compounds.
3. The density and length of ZnO NWS can be optimized for the improvement of solar cell performances by controlling the time of growth, leading to a 3% relative improvement in the efficiency of Cz silicon solar cells.
4. The antireflection effect of ZnO NWS is due to the multiple scattering of incident light and their gradually and continuously changing refractive index profile.
5. However, long-time immersion of solar cells in aqueous solution during the ZnO NW growth process can deteriorate the solar cell performance.",1

2. The study compares two simplified methods for treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis through sympathetic chain transection at the third or fourth rib level (R3 or R4 sympathicotomy).
3. The study involved 133 patients with primary hyperhidrosis who underwent video-assisted thoracic sympathicotomy between 1999 and 2009.
4. The most common clinical manifestation was palmar and axillary sweating (39.9%).
5. Both R3 and R4 sympathicotomy resulted in similar success rates in treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis.
6. The incidence of moderate to severe compensatory sweating was higher in the R3 group (71.8%) compared to the R4 group (33%, p=0.02).
7. No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding age, sex, and positive family history.
8. No patients requested reoperation or expressed regret after surgery, and there were no life-threatening events or mortality.
9. The study suggests that R4 sympathicotomy decreases the extent of side effects without compromising efficacy, making it the method of choice for treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis.",1

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons, with neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. The clinical diagnosis of PD can be challenging, especially in mild or uncertain cases, and differentiating PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration is difficult.
2. Molecular imaging techniques using PET or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have been developed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and the sympathetic innervation of the heart are popular molecular imaging tools used in clinical practice.
3. Imaging of DAT binding with [I]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) successfully visualizes the presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract. DAT SPECT abnormalities can help support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with essential tremor, psychogenic parkinsonism, and vascular parkinsonism who have a normal nigrostriatal function.
4. However, DAT imaging as a stand-alone tool cannot differentiate between the various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy. Similarly, several studies have shown the utility of meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy in assessing the sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals in PD patients with a decreased cardiac MIBG uptake.
5. Because these molecular imaging tools are limited in terms of their test accuracy, the use of either DAT SPECT or MIBG scintigraphy alone is insufficient for distinguishing PD from non-PD. In this retrospective study, the authors compared the results of SPECT studies of striatal DAT receptors and myocardial MIBG scintigraphy with the clinical diagnoses in",0

This tick is known to infest a wide variety of vertebrates and has been reported to bite humans in Asian countries, including Korea, where it is distributed but human infestations are rare.

<summary>

* The tick is a female adult of the species Amblyomma testudinarium.
* It is a large, ornate, longirostrate tick that feeds on a variety of vertebrates.
* Human infestations of this tick are rare in Korea, where it is distributed.
* The tick was found on a 73-year-old Korean man who had visited a water reservoir in a rural county in Jeollanam-do province.

It can be caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with the major genes including MYH7, TNNT2, MYBPC3, and others.
2. TNNT2 mutations are responsible for approximately 15% of familial HCM and are associated with a severe form of the disease. Most TNNT2 mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle, and there has been an attempt to classify mutations as benign or malignant based on clinical outcome.
3. However, due to genetic diversity and variable phenotypic expression, genetic analysis and determination of genotype have not been predictive of poor prognosis. Late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance has been reported to be a predictive marker of ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in HCM.
4. In a study of 173 Japanese patients with familial HCM, three reported mutations and a new mutation of TNNT2 were identified in 11 individuals from four families. The genotype-phenotype correlation of this gene still remains insufficient in Japanese familial HCM.",1
622,"1. Schistosomatidae is a family of digenetic endoparasites with complex life cycles that alternate between intermediate (freshwater gastropods) and definitive hosts (birds, reptiles, fishes, and mammals). The schistosoma species can live in the human host for over 5 years. The schistosoma genus includes six species that infect humans and cause schistosomiasis, a chronic and debilitating disease. Control of schistosomiasis is based on drug treatment, snail control, improved sanitation, and health education.
2. The scientific community has made efforts to assess the schistosoma genomic information to strengthen traditional methods and provide new information to improve success towards schistosomiasis control. The genomes of S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni have been sequenced, and comparative genomics has revealed several conserved features among the three species. Mitochondrial genes have been used as molecular markers for species and strain identification, and the analysis of the whole mitochondrial genome of diverse taxa has changed the perspective of such studies.
3. Transcriptomic analyses are valuable for studies of differential regulation in gene expression and the identification of splicing variants. Transcriptomic studies have been essential in the identification of gene-coding regions during the process of genome annotation. Transcriptomic approaches have been used to investigate gene function studies and the diverse techniques employed. A fine tuning in gene expression of parasites must occur to enable them to survive in diverse environments, adapt to different hosts, and evade the immune system. Transcriptomic studies have allowed a temporal and quantitative analysis of gene expression, which are crucial to assess parasite biology at the molecular level.",0
623,"1. For patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sCLM), the optimal surgical strategy remains controversial. Simultaneous resection of primary and liver tumors is a favorable strategy due to less mental stress and simplified perioperative treatment. However, this approach has a higher morbidity rate due to greater surgical stress and longer operation time compared to single-organ surgery. Staged resection is considered an alternative strategy to avoid excessive surgical stress, but its efficacy and the patients who could benefit from this strategy are unknown.
2. A study was conducted to determine which patients could benefit from staged resections instead of simultaneous resection by identifying predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM. The study found that operation time greater than 8 hours was the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM. Extent of hepatectomy, timing of anastomosis and hepatectomy, and usage of pringle maneuver did not correlate with occurrence of complication or anastomotic leakage. The rates of complication IIIa and anastomotic leakage were more frequently observed in patients with rectal resection, but extent of hepatectomy did not seem to affect occurrence of complication IIIa or anastomotic leakage.",0

Inhalation is the most widely used approach for asthma treatment, allowing drugs to reach the lungs in a selective manner, increasing drug concentration in the airways, and reducing systemic adverse effects. However, only half of all asthma patients use the prescribed medication correctly.
2. Low treatment adherence is often due to patients not knowing how to use or having difficulty using inhaler devices correctly. Asthma education can remedy this, being a key component of asthma management. Incorrect inhaler use can lead to treatment failure and difficulty achieving clinical asthma control.
3. The frequency of incorrect use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) ranges from 14% to 90%, with an estimated mean of 50%. This incorrect use reduces lung drug deposition to less than 20%. In a study of patients using inhaled or oral corticosteroids, increased bronchodilator use, nebulizer use, and hospitalizations were observed in more than 50% of patients who did not adhere to treatment.
4. Instruments (or scoring systems) that assess the difficulties patients face in using inhaled drugs might be useful in reducing those difficulties. By using such instruments, health professionals can devise an educational program targeting the most common errors made by patients, thus improving treatment adherence.
5. There are scoring systems that assess inhaler technique in patients with lung disease, but no gold standard system exists. Such an instrument could play an important role in evaluating patients using inhalers. Leal developed a scoring system to assess the difficulties patients face in using MDIs, and Santos et al. developed scoring systems for the assessment of DPI and MDI technique.
6. The aforementioned instruments have yet to be validated for use, but they are used in a hospital to assess inhaler technique in patients with asthma and COPD. Instrument validation allows determination of the congruence between the scoring system used and the reality being measured, thus increasing the reliability of the instrument.
7. The present study aimed to validate two scores quantifying the ability of patients to use MDIs or DPIs, identify the most common errors made during their use,",0

They can inhibit the growth of closely related bacteria as well as bacteria from different genera. The antimicrobial sensitivity of a target strain to a bacteriocin can depend on environmental conditions such as salt concentration, pH, and the presence of membrane disrupting molecules.
2. Gram-positive bacteriocins have been classified into four classes, including class I or lantibiotics, class II, class III, and class IV. Class II bacteriocins are further divided into three subgroups: subclass iia, iib, and iic. Many enterococcus strains from various ecosystems have been characterized as antagonists of a broad range of foodborne pathogens, and the bacteriocins produced by enterococcal strains have displayed heterogeneous structures and differences in their mode of action.
3. The bacteriocin enterocin S37, produced by a strain of E. faecalis isolated from chicken feces, has shown antibacterial activity against strains belonging to Listeria and Campylobacter species. The antibacterial activity of enterocin S37 was assessed against a range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and it was found to be stable at different pH values and high temperatures. The purification and characterization of enterocin S37 revealed that it has a molecular weight between 4 and 6 kDa and appears to be a class II bacteriocin.",1

2. The CG model in Iran consists of seven interlocking components, including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information.
3. Systems awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication are considered the foundation of the CG model in Iran.
4. The implementation of CG in Iran has faced several barriers, including insufficient knowledge and attitude toward CG, lack of resources, inadequate information technology systems, resistance to change, necessity of cultural change, and professional boundaries.
5. Previous literature has identified several factors affecting the success of quality improvement activities, including raising awareness of CG among managers, supportive culture, and sufficient resources.
6. A qualitative research study was conducted to capture both facilitators and barriers in CG implementation from the viewpoint of curative deputies in Iranian medical universities.
7. The study found that most senior managers accepted that improving quality of healthcare should be integral to their role and essential to safeguard patient care.
8. Senior managers believed that quality improvement is a strategic goal to achieve central government targets and expressed a willingness to support and positive attitude towards CG.
9. The study identified several factors affecting CG implementation, including adequate knowledge about CG, positive attitude toward the necessity of the program, appropriate culture for improving quality, teamwork, readiness toward change, and adequate organizational commitment.

It is common in many parts of the world, particularly in regions with animal husbandry, and is prevalent in tropical regions such as Argentina, Peru, East Africa, Central Asia, China, and South America. In Iran, it is considered a hyper-endemic area due to the close relationship between society and animals, traditional animal husbandry, and contact with infection sources. The prevalence rate of hydatid cyst in the intermediate host has been reported as 11.5%-34.6%, and the prevalence rate of human hydatid cyst ranges from 1.1% to 13.7% in different parts of Iran.

2. In Khorasan Razavi province, during 2011-2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the epidemiological and clinical status of human hydatidosis. The study population included all cases diagnosed with hydatid cyst in governmental and private laboratories, hospitals, and health centers in the province. A checklist was used for data collection, including age, sex, nationality, place of residence, occupation, infected organ, the number of cysts, type of diagnosis, clinical symptoms, and risk factors such as washing vegetables and contact with dogs. The data analysis was performed using descriptive and analytical statistics, and the results showed that 357 hydatid cyst cases had been registered in the health centers during the study period. The most percentage of cases was related to the cities Mashhad (51.8%), Ghoochan (7.8), Neishabour (7.0%), and Fariman (4.8%).

CHFCs are thought to result from the evagination of the foregut during embryogenesis and are characterized by four layers: a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer with interspersed mucus cells, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule.
2. CHFCs are rare, with only 103 cases reported worldwide since 1857. The majority of cases have been reported in the last 25 years, and they are most commonly found in segment IV of the left lobe just beneath the hepatic capsule. CHFCs are typically asymptomatic and are found incidentally on imaging studies or at autopsy.
3. CHFCs are typically solitary and unilocular, and their imaging appearances are variable. Ultrasound findings may show anechoic or hypoechoic cysts with spotty hyperechoic areas, while CT findings may show a non-enhancing rounded lesion of varying density. Typical MRI features include a hyperintense cyst on T2-weighted images and a variable appearance on T1-weighted images.
4. Histologically, CHFCs are characterized by four layers: an outer fibrous rim, a layer of smooth muscle (often incomplete), subepithelial connective tissue, and a lining of ciliated, pseudo-stratified, mucin-secreting columnar epithelium. The differential diagnosis of a hepatic cyst includes simple cyst, hydatid cyst, biliary cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and bronchogenic cyst.
5. The recommended treatment of CHFCs has varied from observation to aspiration to surgical excision. However, given the recent cases of CHFC malignant transformation, serial imaging may be required for those patients undergoing cyst sclerosis. Most authors agree that CHFCs should be surgically excised for cysts larger than 4 cm to ",0

2. The formulation process involved the use of polymers, such as sodium starch glycolate and polyvinyl acetate, to create a flexible and easily dispersible strip.
3. The optimized formulation, f6, showed rapid disintegration and a high percentage of drug release within 30 minutes.
4. The surface morphology of the optimized formulation depicted a smooth surface with some little pores, indicating uniform distribution of drug particles.
5. The in vitro drug release profile of the orally dissolving strip formulations followed a diffusion-controlled drug release profile and is in agreement with the Higuchi model.

Recovery is complex and multidimensional, encompassing biological, psychological, and sociological elements.
2. Self-management practices have been suggested as key to promoting recovery and improving health outcomes for individuals with long-term conditions. These practices involve the active management of treatment, symptoms, lifestyle, and physical and psychological consequences.
3. Self-management interventions (SMIs) are designed to enable people to manage their health more effectively, and their evaluation should consider whether people develop the skills to manage their own health and if this results in better health. However, SMIs are complex and can be difficult to evaluate due to variation in delivery, culture of the sponsoring healthcare organization, and anticipated goals and outcomes.
4. The UK Medical Research Council advocates establishing the theoretical basis of an intervention as a first step in estimating its possible outcomes. Currently, evidence suggests that the mediators of change and theoretical premises in SMIs are unclear.
5. Self-management outcome measures should be evaluated using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which capture information that is not directly observable and unmediated by healthcare professionals. However, the accuracy of PROMs is contingent on their ability to reflect the variable in question.
6. A recent international Delphi study resulted in a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties, referred to as the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. This checklist has good inter-rater agreement and reliability and represents the first critical appraisal tool that is based on the consensus of experts in psychometric theory.
7. The COSMIN list addresses modern psychometric theory methodology, such as item response theory, as well as classical test theory. The properties examined in this systematic review are defined by COSMIN and consist of nine items: internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, content validity, structural validity, hypothesis testing, cross-cultural validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness.

The severity of OA can be influenced by various factors, including age, height, weight, and BMI. In physiotherapy, lowering pain, improving activities of daily living (ADL), and enhancing quality of life are the main goals for OA knee rehabilitation.
2. Physiotherapists use both self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to monitor OA knee rehabilitation progress. Self-reported questionnaires, such as WOMAC, SF-36, and KOOS, provide subjective information about the disease process without examiner bias, while performance-based tests, like the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT), objectively measure a patient's ability to perform ADL activities.
3. Performance-based tests are affected by motivation but not influenced by psychogenic factors, such as beliefs, expectations, cognitive impairments, and cultural, lingual, and educational levels. These tests measure functional limitations, while self-reported questionnaires reveal disability, which includes both social and psychological aspects of functional limitations. Functional limitations are often detected earlier by performance-based tests than self-reported questionnaires.
4. The present study aimed to correlate the subjectively measured KOOS questionnaire with the objectively measured 6-MWT, age, height, weight, and BMI in individuals with primary knee OA. The study used the ACR criteria for clinical diagnosis of idiopathic knee OA, and excluded patients with certain conditions, such as inflammatory arthritis, meniscus tears, and knee ligament ruptures.
5. The KOOS questionnaire consists of 42 questions covering five patient-related domains: pain, other disease-specific symptoms, ADL, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life. The 6-MWT involves walking back and forth along a 30-m track for six minutes, and its two-week test-retest reliability is reported to be 0.87 for patients with knee OA.
6. The study found weak to strong correlations between the KOOS subscales",0

2. Administration of a hyperlipidic diet for 8 weeks combined with short-term ovariectomy caused a decrease in all analyzed cytokines in mesenteric adipose tissue.
3. Ovariectomy in rats fed a hyperlipidic diet resulted in hyperleptinemia, increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content.
4. These changes, in combination with long-term ovariectomy, may contribute to the induction of proinflammatory processes, particularly those associated with a high-fat diet.",1
634,"1. Hemoptysis is a common symptom in respiratory diseases and can have a high mortality rate if massive. Quick treatment is necessary to stop bleeding, and bronchial artery embolization (BAE) has been found to be a safe and effective method.
2. This retrospective study analyzed 344 patients who underwent BAE due to hemoptysis, with 92.2% of them showing suggestive causes and 7.8% showing focal hemorrhage.
3. The study found that 30.5% of patients had blood lobe identified by chest CT scan, while 43.3% had unusual films in both lungs but no focal hemorrhage.
4. Angiography suggested that few direct signs were found, but indirect appearances such as tortuosity, hypertrophy, hypervascularity, aneurysms, extravasation, and bronchial artery to pulmonary artery or vein shunting supported a site of bleeding.
5. The main responsible arteries were right bronchial artery, left bronchial artery, and combined right and left bronchial trunk, with more right intercostal arteries involved than left.
6. BAE was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 96% of patients, but 17.7% had recurrent hemoptysis within 1 month after undergoing BAE.
7. Three patients died of massive hemoptysis in 1 month after undergoing embolization, and one patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died of hypercapnia in 3 days after undergoing embolization.
8. The study found that 21.5% of patients had recurrent hemoptysis over 1 month after undergoing BAE, with 17 patients developing recanalization of the previously embolized vessels and 27 patients developing new blood vessels responsible for hemorrhage.
9. The study concluded that BAE is an effective procedure with which to definitively treat some patients with hemoptysis and can be repeatedly utilized, especially in patients who are poor surgical candidates.",0

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and celiac disease (CD) can both cause lymphocytic gastritis (LG), a condition characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the stomach. However, the prevalence and contribution of these two conditions to LG are still controversial.
	* The study found that 45.5-18.5 IELs per 100 gastric epithelial cells were observed in CD and H. pylori gastritis patients, compared to 10.8-4.5 IELs in patients without LG.
	* The highest proportion of LG (50%) was found in CD patients without H. pylori infection, followed by patients with CD infected by H. pylori (20%).
	* H. pylori positive patients without CD had a lower prevalence of LG (8.3%) compared to previous studies.
2. The study also investigated the differential contribution of H. pylori infection to LG in an inflammatory condition like CD.
	* The study found that the prevalence of LG was similar in H. pylori positive children with and without CD.
	* LG was more common in H. pylori positive children without CD than in H. pylori negative children without CD.
	* The association between these pathologies and LG is not well established.
3. The study characterized the immunophenotype of the gastric mucosa of the two most prevalent etiologies of pediatric LG, CD and H. pylori infection.
	* The study found that CD8+ IELs were significantly higher in CD patients compared to controls or H. pylori infected patients without CD.
	* The low expression of CD57 in the lymphoid cells, both in the epithelium, in the LP as well as in the mucosal glands, indicate that NK cells may play a negligible role in these two pathologies.
	* The study also found that the highest number of lymphoid follicles was observed in a similar proportion of children with or without CD, who were H. pylori positive independent of the presence of L",0
636,"1. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is required for solid tumor growth and is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which binds to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.
2. Inhibition of angiogenesis through the use of several drugs could be an important tool in cancer treatment, as it targets normal processes controlled by normal cells and is not affected by the high mutation rates of cancer cells.
3. VEGF is a primary stimulant for tumor angiogenesis and is a critical target for cancer therapy, with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human VEGF, being approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2/neu-negative breast cancer.
4. In breast cancer, anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab, 2c3, or r84 inhibits the growth of established orthotopic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, reduces tumor microvessel density, and limits the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages.
5. Selective inhibition of VEGFR2 with an anti-VEGF antibody is sufficient for effective blockade of the protumorigenic activity of VEGF in breast cancer xenografts.
6. Inhibition of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 by 2c3 has been shown to reduce tumor size in both pancreatic and breast tumors.
7. The chronic treatment with r84, 2c3, or bevacizumab significantly reduces tumoral growth in an orthotopic human breast cancer xenograft model, demonstrating that inhibition of the VEGF factor is sufficient to reduce the mass volume of MDA-MB-231-derived tumors.
8. VEGF is a major chemoattractant for inflammatory cells, and inhibition of VEGF reduces angiogenesis and modulates immune cell infiltration of orthotopic breast cancer xenografts.
9. Combination of angioinhibitors with conventional chemotherapy has been used in many clinical trials, and preventive",0
637,"1. Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common medical condition in postmenopausal women, caused by the loss of estrogen stimulation on vaginal and vulvar tissue, and it is estimated that 32 million women in the US may suffer from its symptoms.
2. VVA is chronic, progressive, and will not resolve without treatment, potentially impacting women's quality of life and sexual relationships.
3. The REVIVE survey, conducted among a large cohort of postmenopausal women in the US, highlights the poor understanding of VVA and concerns about the efficacy, convenience, and safety of available treatments.
4. Many women are unaware that their vaginal symptoms can be caused by menopause or hormonal changes, and they may assume that VVA symptoms will abate over time.
5. Almost half of the study population had never discussed their VVA symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP), and the most common reasons for not mentioning symptoms to HCPs were assuming they were a natural part of aging or not bothersome enough.
6. Among women who discussed VVA symptoms with an HCP, about half felt neutral or negative about the information and recommended treatment options they received.
7. The most commonly reported VVA symptoms among postmenopausal women are vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and local irritation, with more than half of participants reporting that VVA had the greatest impact on enjoyment of sex.
8. The onset of individual VVA symptoms occurs at variable times, with irritation being the most likely symptom occurring premenopause, and dryness or tenderness more likely to begin during the first year after cessation of menstrual periods.
9. Effective patient education should emphasize that VVA is a common medical condition associated with reduced estrogen levels after menopause and that, unlike hot flushes, VVA will worsen over time if left untreated.",0

2. The study found that patients with PAD (group i) had higher concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol, and enhanced oxidative stress, as indicated by elevated MDA levels, compared to patients on simvastatin therapy (group ii).
3. Although no significant decrease in LOOH and MDA concentrations was observed in group i patients after surgery, a decrease in total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and thiol group concentrations was found 35 days and 710 days postoperatively.
4. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was higher in group ii before surgery and 710 days after surgery in group i, while all studied parameters in group i patients before surgery were significantly correlated with mean changes at 35 days and/or 710 days after surgery.
5. The increased MDA level in group i patients before surgery suggests high oxidative stress, which may contribute to PAD development through lipid peroxidation mechanisms.
6. Statin therapy, such as simvastatin, has been shown to relieve symptoms and improve function in patients with lower extremity PAD, and it reduces MDA concentrations compared to group i patients before surgery.",0
640,"1. The demand for herbal remedies in Nigeria has been increasing, with many households using them as common medicines, despite limited scientific data supporting their medicinal claims or safety assessments.
2. A herbal remedy called FIJK, made from a mixture of 13 medicinal plants, is widely consumed in Nigeria for treating various ailments, even though there is no scientific evidence supporting its medicinal benefits or toxicity.
3. A study was conducted to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to FIJK on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology. The results showed that FIJK caused significant reductions in rat plasma protein levels, elevated plasma triglyceride levels, depleted HDL-c levels, and increased LDL-c levels.
4. Additionally, FIJK significantly elevated rat plasma levels of ALT and AST, indicating possible liver damage, and reduced glutathione levels while increasing lipid peroxidation, suggesting oxidative stress.
5. The light microscopic examination of rat liver sections revealed lesions caused by FIJK herbal mixture, including hypochromic, hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, and hyperemia.
6. These findings suggest that the use of FIJK herbal mixture may have potential health risks, including liver damage and cardiovascular disorders, and highlight the need for scientific data on safety and toxicity profiles of herbal remedies to inform consumers' choices.",0

Preconceptional carrier screening can benefit prospective parents by making them aware of the genetic risks to their future offspring and the reproductive options available, such as prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, using donor sperm or oocytes, seeking adoption, or refraining from having children.
2. Carrier screening and carrier testing are two approaches to identifying carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders. Carrier screening is offered to persons who do not have an increased risk, while carrier testing is offered to those with a higher a priori risk based on personal or family history.
3. Carrier screening can be offered on an individual basis or as an organized screening program, either during or before pregnancy. The goal of preconceptional carrier screening is to strengthen reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making.
4. Internationally, preconceptional carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been studied extensively and has revealed positive attitudes towards CF carrier screening from healthcare providers, patients, their relatives, and the general public.
5. However, traditional healthcare systems have hesitated to implement carrier screening programs for the entire population of couples planning a pregnancy due to concerns such as the psychological impact, risk of stigmatization/discrimination, impairment of freedom of choice, medicalization, difficulty in reaching couples before conception, and provider-related barriers.
6. Recently, commercial companies have been offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers (DTC) through the internet, providing information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring.
7. The DTC offer of preconceptional carrier tests for autosomal recessive disorders raises various ethical issues, such as the informed consent procedure, medical supervision and follow-up, and the appropriate use of existing resources.
8. The current offer of preconceptional carrier tests through online providers varies, with some companies offering individual tests or panels of disorders, while others include carrier status for single-gene conditions in their full genome testing report. The DTC genetic tests providers do not distinguish between screening individuals with an a priori low population risk or testing individuals with a high a priori probability of having an affected child.",0
642,"1. The text discusses the growth in options for operative fracture treatment and the debate over removal of asymptomatic hardware. The debate is influenced by factors such as country-to-country and surgeon-to-surgeon variations, patients' demands, and theoretical long-term risks. The consensus dilemmas notwithstanding, removal of hardware is necessary in certain circumstances such as pain, infection, and implant failure.
2. The study conducted at a teaching hospital found that the most common indications for implant removal were pain/discomfort/prominent hardware, infected hardware, and implant failure. The most commonly removed implants were distal tibial/ankle plates, femoral iM nails, olecranon wires and plates, and tibial iM nails and patellar tbws. The study also found that the majority of patients that needed removal of implant were men (85.5%).
3. The text highlights the potential issues with implant removal, including the risks of fracture, neurovascular injury, and infection. The timing of implant removal in uncomplicated fracture healing is not well established, and further studies are needed. The study also found that the mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher (49.33 years) than those with pain (31.6 years) or implant failure (35 years).",1

2. Müller cells, the major type of glial cells in the retina, support and nourish retinal neurons, maintain ion homeostasis, and are involved in glutamate recycling and synaptic transmission.
3. Reactive Müller cells can worsen retinal damage in glaucoma by releasing cytokines such as TNF-, which contributes to neurodegeneration.
4. The study investigates the effects of -aminoadipic acid (AAA), a compound known to induce specific glial toxicity, on Müller cell gliosis in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
5. AAA treatment inhibited Müller cell gliosis and protected against retinal abnormalities in the AOH model.
6. AAA treatment rescued RGCs from apoptosis and significantly increased the number of thy-1-positive RGCs in the AOH model.
7. AAA treatment markedly reduced GFAP immunoreactivity, indicating attenuation in Müller cell gliosis.
8. AAA treatment attenuated TNF- protein production, promoting survival of RGCs in the AOH model.",1

2. A new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFR-L) has been developed to treat nonampullary SDNs.
3. The LAEFR-L procedure involves ligating the tumor using a ligation device, resecting it using snare technique, and retrieving the specimen intraluminally.
4. This procedure was performed on five patients, all of whom underwent complete resection without complications.
5. The mean operative time was 173 minutes, and the mean tumor size was 9 mm.
6. LAEFR-L has two advantages over conventional full-thickness resection (FTR) procedures: it avoids contact between the resected specimen and the peritoneum, and it does not require proficient experience in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
7. Tumor size and location are important factors to consider when determining the indication for LAEFR-L.
8. LAEFR-L may be a promising technique for treating nonampullary SDNs, but further prospective studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy and safety.",1

2. Lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases. High consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease, while poor SRH has been attributed to poor management of chronic disease and unhealthy dietary patterns.
3. Several studies have found an association between lifestyle behaviors and SRH. Regular physical activity has been significantly associated with SRH in various populations, and following dietary and physical activity recommendations has been associated with the prevention and lessening of the severity of cardiovascular diseases.
4. The present study is a secondary data analysis of the Living for Health Program, which collected information on health behaviors from adults in low-income minority communities in Miami-Dade County. The study found that modifiable lifestyle behaviors, such as low fruits and vegetables intake and high fat intake, were associated with poor/fair SRH in males and females. Poor SRH was also significantly associated with low physical activity in females only, and low physical activity was more common in women than men in this study sample. These results suggest that gender differences may have implications in designing and monitoring lifestyle interventions to prevent cardiovascular diseases.",0

Endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA) has become a popular alternative to open surgery for treating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children, with high success rates reported using the intraureteric injection technique. However, worldwide success rates vary, and up to 25% of patients may still have remaining VUR after Dx/HA injection.
2. Intraoperative positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography has been developed to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) after a negative standard voiding cystogram. PIC cystography has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystogram and can detect occult VUR.
3. A study comparing two different PIC techniques found that performing PIC cystography immediately after Dx/HA injection could not predict a successful surgical outcome. The study also found that a negative intraoperative cystogram correlates with the postoperative vcug in only 80%, indicating that the addition of intraoperative cystograms cannot replace postoperative studies.",1

The accuracy of ultrasound in detecting fetal pathology, including ventriculomegaly, depends on the sonographer's expertise and is affected by factors such as fetal head descent, skull bone ossification, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios. Fetal MRI has become increasingly important in diagnosing prenatal anomalies, particularly in the evaluation of central nervous system pathology, due to advances in technology and better knowledge of fetal pathology. In the context of ventriculomegaly, MRI can serve as an adjunct to ultrasound for more accurate diagnosis and characterization.
2. Ventriculomegaly can be classified based on the maximal diameter of the atrium of the lateral ventricles or the thickness of the overlying brain parenchyma. The causes of ventriculomegaly can be broadly divided into three categories: an imbalance in cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, abnormal cerebral development, and destructive disease processes. MRI is particularly valuable in detecting small intraventricular hemorrhages, corpus callosum dysgenesis, cortical anomalies, and fossa posterior malformations, which can be associated with ventriculomegaly. The interobserver agreement for both ultrasound and MRI can vary greatly, and the level of subspecialty training of the individuals interpreting the MRI examination significantly improves the interobserver agreement.",0

Lung cancer is a common and deadly form of cancer in the United States, with a high likelihood of diagnosis at an advanced stage and a strong correlation between stage at diagnosis and survival rate. Bone is a common site of metastasis for lung cancer patients, which can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain requiring surgery or radiotherapy. These SREs can significantly impact a patient's mobility and quality of life, adding to the overall burden of the disease. However, there is limited data on the occurrence and outcomes of bone metastasis and SREs in elderly lung cancer patients.
2. In this study, researchers analyzed a combined population-based cancer registry and Medicare claims database to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and SREs on mortality in older lung cancer patients. The study used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, which covers 14-26% of the US population from 9-13 geographic areas, and the Medicare program, which covers 97% of the US population aged 65 years. The SEER data included information on patient demographics, cancer diagnosis and stage, and treatments received, while the Medicare data included demographic information and claims data from hospitals and other healthcare providers.
3. The study identified a cohort of patients aged 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of lung cancer between July 1, 1999 and December 31, 2005, and used SEER and Medicare data to determine possible occurrence of bone metastasis, SREs, and deaths through December 31, 2006. The study required a baseline period of at least six months of full fee-for-service Medicare coverage before the lung cancer diagnosis date, and excluded patients who did not have both Medicare Part A and Part B coverage or who were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan during the baseline period.

The smear layer produced by post space preparation should be removed according to some authors for increased antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness. However, other authors insist on retaining the smear layer for better adaptation of materials to the root surface.
2. The study found that the photodynamic diode laser group had a higher bond strength than the other groups except for the 37% orthophosphoric acid group, without the removal of the smear layer. This may be due to the fact that collagen fibrils structure does not change after lasing, and the intrafibrillar mineral is conserved, making it more stable and less affected by dehydration, which improves the infiltration of the luting agent.
3. The study found that sodium hypochlorite increases the penetration of monomers into the dentinal tubules by removing organic components, but it breaks down to sodium chloride and oxygen, which inhibits interfacial polymerization of resin bonding materials. The study also found that 17% EDTA alone was not effective in removing smear remnants, and dual irrigation methods were not used for this study due to sporadic erosion and dissolution of the dentin. The push-out tests showed generally failures of bonding between resin and dentin, except for the diode laser group, which showed post-cement failure.",0

The Human Microbiome Project in the USA and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives that aim to characterize the microbial communities in various sites of the human body and look for correlations with diseases.
2. Collaborations have been initiated to identify a common core of bacterial species shared among humans, and studies have shown that the gut microbiota is mainly composed of two phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Archaea, particularly methanogenic methanobrevibacter smithii, have also been discovered in the human gut.
3. The composition of the bacterial flora seems to strongly depend on the environment and the maternal input during delivery and breastfeeding. Members of the same family have more similar bacterial communities, and this feature is host genotype independent.
4. Recent high-throughput studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities, and a common bacterial core shared by all or at least a majority of humans has been determined. However, each individual subject carries around 500,000 bacterially encoded genes, among which the majority are rare genes, shared by less than half of the group sampled.
5. The minimal gut microbiome and minimal gut metagenome are not mutually exclusive, and there are many genes that belong to both groups, being necessary for the survival of the bacterium as well as for gut function.
6. A higher degree of redundancy at the gene level suggests that the core microbiome should exhibit shared bacterial functions that need to operate to ensure survival and successful symbiosis in the gut.
7. The human gut flora has recently been classified as belonging to one of three different clusters termed enterotypes, and each enterotype has unique properties, notably that there is no geographical demarcation, and further, no correlation between presence of a given enterotype with sex, age, or body mass index.

3. Mycological cultures and potassium hydroxide stains confirmed the elimination of the infection in patients treated with tazarotene.
4. The study also found that tazarotene has fungistatic activity in vitro against several common fungal agents that cause onychomycosis.

2. Most attention has been focused on patient selection, but inadequate delivery of CRT therapy is also a concern, often due to the difficulty in reaching the optimal position in the coronary sinus tributaries.
3. The study examined the acute haemodynamic response (AHR) of the implanted system and alternative left ventricular endocardial pacing sites in patients not responding to CRT.
4. Twenty-four non-consecutive patients with heart failure class III or IV, despite at least 6 months of CRT and adequate medical therapy, underwent an acute haemodynamic study.
5. Five patients showed an increase in AHR with the implanted coronary sinus system after optimization, and in one of them, lv endocardial pacing was considered sufficient to justify the upgrade.
6. The study highlights the importance of considering endocardial pacing as an alternative for patients not responding to conventional CRT, but also emphasizes the limitations of using acute haemodynamic studies to predict clinical outcome.",0

3. She had been hospitalized and hemodialyzed for two months to maintain acceptable blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and potassium values.
4. Clinical parameters and preoperative investigations showed a heart rate of 102/min, systemic blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, hemoglobin of 10.2 gm%, and mild proteinuria with pus cells in urine.
5. Her biochemical profile revealed elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, and her coagulation profile was normal except for an increased bleeding time.
6. Arterial blood gas analysis showed normal pH, pCO2, and PO2 levels, and the anesthetic plan included pulse oximetry, cardioscope, noninvasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urine output measurement.
7. A peripheral line was used to preload the patient with normal saline, and spinal anesthesia was successfully administered using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl.
8. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters remained stable, and a live male child was delivered with an Apgar score of 9 at 5 minutes.
9. Postoperatively, the patient maintained normal hemodynamic and biochemical parameters and did not require additional hemodialysis.

The farm has a subtropical climate with an annual rainfall of 760-960 mm and a peak milk yield observed in the 4th parity for both normal and mastitis cows.
2. The lactation curve parameters for the fortnightly test-day milk yield (ftdmy) showed higher average initial milk yield (a) in normal cows compared to mastitis cows in different parities. The peak milk yield (b) was observed in the 4th parity (16.45 kg and 14.42 kg) while minimum yield was observed in the 1st parity (11.28 kg vs 10.35 kg/d) for both normal and mastitis cows.
3. The descending slope parameter (c) was lower in the 1st parity (0.041) and higher in the 4th parity (0.072) in normal cows, but in mastitis cows, it was minimum in the 1st parity (0.043) and maximum in the 5th and above parity (0.070). Higher persistency of lactation was observed in the 1st parity (54.34 and 51.40) which declined till the 5th and above parity in all cows.

A study was conducted to monitor the lifespan, weight, and food consumption of male b6c3f1 mice that were fed diets supplemented with different concentrations of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). The mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups at 12 months of age and were fed daily with 13.3 kcal/day/mouse of control diet supplemented with NDGA at concentrations of 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, or 4.5 g/kg diet. The results showed that the median lifespan was extended by 12% in mice fed with 3.5g/kg diet (~13.5mg/mouse/day). However, there was no effect on maximum lifespan. The study also found that NDGA decreased the size of liver tumors by 24% but increased hepatic tumorigenesis.
2. The study also investigated the effects of NDGA on drosophila and found that optimum oral treatment with NDGA at 3.0mg/ml medium increased the median lifespan of the flies by approximately 23%. However, there was no effect on food consumption, body weight, or locomotor activity in ndga-treated flies. The results suggest that at least some of the target(s) of NDGA action are phylogenetically conserved between mice and flies.
3. The study found that ndga consumption, even at doses below its therapeutic dose, was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis in mice. The drug also increased the lifespan of drosophila, suggesting its target(s) and mechanism(s) of action may be phylogenetically conserved. However, aspects of the response in flies were unlike those in mice, as ndga did not appear to affect energy uptake or utilization in flies.
4. The study also found that 3.5g/kg diet (373 mg ndga/kg bw/d) extended lifespan in mice, but higher and lower dosages were ineffective. The NIH-ITP found that ndga extended male mouse lifespan at 2.5 g ndga/kg diet, but",0

Genetic variation plays a crucial role in disease susceptibility and treatment response, with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enabling the discovery of genetic variants contributing to complex genetic diseases and pharmacogenetic markers (Manolio, 2010; Link et al.). Personalized medicine, which involves the identification of the optimal drug and dosage for a subgroup of patients, is the primary goal of these advances in genetic epidemiology. However, current personalized medicine applications are broader, including situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.
2. Biomarkers, or any substance, structure, or process that can be measured in a biospecimen and is associated with health-related outcomes, are essential to personalized medicine (Gallo et al., 2011). The Biomarkers Definitions Working Group (2001) defines a biomarker as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers can be categorized as diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, monitoring, safety, surrogate, target, or toxicity biomarkers, each with a specific role in personalized medicine.
3. Distinct from DNA biomarkers, DNA tumor biomarkers are specific to cancerous tumors and measure the presence or absence of a mutation in a gene. General biomarkers, such as RNA, protein, or metabolite measurements, can be measured in biofluid, tissue, or cell lines. DNA biomarkers are discrete in nature, while general biomarkers are continuous, and both DNA biomarkers and DNA tumor biomarkers require thresholds to relate biomarker measurements to clinical decision-making.
4. DNA biomarkers are stable, reproducible, and can be measured at any point in time, making them suitable for prospective and retrospective studies. DNA biomarkers can be prospectively validated in biobanks, where clinical information has already been collected. However, DNA biomarkers cannot be used for therapy monitoring, pharmacodynamics, or as surrogate markers due to their stability. The durability of DNA biomarkers",0

2. MyoVA is composed of a pair of motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain.
3. MyoVA's movement is driven by ATP hydrolysis and amplified by the lever arms, which take 72 nm steps.
4. Calcium is required for MyoVA's ATPase activity, but high calcium concentrations reduce processivity and can cause calmodulin to dissociate from the lever arms.
5. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVA motors and their subdomains.
6. The study found that the lever arms of MyoVA have a flexural stiffness of 0.0346 pN/nm and a persistence length of 242 nm.
7. The addition of calcium reduces the lever arm flexural stiffness of MyoVA by 40%, which is likely to negatively impact the motor's interhead communication and gating.
8. The distal rod domain of MyoVA has a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm, but its persistence length cannot be accurately calculated due to uncertainty in its length and structure.
9. The study suggests that the lever arm/rod junction of MyoVA must be highly compliant to allow the motor to maneuver through actin-actin intersections and switch tracks on actin bundles.",1
659,"1. A study was conducted to determine if clinical outcomes after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
2. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 genes were genotyped in a cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
3. In multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients carrying the wild-type t/t genotype.
4. Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type g/g genotype.
5. These findings suggest that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC.
6. Despite attempts to improve the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer, prognosis remains poor, with a 5-year overall survival of 20-30%.
7. Well-known prognostic factors for esophageal cancer are summarized in tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging, but they do not seem to completely reflect the biologic diversity of esophageal cancer.
8. The true drivers of this clinical-biologic diversity include the molecular aberrations of the cancer and the genetic make-up of the patient.
9. The study of host genetic variability offers worthwhile potential to identify individuals that may have the best chance of survival.",0
660,"1. The oral cavity can be colonized by Candida albicans or other Candida species in 40-60% of healthy individuals. In immune-compromised patients, Candida species can cause various diseases ranging from localized mild oral lesions to disseminated candidiasis.
2. The development of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is associated with several factors, including malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, dental malocclusion, and immunosuppression. The diagnosis and treatment of oral lesions caused by Candida species are crucial in HIV-positive patients who continue to suffer from significant Candida-associated morbidity.
3. OPC is the most frequent opportunistic fungal infection among HIV-positive patients, and it is estimated that more than 90% of HIV-positive patients develop this infection at some point during the progression of their disease. OPC is an opportunistic infection of soft buccal mucosa and can appear as erythematous patches or white, scrapable lesions.
4. OPC is often one of the first clinical signs of HIV infection and is observed with a higher prevalence in patients with CD4+ counts below 200/mm or a high viral load (> 10,000 copies/ml). C. albicans is generally managed by judicious use of fluconazole, but a rise in resistant organisms may be due to prolonged or frequent treatment with azoles.
5. An epidemiologic shift of Candida species could significantly impact the utility of fluconazole as empiric treatment for candidiasis in patients with HIV/AIDS. The present study aimed to evaluate the forms of OPC and their correlation with CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients.
6. The study was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study conducted over a 2-year period. Patient records were initially studied, and patients were asked to visit the clinic for further evaluation. A complete medical history and physical examination of the oral cavity, head, and neck area were performed on each patient.
7. The variables studied included medical history, physical examination, socio-demographic characteristics, socio-behavioral factors, experience with oral lesions, and laboratory tests. Patients were prescribed essential medication and repeated examination and",0
661,"1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and it primarily spreads through the lymphatic system. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients. The combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is commonly used, but its accessibility is limited due to regulations and availability.

2. A magnetic tracer and handheld magnetometer were evaluated as a radiation-free alternative in two clinical trials. The magnetic technique was found to be noninferior to the combined technique in identifying SLNs, but there was a discordance in SLNs identified between the two methods. The particle size of the magnetic tracer used in the magnetic technique is larger than the radioisotope used in the combined technique, which could potentially lead to false-negative staging. Therefore, evaluating the performance of different-sized SPION-based formulations within an in vivo porcine model was conducted to optimize the clinical application of the magnetic technique for SLNB.",0

2. The serum adiponectin level was significantly higher in patients with RI than in those without RI, regardless of the presence or absence of T2DM.
3. Spearman's analysis showed that serum vaspin levels were related to different parameters in patients with and without T2DM, while serum adiponectin levels were related to age, blood pressure, renal function, and cholesterol levels in both groups.
4. Multiple regression analyses found that HbA1c levels were independently associated with vaspin concentration, while renal function was associated with adiponectin concentration in all subjects.",1
663,"1. Two multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trials were conducted to test surrogate variables for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and explore the correlation between granulation tissue development and complete healing.
2. The trials involved patients with Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs larger than 1 cm, who received intralesional injections of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (RHEGF) or a placebo, in addition to standard care.
3. Surrogate markers of complete healing were generated, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT).
4. The EOT data were used as the comparison points for the 4-week area change, and ulcer areas and percent granulation were measured using a validated portable wound measurement device.
5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals.
6. Cutoff points were generated to maximize both sensitivity and specificity, and the candidate surrogates were then codified and assessed for their association with the final outcome (complete ulcer closure).
7. The product coefficient (PC) was used to quantify the contribution of the surrogate on ulcer closure, and binary logistic regression was performed to estimate the association between some baseline influencing factors and healing.
8. The results showed that granulation tissue development at the EOT was an early predictor of final healing, with a 72.9% certainty and positive/negative predictive values of 71.7/75.8%, respectively.
9. The validation tests using multivariate analyses were developed with the data of the randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of intralesional RHEGF in advanced DFUs.
10. The study suggests that granulation tissue development can be taken into consideration as a surrogate of complete wound closure, particularly in larger and advanced ulcers, and that the proportion mediated for granulation variables was very high.",0

2. However, the reduction in postoperative wound pain did not significantly improve the incidence of chronic groin pain, which still occurred in 2% of the ntapp group and 2.8% in the stapp group.
3. The ntapp procedure also had a shorter total time until return to work compared to the stapp group, but patient-related outcomes such as pain, cosmetic satisfaction, and length of disability are motivation-dependent and subjective measurements.",1
665,"1. Mouth breathing in childhood can lead to pathological adaptations of the stomatognathic system, affecting facial growth and causing dental occlusion alterations, higher mandibular inclination, and a vertical facial growth pattern.
2. These adaptations can also result in functional changes in the stomatognathic system, observed through alterations in speech, chewing, and deglutition.
3. The main causes of mouth breathing in childhood include hypertrophy of the pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsil, nasal mucosa and turbinate edema, nasal septal deviation, extended suction habits, and others.
4. An accurate diagnosis of the cause of mouth breathing is essential for effective treatment, with different types of care used in phonoaudiology based on the etiology of the altered respiratory mode.
5. Most causes of mouth breathing are diagnosed through a standard otorhinolaryngologic exam, except for the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, which requires complementary exams.
6. Nasopharyngoscopy is considered the most reliable exam for diagnosing nasopharyngeal obstruction due to hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, as it allows for the visualization of the pharyngeal tonsil and its relation to other nasopharyngeal structures.
7. Cephalometry is a noninvasive exam that provides data related to craniofacial growth and the myofunctional status of these structures, and is often more accepted by children due to its lower cost and greater availability relative to nasopharyngoscopy.
8. A study was conducted to verify the correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, with the study sample consisting of children from 3 public schools who were evaluated from September 2008 through December 2009.
9. After employing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 55 children, including 25 males and 30 females, with an average age of 9.8 years, were selected and underwent otorhinolaryngologic assessment, as well as nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry.

2. To differentiate TR and NPT, the location of the new tumor, staging, and histological subtype should be studied through imaging, biopsy, immunohistochemical studies, and determination of Her-2 and hormone receptor expression.
3. A case of a 35-year-old premenopausal woman with a family history of breast cancer is presented, who was diagnosed with moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma and received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy.
4. Four years after surgery, the patient noticed periareolar thickening in the same breast with redness and heat, and was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), which is a rare and very aggressive form of locally advanced breast carcinomas.
5. IBC represents 0.55% of primary invasive breast tumors and is more common in Caucasian women under 60 years, requiring a differential diagnosis with locally advanced noninflammatory breast carcinomas and non-neoplastic diseases.
6. After breast-conserving treatment, IBTR may represent two distinct types of lesions, TR or NPT, which have different natural histories, prognosis, and implications for therapeutic management.
7. A retrospective study concluded that women with ER-positive first tumors have a decreased risk of second breast cancer occurrence, whereas patients with ER-negative primary tumors have an increased risk limited to ER-negative second tumors.
8. The risk of second ER-negative breast cancer is really high after a first ER-negative tumor, particularly in women with strong family history, and the risk of developing a second breast cancer among women diagnosed with a first breast cancer depends on ER status, period of diagnosis, and family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer.

2. Upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in the development and progression of AMD. The management of neovascular AMD has been transformed with the development of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, which is significantly more effective in preventing progressive vision loss and improving visual acuity (VA) than previous alternative treatment modalities.
3. Current management of neovascular AMD involves the use of continuing anti-VEGF treatment to control signs of exudation by blocking the growth of abnormal blood vessels to prevent vision loss and potentially improve VA. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents ranibizumab and aflibercept are Health Canada-approved options for the treatment of neovascular AMD.
4. Large multicenter clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of monthly ranibizumab and intravitreal aflibercept injection every 8 weeks in preventing vision loss and improving VA in patients with neovascular AMD. Aflibercept binds to VEGF with a higher affinity and has a longer duration of action than ranibizumab, allowing for less frequent dosing.
5. Contrast sensitivity (CS) measures an individual's ability to detect low contrast images and to perceive differences between light and dark, whereas the Snellen VA chart test measures the level at which an individual can identify fine detail at high contrast using black-on-white letters. CS could be considered as an adjunct to standard acuity testing to better assess visual capability and as a useful measure for evaluating a wide range of ocular conditions.
6. The snellen VA test may not be an adequate or appropriate measure in all cases of vision loss, as various types of vision loss are not caused by spherical blur. CS is a sensitive and arguably essential outcome end point for a complete assessment of visual function and visual performance, including driving, mobility, reading speed, and general vision-related quality of life.

It is most commonly found in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40. The exact cause of MS is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors, such as viruses, are believed to be involved in its pathogenesis.
2. In this case-control study, the association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS was evaluated in an Iranian population. Blood samples were collected from 74 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 75 healthy controls. The results showed no significant difference in the frequency distribution of genotypes between patients with MS and the controls.
3. The logistic regression model also found no significant association between the c424c/a polymorphism and MS development. The distribution of a and c alleles was also not statistically different between the two groups.
4. The study also found no significant difference in the frequency of the a allele compared to the c allele in patients with MS. The results suggest that the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene is not associated with MS in the Iranian population.
5. Previous studies have suggested that IL-25, as a Th2 cytokine, can participate in the regulation of immune responses during inflammatory diseases including MS. However, the study found that the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene is not associated with MS or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Instead, other polymorphisms within the IL-25 gene may regulate IL-25 expression in MS and IBD.",0

The study found that a significant proportion of elderly Korean male hypertensive patients had thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), with TAA being more prevalent than AAA. The prevalence of TAA was 64.6% in patients with AAA and 40.0% in patients without AAA. The study also found that patients with AAA had a higher occurrence of TAA compared with those without AAA.
2. The study identified several risk factors associated with TAA and AAA. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, TAA was independently associated with age, absence of dyslipidemia, larger body surface area, higher diastolic blood pressure, and presence of AAA. AAA was independently associated with presence of dyslipidemia, current or past smoking, and presence of TAA.
3. The study found that race may influence AAA prevalence, with asians generally having a low prevalence of AAA. The study also reported a low prevalence of AAA in an asian population and reinforced the impact of smoking on AAA. The study highlighted the need to clearly define the usefulness of routine screening for AAA among asian non-smokers. The primary limitation of the study is that a CT scan with axial images could not properly evaluate the very proximal portion of the ascending aorta including the aortic root. The study was performed in a population of elderly asian males with hypertension at high risk for cardiovascular disease, and the results cannot be applied to females, other ethnicities, or groups with a low risk of cardiovascular disease.",0
670,"1. Endometrial cancer has become the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries, surpassing cervical cancer. Early screening methods for cervical cancer have made significant progress, and a similar effective approach to screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor is needed.
2. Endometrial complex hyperplasia with atypia and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) are considered precursors of type I endometrioid adenocarcinoma, while endometrial glandular dysplasia leads to type II carcinoma. These precursor lesions take a certain period to develop into cancer.
3. Traditionally, endometrial samples for histologic analysis are obtained through D&C or hysteroscopy, which are reliable methods for evaluating endometrial conditions. However, the adequacy of specimens obtained using the SAP-1 device compared to D&C or hysteroscopic biopsy is still unknown.
4. A study was conducted to investigate whether liquid-based SurePath preparation for endometrial cytology tests (ECT) can maintain the three-dimensional structure of the endometrium. The study found that histology is the gold standard for evaluating the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value (NPV) of ECT.
5. The study included patients with risk factors for endometrial carcinoma and used the SAP-1 sampling device, which is a flexible latex loop with spines and an outer protective sheath. The device is easy to operate and can be used in outpatient settings, health examination centers, and community hospitals.
6. The results showed that the SAP-1 device provided more sufficient materials for cytology than D&C or hysteroscopic biopsy for histology (p < 0.01). The device was also found to be easier to collect cytology specimens than histology specimens (p < 0.05). The accuracy of cytology for detecting endometrial precursor and carcinoma was estimated at 91.7%, sensitivity at 73.6%, specificity at 94.9%, PPV at 71.9%, and NPV at 95.3",0
671,"1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with the highest incidence rates in Europe and North America. Mammography is the most commonly performed procedure for breast cancer detection, with digital mammography (DM) being more commonly used in the US due to its benefits over screen-film mammography.
2. DM has a slightly higher sensitivity than screen-film mammography and is less likely to be lost or damaged. However, both DM and screen-film mammography have limitations, such as false positives and the potential for tumors to be obscured by overlapping tissue.
3. Tomosynthesis, also known as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), is a 3-D procedure that may help solve the problem of overlapping tissue in mammography. Newer prospective population-screening trials have provided more definitive results on the use of tomosynthesis.
4. The radiation exposure associated with tomosynthesis has been a concern, but newer developments are addressing this challenge. Tomosynthesis can be used for both screening and diagnostic mammography and has been shown to increase mammogram accuracy.
5. The addition of tomosynthesis to standard mammography has been shown to increase mammogram accuracy, with a 40% higher invasive cancer-detection rate compared to DM screening alone in one study.
6. Tomosynthesis can more clearly depict benign findings than routine screening views, potentially reducing the need for recall for additional imaging and decreasing false-positive biopsies.
7. The radiation dose for the combined examination of conventional mammography and tomosynthesis is slightly more than twice the dose of mammography alone, but synthetically reconstructed 2-D images can be made from the tomosynthesis data, eliminating the need for double exposures and reducing the radiation dose.",0

2. Diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, is classified as an antitussive by the FDA and has been shown to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in healthy volunteers and those with chronic cough.
3. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a diphenhydramine-containing multicomponent syrup, compared to a dextromethorphan-containing syrup and placebo, on cough reflex sensitivity in otherwise healthy subjects with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI).
4. Twenty-two subjects were recruited and completed the study, and cough reflex sensitivity was significantly inhibited after diphenhydramine (p < 0.01), but not after dextromethorphan.
5. The diphenhydramine-containing formulation proved to be a more effective antitussive than dextromethorphan, but the timing of the cough challenge may not have allowed for the maximal antitussive effect of dextromethorphan.
6. The study's findings suggest that diphenhydramine can suppress cough reflex sensitivity in subjects with acute URI, and further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of OTC cough and cold products.",0
673,"1. The global population is aging, and this trend is expected to continue, with aging being a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to decreased ability to resist cellular stress.
2. The endothelium, which forms a monolayer lining blood vessels, plays a crucial role in vascular function, but its function is compromised during aging due to increased oxidative stress and inflammation.
3. Oxidative stress reduces nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, a potent vasodilator, and increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to endothelial dysfunction.
4. Exercise has been shown to improve endothelial function by boosting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, increasing NO availability, and reducing ROS production.
5. Aging is associated with a decline in endothelial function, which can be prevented or restored through exercise training, possibly by restoring NO availability and alleviating inflammatory processes.",1
674,"1. The number of metastatic lymph nodes in breast carcinoma patients is associated with the number of removed lymph nodes and affects prognosis. The lymph node ratio (LNR) has been found to provide more useful prognostic information compared to nodal disease classification based on the number of metastatic lymph nodes.
2. Previous studies have determined different threshold values for LNR to separate patients into two prognostic groups with significantly different survival rates. However, these studies have mostly been conducted in all lymph node-positive patients without subdivision in n1, n2, and n3 disease groups.
3. A study found that patients with n2 and n3 disease receiving adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support had a higher LNR threshold value of prognostic significance (0.80 and 0.70, respectively) compared to those including n1 disease (0.20 and 0.25).
4. The study proposed that identifying a separate LNR threshold value for each n disease group may be useful. Fortin et al. recommended axillary radiotherapy for patients with a LNR of 0.40 or above in the group with 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes and for patients with a LNR of 0.50 or above in the group with 4 or more metastatic lymph nodes among t1-t2 node-positive patients.
5. The study evaluated the prognostic significance of the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR in breast carcinoma patients with 1-3 axillary metastatic lymph nodes. The study found that axillary recurrence was significantly higher in patients who had 15 lymph nodes removed (9.4%) compared to those with 6 or more nodes removed (0.9%).
6. The study identified different threshold values for the most significant LNR for disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). The study suggests that determining a different threshold value for each type of disease recurrence may be useful in planning a more appropriate adjuvant therapy.

676,"1. Biological invasions by non-native species have caused significant harm to ecosystems for centuries, such as the Phylloxera destroying grapevines in Europe and chestnut blight in North America.
2. Although Charles Elton's book on invasions in the 1950s raised awareness, it wasn't until the 1980s that a global research thrust on invasions occurred, led by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE).
3. This surge of research revealed that non-native invaders impact ecosystems at various levels, affecting nutrient cycles, hydrology, and fire cycles, as well as causing genetic hybridization and introgression with native species.
4. Molecular genetic techniques have shown that hybridization between native and introduced species can lead to the creation of new, more invasive species, and can cause substantial evolution in native species.
5. Genetic features such as microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are used to trace sources and routes of invasions, and to detect invaders through environmental DNA (eDNA).
6. Introduced populations often combine genes from multiple source populations, resulting in novel genetic combinations and greater genetic variation than any single source population.
7. The ""invasional meltdown"" phenomenon occurs when two or more introduced species facilitate each other's establishment or enhance each other's impact on native species.
8. Lag effects have been detected, where the widespread establishment and impact of an introduced species lag for years behind initial arrival, due to various reasons and limited resources.
9. Critics argue that the problems caused by invasions are overblown, that introduced species can increase native biodiversity, and that the antipathy towards introduced species is xenophobic.
10. However, the majority of introduced species have not been studied, and modern invasion biology is still new, making it difficult to determine their impact. Ecosystem impacts, lag effects, and the greater propensity for non-native species to cause harm suggest that managing invasions only after impact is evident is ill-advised.",0

2. Vidian canal schwannomas are particularly rare, but can cause decreased lacrimation, corneal desiccation, and dryness of the nasal mucosa.
3. A case of biopsy-proven schwannoma of the vidian canal is presented, which was identified incidentally on a routine MRI for multiple sclerosis follow-up.
4. The patient was asymptomatic from the lesion, but the mass was causing bony erosion of the vidian canal.
5. The patient opted for stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) to minimize late normal tissue injury risks, given the benign histology, background of multiple sclerosis, and young age.
6. The traditional and curative management of peripheral nerve tumors is surgical resection, but radiation therapy is also an alternative option.
7. Conservative management with serial imaging can be considered when surgical resection is not feasible or involves a disproportionate risk of morbidity and/or mortality.

2. Twelve fresh-frozen calf lumbar specimens were used, and an unstable burst fracture was created in the L3 vertebra.
3. The specimens were divided into two groups (monoaxial and polyaxial) and subjected to biomechanical testing for flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation.
4. The addition of an intermediate screw decreased the range of motion (ROM) of the L2L4 segments in both the monoaxial and polyaxial groups.
5. The increase in stiffness was more significant for the monoaxial group with intermediate screws (mpsi) than the polyaxial group with intermediate screws (ppsi).
6. The short-segment construct in the pps group had significantly greater ROM in flexion and extension when compared with the mps group.
7. The study suggests that adding intermediate screws increases the stability of a short-segment pedicle fixation, especially when using monoaxial screws for fixing unstable burst fractures of the lumbar region.",1

2. This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering that is typically needed for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, which prevents the use of conductive plastic substrates.
3. The authors have previously demonstrated the use of ESA with ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes, and found that minor addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to the ZnO surface brought about a significant impact on the crystal growth for evolution of various nanostructures and alteration of the crystallographic orientation of the film.
4. In the case of ZnO/Eosin Y (EY) hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed, with the space between the ZnO nanowire filled with aggregates of EY.
5. The solid EY can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline such as dilute KOH aq, resulting in ZnO thin films with large single-crystalline grains, internal porous structure, high surface area for adsorption of photosensitizer dye, and high crystallinity for efficient transport of electrons.
6. With the DSSC application in mind, it would be highly interesting to find a compatible system for fabricating sensitized photocathodes.

2. A Tornwaldt's cyst can develop if the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, while crusts adhering to the orifice without obstruction form the crust type. The crust type is characterized by periodic shedding from the nasopharynx, causing an offensive smell and unpleasant taste.
3. The cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is more common and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal abscesses and cysts. Although most patients are symptom-free, some develop bursitis, a cyst, or an abscess, resulting in symptoms such as nasal obstruction, eustachian tube obstruction, dysphagia, or cranial nerve paralysis.
4. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, with a peak incidence between 15 and 30 years and no gender predilection. Most published literature focuses on the cystic type, with no single report estimating the incidence or characterizing the symptoms of crust-type nasopharyngeal bursitis.
5. In this clinicoanatomical audit, six patients (four males and two females, mean age 54 years) were diagnosed with nasopharyngeal bursitis, with an incidence of less than 1% of all rhinitis patients seen during the study period. Two patients had classical Tornwaldt's cysts, one had a fibrosed Tornwaldt's cyst, and three were diagnosed with crust-type bursitis.
6. Patients with crust-type bursitis presented with crust expectoration and retching, with or without fetid postnasal discharge and occasional occipital pain. Surgical treatment using a combined endoscopic nasal and transoral approach resulted in complete recovery with no recurrence of symptoms.

2. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that visualizes morphological features not discernible by the naked eye, with different techniques enhancing morphological details. Dermoscopy can improve diagnostic sensitivity by 10-30% but may lower accuracy in inexperienced dermatologists.
3. Diagnostic performance in melanoma is highly dependent on subjective judgement and is scarcely reproducible. Scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to assist less experienced clinicians, but within- and between-observer concordance remains low.
4. In the last two decades, there has been growing interest in automated analysis of digitized images from dermoscopy techniques to differentiate early melanoma from benign skin lesions. Computational intelligence methods can help physicians and dermatologists make faster, more reliable diagnoses.
5. Various border detection, feature extraction, selection, and classification algorithms have been used in automated diagnostic systems for melanoma. Research is needed to identify and reduce uncertainties in these systems to improve diagnosis accuracy.
6. A comprehensive up-to-date review of automatic diagnostic models for skin lesions is not available, with numerous classification algorithms and techniques emerging in recent years.
7. A standard automatic decision support system is described, based on semantic analysis of melanoma images and further classification of characteristic objects commonly found in pigmented skin lesions.

2. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the number of people with diabetes will rise to 552 million by 2030 if no action is taken.
3. T2D is often the result of a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors, and genetic association studies have identified the PGC-1 loci as being associated with T2D.
4. The ESRRA protein, which binds to PGC-1, regulates the expression of the MFN2 gene, which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism.
5. The MFN2 gene maps to chromosome 1p36.22 and is highly expressed in tissues with high energetic requirements, such as skeletal muscle and heart.
6. A study found that the mfn2-dependent mechanism of mitochondrial control is disturbed in skeletal muscle in animal or human obesity and in patients with T2D.
7. The study found that the A allele and C allele of rs873458 and rs2878677 of the MFN2 gene confer protection against T2D in Han Chinese populations.
8. The study also found that haplotypes of the MFN2 gene, specifically A-C-G-T-C and G-T-C-T-C, are significantly associated with T2D in Han Chinese populations.
9. The study suggests that there are interactions between genetic variants in the MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1 genes in the pathogenesis of T2D.

Inter-individual variations in ex vivo platelet aggregation during clopidogrel therapy have been linked to reduced exposure of the active clopidogrel thiol metabolite and differences in p2y12 receptor occupancy. High on-treatment platelet reactivity and low platelet inhibition during clopidogrel therapy are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, in particular stent thrombosis.
2. Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (cyp2c19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting. Recent advances suggest that clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation, with the inactive prodrug first oxidized to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic cyp450 enzymes and then converted to the thiol metabolite.
3. A recent study using sophisticated metabolomic methods suggested that a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (pon1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the second step of clopidogrel biotransformation. A common polymorphism of pon1 (q192r) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the qq (aa) haplotype, and has been linked to an increased risk of stent thrombosis in two cohorts of patients with coronary stenting.
4. In a group of patients with a history of prior stent thrombosis but not currently receiving clopidogrel therapy, reduced plasma activity of pon1 and the pon1 (qq192) genotype were associated with reduced active thiol metabolite exposure and reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel. However, a genome-wide association study (gwas) examining the association of common genetic polymorphisms on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel did not find evidence of a significant association of snps located on or near the pon1 gene.

The source describes a patient with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) caused by congenital toxoplasmosis, which was diagnosed through typical symptoms and signs, serologic test, and neuroimaging findings. Congenital toxoplasmosis can cause multifocal parenchymal necrosis forming calcifications, and the distribution and severity of calcifications vary according to the date of maternal infection and correlate with neurologic signs and symptoms.
2. The patient presented with predominantly dyscognitive seizures accompanied by psychic aura during ictal events, which was confirmed with ictal and interictal EEG findings and neuroimaging including SPECT and SISCOM. The patient had hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and amygdala hypertrophy on the left temporal lobe, which may be caused by several different mechanisms, including the kindling phenomenon of epilepsy and the inflammatory reaction and resulting gliosis around the calcified nodule. The source emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation and careful management of seizure in patients with congenital toxoplasmosis, especially those with calcification in the perihippocampal area.",0

2. In 1992, the National Institute of Health held a conference to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, concluding that it offered substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no increase in morbidity or mortality.
3. The panel also found that laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduced pain and disability, leading to equal or slightly lower treatment costs and substantial savings for patients and society due to the shortened period of disability.
4. However, charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often surpass those of open cholecystectomy, which is surprising because charges should reflect the costs resulting from increased length of stay, nursing, and hospital support required by open cholecystectomy.
5. A study of 70 cholecystectomy patients found that the average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922, while that of open cholecystectomies was $13,042, with the amount attributed to laparoscopy being $6,880.
6. Decision tree analysis showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective than laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but if charges could be reduced to certain levels, depending on the conversion rate, laparoscopic cholecystectomy would become cost-effective.",0

The proportion of girls and boys was comparable among remitters and nonremitters. Mean age at diagnosis was similar between subgroups, and height and BMI z-scores were also similar between subgroups and to the distribution of healthy Belgian children from the reference database.
2. The absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was significantly higher in PR patients (82.3%) than in no PR patients (63.5%). This effect was more pronounced in boys, who had a higher PR frequency when no DKA occurred at diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that chances of PR were higher when there was no DKA at diagnosis. Mean PR duration was 279.6 days (range 151-722) or 9.2 months (range 0.5-6.6) with no differences between gender and age subgroups.
3. Patients entering PR had a lower baseline A1c (10.1±2.7%) than patients with no subsequent PR (10.8±2.8%). This effect was evidenced in girls entering PR who had a lower A1c at diagnosis (10.0±2.9%) than girls without PR (11.2±3.1%). However, boys had similar A1c levels whether they entered PR or not. In multivariate logistic regression models, lower A1c at diagnosis was associated with higher chances of PR. A1c levels at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after diagnosis were strongly associated with PR duration when subgrouped. Low A1cs at 3 to 12 months were associated with longer PR, whereas pr durations dropped for a1cs > 6 to 7% and > 7 to 8%. High a1cs (> 8 to 9%) were not different from patients with poorly controlled diabetes (a1c > 9%).",0

The prevalence of oral lesions in the elderly population varies based on socioeconomic factors, medical and dental history, treatment expenditure, and handicap. However, there is a lack of research on gerodontology in the Indian subcontinent.
2. A study conducted at Jodhpur Dental College General Hospital in India found that 64% of 5,100 geriatric patients had various oral lesions. The most common lesions were nicotinic stomatitis (43%) and denture stomatitis (34%). The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions was higher in this study than in previous studies by Mujica et al. and Espinoza et al..
3. The study found that males were more affected by oral lesions than females, and the majority of the lesions were observed in patients between 65 to 70 years of age. The hard palate was the most commonly affected site (23.1%), followed by the tongue (16.4%) and gingiva (14.7%).
4. The lesions identified during the study were classified into 27 different clinical entities based on clinical, histopathological, and microbiological diagnosis. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) was a commonly seen premalignant lesion due to the high percentage of people with the habit of betel nut chewing.
5. The study also found that several conditions are encountered in the elderly age group, including neoplasms, infections, immunological, hematological, and systemic disorders, leading to oral pain and discomfort. Bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections, physical and thermal alterations, immune system changes, systemic diseases, tumors, trauma, and other factors can cause changes in the oral mucosa due to aging.
6. The study found that 2% of the patients were diagnosed with malignancies, all of whom were diagnosed as having squamous cell carcinoma. The oral cavity is one of the most suitable locations for the development of cancerous diseases, and all potentially malignant lesions should be confirmed by microscopic analysis.

Misdiagnosis of chondroblastoma can lead to unnecessary treatments and a delay in suitable treatments for this rare tumor with malignant potential. In the case described, the patient was initially misdiagnosed with otitis media and a tumor mass was present in the middle cranial fossa, including the temporomandibular joint and cochlea, after 5 years of unsuccessful treatment.
2. Accurate diagnosis of chondroblastoma is important as tumors that originate as benign can become malignant under inappropriate treatment. The patient in this case was misdiagnosed with giant cell tumor in the temporal region based on CT scan/MRI plus pathology. However, re-examination of CT/MRI and immunohistochemical examination of the lesion showed reactivity of the neoplastic protein mass for S-100 protein, indicating malignant chondroblastoma. Treatment of chondroblastoma in the temporal bone requires total en bloc excision, curettage, and irradiation. However, postoperative irradiation is not universally recommended due to malignant changes in chondroblastoma observed after irradiation. Therefore, accurate, early-stage diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment.",0
689,"1. Regular structured exercise has numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular and metabolic function, which can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that exercise alone can reduce visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL), both of which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease.
2. While there is strong evidence for the benefits of regular structured exercise, it is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits in reducing adipose tissue depots. Understanding this association is important because of low participation rates in structured exercise and an increasing emphasis on the importance of habitual physical activity levels and reduced sedentary time in public health messages.
3. Cross-sectional analyses have shown an inverse relationship between central adiposity and self-reported physical activity levels, as well as between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and physical activity. Prospective studies have further supported this association. However, self-reported behavior is subject to reporter bias and tends to overestimate activity levels.
4. Emerging evidence using objectively measured physical activity via accelerometry supports these observations, but research using accurate assessments of VAT and IHL is limited. If the epidemiological data can be confirmed by high-quality objective assessments, encouraging habitual physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior will have important clinical ramifications.
5. In a study of adults with overweight/obesity, researchers aimed to evaluate whether levels of accurately quantified sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of VAT and IHL. They hypothesized that there would be a negative relationship between time spent in moderate intensity physical activity and levels of VAT and IHL and a positive relationship between time spent in sedentary behavior and VAT and IHL content.
6. The study found that traditional risk factors such as sex, age, and waist circumference were associated with VAT and IHL, but there was no relationship between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat. Additionally, there was a weak positive association between VAT volume and time spent in moderate activity, and the inclusion of objectively measured levels of moderate activity and sedentary behavior did not improve the potency of traditional risk factors for predicting",0

2. The study found that 9.43% of the injuries were open-globe and 90.56% were closed-globe. Eighteen eyes underwent surgical management, while 34 were managed conservatively. Five eyes developed phthisis bulbi, and one eye was advised primary enucleation.
3. The most common types of firecracker causing injury were bombs, and high-velocity fireworks such as rockets and bombs were more frequently associated with poorer visual outcomes. Corneal abrasions, corneal foreign body, and hyphema were the most common anterior segment findings.
4. The study highlights the need for public awareness about the dangers of fireworks, prophylactic measures, and expert primary ophthalmic care for the injured. It also recommends regulating the manufacture, sale, and use of consumer fireworks through strong legislation to reduce this preventable cause of ocular morbidity.",0
691,"1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by an isolated elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with a normal free thyroxine (FT4) level, which is considered to represent early, mild thyroid failure. The prevalence of SCH varies according to population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement, and is defined as a TSH level greater than 4.0 to 6.0 miu/l.
2. The clinical significance of SCH is still a matter of controversy, and its relationship with adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes is unclear. Despite this, it is known that SCH can lead to impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function, and older people with SCH and a high CV risk appear to be at an increased risk of incident heart failure.
3. SCH has been associated with an increased risk of developing a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components. A recent meta-analysis found that SCH is associated with higher systolic blood pressure, and a Korean study demonstrated that SCH subjects with an intermediate-to-high risk of CVD had higher coronary calcium scores than euthyroid subjects.
4. The treatment of SCH is typically considered only for pregnant women, infertile individuals, those with associated symptoms, or those at high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. A number of placebo-controlled studies have assessed the effects of T4 replacement therapy on the symptoms of patients with SCH, but the reported benefits are limited and evidence regarding the association of SCH with CVD remains controversial.
5. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that SCH may be associated with a modest increase in the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality, particularly in subjects with higher TSH levels. A more recent review found that even modest elevations of TSH may have substantial health outcomes, including CV mortality.

2. Diagnosis of CDAD typically involves an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B released by the C. difficile cells. However, the low detection sensitivity of EIA for the CD toxins has been reported.
3. A nucleic acid amplification test, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can be used to compensate for the low sensitivity of EIA. PCR detection of TcdA or TcdB genes is the evidence for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile.
4. Patients with toxin-negative stool may be dismissed as non-CDAD and thus overlooked in terms of treatment and infection countermeasures. There is currently no definite method of determining whether diarrhea is caused by CD toxins present at concentrations below the detection sensitivity of EIA or by another cause.
5. The present study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA and were divided into three groups based on the EIA CD toxin results in stool specimens and isolates obtained from bacterial culture.
6. The study found that there were no significant differences in clinical characteristics or antimicrobial drug use among the three groups. However, there was a significant difference in mean diarrhea duration between the positive stool group and the dual-negative group.
7. A significant difference was also observed in the proportion of patients who received vancomycin or metronidazole treatment for CDAD among the three groups.
8. The study suggests that patients who tested positive for C. difficile on culture but negative for toxins in their stool had milder symptoms, despite having toxin-positive isolates.

3. In contrast, participants who received ramipril did not have significant changes in beta-cell function.
4. The study also found that rosiglitazone's impact on diabetes incidence was independent of baseline levels and changes in beta-cell function.

A complete understanding of microbial metabolism must consider both individual strain properties and the interactions within complex communities.
2. Interacting microbial strains can exhibit naturally complementary metabolism or be genetically engineered to interact. These partners share various metabolites, such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose. A general model of metabolic interaction should account for the variety of metabolites exchanged and the genotypic diversity of the strains involved.
3. Optimization-based techniques, like flux balance analysis, have been successful in describing metabolic systems by using well-characterized biochemical reaction networks and can be generalized to more exotic species. Using a model set of E. coli auxotrophs, these approaches have been extended to the higher-order system of two strains in co-culture.
4. Certain pairs of auxotrophs complement each other's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites, a relationship referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT). SMIT interactions constitute a class of synthetic genetic interactions, reflecting and elucidating the genetic and metabolic network from which they derive.
5. A quantitative and predictive theoretical model has been developed to reveal the extent to which complex metabolic interactions emerge from the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network. Forty-six conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli strains were selected, each with a specific essential metabolite biosynthesis deletion.
6. These deletion strains cover a significant portion of metabolic diversity, including genes required for amino acids, nucleotides, cofactors, glycolysis, and respiration biosynthesis. Each deletion strain exhibits robust growth in rich medium but no measurable growth in minimal medium. Strains were labeled individually with plasmids expressing fluorescent proteins and co-cultured in minimal media in all pairwise combinations.

Biological scaffold materials derived from human, bovine, and porcine sources have been used in soft tissue repair applications such as hernia repair, breast reconstruction, and orthopedic applications. These scaffolds are particularly useful in contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria. However, they are expensive, exhibit variability, and provoke patient-specific immunological responses.
2. Absorbable polymer scaffolds such as Dexon and Vicryl have been used in damage control situations, but they lose mechanical strength and are resorbed quickly, making them less than ideal for hernia repair applications. Newer absorbable scaffold designs such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh use long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly and have been shown to have promising outcomes in clinical applications.
3. A study was conducted to determine the mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics of Phasix Mesh and p4hb plug when utilized to bridge a surgical defect in a porcine model. The study found that both devices and their types of fixation remained intact at the repair sites up to 52 weeks, with no evidence of hernia or diastasis. The burst strength of the native abdominal wall and the repaired walls with Phasix Mesh and p4hb plug remained stable throughout the study, with no significant differences detected between the two devices at any time points. Porcine abdominal wall sites repaired with Phasix Mesh or p4hb plug materials both demonstrated significantly greater burst strength compared to the native abdominal wall at all time points.",0

2. Several European countries, including Denmark, have reported a rising incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in recent years.
3. In Denmark, a dramatic increase since 2012 has been due to multiclonal outbreaks of vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium.
4. For every patient with a VRE infection detected in a clinical sample, up to ten patients may be intestinal carriers of VRE.
5. Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, using selective culturing and/or detection of resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR.
6. A report from France highlighted that rapidly available results can lead to substantial indirect savings during VRE outbreak management.
7. Studies have examined the diagnostic accuracy of various assays to detect vanA and vanB, with sensitivities ranging from 43.5% to 100% and specificities from 79.2% to 99.6%.
8. In a Danish laboratory, the use of a culture-based method with overnight enrichment and subsequent plating on chromogenic agar was replaced by the Xpert vanA/vanB assay, providing results within an hour.

2. Triple combination therapy (captopril + losartan + ru) was generally the most effective strategy in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in both normal and diabetic hearts.
3. In diabetic hearts, capt + los dual therapy was equally effective as the triple combination, and capt + ru double combination was not significantly better than any of the single therapies.
4. The relative improvement in cardiac function or effectiveness of RAAS blockers was greater in diabetes than in control hearts, except for pmax for ru given after ischemia.
5. Ru was highly effective at preventing i/r-induced cardiac dysfunction in nondiabetic hearts, but only effective at preventing ischemia-induced injury in diabetes.
6. Ru importantly improves diastolic function in diabetes, especially when given after ischemia, suggesting a novel strategy for treating diabetes-induced diastolic dysfunction.

3. The study examines changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers who underwent cosmetic rhinoplasty using acoustic rhinometry and comparing differences before and after surgery.
4. The study found that bilateral d1 and both mca2 decreased significantly, while significant increase was observed in mca1 postoperatively.
5. The effect of septoplasty, osteotomy, and placing a columellar strut on the nasal airway was not statistically significant.
6. Acoustic rhinometry is accurate in evaluating the nasal airway and can provide objective documentation and diagnosis for better treatment of nasal airway blockage.
7. The study found a reduction in d1, an increase in mca1, a decrease in mca2, and no change in v and d2 after surgery.
8. Performing septoplasty may increase patient nose patency, and placing a strut may be beneficial in most cases.

700,"1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in many developed nations, and its incidence is still increasing. Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of CVD risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been proven in several observational and experimental studies.
2. N-3 PUFAs have been shown to have lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects. Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disease characterized by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop throughout the disease progression.
3. Endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins, maintaining a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance is disrupted, leading to an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 1, 2, and 6 (IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-). These pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce oxidative stress by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by monocytes, macrophages, and leukocytes.
4. PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response. Unsaturated fatty acids are referred to as PUFAs when two or more double bonds are present. There are two PUFA families, omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, which differ in the location of the last double bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule.

701,"1. The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer has been built on the work of three pioneering pathologists. Rudolf Virchow proposed that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. Pelayo Correa, a pathologist from Colombia, published a model for gastric cancer development in 1975, hypothesizing that the development of the more common intestinal subtype of gastric cancer resulted from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over the next 30-50 years.
2. Correa initially thought that the agent(s) responsible for promoting this slow progression from gastritis to cancer were environmental, based on studies of migrants from high gastric cancer risk areas. However, in his 1988 publication, he briefly discussed a possible role for Campylobacter pylori, a newly discovered gastric bacterium, in the initiation of the disease. Correa's subsequent work has focused primarily on the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer.
3. In the 1970s, Robin Warren from Australia, together with Barry Marshall, discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Although Warren and Marshall did not investigate the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer directly, they were aware of the relationship between gastritis and cancer, and speculated that these bacteria may have a part to play in gastritis-associated diseases, including gastric cancer.
4. Initial investigations into a possible association of H. pylori with gastric cancer provided only weak evidence for a link between H. pylori and gastric cancer. More convincing evidence for the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer came from three large cohorts with nested case-controls, in which serum had been banked from cancer-free subjects and the cohort had been followed up for approximately a decade. In each cohort, evidence of prior H. pylori infection was found to be significantly more common in those subjects who subsequently developed gastric cancer.

The study found that both drugs had similar effects in preventing visual acuity loss and improving vision in some patients. The safety of the drugs remains unclear, and there is ongoing debate about this issue.
2. The study included patients who were treated with either bevacizumab or ranibizumab between 2009 and 2011, with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. The study found that both drugs resulted in significant improvements in visual acuity and central retinal thickness (CRT) compared to baseline at every time point. The two groups were parallel to each other with respect to change in BCVA and CRT, injection numbers, and complications.
3. Previous clinical studies have reported similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes with bevacizumab or ranibizumab. A short-term efficacy and safety study by Landa et al. found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab treatments resulted in similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes one month after an intravitreal injection in patients with AMD. A retrospective study by Feng et al. reported that after a median follow-up time of 12 months, there was no statistical difference in visual acuity changes between the two groups.
4. The CATT study, a multicenter, noninferiority trial, compared the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab. The study found that as-needed bevacizumab was equivalent to as-needed ranibizumab with a gain of 5.9 and 6.8 ETDRS letters in visual acuity, respectively. The mean injection numbers of as-needed bevacizumab and ranibizumab groups were 7.7 and 6.9 at month 12, respectively. The two-year results of the study were similar to the first-year results, but the mean gain in visual acuity was found to be greater in monthly groups than as-needed groups. The study also addressed the safety issue and adverse events between the two drugs, with",0

Women with SHP were delivered earlier, had a higher rate of cesarean section (CS), and were more likely to present with severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta compared to those with mild hypoproteinemia (MHP).
2. Neonatal outcomes were also worse in the SHP group, with lower average birth weight, higher rates of fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that SHP was a significant risk factor for CS, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes in PE women.",1

The development of the VEGF-A monoclonal antibody Avastin has been successful in treating various human cancers, but its recent withdrawal for treating breast cancer in the US highlights the need for careful cost-benefit analysis and the potential role of other growth factors in sustaining tumor angiogenesis.
2. Other VEGF family members, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, have been identified and shown to promote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, suggesting their potential as alternative targets for anti-cancer therapy.
3. In addition to VEGF family members, other signaling pathways, such as those driven by PDGF, IGF, and FGF growth factor families, and alternative molecular targets like c-met, may also provide valid therapeutic targets for inhibiting angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis in cancer.",1

2. A study in the Bagh-e Malek region of Hormozgan province, which has a high rate of malaria transmission, found that microscopy and RDTs failed to detect three asymptomatic P. vivax cases, which were only detected by nested-PCR.
3. The study suggests that using molecular methods like nested-PCR, in addition to microscopy and RDTs, can improve sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for active case surveillance in endemic settings, which is crucial for interrupting malaria transmission and preventing re-introduction in Iran.",1
706,"1. Over the last two decades, new immunotherapy approaches for cancer treatment have been developed due to increased understanding of the immune system and tumor evasion mechanisms.
2. Some of these investigations have led to approved agents, such as infusional cytokine therapies, intravesical BCG therapy, and the Sipuleucel-T prostate cancer vaccine.
3. Other agents, like the ipilimumab anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody for melanoma, have shown benefit in clinical trials and are awaiting approval.
4. Identifying biomarkers for these agents is challenging, especially for broadly active immune modulating agents like anti-CTLA-4 or PD-1 antibodies.
5. Researchers have used Serex-based studies to identify immunologically recognized proteins in prostate tissue and cancer, which could serve as targets for anti-tumor vaccines or have diagnostic value.
6. A subset of these antigens was recognized in patients with prostate cancer and symptomatic prostatitis, suggesting potential use as biomarkers for inflammatory conditions or premalignant settings.
7. In a study, machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) were used to identify promising biomarkers and potential biomarker networks in complex immune biomarker data sets.
8. The study trained ML-BBNs to identify promising biomarkers and then used these networks to select a subset of features to train a network of immune biomarkers related to observed declines in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
9. The findings support the concept of using measures of antigen spread as biomarkers of immunological efficacy for immune-active therapies, and igg responses to panels of tissue-associated antigens as measures of this antigen spread.
10. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using ML-BBNs to identify promising early biomarkers of immune response to vaccine therapies, which could potentially be used to determine clinical response in patients.",1

2. The study explores the use of the converse piezoelectric effect to mechanically stimulate bone using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films.
3. PVDF films were coated with an acrylic material and bonelike particles to improve cell adhesion and assure electrical insulation.
4. The actuator device was programmed to apply a 5V square wave of 1Hz and 3Hz for 15 minutes at each frequency, once every 24 hours.
5. The actuator device was implanted in the left hind limb of a 4-year-old merino ewe, and a control device was implanted in the right hind limb.
6. Total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher compared to static controls, and the increment of bone occupied area was due to new bone formation.
7. The study also found a significant increase in osteopontin (OPN) expression around actuators compared to static controls.

709,"1. The LCN2 mice were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells from mouse strain 129 and backcrossed onto the b6 background for 10 generations. These mice were used in experiments alongside wild-type mice to study the effects of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and cold exposure.
2. Age-matched male wild-type and LCN2 mice were fed either an HFD or regular chow diet (RCG) and housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at the University of Minnesota. Animal handling followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines, and experimental procedures were approved by the University of Minnesota Animal Care and Use Committee.
3. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were conducted by intraperitoneal injection of glucose and insulin after an overnight or 6-hour fast, respectively. Blood glucose levels were measured at various time points after injection.
4. Frozen liver tissue was homogenized and prepared for triglyceride quantification, while adipose tissue was obtained from the epididymal and inguinal fat pad of wild-type and LCN2 mice fed an RCD.
5. Adipose tissue samples were fixed in osmium tetroxide and incubated for 48 hours to determine adipose cell size using a Beckman Coulter Multisizer III with a 400-m aperture.
6. Food intake, ambulatory activity, oxygen consumption, and respiratory quotient were measured using indirect calorimetry in RCD-fed wild-type and LCN2 mice at 18 weeks of age.
7. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity was assessed under thermoneutral and thermal stress conditions by measuring body temperature in ambient temperatures of 28°C, 22°C, and 4°C.
8. To explore the possible mechanisms for cold intolerance in LCN2 mice, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenic activity and capacity of BAT were investigated upon HFD feeding.
9. The effects of LCN2 deficiency on systemic insulin sensitivity were assessed by performing glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs",0
710,"1. Male Wistar rats were obtained from a lab in Sapporo, Japan and were divided into two groups: weight-bearing (WB) and non-weight-bearing (NWB). Both groups were given LPS and methylprednisolone injections to induce non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).
2. The WB group was allowed to move freely in their cages, while the NWB group had their hindlimbs unloaded using a tail suspension system to prevent weight-bearing.
3. The rats were then sacrificed, and their femurs and humeri were harvested and processed for histopathological examination.
4. The presence of empty lacunae and pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis, was used to define histopathological ONFH.
5. The results showed that femoral head ONFH was observed in 63.6% of WB rats and 54.5% of NWB rats, with no significant intergroup difference.
6. The histopathological appearance of the femoral head showed empty lacunae and a decrease in hematopoietic cells in both the WB and NWB groups.
7. However, necrotic cell debris was accumulated in the medullary space of the NWB group, which was not observed in the WB group.
8. No humeral head ONFH was observed in any of the rats in either group.
9. The study suggests that the rat model may be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of ONFH and developing prevention strategies, but may not be suitable for observing the mechanism of femoral head collapse.
10. The study concludes that weight-bearing is not related to the development of non-traumatic ONFH in the rat model, but the aetiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of non-traumatic ONFH remain unclear.",0

There is a growing recognition of the importance of nurses' involvement in national health policy processes due to their significant role in the healthcare workforce and their unique insights into service delivery. However, historically, nurses have had limited involvement in policy formulation and decision-making, often due to gender differences, lack of awareness and knowledge of policy processes, and limited opportunities to contribute.
2. In Kenya, a study found that nurses' participation in policy development processes was limited and inconsistent, with many nurses feeling excluded from decision-making. The study identified several reasons for this underengagement, including a top-down policy-making approach, lack of knowledge and skills to engage in policy processes, and a hierarchical health system that excludes nurses from policy tables.

2. The study also found that E. coli was highly resistant to ampicillin (93.6%), cefixime (85.7%), and cephalexin (77.3%), but was mostly susceptible to cefotaxime (63.6%).
3. The study suggests that a third generation cephalosporins plus an aminoglycoside would be a better choice as the first line of empiric therapy for neonatal UTIs, due to the high resistance of the most prevalent organisms to ampicillin.",1
713,"1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders that cause a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of all affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
2. The deficiency of 21-hydroxylase leads to decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, causing hyperplasia of the adrenal gland and increased virilization due to the diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens. There are different clinical forms of CAH associated with 21-OHD, including classical CAH (salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms) and the non-classical form, which may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of postnatal or even adult onset hyperandrogenism.
3. The study investigated the frequency of white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in patients with CAH due to 21-OHD and found that 42.3% of patients showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, temporal lobe atrophy, and hippocampal dysgenesis. These abnormalities could be the consequence of hormonal imbalance during brain development and corticosteroid treatment.
4. The study also reported a case of a patient with CAH who developed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, suggesting a possible genetic link between multiple sclerosis and CAH. The organizational and activational effects of androgens and glucocorticoids on the brain, particularly on the hippocampus and amygdala, could contribute to the pathophysiological characteristics of anxiety and depressive disorders in both adults and children.",1
714,"1. The human genome sequence, completed through both publicly funded and corporate projects, holds great promise for biomedical advances this century. However, biologists must become skilled at interpreting the vast genomic DNA data to uncover hidden knowledge.
2. There are two common ways to annotate genes: one based on experimental observations and another on predicted evolutionary relationships. The latter relies on identifying homologous genes, which often have similar functions.
3. Homology assignment is useful for predicting gene function but has limitations, as homologs may not share similarities in molecular mechanism or function. Therefore, homology only provides an approximate direction for future empirical determination of function.
4. The first completely sequenced genomes, such as Haemophilus influenzae, were annotated using sequence database searches for each predicted gene product. However, a major problem arises when homologous portions of genes are embedded in otherwise dissimilar contexts.
5. Domains, homologous portions of sequences in different gene contexts, represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution. Various resources, such as Pfam, Smart, Prosite, and Celera, detect domains using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments.
6. InterPro combines the domain and motif sets of Prosite, Pfam, Prodom, Prints, and Smart in a hierarchical manner, providing annotation for 74% of all Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entries. Pfam, Smart, and InterPro were chosen to annotate human genome draft sequences.
7. Proteome annotation by domain content implies that a gene product's function is a synthesis of the generalized functions of its component parts. This approach provides the best predictions for the uncharacterized majority of human genes, but it is achieved automatically and may be replaced by high-throughput studies of non-vertebrate model organisms.",1

2. The prototype was calibrated using weights ranging from 0.5 kg to 6 kg, and a simple linear regression analysis was applied to adjust the data. The prototype's accuracy and precision were then measured using weights of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 kg.
3. The maxillary central incisor brackets were bonded to the enamel using a specific procedure, and specimens were divided into two groups: group 1 (bracket debonding with the prototype) and group 2 (bracket debonding by tensile testing in a universal testing machine).
4. The bracket debonding force was recorded by the software in kgf, transformed into newtons, and divided by the bracket area to obtain resistance values in mpa. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) was also assessed to evaluate the fracture pattern.
5. The mean bond strength obtained in group 1 (2.96 mpa) and group 2 (3.08 mpa) were statistically similar. Adhesive remnant index score 3 was predominant in both groups, indicating that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding.
6. The prototype was developed to control the problem of strain gauges being influenced by the operator's hand, which was an issue in the previous device. Strain gauges are localized mechanical deformation sensors that convert mechanical displacement into a range of electrical resistance.
7. To compensate for temperature alterations, an electrical resistance strain gauge with temperature compensation for steel was used, and the laboratory mean temperature was controlled during the experiments.
8. The strain gauges were bonded in the intermediate part positioned between the active arm of the plier and the claw, with one strain gauge directly connected to the claw. When the plier was used to debond the brackets, the strain gauge metal grid resistance generated a tension (mv).

The study found that trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection was more prevalent in older women, those with less education, single women, women who reported unprotected sex with a nonsteady partner, and women who reported multiple sex partners. However, there was no association between TV infection and vaginal symptoms. The prevalence of TV infection was not different between women with or without recent painful urination or vaginal discharge, suggesting that syndromic management of TV may result in both over and under-treatment. The asymptomatic nature of TV infection could contribute to a long duration of infection and continued spread in the population.
2. The study highlights the need for screening and treatment programs to control the spread of TV infection, especially in hard-to-reach populations such as socially-marginalized women who are often underrepresented. The findings support the need for improved disease control activities to reduce adverse trichomoniasis-associated reproductive health outcomes such as ectopic pregnancy, low infant birth weight, preterm labor, and non-HPV associated cervical neoplasia. Further studies are needed to determine if screening and treatment of TV will improve the reproductive health and birth outcomes of women.",0
720,"1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, characterized by specific types of seizures, EEG patterns, and cognitive impairment. It is classified as a symptomatic generalized epilepsy syndrome and has various causes, such as cortical maldevelopment and perinatal hypoxia-ischemia.
2. The classic clinical and EEG features of LGS may not be present at the onset, making diagnosis challenging. The syndrome is difficult to treat due to its encephalopathic nature and multiple seizure types, often leading to polypharmacy and cumulative side effects.
3. Valproic acid is generally considered the most useful initial medication for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS. However, caution is required when using valproic acid in children under 2 years old or those receiving multiple anticonvulsants due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.
4. Felbamate is an alternative to valproic acid, as it lacks sedative side effects, but its use is associated with risks of aplastic anemia and hepatotoxicity. Clobazam has shown promise in reducing both drop and non-drop seizures in LGS.
5. Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, is a novel anticonvulsant approved for the adjunctive treatment of LGS in the US and Europe. Its mechanism of action involves decreased firing of high-frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.
6. Rufinamide has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effectiveness in animals and a good safety profile in humans, with minimal cognitive side effects. It is well absorbed orally and has low protein binding, suggesting minimal drug-drug interactions.
7. In clinical trials, rufinamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of valproic acid, lamotrigine, or topiramate. However, phenytoin clearance was decreased, and valproic acid therapy should be introduced cautiously in children already on rufinamide.

2. Differences in chemical signals can lead to premating boundaries and reduced gene flow between populations, potentially resulting in cryptic speciation. In the Iberian wall lizard (Podarcis hispanica), males use chemical signals for male-male interactions and female mate choice decisions.
3. The Iberian wall lizard is paraphyletic and forms a species complex, suggesting the existence of cryptic speciation within taxa previously considered to be conspecific. Five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards in central Spain were studied to explore the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition.
4. These populations live in close proximity to each other in different environments, and some maintain clear distinct morphotypes and differ genetically, suggesting reproductive isolation. Morphological measurements and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were conducted to compare the morphological characteristics and chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions of males from these populations.
5. Tongue-flick experiments were performed to analyze whether males and females discriminated by chemosensory cues alone between scents of lizards from different populations. It was hypothesized that male and female lizards could recognize and prefer the scents of individuals from their own population.
6. The study found significant differences in morphological measurements between populations, with lizards from Fuenfra and Golondrina populations being significantly heavier, longer, and having greater heads than lizards from Aranjuez and Belmonte. The number of femoral pores and blue ocelli also differed between populations.
7. GC-MS analyses revealed 53 lipophilic compounds in femoral gland secretions of male P. hispanica, with cholesterol being the most abundant chemical. Differences in the presence/absence of 19 compounds in femoral secretions were found between populations.

2. Vaccination of susceptible individuals, particularly women of reproductive age, can prevent CRS by inducing immunity.
3. The Ra27/3 virus strain is commonly used in rubella vaccines, providing a strong immune response and minimizing the risk of infection in previously infected or vaccinated individuals.
4. In Iran, rubella and mumps vaccines were added to the national vaccination plan in 2003, resulting in high vaccination coverage and a significant decrease in measles and rubella cases.
5. A study on Kermanshahi girls at marriage in 2006 showed a significant increase in rubella immunity after mass vaccination, with 99.3% of vaccinated girls having positive antibodies.
6. The immunity rate among vaccinated girls in Kermanshah was 98.8% in a study conducted by the Immunology Department researchers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Ra27/3 vaccine.
7. Due to the lack of life-long immunity after rubella infection or vaccination, it is recommended to perform rubella seroepidemiology studies periodically to identify vulnerable individuals and provide necessary vaccinations.

Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a common technique used to visualize gene expression patterns by detecting RNA transcripts in whole mounts. This technique was initially performed using radioactive probes, but nonradioactive probes have since been developed, simplifying the process. WISH is now widely used in several biological systems, including Drosophila, Xenopus, quail,Dictyostelium, and zebrafish.
2. In situ hybridization (ISH) is a common technique in developmental research labs and is used for medical and prenatal diagnostics. The use of two different labels for the RNA probes and two color substrates allows for the detection of more than one transcript simultaneously. However, a major limitation of these chromogenic multilabeling techniques is that the overlapping regions of expression are very difficult to discern. The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts may overcome this limitation, but successful implementation is rare, especially in certain embryos such as mouse or Xenopus.
3. Fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts have several advantages over chromogenic methods, including higher quality three-dimensional imaging, multiplexing different RNA species, and covisualization of RNA with proteins. However, the major limitations preventing widespread use of fluorescence detection for WISH are the high endogenous background fluorescence of many embryos and the limited brightness and photostability of organic fluorophores. A new type of inorganic fluorophore, quantum dots (QDs), have been used recently for detection of proteins in vitro and in vivo for protein labeling and lineage tracing.
4. QDs have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including a strong fluorescent signal emission, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between the excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching. These unique optical properties make QDs an ideal candidate for detecting multiple RNAs in ISH protocols and their high fluorescence intensity raises the possibility of using them for RNA detection in whole embry",0

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and lethal form of pancreatic cancer, with a median survival time of about four months and a five-year survival rate of approximately 2%. The survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC can vary significantly depending on various factors, including demographic characteristics, pathologic nature of the tumor, and treatment type.
2. Cox proportional hazards regression models have been used to estimate the relative impact of distinct risk factors on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC. These models have shown that demographic factors such as gender, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, and time period of diagnosis have a significant impact on PDAC survival. Clinical factors such as tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases also significantly influence PDAC survival.
3. The most dramatic influence on PDAC survival is surgical resection of the tumor, but less than 20% of patients diagnosed with PDAC are suitable for surgical resection. The combination of surgery with radiation and chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival compared to surgery alone. However, the estimates of the relative impact of risk factors on PDAC survival vary depending on the quantity and quality of data used, the set of considered variables, and the technical approaches utilized in developing these models.
4. Two nomograms have been developed using Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC who have undergone pancreatectomy and to predict the risk of perioperative mortality in PDAC patients scheduled to undergo pancreatectomy. However, the utility of these nomograms is limited to the relatively small fraction of patients with resectable PDAC (less than 20%).
5. Recently, two new Cox regression models were developed to estimate the survival for patients with resectable and unresectable PDAC. These models use variables such as age, gender, race, tumor stage, tumor site, tumor grade, and radiotherapy. Based on these models, an interactive, online clinical calculator was developed to estimate personalized survival probability for patients diagnosed with PDAC.

2. The diagnosis and management of CLI were based on the Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) or its revised consensus (TASC II).
3. PTA was the first-choice procedure for revascularization, except for heavily calcified or diffusely occluded lesions.
4. Major amputation was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control foot lesions.
5. Preoperative variables considered in the analyses included sex, age, activities of daily living (ADLs), Fontaine stage, infection, diabetic condition, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, receiving regular hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.
6. Diabetic condition was determined by the presence of diabetes in the whole population and as a glycemic control in the diabetic population.
7. The study found that diabetic patients had a higher prevalence of Fontaine stage IV and hemodialysis than those without diabetes.
8. Diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared with nondiabetic patients, whereas they had a similar life prognosis.
9. The presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation, and mortality was associated with age, impaired ADLs, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.

The disease is common in areas with close contact between intermediate hosts (usually sheep) and definitive hosts (dogs).
2. CE in humans typically presents with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other organs. Diagnosis is established through radiology and serology. Postsurgical relapses or treatment failure can occur due to nonradical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material.
3. Previous studies have reported relapse rates between 2% and 25% after CE therapy. Posttreatment follow-up is necessary to detect newly growing or relapsing cysts and track previously undetected but still viable cysts.
4. Serology has been used for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies makes relapse diagnosis difficult. Many serologic techniques have been evaluated, but there is still a need for improved immunodiagnostic tools.
5. One approach to improve serodiagnosis is to search for and identify new antigens that specifically allow the classification of patients into cured and noncured categories.
6. A study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for CE serodiagnosis using immunoblotting analysis and determined the diagnostic performance of western blot.
7. The study found that antigenic bands with molecular weights of 52, 24, 39, 46, 63, and 6061 kDa were specific for hydatid disease, suggesting higher diagnostic value. The 39 kDa band reactivity decreased significantly in follow-up samples, but persisted in two patients with relapse at two years.
8. The antigenic fractions of 52, 46, 39, and 24 kDa in combination may serve as useful diagnostic markers. Immunoreactive bands of 52, 46, and 57 kDa persisted in higher numbers of post-operative samples.

2. The study was conducted with 66 patients (40 women and 26 men) with a mean age of 55.8±11.6 years.
3. Patients were divided into three groups based on their BMI: group I (BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m2), group II (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2), and group III (BMI ≥40 kg/m2).
4. The study found that patients in group III had greater mean waist circumference (WC) compared to groups II and I.
5. Mean WC, waist-to-height ratio (WHR), BMI, and body adiposity index (BAI) values were higher in group III compared to groups II and I.
6. Mean serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in group III were significantly lower than in group I.
7. Negative significant correlations were found between BMI and TC, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), WC, WHR, visceral adiposity index (VAI), and HDL-C.
8. Positive significant correlations were found between WC, WHR, and TC/HDL-C ratio, as well as between VAI and TC, TG, TC/HDL-C, LDL/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C.
9. The study found that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C.
10. The VAI index demonstrated the strongest correlation with TG and HDL-C levels and with the lipid indices TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C.",1
729,"1. The use of the internet has grown significantly in India and worldwide in the last decade, with potential benefits and drawbacks.
2. Internet addiction has been a growing concern, and researchers such as Griffiths, Davis, Young, and Caplan have proposed different criteria and terms to describe it.
3. Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) is a widely used tool to measure the severity of internet addiction, with scores ranging from 20 to 100.
4. In a study of 987 college students in Mumbai, India, 24.8% were classified as possible addicts, and 0.7% as addicts, with males being significantly more likely to be addicted.
5. Moderate users and possible addicts used the internet mostly for social networking, academic purposes, chatting, emailing, gaming, and downloading media files and pornography.
6. Internet addicts were more likely to use the internet in the evenings and nights, and to work part-time, compared to other users.
7. The study found that addicts had poor mental, physical, and social health, as well as high anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression scores.
8. Understanding the relationship between internet usage and psychopathology can help formulate interventions and detect early warning signs of underlying psychopathology.",1
730,"1. The frequency response of resonators was measured using a downmixing method, where a driving voltage was applied to a side-gate parallel to the resonator and the device was electrostatically actuated.
2. The drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency to reduce parasitic signals, resulting in the amplitude of motion being proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.
3. A bias voltage was used to down-mix the resistance change occurring at the actuation frequency, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier.
4. Typical measurement values included 1.5V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz.
5. All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature.
6. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same setup with the drive electrode disconnected.
7. The allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
8. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within the resonator's bandwidth.
9. The measurement setup was based on a previous one, but here each signal was doubled, using two drive signals at different frequencies, two bias signals, and two measurement signals.
10. Particular care was taken when choosing the drive signal amplitudes so that the resonator remained in the linear regime.
11. The two measurement frequencies were chosen to avoid cross-talk and the phase traces were converted to frequency traces corresponding to different integration times.
12. The complete phase response of the resonator was used rather than the linear approximation as the frequencies for phase samples can be quite different from the resonance frequency.
13. The correlation of these frequency traces was then plotted versus the integration time.
14. The correlation for a given τ was processed to only depend on frequency variations with characteristic time close to τ.
15. The two frequency traces were filtered with a band-pass filter centered on τ and the allan deviation transfer function was chosen as the band-pass filter.
16. The correlation coefficient of the filtered frequency traces f1 and f2 was then defined by the sample means and standard deviations of f",0
731,"1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and aspirin therapy is a prevention measure that can reduce the risk of major CVD events. However, many studies on aspirin use for CVD prevention may not accurately reflect physician recommendations due to self-initiation of aspirin use and varying risk assessment methods.
2. A nationally representative study analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011-2012 to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations for CVD prevention. The study found that among primary prevention patients, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and over three-fourths were classified as low risk.
3. Among high-risk primary prevention patients, less than half received a recommendation to take aspirin, while over a quarter of low-risk patients were also recommended to take aspirin. Of those told to take aspirin by their physicians, the vast majority complied with the recommendation.
4. Bivariate analyses revealed that demographic factors, health insurance, having a regular place to go for health care, and diabetes diagnosis were associated with being told to take aspirin as primary prevention. Among primary prevention patients, there were also significant differences in demographic and access-to-care variables by race/ethnicity.
5. Logistic regression models showed that education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention among all primary prevention patients. Among high-risk individuals, age, health insurance, and being of Asian/other descent were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin.
6. The study's findings suggest that decisions for treatment recommendations seem to be made on criteria other than objectively calculated future CVD risk, and there is a significant disconnect between who needs and who receives recommendations for aspirin use. Improved clinical decision support and access to care are necessary to ensure appropriate preventive care for CVD patients.",1
732,"1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate signaling pathways related to tumorigenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses.
2. Oxidation of protein cysteine residues by ROS results in the formation of disulfide or sulfenyl amide bonds, changing protein function and affecting cellular signaling.
3. The cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms, similar to how phosphatases, deubiquitinating enzymes, or histone deacetylases regulate phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation.
4. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs, with higher mitochondrial and oxidant content correlating with stem cell differentiation and lower content correlating with stem cell maintenance.
5. In the epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium regulated by stem cell populations, mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production promote signaling through pathways required for differentiation of mammalian stem cell populations in vivo.
6. Conditionally deleting TFAM, a transcription factor required for mitochondrial genome replication and transcription, in basal undifferentiated epidermal keratinocytes leads to an epidermal barrier defect and impaired differentiation, demonstrating that mitochondria play an active role in the regulation of epidermal homeostasis.
7. MROS generation is required for activation of the Notch and β-catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth, respectively, indicating that MROS act as pro-differentiation signals and are key upstream regulators of stem cell fate decisions.
8. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial metabolism promotes cellular differentiation beyond oxidant-dependent signaling remain poorly understood, but may involve the nutrient-dependent regulation of chromatin and histone acetylation, as well as the efficient ATP production provided by oxidative phosphorylation.",0
733,"1. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. The diagnosis of HCV infection is typically made using a branched chain DNA signal amplification assay and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
2. Histochemical techniques are needed for the detection of HCV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissue sections for routine diagnostic purposes. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH) have been used to detect HCV in human liver tissue, but their reproducibility is not yet sufficient.
3. In this study, an ISH technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAII) was established for the detection of HCV-RNA in FFPE tissue sections of the liver. Humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice were used as positive controls, and needle biopsy liver specimens of chronic hepatitis C were also examined.
4. The ISH technique demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic signals in human hepatocytes in all HCV-infected livers but not in the livers of three HCV noninfected mice. The positive signals remained after DNase treatment but were completely abolished after RNase treatment.
5. LNA-based ISH detected signals in 82% of chronic hepatitis C lesions, while nested RT-PCR genotyping for HCV using total RNA extracted from FFPE sections was successful in 73% of biopsied chronic hepatitis C lesions. No HCV-RNA was detected in HBV-related lesions, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, and in HCC lesions.
6. The ISH technique using the LNA-modified oligonucleotide probe and CSAII can be applied to detecting HCV-RNA in liver biopsy specimens, with a sensitivity comparable to in situ RT-PCR. This method is relatively simple and requires no special equipment to perform, making it a valuable tool for routine histopathological diagnosis of HCV infection using FFPE liver biops",0
734,"1. The thyroid system in vertebrates can be disrupted by various endocrine-disrupting chemicals, with frog tadpoles being particularly susceptible due to their thin, permeable skin and aquatic habitat.
2. The OECD and EPA have established guidelines for investigating frog metamorphosis as an indicator of thyroid toxicity, as the process is regulated by thyroid hormones (THs) and involves significant structural and functional changes in larval tissues.
3. THs are produced and secreted similarly in amphibians and mammals, with thyroxine (T4) being converted to the more biologically active 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral target tissues.
4. Several processes can influence TH balance, including inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake and peroxidase activity, reduction of T4 to T3 conversion, and increase in TH excretion due to enzyme induction.
5. Chemicals can interfere with TH metabolism by binding to transport proteins, altering TH affinity, or inhibiting TH sulfation and glucuronidation, which can affect cellular uptake and biological responses.
6. Amphibian tadpoles have a higher affinity for T3 than T4 binding to transport proteins, and chemicals that bind to transport proteins can directly affect plasma T3 levels and its clearance rate.
7. The aldosterone plasma level rises sharply during metamorphic climax, and both corticosteroids and sex hormones can inhibit T3-induced metamorphosis in tadpoles.
8. Several thyroid-disrupting substances, such as propylthiouracil (PTU), methimazole, and perchlorate, have been tested for toxicity using amphibians, causing metamorphic retardation, histological changes in the thyroid gland, and decreased TH levels.
9. The Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (AMA) has been adopted by the OECD and EPA as a guideline for testing chemicals, representing a generalized vertebrate model based on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (",0
735,"1. Cesarean sections (CS) performed for medical reasons are necessary to prevent maternal or perinatal complications, and the appropriate rate of use is associated with the lowest rate of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
2. However, the rate of CS performed without medical indication is increasing worldwide, leading to higher rates of CS.
3. A World Health Organization (WHO) global survey found that severe maternal morbidity is higher in planned CS delivery compared to planned vaginal delivery (VD).
4. WHO recommended a CS rate of 10-15%, based on the CS rates of countries with the lowest maternal and neonatal mortality rates.
5. However, many countries have CS rates far higher than the recommended range, including Iran, where the CS rate increased six-fold over the past three decades.
6. A study examining the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL) found that women with VD had higher physical HRQOL scores at 2 months follow-up compared to CS.
7. At 4 months postpartum, women with VD had higher total physical and mental HRQOL scores compared to women with CS.
8. The study also found that women with VD showed more improvements in mental HRQOL from time 1 to time 2 assessment compared to women with CS.
9. The findings suggest that VD leads to better physical health at 2 months after delivery and physical and mental health at 4 months after delivery. The study recommends future studies to include both general and specific questionnaires in assessing postpartum HRQOL among women with VD, elective CS, and emergency CS.",0
736,"1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs, proposed in 1943 and 1954, suggests that human needs can be categorized into physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization, with each level becoming relevant once the previous level is satisfied.
2. Physiological needs include food and sex, while safety needs involve personal and financial security, and health and well-being.
3. Safety needs can dominate behavior and may even suppress the significance of physiological needs, as seen in fear-induced responses that prioritize survival.
4. The appraisal theory of emotions, proposed by Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus, posits that emotions result from people's interpretations and explanations of their circumstances, with primary appraisal (fear) and secondary appraisal (anger) being key factors.
5. The amygdala, recognized as the neural basis for fear and stress-elicited fear and anxiety, plays a crucial role in safety needs, while the ne/lc system is essential for directing behaviors in dangerous environments.
6. Fear and anger might be derived from the same neurotransmitter (ne) and stressful event, with the fast-acting thalamus-amygdala circuit allowing for rapid threat detection.
7. Safety needs are the most fundamental needs for humankind, and their violation can lead to mental disorders such as anxiety, phobia, depression, and PTSD.
8. The neural basis for safety is the amygdala and lc/ne system, which can be regarded as a ""safety circuitry"" responsible for fight or flight and fear and anger emotions or conditioned learning for these emotions.",1
737,"1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are important regulators of various physiological functions, including blood pressure regulation, nociception, adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory activity, organ regeneration, insulin potentiation, podocyte integrity, and cellular responses to bacterial infection. They are derived from arachidonic acid via metabolism by cytochromes P450, particularly members of the 2c and 2j families. The ratio and stereocomposition of EET isomers are isoform-dependent, leading to species- and tissue-specific variations. However, the stability limitations and metabolic factors of EETs complicate investigations into their roles and hinder their therapeutic potential.
2. To address some of the stability limitations of natural EETs, researchers have synthesized several iterations of EET surrogates with improved stability. These surrogates have shown varying levels of vascular relaxation and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibition. The latest generation of analogues modifies the free carboxylic acid of previous EET mimics while retaining key structural features. These modified surrogates were evaluated for vasorelaxation and sEH inhibition in precontracted bovine coronary artery rings, with varying results.
3. Further structural iterations of these surrogates have been explored, focusing on replacing the carboxylate with various heterocyclic bioisosteres. Among these, urea 19 exhibited the best dual activity, with a submicromolar ed50 value and a low nanomolar ic50 for sEH inhibition. This makes it a leading candidate for further development as a potential therapeutic agent. Other heterocyclic variants, such as oxadiazol-5-one 22 and oxathiadiazole-2-oxides 23 and 24, have also demonstrated good vasorelaxant activities and varying levels of sEH inhibition.",0
738,"1. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) is a model of care that aims to provide quality, coordinated, and cost-effective care to patients, and increase access to services. It is an extension of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and has been proven to reduce patients' healthcare costs and improve patient care quality. Over 1,500 sites and 7,700 clinicians across the US have successfully completed the NCQA recognition process and are functioning as PCMHs.
2. The transition to PCMH can be difficult, with common concerns including promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records (EMRs). Physicians may resist the change due to a lack of appropriate training, misaligned financial incentives, underreimbursement, and time-consuming procedures.
3. To become recognized as a PCMH by the NCQA, a practice must provide documentation of its guidelines for implementation and adhere to PCMH principles. Practices must create their own written policies that fit their specific practice structure, taking into account patient panels, location, and financial resources. The transition and recognition process can be time-consuming and expensive, but rewards include better patient care, a more coordinated practice structure, and potentially reducing the overall cost of care for patients.
4. The PCMH model introduces team-based care to primary care practices, requiring staff to address patient treatment decisions collectively. This includes previsit meetings to allocate resources, ensure adequate health maintenance, and address chronic care management. Previous studies have shown that the use of previsit huddles has resulted in improved decision-making and care for patients, as well as increased patient and provider satisfaction.
5. The PCMH model focuses on educating patients regarding their health and ensuring they have the knowledge necessary to improve it. National PCMH demonstration projects have shown that patient education has increased their participation in their own care and subsequently their quality of life. Patients are encouraged to interact with practice staff and their providers regularly during appointments and through new means of communication, such as online patient portals, and to take advantage of health education opportunities within the community.",0

The use of hypothermia therapy for patients who have suffered from cardiac arrest has been shown to improve their survival rate and neurological function, according to a meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials. However, the therapy does not have a significant impact on the survival rate and neurological function of patients at hospital discharge.
2. The meta-analysis, which included studies with a total of 531 adult patients, found that hypothermia does improve the survival rate (rr = 1.25, 95% ci: 1.05-1.49, p = 0.01) and neurological function (rr = 1.37, 95% ci: 1.13-1.66, p = 0.001) of patients after 6 months.
3. The analysis also showed that hypothermia does not influence the incidence of rearrest (rr = 1.19, 95% ci: 0.87-1.61, p = 0.27) or other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and bleeding.
4. The study notes several limitations, including the small number of trials and study size, as well as clinical and methodological heterogeneity, which may affect the accuracy of the results. Further research is needed to analyze the impact of different cooling measures or hypothermia duration on the survival rate and neurological function of patients.",0
740,"1. Infertility can be caused by male factors, with approximately 40% of marital infertility due to male issues, including varicocele.
2. Varicocele is characterized by enlargement and elongation of the pampiniform plexus, venous convolution, and sinus formation, which can lead to backflow and compromised testicular oxygen concentration.
3. The left testicular vein's vertical alignment and connection to the left renal vein can result in blood turbulence, retrograde flow of renal metabolites and adrenal hormones, and elevated hydrostatic pressure within the testicular vein.
4. Testicular hypotrophy, caused by atrophic changes within convoluted tubules due to increased scrotal temperature or tissue hypoxia, can be an indication for surgical repair in adolescents.
5. Grading varicocele is based on the Dubin Amelar 1 to 3 scale, with a palpable varicocele and testicular hypotrophy on the affected side, confirmed by color doppler, being an indication for surgical repair.
6. In a retrospective study of 82 adolescents operated on for idiopathic varicocele with testicular hypotrophy, laparoscopic repair resulted in a significant increase in testicular volume on the affected side.
7. Late diagnosis and treatment of varicocele can lead to spermatogenesis disturbances and abnormal concentrations of sex hormones, while normal fsh, lh, and t levels found in young men operated on in adolescence are significant.
8. Assessment of the efficacy of surgical varicocele repair should include hormonal tests and semen analysis in procreative age group.",1
741,"1. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a common surgical treatment for localized prostate cancer, with numerous studies demonstrating excellent tumor control, good functional results, and low morbidity. However, the major long-term morbidity is erectile dysfunction.
2. Prior to studies by Walsh and Donker, the cause of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy was not well understood. They proposed and demonstrated that erectile dysfunction occurred secondary to the injury of cavernosal nerves.
3. These nerves are mainly concentrated laterally to the prostate and are referred to as neurovascular bundles. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates.
4. However, there is still controversy about the exact periprostatic nerve distribution, with no definite and exact anatomy of periprostatic nerve fibers, especially the cavernosal nerves.
5. In a study of five adult male human cadavers, the prostate, seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum were removed en bloc and sliced into 5 mm step sections.
6. The sections were then stained with anti-s-100 antibody neural stain to delineate the precise location of neural tissue. The study found that the average number of nerve fibers located in the ventral part of the prostate was significantly fewer than in the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts.
7. The average distance from the prostatic capsule to nerve fibers was similar in all four parts of the prostate, and there was no significant difference in nerve fiber thickness according to level.
8. The three-dimensional model of the periprostatic nerve fibers revealed an almost even distribution and nearly similar thickness of periprostatic nerve fibers on dorsal and both lateral parts. However, the nerve fibers in the ventral part were substantially fewer in number and decreased in thickness.
9. Traditionally, it was thought that cavernosal nerves branched from the pelvic plexus and ran as a plexus of small nerves within a prominent cord-like neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate. However, recent studies have challenged this traditional knowledge, and new advancements in surgery have enabled precise",0

2. Elevated SAA levels were found not only in patients with high disease activity but also in those with low or moderate disease activity, suggesting that sustained inflammation persists in most RA patients and may be connected with the disease complications.
3. The study also found that women treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) had significantly lower SAA concentration than women treated only with synthetic DMARDs, indicating better therapeutic effects of biological DMARDs in comparison to synthetic DMARDs resulting in lower disease activity.",0
743,"1. Glucocorticoids, which are part of systemic stress responses, play coadjuvant roles in promoting inflammation and may promote Th2-type immunity through differential effects on Th1 and Th2 cytokine production. Chronically stimulated eosinophil production is an important feature of human asthma and murine allergic asthma models, and this effect is antigen-specific and can be abolished by inducing oral tolerance to the allergen.

2. The effects of oral tolerization in bone marrow neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes can be duplicated by transfer of splenic T lymphocyte subpopulations from tolerized/sensitized/challenged donors to histocompatible naive recipients, highlighting the importance of acquired cellular immunity in regulating the hematological response to allergen sensitization and challenge. This suggests that granulopoiesis, encompassing both eosinophil and neutrophil production, might be regulated by lymphocyte populations in nonsensitized subjects as well.

3. In an allergic asthma model, researchers demonstrated a critical role for endogenous glucocorticoids in the hematological response to allergen challenge. Challenge induces a corticosterone surge that is paralleled by increased eosinophilia of bone marrow in vivo and by increased responsiveness to IL-5, the major eosinopoietic cytokine, ex vivo. The bone marrow response to challenge is abolished by blockade of glucocorticoid signaling or glucocorticoid production.

4. In the absence of allergen sensitization and challenge, researchers have also obtained evidence of a link between the corticosterone surge induced by mild surgical trauma and short-term bone marrow eosinophilia. Blockade of endogenous glucocorticoid production or action abolished the bone marrow eosinophilia induced by trauma.

2. Fear of hypoglycemia and weight gain are common barriers to initiating insulin therapy for T2DM management.
3. Modern insulin analogues offer a convenient approach to glycemic control, with a lower incidence of hypoglycemia and favorable weight changes.
4. The A1chieve study, a 24-week, multinational, non-interventional study, evaluated the safety and effectiveness of insulin analogues in T2DM patients (n = 66,726) in routine clinical care.
5. The majority of patients (73.9%) started or switched to biphasic insulin aspart, while others used insulin detemir, insulin aspart, basal insulin plus insulin aspart, or other insulin combinations.
6. After 24 weeks, overall hypoglycemic events decreased in both insulin user and insulin naive groups, with no episodes in the insulin naive group.
7. Blood pressure decreased, and overall lipid profile and quality of life improved in the cohort at week 24.
8. Glycemic control parameters improved from baseline to study end in the total cohort and in those who started or were switched to specific insulin analogues.
9. The study found improved glycemic control and quality of life following 24 weeks of treatment with any of the insulin analogues, with no severe adverse reactions reported. Overall, body weight increased in the insulin naive group, but there was no change in the insulin user group. The trend suggests that insulin analogues can be considered effective and safe for treating T2DM in Mumbai, India.",0

2. ESCs can differentiate into most somatic lineages, including cardiovascular lineages, and can be expanded indefinitely in vitro. In vitro differentiation of ESCs with specific growth factors or small molecules can enrich the pool of ESC-derived cardiac cells available for transplantation.
3. Both pluripotent ESCs and committed ESC-derived cardiac cells have shown promising results in rodent models, but concerns regarding teratoma formation, graft-versus-host disease, and bioethics have hindered clinical trials. Recent discoveries in reprogramming adult somatic cells to yield ESC-like cells may help address these issues.
4. iPSCs can be generated from murine and human adult somatic cells by overexpressing transcription factors critical for ESC pluripotency. Non-integrating technologies and transferring fewer transcription factors have reduced the risk of tumorigenesis during the de-differentiation process.
5. Once established, iPSCs differentiate much like ESCs, yielding functional cardiovascular lineages in vitro and contributing to normal cardiovascular development in vivo. IPSCs have successfully restored myocardial structure and function in mice, suggesting their potential as an unlimited supply of autologous donor cells.
6. MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes under normal conditions but can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes under special conditions. MSCs can be rapidly expanded in culture, allowing for autologous transplantation, and may be less immunogenic than other cell populations, enabling allogenic transplantation.
7. However, MSCs' propensity to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues currently limits their use. Despite this limitation, at least one clinical trial has shown improved ventricular function after intracoronary infusion",0

It was first described in Austria and has since been identified in many salt deposits worldwide. Polyhalite is often associated with other minerals such as halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.
2. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, and later confirmed. It can be synthesized in laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C and can go up to 343°C.
3. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements significantly changes the dehydration reactions of polyhalite to higher or lower temperatures. Polyhalite forms early diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact with the precursor rock.
4. Polyhalite is stable between room temperature and 255-343°C, making it useful for absolute age dating in deciphering the geological history of a region. It is a minor but widespread and important constituent in the Haselgebirge evaporite succession in the Northern Calcareous Alps (NCA) of Austria and southern Germany.
5. Polyhalite occurs in three different types of occurrences and five different polyhalite types, as distinguished by Grgrey (1910) and Schindl-Neumayer (1984). Recent work has distinguished three main polyhalite microfabric types and another polyhalite microfabric type in pseudomorphic anhydrite cubes after halite hopper crystals.
6. Polyhalite occurs in polyhalite rocks and as vein filling with various fabric types, which also gave distinct Ar/Ar ages. The alpine Haselgebirge polyhalites formed at ca. 235-",0

2. Propofol, a widely used anesthetic, has antioxidant effects and ameliorates oxidative injury in various organs.
3. The study found that propofol at high doses affected the lipid profile in rodents, increasing total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol levels.
4. Additionally, propofol decreased HDL cholesterol levels in the rats.
5. The increased cholesterol level may be linked to increased alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity.
6. Propofol increased the levels of hepatic glutathione and the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase.
7. The increased activities of glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase may enhance the detoxifying potential of the liver.
8. However, propofol elicited a detrimental effect on the lipid profile, resulting in hypercholesterolemia and increased activities of serum creatinine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase.
9. The study suggests that the use of propofol in patients with cardiovascular or lipid disorders should be carefully reviewed.

2. The gonadotropin + androgen therapy appeared to be superior to androgen replacement alone, with significant differences in penis length, pubic hair, laryngeal prominence development, and normalization of testosterone level.
3. The investigation also found that the overall QOL score of IHH patients was positively correlated with the level of testicular volume and the developmental state of the external genital organs after treatment.
4. Network investigation has advantages such as including more participants, obtaining information more quickly and conveniently, and expressing sexual function and other private information freely.
5. However, network investigation also has disadvantages such as bias in patient selection and the use of layman's language for communication.",1

2. The teeth were cleaned and shaped using ProTaper Universal rotary files, and obturation was done by warm lateral compaction.
3. The teeth were kept for 30 days at 37°C and 100% humidity, then randomly divided into four experimental groups for retreatment.
4. ProTaper Universal RFS, ProTaper Next, WaveOne, and Self-Adjusting File were used to remove root fillings and residual filling materials.
5. The amount of debris extruded was determined by weighing the tubes before and after instrumentation, and the mean weight was computed.
6. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc test were used to determine the significant group with the alpha-type error set at 0.05.
7. The results showed that the Saf group was associated with the lowest percentage of debris extruded apically (12%).",1

The anterior and middle superior alveolar (AMSA) nerve block is a proposed anesthetic technique in maxilla that can achieve pulpal anesthesia from the central incisor to second premolar through a palatal approach with a single injection, and an expected anesthesia duration of 45 minutes to an hour using a computer-controlled injection system.
2. However, a controlled clinical study found that the anesthetic success rates of the AMSA nerve block technique using a conventional syringe for 30 Caucasian patients ranged from 17-66%, with anesthetic induction times ranging from 6-12 minutes and the duration of pulpal anesthesia ranging between 23-40 minutes.
3. The study also found that no patient obtained pulpal anesthesia from the second premolar to the central incisor and facial anesthesia, while 26.7% of patients had no anesthetic success in any of the experimental teeth.",1

Malaria is a significant public health issue in South-East Asia, including India, with the region contributing 2.5 million cases to the global burden, and India accounting for 76% of those cases. In India, 22% of the population lives in high transmission areas, 67% in low transmission areas, and 11% in malaria-free areas. A study published in The Lancet in 2010 reported that malaria causes 205,000 deaths per year in India before age 70 years.
2. A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in RS Pura Health Block of Jammu District in Jammu and Kashmir State in North India to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding malaria among inhabitants. The study found that while the majority of participants had heard of malaria and correctly associated it with mosquito bites, there was a lack of knowledge regarding malaria treatment. However, the overall attitude of the study population toward the use of bed nets and vector control program was positive.
3. The study also found that knowledge regarding causation of disease, its cure and prevention were high, but knowledge that malaria can be fatal was low. This may be due to less personal interaction with malaria patients and lower exposure to cases of malaria in the state. The study suggests that creating awareness across all socioeconomic domains and identifying possible bottlenecks is crucial for better preventive measures. The attitude toward malaria was positive, with most respondents labeling it as a serious health problem and consulting a doctor in case of a febrile child. However, only 15.5% knew chloroquine to be the best treatment for malaria, which could be due to low literacy in this rural population.",0
752,"1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have shown that the dynamic folding of the chromatin is crucial in regulating gene expression and DNA replication. The genome is organized into hierarchical structures such as chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), which exhibit specific long-range looping interactions. These structures can be dynamically regulated during development, and perturbations in folding units are associated with diseases and cancer.
2. TADs, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size, are stable units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions. TAD boundaries are enriched for certain histone marks, CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, and the timing of replication domains in human cells. In Drosophila, the combinatorial binding of different types of insulators is associated with the strength of the TAD boundary.
3. BRG1, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions and for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions. A recent finding indicates that BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength, and its loss affects nucleosome occupancy and higher order chromatin organization.
4. BRG1 knockdown in human mammary epithelial MCF-10a cells results in the differential expression of genes related to extracellular matrix and lipid synthesis and many long non-coding RNAs. ChIP-seq analysis of BRG1 demonstrated binding primarily at genic regions, and intergenic BRG1 peaks included super-enhancers. Comparison of control and BRG1 knockdown Hi-C data sets revealed that the majority of TAD boundaries were largely overlapping, but more than 10% of the TAD boundaries were unique to either the control or the BRG1 knockdown cells. The strength of the TAD boundaries was significantly reduced in BRG1 knockdown cells, resulting in a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions.",0

The study uses statistical modeling, specifically Poisson and negative binomial regressions with zero inflated, to model the number of failed courses and semesters in students at the Iran University of Medical Sciences. The study found that a unit increase in university average resulted in a decrease in the number of failed courses and semesters.
2. The study also found that the change of quota system from other systems to free quota system resulted in a decrease in the expected logarithm of the numbers of failed semesters. Additionally, the number of failed courses had a positive relationship with the logarithm odd of inflated zero, indicating that an increase in the number of failed courses resulted in an increased chance of having failed semesters.
3. In the regression of failed courses, the variables of gender and marital status had an inverse and positive relationship with the number of failed courses, respectively. In the negative binomial regression, the variables of bachelor level and the faculties of management and rehabilitation caused an increase in the number of failed courses.",1
754,"1. Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecdhfr) is a suitable system for studying how conformational changes can affect the active site electrostatic environment and enzyme catalysis.
2. Researchers used thiocyanate probes to analyze the electrostatics and degree of hydration of the microenvironments surrounding the probes in ecdhfr.
3. Experimental data showed changes in the active site electrostatic environment due to structural rearrangements, and mixed quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (qm / mm) analyses of classical molecular dynamics (md) simulations were able to reproduce the experimentally measured vibrational frequency shifts.
4. The electrostatic contributions from the active site microenvironments surrounding the probe were decomposed into the major components (individual residues and ligands).
5. The qm / mm calculations allowed for the examination of the electric field along the hydride transfer pathway between the substrate and cofactor.
6. The study of ecdhfr provided valuable insights into the interplay between electrostatic and conformational changes along the catalytic cycle.
7. The two native cysteines in wild-type ecdhfr were mutated to ala and ser, and selective incorporation of cysteine was achieved through subsequent mutations.

755,"1. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO). The SPIO's superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated allow MPI to provide high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios. Possible application scenarios for MPI include cardiovascular imaging and intervention guidance. However, the development of suitable MPI scanners and appropriate tracer material is necessary for this diagnostic and therapeutic pathway.
2. Resovist, an approved T2* contrast agent for MRI, is the most important benchmark material for MPI and remains the best performing commercial SPIO for MPI. Its pharmacokinetics, especially its half-life in blood, are important for cardiovascular MPI. Although the ideal characteristics of an MPI tracer are well understood, no MPI-specific tracer has reached the marketplace so far. Resovist has known drawbacks, such as a hydrodynamic diameter greater than 50 nm, which limits its in vivo distribution. The properties of SPIO greatly influence the quality and sensitivity of the entire MPI system, and an ideal tracer should exhibit SPIO with a homogeneously distributed iron core diameter of 30 nm, resulting in a relatively high hydrodynamic diameter and a shorter half-life in blood.
3. A study was conducted to evaluate the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), as it may differ significantly from the blood half-life in MRI. The study used two different versions of Resovist, distributed by Bayer Pharma AG in Europe and Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd in Japan. The results showed that the average MPI signal in blood declined to 30% of the baseline signal 5 minutes after injection, and within 30 minutes, the MPI signal was below the noise level of the MPS. The signal for Resovist from Bayer Pharma AG decreased to 39.7% of baseline after 5 minutes, while the signal for Resovist from Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd showed a rapid decrease to 20.4% of the baseline signal after 5 minutes",0
756,"1. Intracellular pathogens, like Leishmania, have evolved to coexist with host defense mechanisms. Studying the host response to Leishmania infection is challenging due to the general inflammatory response that occurs alongside pathogen-specific responses. This inflammatory response is driven by the complement cascade, coagulation pathway, acute phase response, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can affect phagocyte function.

2. To distinguish between pathogen-specific and general inflammatory responses, the authors propose using the transcriptomic response of uninfected cells exposed to inflammation as a baseline measure. Transcriptomic networks specifically observed in infected cells, but not in neighboring uninfected cells, would represent cell-intrinsic pathogen-induced changes. In a Leishmania infection model, the authors discovered that an RXRA-centered transcriptomic pathway is aberrantly maintained in infected Kupffer cells (KCs), leading to enhanced parasite survival. Pharmacological manipulation of RXR activity perturbed the transcriptomic network of infected KCs, enhancing their leishmanicidal activity.

3. The authors also identified transcriptomic networks restricted to uninfected cells, which could potentially benefit the host. The lack of these networks in infected cells might favor pathogen survival. The authors used four-dimensional intravital two-photon imaging to observe the fine membrane structure and lamellipodia dynamics of steady-state KCs in the livers of uninfected mice. They found that KCs exhibited small fluctuations in volume and surface area over time, while monocytes and neutrophils moved rapidly through sinusoidal spaces.

4. The early response of KCs to Leishmania infection is largely uncharacterized. The authors examined KC behavior before and after infection in live mice and found that injection of live, but not dead, amastigotes induced a rapid increase in the average shape factor and a decrease in velocity, indicating a cellular response to active infection. These changes were not observed following injection of dead amastigotes, suggesting that signals provided by infected KCs or the activation of serum-derived mediators of inflammation, rather than direct consequences of intracell",0
757,"1. The control of appetite is complex and involves both physiological and environmental factors. Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue, while more recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract or associated organs.
3. A new formulation proposes that aspects of body composition and energy expenditure regulate hunger and appetite, based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects.
4. This formulation aims to help understand the relative impact of biological and environmental cues on body weight, as an alternative to the molecular approach to appetite control.
5. The interplay between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI) has also been studied, with the hypothesis that any increase in EE will be met with an equivalent increase in EI.
6. However, experimental studies have shown no correlation between EE and EI in a single day, but a good correlation over two weeks, suggesting that ee from resting metabolic rate (RMR) could provide a tonic signal of energy demand.
7. Exercise can raise resting values of EE several fold, and have numerous physiological effects, including changes in gut hormone activity and nutrient absorption, which could influence appetite mechanisms.
8. Acute bouts of exercise do not lead to a consistent increase in food intake, but a partial compensatory response begins to appear when exercise is repeated over several days, with exercise raising average daily EE and generating a compensation in EI.",0
758,"1. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a commonly used material in prosthetic dentistry for denture bases due to its desirable properties and simple processing technique.
2. The conventional heat-polymerized PMMA resin method, while easy to process, can induce high processing stresses and result in dimensional changes and inaccuracies in the fit of the denture base.
3. Chemically activated resins, when compression molded, display less polymerization shrinkage and greater dimensional accuracy compared to heat-activated resins, but have higher solubility and inferior color stability.
4. The injection molding technique has advantages over compression molding, including reduced processing time, lower cost, and higher bond strength between denture teeth and denture base resins.
5. Surface treatments, such as grinding the glossy ground surface, painting the ground surface of the teeth with monomer, and cutting mechanical retention features, can increase the bond strength between acrylic resin teeth and denture base resins.",1

2. The UVR hazard during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel, which is the most commonly used welding method, tends to increase with welding current and depends on the type of welding wire, but the available data about the level of UVR emitted by GMAW is unreliable and insufficient.",1
760,"1. Microorganisms in extreme environments, such as those found in the foreland of Ecology Glacier in Antarctica, have the potential to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which are energy and carbon storage compounds. These PHAs can increase the survival capabilities of bacteria in extreme environments or when nutrient availability is poor.
2. PHAs are synthesized by many bacteria and archaea and are divided into two groups based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units: short-chain-length (SCL-PHAs) and medium-chain-length (MCL-PHAs). The surface of PHA granules is coated with phospholipids and proteins, and the type of PHA produced depends on the metabolic pathway of the particular microorganism.
3. In a study of five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream in the foreland of Ecology Glacier, 50 bacterial isolates were characterized by sequencing a 1000 bp long fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. The isolated strains belonged mainly to the phylum of proteobacteria and represented classes beta, gamma, and alpha proteobacteria, as well as two isolates belonging to the bacteroidetes phylum.
4. The most frequently recovered group of isolates was members of the pseudomonas genus (7 isolates), and the second numerous group of isolates belonged to the janthinobacterium genus (5 isolates). PCR amplification using primers specific for PHA synthase genes revealed that six pseudomonas strains and two janthinobacterium strains possessed genes responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis.
5. Phylogenetic analysis of PHA synthase genes revealed that the DNA sequences of two janthinobacterium strains and two undefined betaproteobacteria strains were responsible for SCL-PHA synthesis, while all obtained DNA sequences of PHAC and PHAC1 genes were typical for genes coding for synthase responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis.
6. The statistical analysis of principal components (CCA) showed correlation between the presence of bacteria possessing particular PHA synthase genes and environmental conditions. Bacteria having genetic potential to synthesize SCL-PHA were found",0
761,"1. The reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands involves several categories of operations, with establishing vegetation being the most uncertain due to reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment.
2. Vegetation establishment is important for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing for productive reuse of land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape.
3. Natural rainfall can allow the establishment of robust native or non-native vegetation, but natives are now more recommended due to their long-term stability, resource value for wildlife, and better public acceptance.
4. Non-natives are currently less acceptable due to potential economic losses, increased wildfire risk, and other negative impacts. A mixed plant community is needed to maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation.
5. In southern Arizona, the likelihood of successful establishment of native perennial warm-season grasses was estimated using 31 years of historical rainfall event data.
6. Soil moisture was simulated using a land surface model with detailed long-term precipitation event data, data on moisture movement through the soil, and data on evaporation from the Santa Rita Experimental Range.
7. The specific practices selected for analysis included seeding on bare soil in southern Arizona, USA, with generic native warm-season grasses assumed to be in the top 0.1 cm of the soil when the monsoon rains began.
8. The soil type used in the simulations was a loamy sand, which was common in the region and the primary soil type on a nearby mineland reclamation site.
9. The analysis assumed that the native, warm-season (C4) grass seeds were in the soil from 0.1 cm deep and that they germinated when exposed to suitable monsoon conditions.
10. The results showed six times more potential for seeding success (68%) than was expected from the 10% estimate by Cox and Jordan (1983) for southern Arizona, indicating substantial potential for reclamation in most years.",0
762,"1. Major depression (MD) is a significant cause of disability and is projected to be the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. Approximately 60-80% of individuals with MD respond to available antidepressant medications, but up to 40% do not show satisfactory improvement. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a challenge in mental health care, and there is increasing interest in utilizing neuromodulation therapies (NTS) for its management.
2. NTS are designed to target specific brain circuits involved in the pathogenesis of MD, and they have a limited side-effect profile and minimal drug interactions compared to psychopharmacological therapy. Several NTS have been studied for TRD, including seizure therapies, noninvasive therapies, neurosurgical approaches, and new approaches on the horizon.
3. Seizure therapies, such as modified electroconvulsive therapy (MECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST), have been used in TRD. Noninvasive therapies, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and cranial electric stimulation (CES), have also been studied. Neurosurgical approaches, including vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), epidural cortical stimulation (ECS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS), have shown promise in TRD.
4. New approaches on the horizon, such as focused ultrasound (FUS), near-infrared light therapy (NIR), low-field magnetic stimulation (LFMS), and optogenetic stimulation (OS), are also being explored for TRD. These NTS have shown potential in modulating neural pathways linked with overactive subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG) glucose metabolism, which has been reported in MD and reduced with successful antidepressant therapies.
5. DBS has been reported to modulate neural pathways linked with SCG in relieving MD, and antidepressant effects have been found when DBS targeted ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) in patients with severe OCD and MD. Other studies have reported improvement in both depression and tardive dyskinesia (TD)",0
763,"1. Small RNA molecules are crucial in regulating various molecular and biological activities in the cell, with short RNA sequences playing a critical role in targeted gene expression regulation through a mechanism called RNA interference (RNAi).
2. Double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can knock down expression levels via the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates degradation or translational inhibition of the targeted mRNAs.
3. RNAi can also modulate gene transcription itself, and in fission yeast, homologs of the RNA-induced silencing complex regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNA.
4. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells, while in human cells, short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level.
5. This phenomenon, called RNA activation (RNAA), has been conserved in other mammalian species, and promoter-targeted small hairpin RNAs have been shown to efficiently upregulate genes in vivo.
6. To design sarna candidates for activation of specific cellular genes, researchers developed a novel bioinformatic approach focusing on the klf4 gene on chromosome 9 and the c-myc gene on chromosome 8.
7. They identified potential antisense transcripts from the klf4 and c-myc loci and designed short sense RNAs to potentially bind and degrade antisense RNAs generated from the two candidate sequences.
8. These sarna candidates were tested for their ability to upregulate the targeted reprogramming factors, klf4 and c-myc, in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
9. The effects of sarna transfection on endogenous gene expression profiles were compared with those resulting from lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of the exogenous klf4 and c-myc transgenes.
10. The results indicate that sarna shows significant potential as a tool for studying stem cell biology and a safe method to manipulate stem cell gene",0

Urinary tract obstruction is characterized by tubular atrophy or dilation, tubular cell death by apoptosis and necrosis, interstitial leukocyte infiltration, and increased interstitial matrix deposition.
2. Such an obstruction might be observed after benign prostatic hyperplasia, renal, ureteral, or bladder calculi, urethral stricture, and neoplasm of the bladder, prostate, or urethra. The hydrostatic pressure resulting from the blockage initiates renal injuries.
3. The injuries are characterized by tubular dilatation or atrophy, inflammatory infiltration of leucocytes, fibroblast activation, proliferation, increase in matrix proteins, and progressive interstitial fibrosis with the loss of renal parenchyma.
4. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is an experimental rat model of renal injury that imitates the process of obstructive nephropathy in an accelerated manner. Evidence supports a key role of the inflammatory process in the renal structural changes that occur after uropathy.
5. Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is an organic acid and a major component of the bile, which has been shown to have beneficial effects on the renal fibrosis that occurs after cisplatin-induced injuries, diabetic nephropathy, and age-related renal changes.
6. It also plays an important role in some biochemical and physiological processes in the kidney, such as ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, renal vascular endothelial function, and antioxidant properties (especially in the glomerulus).
7. Taurine has been shown to play an important role in four different forms of kidney diseases: glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, chronic renal failure, and acute kidney injury.

765,"1. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are crucial for the initiation of innate immune responses, which are necessary for protection against microbial infections. Upon sensing microbial components, PRRs drive the activation of transcription factors, leading to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, type I interferons (IFNs), and antimicrobial genes.
2. Autophagy, a bulk degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents into lysosomes, is involved in the innate immune response. Mice deficient in essential components of the autophagic machinery, such as ATG3, ATG5, or ATG7, die within one day of delivery, indicating that autophagy is essential for survival during neonatal starvation.
3. Autophagy plays a critical role in host defense responses by promoting the elimination of pathogens and the induction of acquired immunity. The rab7-dependent formation of bacteria-containing autophagosomes is critical for the killing of invading bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Coxiella burnetii, in nonphagocytic cells.
4. Autophagy also plays an indispensable role in antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells, a process essential for the induction of acquired immunity. MHC class II molecules are localized on autophagosomes, and the autophagic machinery promotes the presentation of viral and self-antigens by MHC class II molecules to antigen-specific CD4 T cells.
5. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified ATG16L1 as a candidate gene responsible for susceptibility to the inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's disease. ATG16L1 forms an 800-kd protein complex with ATG12-ATG5 conjugates, and the self-multimerization of ATG16L1 via its coiled-coil domain is required for the recruitment of this conjugate into an isolation membrane.

2. Betel nut chewing is associated with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a precancerous condition, and the incidence of OSMF and oral cancers has increased due to industrial manufacturing and marketing of chewable mixtures like gutkha.
3. The study of 63 oral cancer patients showed that most were in advanced stages, with a mean age of 61.20 years for males and 59.92 years for females.
4. The mean duration of betel chewing was 18.56 years for males and 20 years for females, with all patients changing to packaged panmasala and gutkha.
5. Betel nut and gutkha chewing, along with smoking, alcohol consumption, and working in tobacco processing factories, were the etiologies for all patients in the study.
6. The WHO and International Agency for Research on Cancer classify betel nut as a group 1 human carcinogen with sufficient evidence of increased risk of OSMF and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus.",1
767,"1. Patient blood management is becoming more important due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. These transfusions are also associated with severe postoperative infections, adverse effects, risk of transferring pathogens, high costs, and shortage of blood bank products. Postoperative severe bleeding is common following cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass are at an increased risk of postoperative bleeding.
2. Several studies have reported on the long-term mortality after transfusion with blood and blood products in cardiac surgery. Although not all studies report a higher long-term mortality after blood transfusion, the majority do. However, these reports are mainly from designated types of surgery or single center studies. The correlation between blood flow, oxygen delivery, and consumption together with hemoglobin can easily be visualized, and a decrease in hemoglobin must result in a compensatory increase in either cardiac index or oxygen extraction or a combination. Low cardiac output, low hemoglobin concentration, or low hemoglobin O2 saturation will result in an inadequate delivery of oxygen, unless a compensatory change occurs in one of the other factors.",0
768,"1. Neurogenesis, or the creation of new neurons, was once believed to occur only during embryonic life in mammals. However, recent research has shown that neuronal regeneration continues in specific tissues such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium after birth.
2. The olfactory epithelium, which contains neurogenic stem cells, has the unique ability to regenerate and recover even after significant damage, making it a promising area of study for neural regeneration and repair.
3. Researchers have long searched for an ideal cell with the properties of absolute totipotency and regenerability in vitro and in vivo for use in neural regeneration therapy.
4. Recent studies suggest that a complex of cells, including olfactory ensheathing cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and olfactory epithelial multipotent stem and progenitor cells, may be more effective for achieving maximum positive effects in neural regeneration.
5. The olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with possible neuropotency: globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs).
6. GBCs, in particular, have been shown to function as broadly multipotent progenitors capable of giving rise to neurons and all of the cell types of the epithelium, making them a potential candidate for neural regeneration therapy.
7. GBCs can be isolated and purified using specific antibodies and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and have been shown to engraft easily into damaged olfactory epithelium and give rise to most of the neural and non-neural cells present in the epithelium.
8. Olfactory epithelial cells are an ideal candidate for use in clinical research and therapy due to their accessibility, ability to regenerate completely without loss of function, and shared environmental niche and developmental hierarchy with neural cells.
9. Further research is needed to fully characterize the lineage and behavior of GBCs and other potential neural progenitor cells present in the olfactory mucosa, and to apply this knowledge to medical use for therapeutic treatment of diseases.",0
769,"1. The central nervous system (CNS) was once considered immune privileged, but it is now known that microglia play a crucial role in innate immunity within the CNS. A conduit enables communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes via the glymphatic system, facilitating immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid. This suggests that the CNS immune system is more active than previously thought.
2. Microglia are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and enter the brain during different developmental stages. They mature from primitive c-kit erythromyeloid precursors into cd45+ c-kit+ cx3cr1 immature (a1) cells and then into cd45+ c-kit+ cx3cr1 (a2) cells. Proliferating a2 cells develop into microglia and invade the developing brain, a process that requires matrix metalloproteinase activity. In the postnatal brain, microglia are maintained through cellular division or expansion of progenitors that colonized the brain during CNS development.
3. Microglia have multiple functions in the postnatal brain, including immune surveillance, initiating an inflammatory response, phagocytosing pathogens and apoptotic neurons, exerting scavenging actions on tissue debris under pathological conditions, recognizing apoptotic cells, refining synapses, and playing a role in angiogenesis. They also express voltage-sensitive ion channels and are thought to sense electrical activity pertaining to cortical spreading depression (CSD). CSD can initiate inflammatory activation of microglia, forming a positive feedback mechanism that favors the perpetuation of CSD induction. IGF-1 treatment and environmental enrichment can inhibit microglial CSD-generating activity, potentially ameliorating secondary brain damage resulting from cerebral ischemia.",0

Transposable elements (TEs) were once considered junk DNA, but they have been shown to serve as a genomic reservoir for new regulatory and coding sequences, allowing genetic innovation and organismal evolution. They can form new cellular protein-coding genes through molecular domestication.
2. In vertebrates, several gene families have been derived from a ltr retrotransposon gag gene, such as MART genes in mammals and ma/pnma genes in humans. These genes have essential functions in placenta development, control cell proliferation and apoptosis, and are involved in neurological disorders.
3. GIN genes, derived from gag genes of ty3/gypsy elements, have been molecularly domesticated in fish and amphibians. GIN1 is present in mammals, birds, and reptiles, while GIN2 is present in tetrapods, bony fish, and sharks, suggesting important conserved functions in vertebrates. GIN2 was lost in a common ancestor of monotremes and placental mammals, indicating that either its function was no longer essential or was taken over by GIN1.",0

2. These diseases can spread from cell to cell, amplifying and accumulating within the central nervous system, leading to a loss in life expectancy and quality of life.
3. Molecular chaperones play a central role in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, but during cellular stress, these chaperones can become overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins.
4. The ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy are responsible for clearing misfolded proteins, but when they fail, protein aggregates can form and cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function.

773,"1. Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 87% of stroke-related deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries. The genetic influences on ischemic stroke are likely to be polygenic, with multiple genes exerting a small influence on the phenotype.
2. Beta-adrenergic receptors (βARs) are a family of receptors that play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, which can lead to ischemic stroke. The two major non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the β2AR gene are located at nucleotides 46 (A>G) and 79 (C>G), causing changes in amino acid residues at positions 16 (Arg>Gly) and 27 (Gln>Glu) of the amino terminus and the fourth intracellular loop.
3. Studies have shown that the polymorphism in β2AR can lead to functional alterations in receptor function, influencing certain intermediate mechanisms for the predisposition of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
4. A meta-analysis of available published studies was conducted to determine the association of β2AR with ischemic stroke and offer early diagnosis of susceptible subjects. The search keywords used were 'bar', 'bar gene variant' or 2ar, 'beta-adrenergic receptor' or 'beta adrenergic receptor polymorphism', and 'cerebral infarction' or 'cerebrovascular accident' or 'ischemic stroke' or 'brain infarction'.
5. The inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis were case-control studies investigating the association between β2AR polymorphism and stroke, studies published in English with full text, and stroke confirmed by MRI or CT. The exclusion criteria were studies other than case-control design, studies that did not report genotypic and allelic frequencies, and duplicate publication.
6. Two investigators independently evaluated the title, abstracts, and search terms for eligibility based on the predetermined selection criteria. The relevant data from each study were independently extracted by two reviewers using a standardized, structured form.

Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), the removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, is a strategy used by women with BRCA1/2 gene mutations to reduce the risks of breast and ovarian cancer. However, the magnitude of risk reduction associated with RRSO in women with BRCA1/2 mutations is unclear.
2. A meta-analysis of 10 published reports found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. The summary risk reduction estimates provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies.
3. The meta-analysis identified 346 studies published between 1999 and 2007, of which 309 included the term ""BRCA1"" in the title and 267 included the term ""BRCA2."" Of these, 10 studies provided estimates of risk reduction due to RRSO and were included in the meta-analysis.
4. The meta-analysis used hazard ratios (HRs) and/or odds ratios (ORs) to estimate the pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers associated with RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
5. Eight studies estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were treated with RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment. Three nonoverlapping studies, which included 5703 participants, estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who received RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive the procedure.
6. Four nonoverlapping studies estimated the risk reduction associated with RRSO for breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.47 (95% CI = 0.35 to 0.64). Three nonoverlapping studies estimated the relative risk for breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.47 (95",0
776,"1. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa, characterized by a dense subepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes and degeneration of basal keratinocytes.
2. The interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17 axis, a newly discovered proinflammatory signaling pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, including OLP.
3. In OLP, both IL-23 and IL-17 are overexpressed, with the former being predominantly produced by keratinocytes in the epithelial layer of lesions.
4. The upregulation of IL-23 is associated with increased levels of IL-17 in the early stage of OLP lesion, promoting the pathogenic function of Th17 cells.
5. The IL-23/IL-17 axis may represent a new signaling pathway in the crosstalk between keratinocytes and CD4+T cells, contributing to the immunopathogenesis of OLP.
6. Further understanding of the role of IL-23/IL-17 axis in the pathogenesis of OLP may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for its prevention and management.",1
777,"1. The isolation of pure cell populations is crucial in both clinical and basic research, such as in the diagnostic test for HIV infection and in understanding the body's response to injury. Recently, the isolation of rare cells has become an active area of research, such as the identification of islet 1+ cells in mouse and human hearts, which can differentiate into cardiac cells. However, isolating these cells is challenging due to their small numbers and the need for robust and efficient methods.
2. Miniaturized cell separation devices offer several advantages over conventional techniques, including small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential integration with analytical techniques. These technologies are often derived from the semiconductor industry or advances in synthetic chemistry. Cell separation techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: size and density-based techniques and affinity-based techniques (chemical, electrical, or magnetic).
3. Size and density-based techniques rely on the physical properties of cells, while affinity-based techniques use specific interactions between cells and ligands. Microfluidic devices are commonly used in these techniques due to the micron size of cells and their handling in suspensions. Many of these devices incorporate nanoscale elements, such as magnetic separation techniques.
4. Purity and throughput are important metrics for any separation process, but it is often impossible to attain high levels of both. Several novel size-based separation processes are being employed in micro- and nanoscale devices, which are compact, simple, and usually do not require additional energy sources or equipment. These devices force a fluid containing a heterogeneous particle population through a series of channels or obstacles of varied size, ensuring laminar flow.
5. The main advantage of size-based approaches is that they do not require the presence of cell-specific markers or proteins to achieve separation, making them useful for isolating stem cells and other rare cells that do not express known markers. However, maintaining cell viability is a major concern with this approach. One technique for size-based separation uses an array of obstacles to sort particles based on their size and the width of the lane they are flowing in.
6. Another technique for size-based separation uses a series of channels of successively smaller width to act as a sieve, trapping larger cells in the larger channels and allowing smaller cells to pass through. This approach has been used to isolate rare cells, such as neuro",0
778,"1. A definitive diagnosis of cirrhosis is typically made through histological findings after a liver biopsy. However, due to the high incidence of viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, many patients undergo imaging examinations prior to a definitive diagnosis.
2. Several studies have shown that certain morphological signs can accompany cirrhosis and can be identified on routine clinical imaging examinations. These signs include the transverse diameter of segment 4, caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL), the right posterior notch (RPN), right lobar atrophy, porta hepatis enlargement, and expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF).
3. These morphological signs are the result of fibrosis accompanied by decreased blood flow within portal veins. The C/RL has been demonstrated to have a high specificity and accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis, and the size of the caudate lobe has been correlated with the hepatic functional reserve in cirrhotic patients.
4. The RPN and EGF are simple qualitative visual signs of cirrhosis and have shown high specificity and positive predictor value for the MRI diagnosis of cirrhosis. However, their low sensitivity means they are not routinely used in clinical practice.
5. A comparison between the C/RL, EGF, and RPN in cirrhotic liver has not been studied, and the purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare the diagnosis performance of these signs in diagnosing cirrhosis.
6. The study found that there was no statistical significant difference between C/RL and RPN (p=0.382) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis, but there were statistical significant differences between C/RL and EGF (p=0.000) and between RPN and EGF (p=0.010) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
7. The study also found that the interobserver agreement between the two readers was excellent (0.81; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.0) in the evaluation of the presence or absence of RPN and EGF, and there was a significant statistical difference of the diagnostic value of C/RL, RPN, and EGF between cirrhotic patients and control group (p<0.001",0

2. Participants underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations, including review of medical history, best corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, gonioscopy, dilated ophthalmoscopic examination, stereoscopic optic disc photograph, SD-OCT testing, and Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) standard 24-2 visual field testing.
3. Patients with any ocular or systemic disease that could affect the optic nerve or visual field were excluded. All patients had a diagnosis of glaucoma at baseline, based on repeatable visual field defects on SAP and/or glaucomatous optic neuropathy on optic disc stereophotographs.
4. Repeatable visual field defects on SAP were defined as at least three consecutive abnormal SAP results with pattern standard deviation (PSD) with p < 0.05, and/or glaucoma hemifield test results outside normal limits. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy was evaluated by masked assessment of stereophotographs and defined based on the presence of neuroretinal rim thinning, excavation, notching, or characteristic RNFL defects.
5. Healthy subjects were recruited from the general population or from the staff and employees at the UCSD. Healthy subjects had intraocular pressures less than 22 mmHg with no history of increased intraocular pressure and at least two reliable normal visual fields in both eyes.
6. For inclusion in the analysis, each glaucoma patient or healthy subject was required to have at least five visits (with five SAP tests and five OCT tests) over a follow-up duration of at least 2 years. The spectralis SD-OCT (software version 5.4.7.0) was used to measure peripapillary RNFL thickness.
7. All images were reviewed to ensure that the scan was centered, the signal strength was more than 15 db",0
780,"1. The healthcare industry faces challenges in improving access, cost, and quality of care, while research-based institutions experience reduced funding for research. This has resulted in fewer grants, discoveries, and talented researchers leaving the field.
2. Increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in fundamental research and development is crucial to address these challenges. Technological innovations have the power to enable disruptive changes in performance while reducing costs.
3. Successful innovation in healthcare requires navigating a long and challenging journey from unmet needs or discoveries to a viable commercial product or service. The so-called ""valley of death"" between academic research and commercialization is often cited as a key obstacle.
4. Financial investors are less willing to take risks and prefer opportunities where they can manage risks, such as implementation-related issues. Only teams with robust preparation and de-risking of both technology and market have a chance of attracting investors.
5. Universities and academic medical centers need to do more in preparing and supporting investigators interested in translating research into practice to compete successfully for research funding and attract the best investigators and students.
6. Adding a business development function to technology transfer offices (TTOs) can be effective but does not address the fundamental issue of improving the commercial readiness or attractiveness of technologies emerging from labs.
7. Creating programs to assist academic investigators in advancing technologies toward commercialization can help. These programs provide educational opportunities and hands-on skills development to help teams achieve a commercial exit.
8. Healthcare Commercialization Programs (HCPs) attempt to balance cost-effective advancement of a project into commercialization with building the skills of team members. Two recent examples are a modified version of the I-Corps program and the Coulter Foundation C3i program.
9. Effective HCPs differ from the I-Corps program and should address unique challenges facing healthcare innovators, such as buying dynamics, reimbursement complexity, regulatory pathway, culture, and funding requirements.",0

2. A study of patients treated for bladder cancer in a Polish hospital found that not all patients admit to smoking, and not all follow recommendations to quit smoking, with 18% admitting to active smoking and 4% unaware of the adverse effects of tobacco smoke exposure.
3. The study also found that detection of cotinine, a marker of exposure to tobacco smoke, in urine allowed for an objective assessment of medical history related to tobacco smoking, and monitoring of cotinine levels can effectively convey recommendations for quitting tobacco smoking.",1
782,"1. Anal incontinence (AI) is a common problem in women that can lead to hygienic issues, limitations in daily activities, and reduced quality of life. The prevalence of AI is measured through patient self-reporting, and there are no objective assessment methods.
2. Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is a leading cause of AI in nonpregnant women, and multiple vaginal deliveries can increase the risk of AI regardless of sphincter injury. Other risk factors include age, obesity, and medical conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and gastrointestinal disorders.
3. The prevalence of AI among women varies widely in previous studies and between different populations. Women with pelvic floor disorders and those attending gynecological outpatient clinics have a higher prevalence of AI. Community-based studies show differences in prevalence between age groups, with the highest prevalence among nursing home residents.
4. Few studies have assessed the prevalence of AI in a female population of fertile age, and even fewer have included nulliparous women. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for AI in an unselected female population across parity groups in the second trimester of pregnancy.
5. The study was conducted as a survey of pregnant women attending routine ultrasound examinations at the second trimester in a large university hospital in Oslo, Norway. The pregnant women attending the ultrasound screening in the hospital represent a nonselected population from the entire Oslo area.
6. The questionnaire consisted of 105 questions concerning AI and urinary incontinence, general health condition, drug use, and worries concerning pregnancy and delivery. Anal incontinence was identified by self-reported leakage of gas, loose, or solid stools, lack of ability to defer defecation for 15 minutes, use of pads or plugs, and alteration of lifestyle.
7. The study found that the prevalence of AI in the entire study group was 8.4%, and most women (80.3%) reported complete anal continence. Inability to control flatus was the most frequent complaint, reported by 18.0% of the women. Urinary incontinence was significantly associated with reported AI among all parity groups.

The study compares the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia performed with hyperbaric bupivacaine between normotensive and hypertensive patients who were scheduled for elective surgeries of lower abdomen, lower limbs, and perineum. The study found no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between the two groups, although more hypertensive patients (6/30) developed hypotension compared to normotensive patients (1/30).
2. The hypertensive patients had significantly higher systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure values at all measurement times compared to the normotensive group. However, heart rate values did not show a significant change compared to the basal measurements in either group. Six patients in the hypertensive group and seven patients in the normotensive group received atropine due to bradycardia.
3. The study also notes that previous cohort studies reported that hypotension due to spinal anesthesia was approximately twice as common in hypertensive patients. Intraoperative hypotension is associated with myocardial ischemia and increased stroke risk. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular diseases.
4. The number of hypertensive patients in the adult population in Turkey is estimated to be approximately 15 million (31.8%), and almost one-third is unaware of their condition. Despite advances in the definition and management of hypertension, there are only a few randomized controlled studies that have investigated the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia in these patients.
5. The study's limitations include not measuring the basal sympathetic activities of the patients, which is a significant factor in blood pressure regulation. The study suggests that an improvement in vascular structural changes and the achievement of a decrease in basal sympathetic activity with the use of effective antihypertensive treatment may explain why there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension between normotensive and hypertensive patients.",0
784,"1. Chronic pain and depression are common health issues in primary care, and their coexistence can be challenging to diagnose, with significant consequences for treatment outcomes. Numerous studies have found pain to be associated with limitations in daily activities, poor self-rated health, and increased prevalence of depressive disorders.
2. In primary care, 22-40% of all contacts are due to pain, and persistent pain is often comorbid with depression in both general and disease-specific conditions. Despite this, primary care physicians may underestimate the intensity of pain symptoms in patients with depression.
3. A study at Laegehuset Noerretorv in Grindsted, Denmark, aimed to determine the usefulness of Dolotest as a screening tool for depression in primary care for adults. Dolotest is a validated pain- and health-related quality of life assessment tool that measures the intensity of pain and its impact on various aspects of life.
4. The study included 715 patients who filled out Dolotest and Major Depression Inventory questionnaires. Results showed that women had a statistically significantly higher Dolotest score than men in the whole study population and the control group. Additionally, 16.1% of all patients met criteria for depression, with a statistically significant difference between genders in both the study and control groups.
5. The prevalence of patients with depression was higher in the study group (patients visiting due to pain) than in the control group for both men and women. For patients meeting criteria for depression, there was a statistically significant difference in all Dolotest domains between men and women.
6. A cut-off value of 65 on the Dolotest domain ""to what extent do you experience low spirits"" provides a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.95 for detecting patients who meet criteria for depression. This cut-off value also has a predictive value of 0.74 for detecting depression.
7. The study found that Dolotest is useful as a screening tool for patients' experienced pain and the impact of pain on their health-related quality of life, as well as a screening tool for patients meeting criteria for depression. The visual Dolotest profiles can facilitate communication about depression and pain, which is important since coexistence of these conditions can lead to reduced function, reduced work capacity,",0

2. HPV genotypes are grouped into high-risk and low-risk based on their potential to cause cancer.
3. High-risk HPV infections can lead to cervical cancer and other mucosal anogenital and head and neck cancers.
4. Low-risk HPV infections can cause benign or low-grade cervical tissue changes and genital warts.
5. A recent meta-analysis reported a global HPV prevalence of 11.7%, with the highest rates in Africa (21.1%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24%).
6. In Nigeria, the prevalence of HPV is high in all female age groups, with the highest rates in women aged 15-23 years.

Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium may help improve delirium recognition and care. A study investigated the biochemical parameters of patients with and without delirium.
2. The study found that patients with delirium had significantly lower mean levels of arginine and significantly higher mean phe/tyr ratios than those without delirium. Additionally, patients with delirium had significantly lower mean trp/lnaas ratios than those without delirium. No significant differences were found in hva levels between the two groups.
3. The findings suggest that patients with delirium have disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission and an increased status of oxidative stress. The study is the first to investigate bh4 status and levels of arginine and citrulline in acutely ill elderly hospitalized patients with delirium.
4. Further research is needed to confirm these results in a larger population and to explore the potential differences in the pathophysiology of delirium in patients with and without cognitive disorders. The study's findings may suggest that decreased bh4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and an increased status of oxidative stress may have played a role in the pathogenesis of delirium in the patient group.",0

2. A study was conducted to assess the knowledge of diabetes among the rural Karen residents and compare the diabetes knowledge between male and female respondents.
3. The study found that one-third of the sample population gave correct answers to diabetes-related questions, while two-thirds were unsure or gave wrong answers.
4. Public knowledge of diabetes among the Karen ethnic rural community is at the lower extreme, and female participants had a lower overall knowledge level compared to male participants.
5. The study also found that most of the Karen community did not know that elderly age, being overweight, and physical inactivity are risk factors for diabetes.
6. Lack of diabetes knowledge can cause missed diagnosis, late diagnosis, and higher incidence of diabetes complications.
7. A television education program in the local language and creating a peer-group gathering place for women may promote women's knowledge of diabetes and sharing of information.

793,"1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, including a higher prevalence of diabetes, than the general population. This increased rate is likely due to factors such as lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications.
2. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has led to the creation of health home programs, which aim to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions. These programs may be particularly beneficial for individuals with SMI, who face chronic impairments and difficulties.
3. A new behavioral health home (BHH) was created at the University of Maryland School of Medicine to focus on the use of population-based care to identify and address abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in individuals with SMI. It was hypothesized that the use of BHH services would improve early recognition of developing problems and provide access to preventative somatic care.
4. The BHH was embedded in the Division of Community Psychiatry, which consists of two large outpatient mental health clinics, an adult and child assertive community treatment team, and an adult psychiatric rehabilitation program. These settings serve 2000 individuals annually.
5. BHH referrals were made to patients who were considered to require the most assistance, determined by selecting persons with SMI who were enrolled in the more intensive assertive community treatment or psychiatric rehabilitation program services of the division.
6. Once enrolled in the BHH, patients received a minimum of two BHH services per month, coordinated by a nurse case manager. A wide variety of services qualified for BHH services, including care coordination, comprehensive transitional care, and health promotion.
7. A population-based health management program was created to target highly prevalent somatic conditions for individuals with SMI, such as diabetes and hypertension. This program involved monitoring specific health conditions for several consecutive months to better understand the population's care needs and the impact of interventions.
8. A total of 120 patients with SMI were enrolled in the BHH and receiving population-based health management services within 10 months of starting the BHH. Of these patients, 45% were not having their HbA1c levels drawn per the clinic's recommended guideline of having HbA",0
794,"1. Valerie Oppenheimer's theory on how men's socioeconomic position influences marriage formation emphasizes the role of men's economic position in demographic change, particularly in declining marriage rates and postponement of marriage. This perspective was not popular during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the decline in marriage was typically attributed to the growing economic role of women or value change.
2. Oppenheimer criticized both economic and cultural explanations for the decline in marriage, noting that there were no signs of an ""independence effect"" and that women with attractive economic resources were not less likely to enter marriage. She also pointed out that the majority of both single men and women still wanted to be married, and that anti-marriage ideology had not spread to a larger audience.
3. Oppenheimer presented an alternative explanation that focuses on men's economic position, arguing that the poor economic prospects of young men in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s contributed to the decline in marriage. She also developed the concept of a ""stopgap job,"" which refers to a temporary job that is not a reflection of an employee's educational credentials and is meant to be temporary.
4. Oppenheimer's theory has a more optimistic implication for the future of marriage, as female labor force participation is unlikely to decline and individualism does not appear to be receding. The economic position of young men largely depends on macro-economic conditions, and unemployment rates tend to have cyclical rather than linear trend patterns.
5. Oppenheimer's explanation can also explain the rise in cohabitation, as a man's failure to provide economically would be less of a problem for cohabitation than for marriage. Cohabitation can provide a way for couples to reduce uncertainty about future career prospects, and it has become a rational response to economic needs rather than the result of ideological change.",1

796,"1. Malaria is a major global health issue, caused by parasites in the genus Plasmodium, with the most prevalent species being P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. It is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, with Anopheles darlingi being the most prevalent species in Brazil.
2. The Brazilian Ministry of Health directs therapy and provides free antimalarial medicines, such as chloroquine and primaquine, to treat malaria caused by P. vivax or P. ovale. However, primaquine can cause hemolytic effects, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), resulting in discolored urine and faeces.
3. A study conducted in the municipality of Mâncio Lima in the western Brazilian Amazon found that after initiation of antimalarial treatment with chloroquine and primaquine, there was a significant reduction in fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain, but an increase in nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste, weakness, and hypochondrial pain.
4. Chloroquine can also cause side effects, such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and in rare cases, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms. Primaquine use can result in hemolytic anemia, which can occur in people without G6PD deficiency, but is more severe in those with the deficiency. The frequency of G6PD deficiency varies globally, and in Brazil, it is between 1.7% and 6.0%, with the african variant being the most prevalent.",0
797,"1. The human lifespan has increased worldwide, leading to a higher proportion of elderly people in the total population. In elderly men, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), erectile dysfunction (ED), and decreased libido often occur together. Several studies have shown a strong correlation between sexual dysfunction, increasing age, and the severity of LUTS.
2. The coexistence of sexual problems with LUTS and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) further affects quality of life. LUTS and ED share increased prevalence as age increases, and they are often synchronously present. The correlation between LUTS and ED may be due to overactivation of the autonomic nervous system, increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system, endothelial dysfunction in the prostate gland and corpus spongiosum, and hormonal imbalance.
3. Treatment of LUTS, a risk factor for ED, may improve sexual function in patients with BPH who concurrently have LUTS and ED. The primary treatment regimen for BPH is to administer alpha-blockers, which improve urinary flow rate and voiding symptoms. However, concomitant administration of alpha-blockers and anticholinergics may be more effective in improving LUTS and secondary sexual function in patients with LUTS/BPH. A study examining the effects on erectile function of a combination of the alpha-blocker tamsulosin and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin found no significant differences in sexual function between patients who received tamsulosin alone and those who received tamsulosin and solifenacin.",0
798,"1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be expressed in a cell type-specific manner, during specific developmental stages, and in disease states including cancer. In cancer, miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, with some being overexpressed and others lost. The miR-200 family, which includes miR-200c, has been implicated in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a normal developmental process that is also used by cancer cells to become more motile and metastatic. Zeb1, a transcription factor involved in EMT, can repress the expression of miR-200 family members, creating a double negative feedback loop that allows for plasticity between the epithelial and mesenchymal states.
2. The miR-200 family, including miR-200c, is thought to be expressed in an epithelial cell-specific manner in normal tissues. In cancer, the loss of miR-200c has been associated with chemoresistance and aggressiveness in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. Specifically, repression of tubb3, a common mechanism of resistance to microtubule-targeting agents, has been identified as the mechanism by which mir-200c restores sensitivity to paclitaxel. Additionally, not all cells exhibit the double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1, and this can be exploited to identify the distinct roles of mir-200c as compared to zeb1.",1
799,"1. The transobturator approach to treat female stress urinary incontinence involves the placement of a midurethral sling (MUS) through the obturator foramen. This approach was first described by Delorme as an alternative to the retropubic MUS placement to prevent complications. A similar transobturator passage using an inside-out approach was later described by de Leval to further reduce potential injury to the urethra and bladder. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence, including the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures.
2. Multiple studies have discussed the anatomical trajectories of both obturator approaches and confirmed their anatomical safety from a neurovascular perspective. However, traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the MUS configuration in relation to the urethra. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT scan image analysis after tantalum wire marked mesh slings were implanted in a series of cadavers.
3. The study found that the MUS tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior. The out-in MUS were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischiopubic ramus than the in-out MUS. Qualitative assessment of the images demonstrated a safe distance from the tapes to the obturator canal for both techniques. The mean full inner angle in a strict anteroposterior view formed by the in-out MUS measured 122 (95%CI: 107-136) versus 144 (95%CI: 131-151) for the out-in MUS (p = 0.02).
4. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory. This technique can be applied to different types of non-radio-opaque",0

Dr. David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, was invited to speak at the Children, Young People and Education Committee meeting regarding the impact of Brexit on higher and further education in Wales. He mentioned that uncertainty about relationships and arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. The HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located in the EU, such as EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding. There are signs that some relationships are beginning to become difficult in the UK sector, and potentially in the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. The financial impact of this uncertainty is hard to predict, but there will likely be turbulence for institutions as the deal and how it unfolds over the next several years is still unknown.

There is a decrease of 8% for EU-domiciled applicants and 9% for non-EU international students. This contrasts with a 2% increase for English institutions. The main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector include the funding position, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure, and uncertainty about potential consequences from the review in England of fees and funding. In terms of European Union students and enrolment, Wales is not forecast to do less well than England, but it is difficult to predict until the enrolments are made.
3. The committee discussed the main factors that led to the 8% or 9% drop in EU students applying to study in Wales. Dr. Blaney suggested that it is probably a combination of the change in student support arrangements for EU students and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to re-balance where the policy of investment goes. The other pressures include student recruitment, pay and pension costs, increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure, and uncertainty about potential consequences from the review in England of fees and funding. The committee also discussed the potential impacts of Brexit on the quality of work in higher education institutions and the academic quality of the work.
