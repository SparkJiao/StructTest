101_2,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `n` to the length of the array `arr`.
2. Iterate over the range of `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
    - For each `i`, iterate over the range of `j` from 0 to `n-i-1`.
    - Check if `arr[j]` is greater than `arr[j+1]`.
    - If `arr[j]` is greater than `arr[j+1]`, swap `arr[j]` and `arr[j+1]`.
3. After the loop, the element at index `k-1` will be the kth element in the array.
4. Return the element at index `k-1`.

1. Initialize `s` to the string `""PHP""`.
2. Initialize `ch` to the character `""P""`.
3. Iterate over the string `s`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Remove the first character from `s` and assign it to `s` (i.e., `s = ""PHP"" -> ""PHP""`).
    - Check if the first character of `s` is equal to `ch`. Since it is not, we don't update `s`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Remove the second character from `s` and assign it to `s` (i.e., `s = ""PHP"" -> ""PHP""`).
    - Check if the second character of `s` is equal to `ch`. Since it is not, we don't update `s`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.
    - Remove the third character from `s` and assign it to `s` (i.e., `s = ""PHP"" -> ""PHP""`).

    - For each character in the second string, check if it exists in the `count` list.
    - If it doesn't exist, add it to the `temp` list and increment `res_ind`.
    - If it exists, remove it from the `count` list.

1. Initialize `arr` to the given array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
2. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the length of `arr` minus one.
3. Iterate over the range of `low` to `high`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `low = 0`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `low = 1`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `low = 2`.
    - In the fourth iteration, we have `low = 3`.
    - In the fifth iteration, we have `low = 4`.
4. For each iteration, check if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`. If it is, return `low`.
5. If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, move `low` to `low + 1`.

228_2,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `num` to `1` (since `1` has `2` bits).
2. Iterate over the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
3. For each iteration, calculate `new_num` as `num & (1 << i)`, where `i` is the current index.
4. Check if `new_num` is `0`. If it is, return `True`.
5. If `new_num` is `0`, return `True`.
6. If `new_num` is not `0`, return `False`.

Let's start the iteration:
- For `l = 39` and `r = 4`, we have `l = 39` and `r = 4`.
- Calculate `new_num` as `num & (1 << 39)`.
- Check if `new_num` is `0`. Since `new_num` is `0`, return `True`.
- If `new_num` is `0`, return `True`.
- If `new_num` is not `0`, return `False`.

Since `new_num` is `0`, return `True`.

    - For the second element `arr[i+1]` (which is 20), check if it is even. Since 20 is even, we add it to `sum`.
    - For the third element `arr[i+2]` (which is 17), check if it is even. Since 17 is odd, we skip it.

1. Initialize `res` to an empty list.
2. Iterate over the list of tuples `test_list`:
    - For the first tuple `(1, 'Sai', 36)`, the result is `[36]`.
    - For the second tuple `(2, 'Ayesha', 25)`, the result is `[25]`.
    - For the third tuple `(3, 'Salman', 45)`, the result is `[45]`.

1. Initialize `res` to a tuple containing the elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
2. Iterate over the range of the length of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Update `res` by subtracting the element of `test_tup1` at index `i` from the element of `test_tup2` at index `i`. As a result, we have `res = (10 - 2, 4 - 5, 5 - 18) = (8, -1, -13)`.
    - Check if `res` is a tuple. Since `res` is not a tuple, we don't update `res`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Update `res` by subtracting the element of `test_tup1` at index `i` from the element of `test_tup2` at index `i`. As a result, we have `res = (8 - 2, -1 - 5, -13 - 18) = (6, -6, -21)`.

273_1,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `res` to a tuple containing the elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
2. Iterate over the range of the length of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Update `res` by subtracting the element of `test_tup1` at index `i` from the element of `test_tup2` at index `i`. As a result, we have `res = (11 - 2, 24 - 45, 3 - 16)`.
    - Check if `res` is a tuple. Since `res` is a tuple, we don't update `res`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Update `res` by subtracting the element of `test_tup1` at index `i` from the element of `test_tup2` at index `i`. As a result, we have `res = (11 - 45, 24 - 16, 3 - 2)`.
    - Check if `res` is a tuple. Since `res` is a tuple, we don't update `res`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.
    - Update `res` by subtracting the element of `test_tup1` at index `i` from the element of `test_tup2` at index `i`. As a result, we have `res = (11 - 16, 24 - 2, 3 - 3)`.
    - Check if `res` is a tuple. Since `res` is a tuple, we don't update `res`.

285_2,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `patterns` to 'ab{2,3}'. As a result, we have `patterns = 'ab{2,3}'`.
2. Initialize `text` to the input string. As a result, we have `text = ""abbbba""`.
3. Check if `text` matches the pattern. Since the pattern is 'ab{2,3}', we need to check if the input string contains at least two 'a's and at most three 'b's.
4. Since the input string contains 'b's, it does not match the pattern. Therefore, we return `False`.
5. Return `False`. As a result, we have `False`.

286_2,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `max_so_far` to `-2147483648` and `max_ending_here` to `0`.
2. Iterate over the range of `n*k`:
    - For each index `i` in the range, calculate `max_ending_here` as the sum of the current element `a[i%n]` and the cumulative sum `max_so_far + a[i%n]`.
    - If `max_so_far` is less than `max_ending_here`, update `max_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.
    - If `max_ending_here` is less than `0`, reset `max_ending_here` to `0`.

1. Initialize `number` to 8.

    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Update `index` by subtracting the second element of `ranges[i]` from `index`. As a result, we have `index = 0 - 1 = -1`.
    - Check if `index` is equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. Since `index` is `-1`, it is not equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. So, we don't update `index`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.
    - Update `index` by subtracting the third element of `ranges[i]` from `index`. As a result, we have `index = 0 - 2 = -2`.
    - Check if `index` is equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. Since `index` is `-2`, it is not equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. So, we don't update `index`.

304_2,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `ranges` to a list of lists where each inner list represents a range of elements in the array. For example, `ranges = [[0,1],[0,2]]` means the first range is `[0,1]` and the second range is `[0,2]`.
2. Initialize `rotations` to the length of the `ranges` list. As a result, we have `rotations = 2`.
3. Initialize `index` to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. As a result, we have `index = 0`.
4. Iterate over the range of `rotations`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Update `index` by subtracting the first element of `ranges[i]` from `index`. As a result, we have `index = 0 - 0 = 0`.
    - Check if `index` is equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. Since `index` is `0`, it is not equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. So, we don't update `index`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Update `index` by subtracting the second element of `ranges[i]` from `index`. As a result, we have `index = 0 - 1 = -1`.
    - Check if `index` is equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. Since `index` is `-1`, it is not equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. So, we don't update `index`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.
    - Update `index` by subtracting the third element of `ranges[i]` from `index`. As a result, we have `index = 0 - 2 = -2`.
    - Check if `index` is equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. Since `index` is `-2`, it is not equal to the first element of the first range in the `ranges` list. So, we don't update `index`.

1. Initialize `tuplex` to an empty set.
2. Initialize `tuple1` to the first element of the tuple.
3. Iterate over the remaining elements of the tuple:
    - In the first iteration, we have `tuplex = {w, r, e, s, o, u, r, c, e}`.
    - We check if `tuple1` is in `tuplex`. Since `tuple1` is not in `tuplex`, we return `False`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `tuplex = {w, r, e, s, o, u, r, c, e, s, o, u, r, c, e}`.

- Initialize `nums` to a list of the digits of `n`.
- Iterate over the list `nums` in reverse order.
- For each element `nums[i]`, check if it is smaller than the next element `nums[i+1]`.
- If `nums[i]` is smaller, remove it from the list and find the smallest element in the remaining list that is greater than `nums[i]`.
- Remove this element from the list.
- Sort the remaining elements in ascending order.
- Replace the first element of the list with",0,{}
408_0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `queue` to store pairs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Initialize `pairs` to store the result.
3. Initialize `i` to 0 and `j` to 0.
4. Iterate over the range of `k`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0` and `j = 0`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[0] + nums2[0], 0, 0]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[0] + nums2[1], 1, 0]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[0] + nums2[2], 2, 0]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[1] + nums2[0], 0, 1]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[1] + nums2[1], 1, 1]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[1] + nums2[2], 2, 1]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[2] + nums2[0], 0, 2]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[2] + nums2[1], 1, 2]` to `queue`.
    - Push the pair `[nums1[2] + nums2[2], 2, 2]` to `queue`.

412_0,"Let's think step by step.
1. Initialize `l` to the input list `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. Iterate over the list `l` using a for loop.
3. For each element `i` in `l`, check if `i % 2` is not equal to 0.
4. If `i % 2` is not equal to 0, add `i` to the `l` list.
5. After the loop, return the modified list `l`.

1. Initialize `res` to an empty string.
2. Iterate over the elements of `test_tup`:
    - For the first element: `res = res + str(test_tup[0])`
    - For the second element: `res = res + str(test_tup[1])`
    - For the third element: `res = res + str(test_tup[2])`
    - For the fourth element: `res = res + str(test_tup[3])`
3. Join the elements of `res` with a hyphen (`-`) and return the result.

1. Initialize `res` to a tuple containing the elements of both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
2. Iterate over the range of the length of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`:
    - For the first element of `test_tup1`, check if it is present in `test_tup2`. If it is, add the element to `res` and remove it from `test_tup2`.
    - For the second element of `test_tup1`, check if it is present in `test_tup2`. If it is, add the element to `res` and remove it from `test_tup2`.

1. Initialize `mul` to 1.
2. Iterate over the range of `n`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Calculate `mul` by multiplying `100` with the remainder of `100 % 11` and then taking the result modulo `11`. As a result, we have `mul = 100 * (10 % 11) % 11 = 100 * 10 % 11 = 100`.
    - Check if `mul` is greater than `n`. Since `100` is not greater than `11`, we don't update `mul`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Calculate `mul` by multiplying `10` with the remainder of `10 % 11` and then taking the result modulo `11`. As a result, we have `mul = 10 * (10 % 11) % 11 = 10 * 10 % 11 = 10`.

    - Check if `mul` is greater than `n`. Since `5` is not greater than `11`, we don't update `mul`.
    - In the fourth iteration, we have `i = 3`.
    - Calculate `mul` by multiplying `25` with the remainder of `25 % 11` and then taking the result modulo `11`. As a result, we have `mul = 25 * (25 % 11) % 11 = 25 * 6 % 11 = 25`.
    - Check if `mul` is greater than `n`. Since `25` is not greater than `11`, we don't update `mul`.
    - In the fifth iteration, we have `i = 4`.
    - Calculate `mul` by multiplying `35` with the remainder of `35 % 11` and then taking the result modulo `11`. As a result, we have `mul = 35 * (35 % 11) % 11 = 35 * 8 % 11 = 35`.
    - Check if `mul` is greater than `n`. Since `35` is not greater than `11`, we don't update `mul`.
    - In the sixth iteration, we have `i = 5`.
    - Calculate `mul` by multiplying `14` with the remainder of `14 % 11` and then taking the result modulo `11`. As a result, we have `mul = 14 * (14 % 11) % 11 = 14 * 3 % 11 = 14`.

1. We need to check if a number is octagonal.
2. To check if a number is octagonal, we can use the formula \( n = \frac{3 \times n^2 - 2 \times n}{3} \).
3. Rearrange the formula to solve for \( n \): \( n^2 - 2n = \frac{3n}{3} \).
4. Simplify the equation: \( n^2 - 2n = n \).
5. Move all terms to one side: \( n^2 - 3n = 0 \).
6. Factor the equation: \( n(n - 3) = 0 \).
7. Solve for \( n \): \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 3 \).
8. Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have \( n = 3 \).

1. Initialize `total` to 0.
2. Iterate over the elements of `data_list`:
    - For the first element, `element` is `7`. Since `type(element) == type([])`, we recursively call `recursive_list_sum` on the sublist `[10, [15, 14], [19, 41]]`. The result is `recursive_list_sum([10, [15, 14], [19, 41]]) = 7 + 10 + 15 + 14 + 19 + 41 = 105`.
    - For the second element, `element` is `10`. Since `type(element) == type([])`, we recursively call `recursive_list_sum` on the sublist `[7, [15, 14], [19, 41]]`. The result is `recursive_list_sum([7, [15, 14], [19, 41]]) = 10 + 7 + 15 + 14 + 19 + 41 = 105`.
    - For the third element, `element` is `10`. Since `type(element) == type([])`, we recursively call `recursive_list_sum` on the sublist `[10, [15, 14], [19, 41]]`. The result is `recursive_list_sum([10, [15, 14], [19, 41]]) = 10 + 10 + 15 + 14 + 19 + 41 = 105`.
    - For the fourth element, `element` is `10`. Since `type(element) == type([])`, we recursively call `recursive_list_sum` on the sublist `[10, [15, 14], [19, 41]]`. The result is `recursive_list_sum([10, [15, 14], [19, 41]]) = 10 + 10 + 15 + 14 + 19 + 41 = 105`.

    - For each character `i` in `strr`, add the ASCII value of `i` (converted to lowercase) to `summ`.
    - If `summ` is divisible by 26, return the ASCII value of 'z' (which is 122).
    - Otherwise, subtract `summ` from 26 and add 1 to `summ`, and return the result as a character (which is 'a' + `summ - 1`).
