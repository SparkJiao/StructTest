He then drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.

We are given that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, so R = 4W.
We are also given that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so S = R/2.
We are given that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, so S = 3 mph.
Since S = R/2 and S = 3, we have R/2 = 3, which means R = 2 * 3 = 6 mph.
Since R = 4W and R = 6, we have 4W = 6, which means W = 6/4 = 1.5 mph.
She travels for a total of 6 hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
Time spent running = (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.

3. **Calculate the total price increase:**  The price increases by $4 each time, so over 18 increases the total increase is 18 * $4 = $72.

4. **Calculate the final price:** The original price of $20 plus the total price increase of $72 gives a final price of $20 + $72 = $92.

1. **Determine the target total score:** Brinley wants an average of 93 after dropping her lowest score. Since there are six tests, and the lowest one is dropped, the average will be calculated based on the five highest scores.  So, her target total score for the five best tests is 93 * 5 = 465.

2. **Calculate the current total without the lowest score:** Brinley's lowest score so far is 71.  Her current total without the lowest score is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

3. **Calculate the score needed on the sixth test:** To reach her target total of 465, Brinley needs 465 - 367 = 98 points on her sixth test.

4. **Consider the scenario where the sixth test score is the lowest:** If Brinley scores lower than 71 on the sixth test, then that score will be dropped.  In this case, her current total of 367 would need to be 465. This is not possible. Therefore, she needs to score at least 71 to maintain her current lowest score. Since 98 is greater than 71, the sixth test score will not be the lowest.

We are given that two of the groups are equal in size, so let's say $n_1 = n_2$.
The third group, $n_3$, is the smallest and is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, $n_3 = n_1 - 10$ and $n_3 = n_2 - 10$. Since $n_1 = n_2$, we can write $n_3 = n_1 - 10$.

The total number of students is 200, so $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 200$.
Since $n_1 = n_2$, we can rewrite this as $n_1 + n_1 + n_3 = 200$, or $2n_1 + n_3 = 200$.
We also know that $n_3 = n_1 - 10$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
$2n_1 + (n_1 - 10) = 200$
$3n_1 - 10 = 200$

Next, we calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book:

Assuming 4 weeks in each month, the total cost for May was 4 weeks * $24000/week = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.  This means 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 employees left.

We are also given that there are 304 humps in total. Camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. So, we can write the equation:

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

The horse runs for 30 minutes, which is equal to 0.5 hours (30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour).  At a speed of 32 miles per hour, the horse covers 32 mph * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

2. **Calculate the amount of hay needed:**
The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.  Over 16 miles, the horse eats 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile = 8 bails of hay.

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay:**
Each bail of hay costs $3.  Therefore, 8 bails cost 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Let the cost of Jillian's handbag be $H$.

We are given that Jillian's shoes cost $80, so $S = 80$.
We are also given that the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost.
So, the cost of the handbag can be expressed as:
$H = 3S - 20$

We are given that $S = 80$. Substitute this value into the equation for $H$:
$H = 3(80) - 20$
$H = 240 - 20$

We are given that when $T_s = 450$, the actual temperature is $T_a = 468$.
The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is $468 - 450 = 18$.
The percentage error is given by
$$ \frac{T_a - T_s}{T_s} \times 100 = \frac{468 - 450}{450} \times 100 = \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = \frac{1800}{450} = 4\% $$
So the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature.

Now, let $T_s$ be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to when the recipe calls for 520 degrees. Let $T_a = 520$ be the desired actual temperature.
Since the oven is off by the same percentage, we have
$$ \frac{T_a - T_s}{T_s} = 0.04 $$
$$ T_a - T_s = 0.04 T_s $$
$$ T_a = T_s + 0.04 T_s $$
$$ T_a = 1.04 T_s $$
We want $T_a = 520$, so
$$ 520 = 1.04 T_s $$
$$ T_s = \frac{520}{1.04} = \frac{520}{\frac{104}{100}} = \frac{520 \times 100}{104} = \frac{52000}{104} = 500 $$

* **Equation 2 (heads):** s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.  From Equation 2, we can express g in terms of s:  g = 20 - s

Now substitute this expression for 'g' into Equation 1:

1. **Vaccines:** 2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40
2. **Heartworm Check Percentage:** The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. This means the vaccines represent 100% - 60% = 40% of the total bill.
3. **Calculating the Total Bill:** If $40 represents 40% of the bill, then 10% of the bill is $40 / 4 = $10.  Therefore, the total bill (100%) is $10 * 10 = $100.
4. **Heartworm Check Cost:** The heartworm check cost is $100 - $40 = $60.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After the purchase, he had 3 + o orange fish and 4 + w white fish.

The problem states that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  So, we can write the equation:

3 + o = 2 * (4 + w)

We can simplify this equation:

3 + o = 8 + 2w
o = 5 + 2w

Now we have two equations:

1) o + w = 17
2) o = 5 + 2w

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1):

(5 + 2w) + w = 17

    * Month 1: 10 * 2 = 20 students
    * Month 2: 20 * 2 = 40 students
    * Month 3: 40 * 2 = 80 students
    * Month 4: 80 * 2 = 160 students
    * Month 5: 160 * 2 = 320 students

3. **Calculate the increase:**  At the end of May, there are 320 students.  Since we started with 10 students, the number of *additional* students is 320 - 10 = 310.

811,"Felix made $105 during the week.  Since he charges $0.25 per branch climbed, we can find the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the price per branch.

Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25/branch = 420 branches

The problem asks for the average number of branches climbed *per day*. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches climbed by 7.

Average branches per day = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches/day

* **z:** amount of zest
* **f:** amount of fragrance
* **s:** amount of salt
* **u:** amount of sugar
* **o:** amount of oil

We know the following:

* **z = f:**  The amount of zest equals the amount of fragrance.
* **s = u:** The amount of salt equals the amount of sugar.
* **o = 2s:** The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
* **s = 2z:** The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.

The total volume of the scrub is 10 ounces.  Therefore:

z + f + s + u + o = 10

Now we can substitute to solve for the amount of oil (o):

Since z = f, we can rewrite the equation as:

2z + s + u + o = 10

Since s = u, we can rewrite the equation as:

2z + 2s + o = 10

Since s = 2z, we can rewrite the equation as:

s + 2s + o = 10

3s + o = 10

Since o = 2s, we can rewrite the equation as:

3s + 2s = 10

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so

931,"Let P be Peter's age, J be John's age, and L be Paul's age.
We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years.  So,
P + L + J = 100

We are also given that Paul is 10 years older than John. So,
L = J + 10

Finally, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages. So,
P = L + J

Now we can substitute the expressions for L and P into the first equation:
(L + J) + L + J = 100
2L + 2J = 100
L + J = 50

Since L = J + 10, we can substitute this into the equation L + J = 50:
(J + 10) + J = 50
2J + 10 = 50
2J = 40
J = 20

Now we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

And finally, Peter's age:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * Total population
Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50
Number of female porcupines = 30

Next, we find the number of babies born each month.
Number of babies born each month = Number of female porcupines * Number of babies per female
Number of babies born each month = 30 * 4
Number of babies born each month = 120

Now, we find the number of babies born in a year.
Number of babies born in a year = Number of babies born each month * 12 months
Number of babies born in a year = 120 * 12
Number of babies born in a year = 1440

Finally, we find the total number of porcupines after a year.
Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Number of babies born in a year
Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440

1. **Race 1:** Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Race 2:** He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.  Twice the amount he lost is $5 * 2 = $10.  Adding $1 to that, he won $10 + $1 = $11.

* **Understanding Depreciation:** Depreciation means the value of the car decreases over time.  A constant rate of 21% per year means that each year, the car is worth 100% - 21% = 79% of its value from the previous year.

* **Calculating Year-by-Year:**
    * 2007: $20000
    * 2008: $20000 * 0.79 = $15800
    * 2009: $15800 * 0.79 = $12482
    * 2010: $12482 * 0.79 = $9860.78

* **Using a Formula:**  A more efficient way to calculate this is using the formula:  $V_t = V_0(1 - r)^t$, where:
    * $V_t$ is the value after *t* years
    * $V_0$ is the initial value
    * $r$ is the depreciation rate (as a decimal)
    * $t$ is the number of years

In this case:

We are given that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.  This can be written as:

b = d + 18

We are also given that the total time taken to make the meal was 98 minutes. This means the sum of Betsy's time and Donovan's time equals 98 minutes:

b + d = 98

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) b = d + 18
2) b + d = 98

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Subtract 18 from both sides:

Price Mr. Rogers paid = 75% of $2000
Price Mr. Rogers paid = 0.75 * $2000
Price Mr. Rogers paid = $1500

Next, find the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for:

Price friend paid = 1.20 * $1500
Price friend paid = $1800

Now, find the discount Mr. Roger's friend received compared to the original price:
Discount = Original Price - Price friend paid
Discount = $2000 - $1800
Discount = $200

Finally, calculate the percentage discount:
Percentage discount = (Discount / Original Price) * 100%
Percentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100%
Percentage discount = 0.10 * 100%

1. **Distance to halfway point:** James's home is 4 miles from the store, so halfway is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

2. **Time to halfway point:** James walks at 4 mph, so it takes him 2 miles / 4 mph = 0.5 hours to get halfway.

3. **Time back home:** It takes him the same amount of time to walk back home, which is another 0.5 hours.

4. **Time to halfway point again:** After returning home, he walks back to the halfway point, which takes another 0.5 hours.

5. **Total time:** In total, James has walked 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.  He is now at the halfway point.  He still needs to walk the remaining 2 miles to the store.  This will take him 2 miles / 4 mph = 0.5 hours.  So the total time to reach the store is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 hours.

2. b = y - 7  (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
3. r + b + y = 37 (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

We can express everything in terms of 'b':

* From equation (2), we have y = b + 7

We are given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. So, R = W = P.
We are also given that half the mural is yellow, which means Y is half of the total paint used. The total paint used is 12 pints, so Y = (1/2) * 12 = 6 pints.
The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of each color: R + W + P + Y = 12.
Since R = W = P, we can rewrite the equation as R + R + R + Y = 12, or 3R + Y = 12.
We know Y = 6, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 3R + 6 = 12.
Subtract 6 from both sides: 3R = 12 - 6 = 6.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, meaning he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch.  This means each bottle of cognac costs $60 * 1.50 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

Next, let's convert the custodian's workday from hours to minutes.  They work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so their workday is 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.

Now, let's figure out how much time is spent cleaning each day. Since they have 5 days to clean all the classrooms, they spend 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes cleaning per day.

Finally, to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total workday and multiply by 100%: (240 minutes cleaning / 480 minutes workday) * 100% = 50%.

Let 'b' be the number of blueberry ice cubes Mary makes.

We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  We can write this as an equation:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116. This means the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116:

s + b = 116

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) b = 5s - 4
2) s + b = 116

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for 's':

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes (s = 20), we can plug this value back into either equation to solve for 'b'. Let's use the first equation:

b = 5 * 20 - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry ice cubes.
