        - If the length of `colorList[colorVertex[x-1]]` is greater than or equal to the length of `colorList[colorVertex[y-1]]`, merge the colors.
        - Otherwise, merge the colors.
11. Initialize an empty list `pathList`.

    - Initialize `val` to a set containing 0 and 200001.
    - Initialize `seg` to a list containing a tuple (0, 200001).
    - Iterate over the range of `n`:

        - Read the input values for `l` and `r`. As a result, we have `l = 1` and `r = 5`.
        - Add `l` and `r` to the set `val`. As a result, we have `val = {0, 1, 5, 200001}`.
        - Append the tuple `(l, r)` to the list `seg`. As a result, we have `seg = [(0, 200001), (1, 5)]`.
        - Continue this process for the remaining iterations.
    - Convert the set `val` to a list and sort it. As a result, we have `val = [0, 1, 5, 200001]`.
    - Create a dictionary `comp` where the keys are the elements of `val` and the values are the elements' index plus one. As a result, we have `comp = {0: 1, 1: 2, 5: 3, 200001: 4}`.
    - Iterate over the range of `n+1`:
        - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
        - Get the values of `l` and `r` from the tuple in `seg[i]`. As a result, we have `l = 0` and `r = 200001`.
        - Update the tuple in `seg[i]` to use the values from the `comp` dictionary. As a result, we have `seg = [(1, 4), (1, 5)]`.
        - Continue this process for the remaining iterations.
    - Initialize a list `deg` with zeros of length `n+1`. As a result, we have `deg = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    - Initialize a list `out` with empty lists of length `n+1`. As a result, we have `out = [[], [], [], [], []]`.

            - Get the values of `l`, `r`, `L`, and `R` from the tuples in `seg[i]` and `seg[j]`. As a result, we have `l = 1`, `r = 4`, `L = 1`, and `R = 5`.
            - Check if the range of `seg[i]` is within the range of `seg[j]`. Since it is, we append `i` to `out[j]` and increment `deg[i]`.
            - Continue this process for the remaining inner iterations.
        - Continue this process for the remaining iterations.
    - Initialize a list `ans` with a single element 0. As a result, we have `ans = [0]`.
    - Create a deque `deq` with the elements of `ans`. As a result, we have `deq = deque([0])`.
    - Iterate while `deq` is not empty:
        - In the first iteration, we have `v = 0`.

    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Try to append the index `i+1` to the list of values corresponding to `arr[i]` in `dict1`. Since `arr[i]` is `1`, we append `1` to the list of values corresponding to `1` in `dict1`. As a result, we have `dict1 = {1: [1]}`.

    - Continue this process for the rest of the elements in `arr`.
5. Initialize `ans` to 0.
6. Initialize `curr1` and `curr2` to 1.
7. Iterate over the range of `1` to `n+1`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Check if `i` is equal to `1`. Since it is true, we calculate the difference between the first and second elements of the list of values corresponding to `1` in `dict1` and add them to `ans`. As a result, we have `ans = 2`.
    - Update `curr1` and `curr2` to the first and second elements of the list of values corresponding to `1` in `dict1`.

- For `i = 2`:

    - Since `min(color1[3], color2[3]) = 0` is not greater than `X_list[1] = 1`, we set `color2[2] = min(color1[3], color2[3]) = 0`.
- For `i = 1`:
    - `child_list[1]` has one child, which is `2`.
    - Since `min(color1[2], color2[2]) = 0` is not greater than `X_list[0] = 4`, we set `color2[1] = min(color1[2], color2[2]) = 0`.

3. Initialize `ans` to `0`.
4. Iterate over each divisor `x` in `div`:
    - For `x = 1`:
        - Calculate the divisors of `x`. As a result, we have `div2 = [1]`.
        - Calculate the Möbius function for `x`. As a result, we have `mu = {1: 1}`.
        - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
        - For each key `y` in `mu`:
            - Calculate `pow(K, ((x//y)+1)//2, mod)*mu[y]`. As a result, we have `cnt = 2`.
        - Since `x` is not divisible by `2`, we don't multiply `cnt` by `pow(2, mod-2, mod)`.
        - Update `ans` by adding `x*cnt` and taking modulo `mod`. As a result, we have `ans = 1*2 % 1000000007 = 2`.
    - For `x = 2`:
        - Calculate the divisors of `x`. As a result, we have `div2 = [1, 2]`.

        - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
        - For each key `y` in `mu`:
            - Calculate `pow(K, ((x//y)+1)//2, mod)*mu[y]`. As a result, we have `cnt = 2 + 2 = 4`.
        - Since `x` is divisible by `2`, we multiply `cnt` by `pow(2, mod-2, mod)`. As a result, we have `cnt = 4 * 500000004 % 1000000007 = 2`.
        - Update `ans` by adding `x*cnt` and taking modulo `mod`. As a result, we have `ans = 2 + 2*2 % 1000000007 = 6`.
    - For `x = 4`:
        - Calculate the divisors of `x`. As a result, we have `div2 = [1, 2, 4]`.
        - Calculate the Möbius function for `x`. As a result, we have `mu = {1: 1, 2: -1, 4: 1}`.
        - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
        - For each key `y` in `mu`:
            - Calculate `pow(K, ((x//y)+1)//2, mod)*mu[y]`. As a result, we have `cnt = 2 + 2 - 2 = 2`.
        - Since `x` is divisible by `2`, we multiply `cnt` by `pow(2, mod-2, mod)`. As a result, we have `cnt = 2 * 500000004 % 1000000007 = 4`.
        - Update `ans` by adding `x*cnt` and taking modulo `mod`. As a result, we have `ans = 6 + 4*4 % 1000000007 = 22`.

4. Initialize `ok` to 0.
5. Initialize `cur` to 0.
6. Calculate `len` as the LCM of 7 and 3, which is 21.

    - In the first iteration, `i = 0`.
        - Check if `a[0]` is 0. It's not, so continue.
        - Decrement `a[0]` by 1 and increment `d[0]` by 1.

        - Check if `a[1]` is 0. It's not, so continue.
        - Decrement `a[1]` by 1 and increment `d[1]` by 1.

        - Update `cur` to 3.
    - Continue this process until `i = 20`.
8. Since `ok` is still 0, we enter the second part of the code.
9. Initialize `k` to a large number, `10**20`.
10. Iterate over the range of `0` to `3`:
    - Update `a[i]` by adding `d[i]`.
    - Check if `d[i]` is 0. It's not, so continue.
    - Check if `a[i] % d[i]` is greater than 0. It's not, so update `k` to the minimum of `k` and `a[i] // d[i] - 1`.
11. Update `k` to 0 if it's still `10**20`.
12. Iterate over the range of `0` to `3`:
    - Update `a[i]` by subtracting `k * d[i]`.
13. Initialize `iter` to 0.
14. Initialize `cur` to 0.
15. Enter a loop:

1. Read the input values `n`, `l`, and `u` as `3`, `[10, 10, 5]`, and `[5, 7, 2]` respectively.
2. Initialize `extra`, `pre`, and `t` lists with zeros of size `n`. So, we have `extra = [0, 0, 0]`, `pre = [0, 0, 0]`, and `t = [0, 0, 0]`.
3. Update the `t` list by calculating the cumulative sum of the `u` list. So, we have `t = [5, 12, 14]`.
4. Iterate over the range of `n`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Calculate the `index` using the `binary_search` function. The `index` value is `0`.
    - Update the `value` and `remain` based on the calculated `index`. So, we have `value = 5` and `remain = 10`.
    - Update the `extra` list based on the conditions. So, we have `extra = [5, 0, 0]`.
    - Update the `pre` list based on the conditions. So, we have `pre = [0, 0, 0]`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `i = 1`.
    - Calculate the `index` using the `binary_search` function. The `index` value is `1`.
    - Update the `value` and `remain` based on the calculated `index`. So, we have `value = 7` and `remain = 10`.
    - Update the `extra` list based on the conditions. So, we have `extra = [5, 7, 0]`.
    - Update the `pre` list based on the conditions. So, we have `pre = [0, 1, 0]`.
    - In the third iteration, we have `i = 2`.
    - Calculate the `index` using the `binary_search` function. The `index` value is `2`.
    - Update the `value` and `remain` based on the calculated `index`. So, we have `value = 2` and `remain = 5`.
    - Update the `extra` list based on the conditions. So, we have `extra = [5, 7, 2]`.
    - Update the `pre` list based on the conditions. So, we have `pre = [0, 1, 1]`.
5. Update the `pre` list in reverse order. So, we have `pre = [2, 1, 1]`.
