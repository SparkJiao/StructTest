Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experiences directed transport, driven by unbiased noisy fluctuations.\n3. Recent studies have focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.\n4. The behavior of nonlinear systems, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, is sensitive to system parameters.\n5. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model and showed that the current could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.\n6. Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals were not correlated with bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior, but rather related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.\n7. The authors of the source document investigate the impact of different ensembles of particles on the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet and find that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.\n8. They also find evidence for a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture, where bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter are associated with abrupt changes in the current.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

Feynman may have mentioned this idea in casual conversations around 1985, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates emerged only in the mid-1990s.\n3. Encoding information in spin offers potential advantages, including lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation.\n4. In 1994, a scheme for a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed.\n5. The proposed NAND gate operates based on the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of spins and the preference for spins to align with the magnetic field.\n6. However, these spintronic logic gates have a severe shortcoming that precludes their use in pipelined architectures due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction.\n7. A three-phase clock was proposed to enforce unidirectional flow of logic signals, but it presents significant fabrication and energy dissipation challenges.\n8. Quantum dots with a density of 10^13/cm^2 can be achieved today, but the minimum power dissipation per unit area for spin-based logic gates exceeds 3 kW/cm^2, which is a major challenge in heat sinking.\n9.

Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf (WD) primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary, with the secondary filling its Roche lobe and transferring mass to the WD through the inner Lagrangian point.\n2. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors lacks systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the so-called period gap) and has a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes, as seen in Figure [combined] (upper frame).\n3. Theoretical models have not been able to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.\n4. Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum reach a minimum period at around 58 minutes, but the observed distribution does not show an accumulation of systems at this period.\n5. The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star, while thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius.\n6. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and, in particular, by the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum (AM) losses.

Bell-nonlocality occurs when measurements violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality.\n3. EPR steerability is a weaker form of non-locality, where one party (Alice or Bob) can demonstrate steering by showing that correlations cannot be described by a local hidden state (LHS) model.\n4. Non-separability refers to states that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents.\n5. For bipartite states, the set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non-EPR steerable states, which is in turn a strict subset of the set of Bell-local states.\n6. The paper focuses on EPR steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals (T-states) when Alice can make arbitrary projective measurements.\n7. The authors construct a local hidden variable (LHV) LHS model that describes measurable quantum correlations for all separable and a large portion of non-separable T-states.\n8.

The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z boson tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Higgs boson decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand.\n2. The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the Higgs pole.\n3. Taking these achievements into account, the physics of the Higgs boson will again play the central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Higgs factory comes true with the generated Higgs events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP.\n4. This factory can be realized in the GigaZ option of the International Linear Collider (ILC) by adding a bypass to its main beam line.\n5. Given the high luminosity of the GigaZ, about 10^16 Higgs events can be generated in an operational year of 10^7, which implies that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of Higgs decay can be improved from 10^-3 at the LEP to 10^-5 at the GigaZ.\n6. In light of this, the Higgs boson properties, especially its exotic or rare decays which are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics, should be investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential in probing new physics.\n7. Among the rare Higgs decays, the flavor changing (FC) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics, and it was found that although these processes are severely suppressed in the SM, their branching ratios in new physics models can be greatly enhanced to 10^-5 for lepton flavor violation decays and 10^-4 for quark flavor violation decays.\n8. Besides the FC processes, the Higgs decay into light Higgs boson(s) is another type of rare process that was widely studied, e.g. the decay H -> hh with the particle h denoting a light Higgs boson was studied in the 2HDM, the decay H -> hh was studied in the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), and the decay H -> hh was studied in a model independent way in 2HDM and also in MSSM.\n9.

SLRI may have been injected into the presolar cloud or solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave, occurring as a single event that was spatially heterogeneous.\n3. Initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGUI) disk through large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles.\n4. Stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during early planet formation, possibly due to UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the outer surface of the disk.\n5. MGUI disks can explain the presence of refractory particles in comet 81P/Wild 2, which formed close to the protosun and experienced large-scale outward transport.\n6. The models presented examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula, by either a single-shot event or a continuous injection process, for various disk and central protostar masses.\n7. The models show that MGUI disks can rapidly homogenize isotopic heterogeneity, with the exact location of injection having little effect on the long-term evolution of the distribution.\n8. The dispersions in the outermost disks converge to similar values of 1-2%, while the dispersions in the innermost disks are significantly higher (10-20%), due to stronger mixing associated with cooler outer disks.\n9.

Later experiments using different reactions obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region absent in most cases, due to experimental precision and finite-size effects.\n4. Recent reevaluations of the ALADIN group's kinetic energies of emitted neutrons brought corrections of about 10%, and it was proven that the energies of the spectator parts grow with approximately 30% in the bombarding energy interval of 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon.\n5.

However, a more recent reanalysis of experiment has claimed to confirm the predictions.\n4.

Entanglement sudden death (ESD) of qubits under Markovian decoherence can occur, but entanglement can also revive after some time.\n4. Some studies indicate that ESD is not always the eventual fate of qubit entanglement, and finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit.\n5.

The distribution of entanglement among bipartite subsystems depends on the explicit properties of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.\n9.

The production of hadrons at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally described in two steps: a hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.\n2. The first step is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second step uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.\n3. Recent findings show that the fragmentation process is inadequate for producing particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions, and recombination of partons is a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.\n4. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.\n5. The shower parton distributions (SPDs) are determined by solving integral equations that relate them to the known fragmentation functions.\n6. The recombination functions (RFs) used in the equations depend on the square of the wave functions of the mesons, which are quantified in the valon model.\n7. The SPDs obtained are useful in problems where the knowledge of the fragmentation functions alone is not sufficient, such as the interaction between a jet and its surrounding medium or between particles within a jet, which are relevant in nuclear collisions at high energies.\n8. The basic hadronization process is recombination, even for fragmentation in vacuum, and the shower parton distributions obtained are model-dependent but useful for studying hadrons produced at intermediate transverse momentum.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

The @xmath0-invariance of Maxwell's equations was discovered a century ago, but quantizing the Maxwell field requires a gauge fixing condition, typically the Lorenz gauge, which breaks this symmetry.\n2. The paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of maintaining this fundamental symmetry when quantizing the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS).\n3. A classical @xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFS, so the paper suggests maintaining @xmath0-invariance during quantization in a CFS.\n4. The work confirms this assertion in the special case of the Maxwell field in de Sitter space, where a new and simple two-point Wightman function was found, having the same physical content as the Allen and Jacobson two-point function.\n5. The paper extends this to general CFS and clarifies the quantum structure of the formalism developed in the mentioned work.\n6. The paper uses Dirac's six-cone formalism and realizes all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6}}

The Dirac-K\u00e4hler formulation of fermionic field theory uses the antisymmetry of the product between differential forms to describe the Clifford algebra.\n3. To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, with the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit.\n4. Defining such a scheme has proven challenging, with difficulties exhibited by the Hodge star and the wedge product between forms.\n5. Several discrete schemes have been proposed to address these difficulties, with varying success.\n6. Becher and Joos used a lattice to define operators with many desirable properties, but they were non-local and required translation operators.\n7. Kanamori and Kawamoto also used a lattice and introduced a specific non-commutativity between the fields and discrete forms to fulfill the product rule, but they found it necessary to introduce a second orientation of form to maintain hermiticity.\n8. Balachandran et al. used a quantized phase space to regularize their system, leading to a fuzzy coordinate space.\n9. The authors of this paper build upon Adams' proposal, which introduces two parallel lattices to maintain the locality of the Hodge star and uses a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product.\n10.

The source document discusses the prediction of the Higgs boson mass in the Standard Model (SM) and models with physics beyond the SM, using global fits to precision measurements.\n2. The SM tree-level relation between the Higgs boson mass and other parameters is given by M_h = 2*M_W^2/(G_F*M_t^2), where M_W is the W boson mass, M_t is the top quark mass, and G_F is the Fermi constant.\n3. In models with Higgs particles in representations other than SM doublets and singlets, the SM tree-level relation no longer holds, and the theory requires extra input parameters when renormalized at one loop.\n4. The document presents two specific examples with tree-level contributions from new physics, demonstrating that the SM is not recovered when the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale.\n5. The possibility of a heavy Higgs boson consistent with precision electroweak data is considered, with the triplet model providing an explicit realization of this mechanism.\n6.

The document presents a new interpretation of GRB 090510 as a short GRB originating from the merger of a binary neutron star (NS) system.\n4. The analysis of the burst's prompt emission within the fireshell model allows for the determination of the inhomogeneities in the circumburst medium (CBM) and the estimation of an average CBM density.\n5. The gev emission in GRB 090510 is one of the most intense ever observed and is associated with the formation of a black hole (BH).\n6. The document considers accretion on co-rotating and counter-rotating orbits around an extreme Kerr BH to explain the gev emission.\n7. The self-consistency of the entire procedure is verified by estimating the cosmological redshift of the source, which is close to and consistent with the spectroscopically measured value.\n8.

The trace of the second fundamental form of a harmonic map vanishes.\n4.

The document mentions several approaches being developed to merge DMFT with LDA, including the development of an LDA+DMFT method, LDA++ approach, combined GW and DMFT theory, and spectral density functional theory.\n3.

The document states that ab initio DMFT based self-consistent electronic structure algorithms should be able to explore all space of parameters where neither dopings nor even degeneracy itself is kept fixed, as different states may appear close to the Fermi level during iterations towards self-consistency.\n5. The document mentions that realistic DMFT simulations of material properties require fast scans of the entire parameter space to determine the interaction for a given doping, degeneracy, and bandwidth via the solution of the general multiorbital Anderson impurity model (AIM).\n6. The document notes that present approaches based on either non-crossing approximation (NCA) or iterative perturbation theory (IPT) are unable to provide the solution to this problem due to a limited number of regimes where these methods can be applied.\n7.

A nonconstant meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface realizes the surface as a finite-sheeted branched covering of the Riemann sphere.\n2. Log-Riemann surfaces of finite type are certain branched coverings of the punctured compact Riemann sphere by a punctured compact Riemann surface, given by transcendental functions of infinite degree.\n3. The uniformization theorems for log-Riemann surfaces of finite type imply that such a surface is given by a pair (X, f), where X is a compact Riemann surface and f is a meromorphic function on the punctured surface such that the differential df has essential singularities at the punctures of a specific type, namely exponential singularities.\n4. Given a germ of a meromorphic function at a point of a Riemann surface, a function with an isolated singularity at that point is said to have an exponential singularity of that type if it locally satisfies a certain condition.\n5. The spaces of germs of functions and 1-forms with exponential singularities of a given type only depend on the equivalence class of the meromorphic function modulo germs of holomorphic functions.\n6. The uniformization theorems give us germs of meromorphic functions at the punctures, with poles of orders say n, such that near a puncture, the map f is of the form f(z) = z^n * g(z), where g is a germ of a meromorphic function near the puncture and z is a local coordinate near the puncture.\n7. The punctures correspond to ends of the log-Riemann surface, where at each puncture, an infinite number of infinite order ramification points are added in the metric completion.\n8. Certain spaces of functions and 1-forms on a log-Riemann surface of finite type were defined, giving rise to a de Rham cohomology group H^1(X, Omega^1(X)).\n9. The integrals of the 1-forms considered along curves in X joining the infinite ramification points converge, giving rise to a pairing between H^1(X, Omega^1(X)) and H_1(X, Z), which was shown to be nondegenerate.\n10. The spaces of functions and 1-forms defined were observed to depend only on the types of the exponential singularities, and so a notion less rigid than that of a log-Riemann surface was defined, namely the notion of an exp-algebraic curve.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10}}

The electronic structure of the interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance, and it is important to understand how charge transfers between these two parts and the energies at which these transfers take place.\n3. The quasiparticle (qp) description is a common way to calculate the addition and removal energies, but its adequacy depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (homo) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (lumo).\n4. Density functional theory (DFT) is commonly used to calculate these energy levels, but local and semi-local approximations of the exchange and correlation functional, such as the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), perform poorly even for the homo level.\n5.

Unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high mass galaxies, suggesting that some process must be able to stop or \"quench\" star formation before the galaxy grows too big. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are believed to play a role in this process by regulating the SFR through feedback mechanisms.\n2. The authors present a large sample of 313 Seyfert galaxies selected using ultra-hard X-ray observations with the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and imaged with Herschel/Spire. They focus on the overall luminosity distributions at the Spire wavebands and the Spire colors to determine the likely heating sources of cold dust in AGN host galaxies. They also look for correlations with a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity to potentially reveal any indication that AGN-heated dust is contributing to the FIR sed.\n3. The authors find that Seyfert 2s are detected at a higher rate than Seyfert 1s, and after accounting for upper limits, Seyfert 2s have slightly higher Spire luminosities than Seyfert 1s. However, the effect is small, indicating that the global FIR properties of AGN are independent of orientation. They also find that none of the Spire luminosities are well correlated with the 14195 keV luminosity, a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity, suggesting that the AGN is unlikely to be strongly affecting the 250, 350, or 500 \u03bcm emission.

The sticking of hydrogen atoms (H) onto dust surfaces can cool interstellar gas and form H2.\n4. H atoms can be weakly (physisorbed) or strongly (chemisorbed) bound to dust surfaces, with both states leading to H2 formation.\n5. In the ISM, PAHs are the main surface for H2 formation, with a significant part of the available surface area in the form of small grains or PAHs.\n6.

Recent investigations using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have revealed complex relationships between galaxy properties (such as color, luminosity, surface brightness, and concentration) and their environments.\n2. Galaxy clustering is a function of both star formation history and luminosity, with low luminosity galaxies showing strong clustering based on color, and luminous galaxies showing strong clustering based on luminosity. For red galaxies, clustering is a non-monotonic function of luminosity, peaking at both high and low luminosities.\n3. The study examines the scale dependence of these relationships, finding that the dependence of mean environment on color persists to the lowest luminosities explored, with red, low luminosity galaxies tending to be in overdense regions.\n4. At any given point of color and luminosity, a correlation function with a stronger amplitude implies a correlation function with a steeper slope.\n5.

The Orion dwarf galaxy is examined in this study to test whether DM density profiles arising in cold dark matter (CDM) numerical simulations are compatible with those detected in actual DM halos around galaxies.\n4. The Orion dwarf's kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored profile, making it critically important for investigating the nature of DM particles and the evolution of DM halos.\n5. The Orion dwarf's RC is well-fitted by a DM halo with a constant density core, rather than one that is centrally peaked, as seen in other dwarf galaxies like DDO 47.\n6. The Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) formalism, which advocates that the gravitational force leaves the standard Newtonian regime at low accelerations, is tested against the Orion dwarf's kinematics.\n7. The MOND formalism fails to reproduce the Orion dwarf's RC with the current literature distance and gas mass estimates, but it can be made consistent with the data by adjusting these values.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

Quantum technologies promise secure communication through Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), but require a new quantum-enabled telecommunications infrastructure.\n2. A quantum network will contain novel components like quantum memories, quantum repeaters, and quantum channels, which must operate strictly in a quantum way.\n3. The question is how much imperfection can be tolerated before a device is no longer operating in a sufficiently quantum way, and a minimal quantum requirement is to not act as measure and prepare channels.\n4. The goal of this work is to illustrate that device characterization via quantum throughput can be implemented in a meaningful way, using specific choices for device types and quantification measures.\n5.

Transverse spin fluctuations are gapless, low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, playing a crucial role in various macroscopic properties at low temperatures.\n2. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in two dimensions and the N\u00e8el temperature in three dimensions.\n3. The method described in the paper evaluates transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) broken-symmetry state, using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).\n4. The method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: (i) the pure model in two and three dimensions, (ii) spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and (iii) low-concentration impurities.\n5. The method allows for the determination of the critical vacancy concentration at which the AF order parameter vanishes, and it shows that the point where the AF order parameter vanishes nearly coincides with the percolation threshold.\n6. For the quenched impurity model with a random distribution of impurity sites, the method shows a net reduction in the spin fluctuation correction due to low-concentration impurities, with a substantial reduction in the averaged spin fluctuation correction.\n7. The local spin fluctuation corrections are enhanced on low-concentration impurity sites but suppressed on average, while for high-concentration impurities, the correction is suppressed on the impurity site and enhanced on average.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

Significant progress has been made within the context of a few prototypical models, such as the Caldeira-Leggett model and spin-boson model.\n3. The environment is often modeled as a bosonic bath, a set of non-interacting harmonic oscillators whose influences on the system are concisely encoded in a spectral density.\n4. The prevalent adoption of bosonic bath models is based on the arguments that knowing the linear response of an environment near equilibrium should be sufficient to predict the dissipative quantum dynamics of the system.\n5. Despite many important advancements in the quantum dissipation theory, more and more physical and chemical studies have suggested the essential roles that other bath models assume.\n6. The document briefly summarizes three scenarios where standard bosonic bath models fail to predict the correct electron transfer rate in donor-acceptor complex strongly coupled to some low-frequency intramolecular modes.\n7. Some past attempts to model such an anharmonic, condensed phase environment include using a bath of non-interacting Morse or quartic oscillators and mapping anharmonic environment onto effective harmonic modes with a temperature-dependent spectral density.\n8. Another prominent example is the fermionic bath model, where electronic transports through nanostructures involve particle exchange across the system-bath boundary.\n9. Recent developments of several many-body physics and chemistry methods, such as the dynamical mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory, reformulate the original problem in such a way that a crucial part of the methods is to solve an open quantum impurity model embedded in a fermionic environment.\n10.

The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POS) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics.\n6. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.\n7. Trace formulas, which relate the density of states (DOS) of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POS of the corresponding classical system, are important tools in semiclassical physics.\n8. A trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators was developed recently and successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and polymer microlasers of various shapes.\n9. However, typical microlasers used in references are three-dimensional (3D) systems, and while trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9}}

In standard cosmology, the acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at recombination serve as a \"standard ruler\" that can be accurately calculated using CMB anisotropy power spectrum measurements.\n2. This standard ruler can be measured at low redshifts in large galaxy redshift surveys to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.\n3. However, if CMB measurements are influenced by new, undetected physics (e.g., a new relativistic particle), the interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations could be biased.\n4. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly determines the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.\n5. The actual densities of matter and radiation do not affect the calculation of the sound horizon, only their ratio matters.\n6. The sound horizon depends primarily on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, which are both robustly measured in the CMB.\n7. The acoustic peak method for probing dark energy is robust because the CMB has good leverage on the redshift of matter-radiation equality.\n8. Other cosmological measurements, both at high and low redshifts, can measure the actual densities and constrain the presence of unknown relativistic species.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

Quantum information processing has gained significant interest due to the potential of quantum computers, which store and process information in quantum systems.\n2. The application of quantum computers includes secret communication (quantum cryptography) and the implementation of quantum networks and algorithms that are more efficient than classical ones.\n3. Many investigations focus on the transmission of quantum information from one party (Alice) to another (Bob) through a communication channel.\n4. The information is encoded in qubits, and if the qubits are perfectly protected from environmental influence, Bob receives them in the same state prepared by Alice.\n5. However, in realistic cases, the qubits have a nontrivial dynamics during transmission due to their interaction with the environment, causing Bob to receive a set of distorted qubits.\n6. Up to now, investigations have focused mainly on two subjects: determining the channel capacity and reconstruction schemes for the original quantum state under the assumption that the action of the quantum channel is known.\n7. The reliable transfer of quantum information requires a well-known intermediate device, and the knowledge of the behavior of a channel is essential to construct quantum codes.\n8. The article focuses on the problem of determining the properties of the quantum channel, which has not been investigated so far, with the exception of very recent articles.\n9.

Left-handed metamaterials (LHMs) have attracted attention due to their negative refractive index and various applications in optics and microelectronics.\n2. LHMs can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, and slow light propagation.\n3. In 1D disordered metamaterials, negative refraction suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths.\n4. The localization length in LHMs shows a sixth power dependence on wavelength under refractive index disorder, instead of the usual quadratic behavior.\n5. The authors numerically calculate the localization length of light in a 1D arrangement of layers with alternating refractive indices and thicknesses, introducing positional disorder.\n6. They analyze homogeneous stacks (H) of right-handed materials and mixed stacks (M) of alternating left- and right-handed materials.\n7. For H stacks, the localization length shows a quadratic dependence on wavelength at long wavelengths and saturates at lower values. It is modulated by transmission bands and decreases with increasing disorder.\n8.

For small @xmath0, LC describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass, but when @xmath0 increases, the spacetime becomes flat.\n4. Circular timelike geodesics exist only for @xmath7, becoming null at @xmath8 and spacelike for @xmath9.\n5. As @xmath0 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11, the Kretschmann scalar diminishes monotonically, vanishing at @xmath12, implying that the space is flat.\n6. For @xmath14, the spacetime admits an extra Killing vector, corresponding to plane symmetry, and test particles are repelled by the singularity.\n7. LC with @xmath14 has been interpreted as the gravitational field produced by an infinite sheet of negative mass density, but this interpretation is not conclusive.\n8. The absence of circular test particle orbits for @xmath16 may be due to the fact that the centrifugal force required to balance the gravitational attraction implies velocities larger than the speed of light.\n9. The acceleration of the test particle represents more suitably the intensity of the gravitational field, and it increases with @xmath0 in the interval (@xmath10, @xmath11).\n10.

Long chain macromolecules, particularly heteropolymers of biological significance, have been the subject of considerable study due to their ubiquity in nature.\n2.

The genetic information is coded by specific sequences of nucleic acids, which are then translated to the chain of amino acids forming a protein.\n4. The energy of the polymer is determined by various interactions between its constituent amino acids, including van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, and Coulomb interactions.\n5. These interactions cause the protein to fold into a specific shape, which is responsible for its activity.\n6. The large number of monomers making up such chains, and the complexity of their interactions, make finding the configuration of a particular molecule a formidable task.\n7.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by no hydrogen but strong silicon lines in their spectra at maximum brightness, are brighter than most other types, and exhibit uniform light curves, making them useful as standard candles for measuring distances to remote galaxies.\n2. A plausible explosion model for SNe Ia is the accreting white dwarf (WD) model, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from its companion star, increases its mass, and eventually explodes.\n3. Recent progress in the WD model includes the introduction of stellar wind from the WD while it accretes material, which has succeeded in sustaining stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.\n4. The model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel, which correspond to different types of companion stars.\n5. The identification of the companion star in the vicinity of the explosion site is crucial to confirm the evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia, and a G2IV star has been proposed as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR).\n6. A direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta involves observing absorption lines with broad blue wings in the star's spectrum, which can be caused by iron (Fe) in the ejecta.\n7.

Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) has seen advancements in theory and practical implementation, with systems like Gaussian-modulated and discrete-modulated coherent-state protocols demonstrated over tens of kilometers.\n2. The security of these systems, using Prepare-and-Measure (PM) implementation, has been confirmed by analyzing the equivalent Entanglement-Based (EB) scheme. However, traditional security analysis of the EB scheme does not consider the Local Oscillator (LO), which can be manipulated by Eve, leaving potential security loopholes.\n3. Monitoring LO intensity is necessary for security proofs in discrete QKD protocols embedded in continuous variables. Eve can exploit LO intensity fluctuations to reduce channel excess noise, making Alice and Bob underestimate her information.\n4. In this paper, the authors propose an attacking scheme exploiting LO intensity fluctuations and analyze the secret key rate with and without Bob monitoring the LO for reverse and direct reconciliation protocols.\n5. The fluctuation of LO can severely compromise the secret keys if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values.

The unification scheme of AGN explains the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN by angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region, often referred to as a \"dust torus\".\n2. The dust in the torus absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the received energy in the infrared.\n3. Type 1 AGN show significantly more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity, consistent with the picture where the face-on view onto the torus in Type 1 AGN exposes the innermost hot dust to the observer.\n4. The anisotropy in the infrared has some constraining power on our understanding of how the torus obscures the AGN, potentially distinguishing between models where the dust is smoothly distributed or arranged in clouds.\n5. A problem encountered when studying AGN samples in the local universe is a significant contribution of the host galaxy to the IR, which can be mitigated by using high-spatial resolution observations or high luminosity objects where the AGN outshines the host galaxy.\n6. The paper aims to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of the AGN emission in the infrared from a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars at z~0.5.\n7. The average SEDs of obscured (Type 2) and unobscured (Type 1) AGN are shown, with the radio galaxies systematically lower in infrared emission than the quasars, particularly in the near-IR.\n8. The anisotropy ratio between quasars and radio galaxies is plotted, showing a gradual decrease from 20 to 2 at wavelengths from 2 to 8 \u00b5m, with a slight increase within the 10 \u00b5m silicate feature, and becoming more isotropic at longer wavelengths.\n9. The intrinsic ratio between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN at 15 \u00b5m is found to be ~1.4, which should be taken into account when using IR-selected, flux-limited samples.\n10.

In the 1970s, many-body theory flourished, with a topic of interest being many-body effects on XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra from deep core levels in metals. Related effects included singularities near edges in absorption and emission spectra.\n2. The CB (conduction band) electrons can have various effects on the XPS peak from the core level. If the excitation is adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by the CB electrons leads to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy. However, the excitation is not adiabatic, and the excitation frequency is large compared to the frequency components taking part in the screening of the core hole. This results in shake-up effects in the form of single particle (electron-hole pair) excitations and collective (plasmon) excitations.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2}}

Soft X-ray transients (SXRTs) like Aql X-1, when in outburst, exhibit properties similar to persistent low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) containing a neutron star.\n2. The origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in the quiescent state of SXRTs is unclear, but one possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) turns on.\n3. Aql X-1 is the most active SXRT, with over 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts detected so far.\n4. The outbursts of Aql X-1 are characterized by a fast rise (5-10 days) followed by a slow decay, with a folding time of 30-70 days.\n5. The X-ray luminosity of Aql X-1 is in the range of 10^36-10^37 erg/s, and the spectrum is soft near the outburst maximum.\n6. During the early part of the outburst decay, the spectrum changes to a power law with a photon index of ~2, extending up to energies of ~10 keV.\n7. In quiescence, Aql X-1 has been observed at a level of ~10^31 erg/s in the 0.4-2.4 keV band, with a black body temperature of ~0.1 keV.\n8. The outburst of Aql X-1 in 1997 was monitored with the RossiXTE All Sky Monitor (ASM) and BeppoSAX narrow field instruments (NFIs).\n9. The sharp flux decay leading to the quiescent state of Aql X-1 is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts, but with obvious differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra.\n10. The outburst evolution of Aql X-1 presents important differences from low-mass X-ray transients containing black hole candidates (BHCs), such as a steepening in the X-ray flux decrease and a smaller luminosity range between outburst peak and quiescence.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10}}

The fundamental atmospheric and physical parameters of stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and age, are crucial for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the local group.\n2. Large spectroscopic surveys like SEGUE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO, and HERMES are used to infer the characteristics of different populations of stars in the Milky Way.\n3. Stellar parameters determined by spectroscopic methods are essential, with metallicity being the only way to accurately measure it, underlying photometric calibrations.\n4. Atmospheric parameters can be estimated from a spectrum in a consistent and efficient way, avoiding the problem of reddening inherent in photometry.\n5. The most common method for deriving spectroscopic atmospheric parameters is to use the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n6. However, systematic biases are present in such analyses due to the breakdown of the LTE assumption, with non-LTE (NLTE) effects being particularly significant at low metallicity and/or surface gravity.\n7.

The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied for several decades, with recent attention due to its importance in biology, particularly in DNA looping, which underlies genetic expression, replication, and recombination.\n2. Static tension significantly affects the looping time of semiflexible polymers, with a minute tension of 100 fn dramatically changing the looping time, especially for longer chains. This sensitivity is due to the cooperativity of the chain arising from chain connectivity.\n3. In the presence of dichotomically fluctuating tension, the looping time exhibits a resonant minimum at an optimal flipping time, which is a nontrivial extension of the resonant activation (RA) of a single Brownian particle. This effect is more significant for longer chains.\n4. The study's results are consistent with recent experiments for both static and fluctuating tension cases, suggesting that a biopolymer can self-organize optimally by utilizing ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations.\n5.

A class of insulators preserving time reversal symmetry is called topological insulators, characterized by non-trivial topological invariants.\n3.

The topological phases are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction, and all known topological insulators contain heavy or rare metal elements.\n5. Ubiquitous mutual Coulomb repulsions among electrons have been proposed to generate effective spin-orbit couplings, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI).\n6. The proposed TMI has not been achieved in real materials, and its stability against competitions with other orders and quantum fluctuations is not clear.\n7. The stability of the TMI and estimation of the critical value of interaction on the honeycomb lattice have mainly been considered by mean-field calculations, which cannot treat correlation effects satisfactorily.\n8.

Lanthanide-based heavy fermion (HF) materials are a major class of correlated electron materials that exhibit distinct behavior from conventional clean metals.\n2. Their behavior is driven by strong spin-flip scattering from essentially localized f-levels, generating a large effective mass and attendant low-energy scale indicative of strong interactions.\n3. The low-temperature state is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened f-spins.\n4. Physical properties of HFs are typically anomalous, with a resistivity that shows a strong non-monotonic temperature dependence and optics that exhibit rich structure from the microwave to the near-infrared.\n5. Theoretical treatments of HFs center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) and its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.\n6. The absence of exact results for PAM, save for some in one dimension, has led to the search for suitable approximation schemes, with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) being a major impact in recent years.\n7.

In quantum turbulence (QT) for quantum fluids such as superfluid helium and one-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), many quantized vortices with quantized circulation are nucleated, forming tangles. This situation is drastically different from classical turbulence (CT) realized in classical fluids because the circulation of velocity field is not quantized in this system.\n3.

Atomic BECs have various characteristic features, one of which is a realization of multi-component BECs. In this system, there exists not only a velocity field but also a (quasi) spin field. Owing to the spin degrees of freedom, various topological excitations such as monopole, skyrmion, knot, domain wall, and vortex can exist. Therefore, in this system, one expects novel turbulence, in which both the velocity and spin fields are much disturbed and various topological excitations are generated.

Multi-nucleon events, particularly two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations, are crucial for describing charge-changing quasielastic cross sections at typical neutrino energies.\n3. There's growing interest in incorporating 2p-2h models into neutrino event generators, with the IFIC Valencia model being the only one currently implemented in some generators like GENIE.\n4. The main challenge in implementing 2p-2h models is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved in evaluating the inclusive hadronic tensor.\n5. The authors present a fast and efficient method, the frozen nucleon approximation, to calculate inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic fermi gas model.\n6. This approach reduces the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1, making it well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux.\n7. The frozen nucleon approximation is validated by comparing the nucleon frozen approximation results with the exact calculation for the 2p-2h response functions.\n8. The authors conclude that the frozen nucleon approximation is a useful tool for implementing 2p-2h models in existing neutrino event generators.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

The paper discusses the accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the nucleus of galaxies as the source of activity in quasars and Seyfert galaxies, with a correlation between the mass of the SMBH and the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the galaxies.\n2. The reverberation mapping technique is used to estimate the mass of the black hole, with the size of the broad line region (BLR) determined by the time lag between the variations in the broad line flux and the continuum variations.\n3. The paper presents optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the low-luminosity AGN H 0507+164, obtained over a month-long campaign in November-December 2007.\n4. The observed time lag between the variations of the continuum flux and the H\u03b2 emission line is found to be 3.5 days, with a corresponding BLR size of 1.4 parsecs.\n5. The mass of the SMBH in H 0507+164 is estimated to be 1.2 x 10^6 solar masses, using the onken et al.

Broad emission iron lines are prominent features in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating near black holes due to the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc.\n2. The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in shaping these lines, determining the position of the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc.\n3. The Laor model, widely used for over two decades, assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, while newer models like KY allow the spin to be fitted.\n4. The aim of the paper is to compare the Laor and KY models using data from XMM-Newton and simulated data for the upcoming X- ray mission.\n5. Two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, exhibiting extremely skewed iron lines, are chosen for the study.\n6. The KY model provides a better-defined minimum for the best-fit value of the spin and more regularly shaped confidence contour plots, indicating smoother adjustment in the parameter space.\n7. The Laor model, however, tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.\n8. Correct re-binning of the data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution is crucial for obtaining statistically relevant results.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

The sound velocity in the fluid and the tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion are less than the velocity of light for all disks.\n4. The tangential velocity first increases with radius, reaches a maximum, and then decreases as 1/r for large radii in disks generated from the Schwarzschild and Buchdahl solutions.\n5. The sound velocity is a decreasing function of radius, except in the npv 2a solution with a specific parameter, where it reaches its maximum value at the boundary.\n6.

The possibility to directly manipulate and test the many-body behavior of a system of trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is attractive, with potential applications in quantum computation.\n4. The Mott insulator quantum phase transition is driven by the interplay of the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy, with the ratio of the on-site energy and the bandwidth forming the key parameter.\n5.

An anomaly in field theory occurs when a symmetry of the action or the corresponding conservation law, valid in the classical theory, is violated in the quantized version.\n2. This surprising feature of quantum theory was discovered by Adler, Bell, and Jackiw in 1969 and plays a fundamental role in physics.\n3. Physically, there is a difference between external and internal symmetries. The breakdown of an external symmetry is not dangerous for the consistency of the theory, but it provides physical explanations, such as the physical explanation for the K0 decay or the solution to the U(1) problem in QCD.\n4. On the other hand, the breakdown of an internal symmetry (i.e., gauge symmetry) leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory. The anomalous Ward identities destroy the renormalizability of the theory, and the unitarity of the S-matrix may be lost.\n5. To avoid such anomalies, severe restrictions are imposed on the physical content of a theory. For example, in the Standard Model for electroweak interactions, the existence of the top quark was demanded long before it was discovered.\n6. Gravitation, regarded as a gauge theory, also suffers from anomalies. The gauges are the general coordinate transformations (diffeomorphisms), the rotations in the tangent frame (Lorentz transformations), or the conformal transformations (Weyl transformations).\n7. In the quantum case, the classical conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor can be broken, leading to an Einstein anomaly, or an antisymmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor can exist, leading to a Lorentz anomaly, or the trace of the tensor can be nonvanishing, leading to a Weyl anomaly.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

The paper studies the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model with a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal, with a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process.\n3. Two schemes of observations are considered: observing only the proportion of time the perturbed signal is over the threshold, and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.\n4. The paper proposes two different estimators for each scheme and studies their asymptotic properties, showing that the estimators are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators.\n5.

A symmetric second-order tensor field is defined that serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.\n4. Quarks and gluons are confined to an anti-de Sitter (AdS) universe, having a finite radius in the flat space-time, and oscillate with a universal frequency independent of the flavor mass inside a closed universe.\n5.

Weak interactions were not contemplated in the original model, but electroweak for electromagnetism can be considered.\n8. The model does not easily allow for interactions between hadrons, but it can be simplified to compare its properties with measured cross sections and branching ratios.\n9.

The secondary transfers mass via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk around the compact object that gives rise to the observed X-rays.\n3. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems that can be divided into two groups: Z-sources and atoll sources.\n4. Z-sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and trace a Z-like shape in their X-ray color-color diagrams. They are thought to have mass accretion rates that reach the Eddington limit.\n5. Atoll sources have lower accretion rates and their color-color diagrams usually consist of fragmented island-like regions.\n6. The main physical difference between Z-sources and atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.\n7. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z-source and is therefore thought to be a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit.\n8. The optical counterpart of LMCX-2 was identified by Pakull in 1978 as a blue star.\n9. The orbital period of LMCX-2 is tentatively identified as 0.32 days, similar to the photometric period detected by Callanan et al. (1990).\n10.

In crystals, the essential degrees of freedom are electrons, ions, and the electromagnetic field, but for understanding certain properties, we work with heavy electrons, phonons, and their interactions.\n3. In QCD, the full nonquenched theory on the lattice is too complicated at the scale of 1 GeV, but the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important phenomenon for understanding the nucleon mass and low-energy properties.\n4. Light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting by the exchange of goldstone bosons, vector and scalar mesons, and subject to confinement.\n5. The chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to SU(3) by the QCD vacuum, leading to a nonzero quark condensate as the order parameter.\n6. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry results in the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by valence quarks.\n7. The constituent quarks and goldstone bosons are coupled with a strength given by the Goldberger-Treiman relation, and the constituent mass is generated by nonperturbative gluonic interactions.\n8. In the low-energy regime, the nucleon consists mainly of three constituent quarks with meson clouds, and the short-range part of the chiral interaction is crucial inside baryons.\n9. The long- and intermediate-range attraction in the two-nucleon system is produced by the Yukawa tails of meson-exchange interactions, while the short-range repulsion is connected to the nucleon structure and the specific interactions between constituent quarks.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9}}

The rail connector is designed to embody the beneficial features of conventional helical spring connectors while avoiding their undesirable aspects.\n4. The connector produces spring torsioning and dynamic uplift at the back rail through kinetic energy it stores, cooperating with any spring action in the seat base support assembly.\n5. It offers varying degrees of dynamic uplift resilience by providing alternative spring action modes within itself.\n6. The invention introduces seat spring-enhancing connectors that combine four essential seat-force-generators: torsioning, dynamic uplift, expansion-contraction, and leverage-amplification.\n7. These connectors produce four most desired seat-performance characteristics: initial-drop, deep-drop, softness without \"oil canning\", \"bucketing\", \"jack-knifing\", or \"bottoming\", and resilient uplift proportionate to load.\n8. Two related forms of rail connectors are produced: one using pre-stressed, close wound coil spring with attachment arms, and another using a pre-stressed, cantilever spring configuration.\n9. The first form's coil spring can be wound on an axis transverse or longitudinally arranged relative to the axis of spring expansion and contraction, with an optional leverage-amplified torsioning capability.\n10.

The invention relates to a method for preparing a solid device using an oxide superconducting material, focusing on improving the properties of the material at the surface or portion close to the surface.\n2. The method aims to provide a highly reliable surface utilizing-device by preventing the removal of oxygen from the surface portion of the superconducting material.\n3. The invention addresses the issue of oxygen deficiency in oxide superconducting materials, which can lead to a deterioration of characteristics and lowering of reliability at the surface or portion close to the surface.\n4. The method involves forming a blocking film (passivation film) over the spaces or micro-holes in the surface portion of the superconducting material to prevent oxygen removal.\n5. The blocking film is formed using a photo CVD method, which is superior in stepped coverage, at a thickness of 10 \u212b to 2 \u03bcm.\n6. After forming the film, oxygen is added onto the surface or portion close to the surface using methods such as ion injection or hot oxidation, and the entire body is heat treated.\n7. The films used for this purpose may be insulating films such as silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, oxidized aluminum, oxidized tantalum, oxidized titanium, or a metal or semiconductor which becomes an oxidized insulating film after oxidizing treatment.\n8.

The invention relates to methods of manufacturing semiconductor devices, particularly insulated gate field effect semiconductor devices with lightly doped drain (LDD) structures.\n2. A conventional method involves forming a gate electrode, injecting a low density impurity to create a source/drain region, depositing an oxide film, anisotropically etching the oxide film to leave a portion on the gate sidewall, and then injecting a high density impurity to complete the LDD structure.\n3. The conventional method has issues with controlling the width of the oxide portion on the gate sidewall and preventing the source/drain region from being etched away during anisotropic etching.\n4. The conventional method also requires high temperature annealing to recover the crystalline structure of the low concentration n-type region, which prevents the formation of shallow junctions and hinders device minimization.\n5. Another issue is that hot carriers may be injected into the oxide film portion on the gate sidewall during MOSFET operation, increasing the resistance of the low concentration n-type region and degrading the transconductance of the device.\n6. The invention aims to improve the controllability of the width of the oxide portion on the gate sidewall, enable the formation of an LDD structure using a low temperature process, and prevent degradation of transconductance and increases in resistances due to hot-carrier injection.\n7.

The federal government lacks reliable and comprehensive data to effectively manage and oversee these contracts, as the official procurement database is insufficient and agencies have varying reasons for establishing their own contracts.\n6. Duplication of effort and products/services among these contracts is a concern, with vendors and agency officials expressing concerns about increased costs and missed opportunities to leverage the government's buying power.\n7.

The aged dependency ratio, which estimates how many workers will be available to support each retiree, is expected to rise from 21 percent in 2000 to 35 percent by 2030.\n3. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is due to both the growing numbers of older persons and the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers.\n4. Several changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives for older workers to continue working, including the elimination of benefit reductions for working retirees and the increase in delayed retirement credits.\n5. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) promotes the employment of older persons and prohibits age discrimination, but evidence suggests that such discrimination still occurs.\n6. Older workers are less likely than younger workers to lose a job, but those who do are less likely to be re-employed and may face more prolonged job searches.\n7. Some employers are using flexible employment arrangements, such as part-time work, seasonal work, or consulting, to retain and extend the careers of older workers, but these programs are not yet widespread.\n8.

Medicare uses cost-based reimbursement contracts, does not expressly allow for profit, and has limitations on terminating contracts, unlike other federal programs.\n4. Medicare could benefit from reforms such as competitive bidding, specialization in specific functions, performance-based contracting, and more efficient termination of contracts.\n5.

PSAOs help independent pharmacies negotiate contracts with third-party payers or their PBMs, and third-party payers account for nearly 80% of drug expenditures.\n\n2. **PSAO Services**: PSAOs provide a range of services to independent pharmacies, with contract negotiation, communication, and help-desk services being the most consistent. They also offer other services like central payment and reconciliation, inventory management, and certification programs.

PSAO owners may operate PSAOs to benefit their other lines of business, but most do not require member pharmacies to use their non-PSAO services.\n\n4. **Antitrust Considerations**: While PSAOs create efficiencies by acting on behalf of multiple pharmacies, they must ensure their arrangements do not unreasonably restrain trade.

The commerce clause, 14th Amendment's Section 5, and 13th and 15th Amendments' Section 2 are potential constitutional authorities for hate crime legislation.\n5. The commerce clause allows Congress to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, but the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Morrison narrowed this scope.\n6. The 14th Amendment's Section 5 authorizes Congress to enforce the amendment's provisions, but it primarily addresses state action, not private conduct.\n7. The 13th Amendment's Section 2 may be a more viable option for expanding hate crime legislation, as it prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude and allows Congress to determine the \"badges and incidents of slavery.\"\n8. It's unclear whether violence based on bigotry constitutes a \"badge or incident of slavery\" and if the 13th Amendment's authority is limited to the descendants of those who experienced slavery.\n9. The 1st Amendment's freedom of speech clause and the 6th Amendment's right to a jury trial impose limits on hate crime legislation.\n10.

Kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb have been found in various motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination.\n5. Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, such as disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, or different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.\n6. The current study aimed to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb and examine the correlation between the two variables in stroke patients using a tracking and reposition sense test.\n7. The study found that stroke patients had lower accuracy in the tracking task and higher error scores in the joint reposition test compared to age- and sex-matched normal subjects.\n8. There was a significant negative correlation between motor and sensory deficits, indicating that stroke patients may have difficulty performing complex motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

Each MyoVa dimer consists of two N-terminal motor domains (heads) connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain.\n3. MyoVa's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms, resulting in 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.\n4. Calcium is required to activate MyoVa's ATPase activity, but high calcium (>1 mM) reduces motor processivity and may cause calmodulin dissociation from the lever arms, reducing their stiffness and efficiency.\n5. MyoVa can maneuver through actin intersections and travel along actin bundles in vitro, requiring sufficient structural flexibility for the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search.\n6. The study used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains.\n7.

The endothelium, the inner lining of blood vessels, plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular function by producing nitric oxide (NO) and other vasodilator substances. However, alterations in these processes, a feature of endothelial dysfunction, can lead to atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders.\n4. Oxidative stress and inflammation are key mechanisms involved in endothelial aging, and exercise can boost antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms to counteract these effects.\n5. Exercise training prevents and restores age-related impairment of endothelial function by restoring NO availability, preventing oxidative stress, and alleviating inflammatory processes.\n6.

The trial recruited 5,269 participants with IFG, IGT, or both, who were randomized to receive ramipril and/or rosiglitazone and followed for a median of 3 years.\n3. A substudy of 982 participants from Canadian study centers had oral glucose tolerance tests at baseline, after 2 years, and at the end of the study to assess changes in beta-cell function using the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.\n4. Rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI/IR and decreased PI/C over time, while ramipril had no significant effect on these measures of beta-cell function.\n5. Rosiglitazone's effect on diabetes prevention persisted after adjustment for baseline beta-cell function, but was modestly attenuated after accounting for the change in beta-cell function.\n6. The improvements in beta-cell function with rosiglitazone treatment may be due to reduced insulin secretory demand, amelioration of lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity, and inflammation, and maintenance of beta-cell proliferation.\n7. Ramipril did not have significant effects on beta-cell function compared to placebo, suggesting its glucose-lowering effects may operate through other metabolic mechanisms.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

The study investigated patients who submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA, comparing patient characteristics, diarrhea duration, antibiotics usage, and severity among three groups: toxin-positive stool, toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates, and toxin-negative stool and isolates.\n4. A total of 68 patients were included in the study, with 39 having toxin-positive stool specimens, 14 having toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates, and 15 having both toxin-negative stool and isolates.\n5. Patients with toxin-negative stool specimens had significantly shorter diarrhea duration (5.6 days) compared to those with toxin-positive stool specimens (10.6 days).\n6. Only one patient in the toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates group received CDAD treatment, and diarrhea duration in this group did not differ significantly from the dual-negative group.\n7. The study suggests that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens may have milder symptoms, even if toxigenic C. difficile is isolated from stool, and that severe symptoms are unlikely to develop at toxin concentrations below detection sensitivity.\n8. EIA directly measures toxin proteins in stool and has a high positive predictive value, making it an important test in determining treatment approach, despite its low sensitivity.\n9.

The study found that Ru was generally more effective than Captopril or Losartan alone in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal hearts, while in diabetic hearts, Ru was similarly effective as Captopril or Losartan. Dual therapies involving Ru were similarly effective as Captopril + Losartan therapy, while triple combination was generally the most effective strategy in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in both normal and diabetic hearts.\n3.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders caused by a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion.\n2. The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of all affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).\n3. The deficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes a decrease in negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to hyperplasia of the adrenal gland and subsequent diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens, causing increased virilization and a chronic hyperandrogenic state.\n4. There are different clinical forms of CAH associated with 21-OHD: classical CAH (both salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms) and the non-classical form, which may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of postnatal or even adult-onset hyperandrogenism.\n5.

The typical age of onset is between 2 and 5 years, with a male-to-female ratio of about 5:1.\n6. Prognosis is poor, with both seizures and cognitive outcomes being unfavorable.\n7. LGS is difficult to treat due to its encephalopathic nature and multiple seizure types, with many drugs losing effectiveness over time.\n8. Rufinamide is a novel anticonvulsant drug with promising potential for treating LGS, as it has shown efficacy in reducing seizures and is well-tolerated.\n9. Rufinamide has a good safety profile, with minimal expected side effects, and appears to have minimal drug-drug interactions.\n10. Further studies are needed to establish the role of rufinamide in the treatment algorithm for LGS and to compare its effectiveness with other drugs used for this syndrome.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10}}

A study was conducted in Yemen to examine the role of urethral plate character in the success of TIP repair among 100 children with primary anterior penile hypospadias.\n4. The study population was divided into two groups based on urethral plate width: >8 mm (Group A) and <8 mm (Group B).\n5. The urethral plates were also categorized as flat, cleft, and deeply grooved.\n6. Group B patients with urethral plate <8 mm had a statistically significant higher fistula rate (p=0.004) and failed 8Fr calibration rate (p=0.01) compared to Group A patients.\n7. Patients with flat urethral plates had a higher fistula rate and failed 8Fr calibrations, although not statistically significant.\n8. Overall, 8% of patients developed fistula, 12% had failed 8Fr calibration, and partial dehiscence occurred in 1 case (1%).\n9. TIP urethroplasty offers advantages such as preservation and utilization of the urethral plate, single suture line, creation of glandular and penile urethra, short operative time, and low complication rate.\n10.

The most prominent regioisomer, 14,15-EET, along with other members of this autacoid family, arises via metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, especially members of the 2c and 2j families.\n3. The ratio of EET isomers and their stereocomposition are CYP P450 isoform-dependent and, thus, species- and tissue-specific.\n4. Numerous chemical and metabolic factors complicate investigations into the roles of 14,15-EET and restrain its potential therapeutic utility.\n5. Its susceptibility toward aerial oxidation or auto-oxidation necessitates handling and/or storage under strict conditions that minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals.\n6. A precis of inactivating enzymatic processes includes esterification, metabolism by other pathways of the arachidonate cascade, conjugation, -oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide.\n7. In biological milieu, hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a major determinant in maintaining the steady state levels of 14,15-EET, whose half-life has been estimated at no more than seconds to minutes.\n8. Inhibition of sEH can elevate EET levels both in vitro and in vivo, offering an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes.\n9. However, this strategy might prove less efficacious than an agonist replacement therapy whenever endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised, for instance, as a consequence of disease, inflammation, radiotherapy, aging, and/or exposure to xenobiotics and drugs that inhibit cytochromes P450.\n10.

Complete removal of root canal fillings is challenging due to resistance offered by well-compacted fillings, which restricts access to the apical foramen and impairs disinfection and reshaping.\n3. Various instruments like hand files, engine-driven rotary retreatment files (RFS), ultrasonic tips/files, and heat-carrying instruments are used for retreatment, but complete removal of fillings is not guaranteed.\n4. Retreatment can push irritants into the periapical region, causing postoperative inflammation, flare-ups, and impaired healing.\n5. The current study aims to evaluate the extrusion of debris apically after using ProTaper Universal RFS and different finishing files for removing residual root canal fillings.\n6. The finishing files used were ProTaper Next (PTN), WaveOne (WO), and Self-Adjusting File (SAF).\n7. The study found that WO extruded significantly more debris, followed by PTN and SAF, with SAF exhibiting the least extrusion.\n8. All retreatment systems caused apical debris extrusion, with SAF instrumentation after RFS resulting in less extrusion than PTN and WO.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

The study evaluated the success rates of pulpal anesthesia with the AMSA nerve block technique using a conventional syringe in 30 adult patients, with an average age of 22 years.\n3. The anesthetic success rates ranged from 16.7% to 66.6%, with induction times between 6 to 12 minutes and duration of pulpal anesthesia ranging from 23 to 40 minutes. No patient obtained pulpal anesthesia from the second premolar to the central incisor, and no facial anesthesia was reported.\n4. The main theoretical advantage of the AMSA nerve block is the reduction in the number of injections and the quantity of anesthetic solution administered compared to conventional supraperiosteal infiltrative anesthesia.

TADs range from 100 kb to 1 Mb in size and exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions.\n5. TAD boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, limiting interactions between adjacent TAD domains.\n6. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, contributes to TAD boundary strength.\n7. BRG1 knockdown results in reduced nucleosome occupancy at CTCF sites, weakening TAD boundaries and increasing inter-TAD interactions.\n8.

The study compared the shear bond strength of denture teeth to two types of denture base resins: heat-polymerized (Meliodent) and autopolymerized (Futura Gen). The denture teeth were subjected to three surface treatments: untreated, treated with monomer, and treated with airborne particle abrasion.\n3. The results showed that the type of acrylic resin and the surface treatment significantly affected the shear bond strength, but there was no significant interaction between these factors. The control groups (untreated) had significantly lower bond strength than the treated groups, but there was no significant difference between the bond strengths of groups treated by monomer or airborne particle abrasion.\n4. The failure mode was predominantly mixed in the Meliodent groups, whereas adhesive failure was reported for Futura Gen specimens.\n5. The study concluded that treatment of the ridge lap surface of denture teeth by monomer or by airborne particle abrasion significantly improved their bond strengths to the denture base resins, with no significant difference between the two treatment methods.

The present research work helped to isolate and decipher numerous new facts about the GBCs in the olfactory epithelium of rats.\n8. Immunostaining of pure GBCs was positive with anti-NCAM, anti-nestin, and anti-SOX2, confirming that these cells contain intracellular proteins like NCAM, nestin, and SOX2 and are neural progenitor cells.\n9. Electrophysiological characterization of the isolated GBCs showed that they are unexcitable, with no voltage-gated Na+ channels and only leaky K+ channels present.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9}}

The lesions rarely undergo self-remission and may have malignant potential. Histologically, OLP is characterized by a dense subepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes, increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and the degeneration of basal keratinocytes. The lymphocytic infiltrate consists predominantly of T cells.\n2. The interleukin-23 (IL-23)/interleukin-17 (IL-17) axis is a proinflammatory signaling pathway that plays a major role in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, including OLP. The study found overexpression of IL-23 and IL-17 in OLP lesions, indicating that the IL-23/IL-17 axis may be involved in the local immune network of OLP. The overexpression of IL-23 in the progress of OLP lesion is associated with the increased expression of IL-17, particularly in the reticular OLP subgroup. IL-23 contributes to the induction of Th17 cells and the production of IL-17 in OLP. IL-17 selectively regulates the expressions of some inflammatory mediators in oral keratinocytes, indicating the selectively regulatory role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the immune network in OLP lesions.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2}}

These devices can be broadly classified into size- and density-based, and affinity-based (chemical, electrical, or magnetic) methods.\n3. **Size- and Density-Based Separation**: These methods, often used when specific markers are not known or cannot be used, include techniques like deterministic lateral displacement, cell sieving, and biomimetic microfluidic devices. They can separate cells based on size and density differences.\n4. **Affinity-Based Separation**: Affinity-based methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), adhesion-based separation, and electrophoretic separation, can achieve high specificity and throughput. They rely on specific markers or receptors on the cell surface.\n5. **Integration with Downstream Analysis**: Microfluidic separation systems can be easily incorporated with devices that perform downstream analysis, such as single-cell lysis and proteomic and genomic analysis.
