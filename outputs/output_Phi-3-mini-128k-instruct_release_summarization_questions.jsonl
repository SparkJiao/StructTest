This problem involves determining the parameters that characterize a quantum channel, which is a completely positive linear map transforming a density operator. The estimation is done by preparing quantum states, sending them through the channel, and measuring their outcomes. The quality of estimation protocols is quantified using statistical and fidelity-based cost functions.\n\n[parametrization]: The parametrization of quantum channels depends on the channel's features and the observables that can be measured.

For the phase damping and amplitude damping channels, the estimation is based on the frequencies of spin measurements along specific directions.\n\n[qubitpauli]: The estimation of the parameters of the pauli channel is discussed, showing that entangled qubits provide a better estimation than separable qubits.
