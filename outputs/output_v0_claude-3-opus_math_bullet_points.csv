- Initial cost of planting the lemon tree: $90
- Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each
- Annual revenue from selling lemons: 7 × $1.5 = $10.5
- Annual cost of watering and feeding the tree: $3

### 2
- To calculate the number of years it will take to start earning money, we need to find the point at which the total revenue exceeds the total costs
- Total costs include the initial planting cost and the annual maintenance costs
- Total revenue is calculated by multiplying the annual revenue by the number of years

### 3
- Let's denote the number of years as ""n""
- Total costs after ""n"" years: $90 + $3 × n
- Total revenue after ""n"" years: $10.5 × n
- To find the breakeven point, we set the total costs equal to the total revenue:
  $90 + $3 × n = $10.5 × n

### 4
- Simplify the equation:
  $90 = $10.5 × n - $3 × n
  $90 = $7.5 × n

### 5
- Solve for ""n"":
  n = $90 ÷ $7.5
  n = 12

### 1
- Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

### 2
- After the first month, she collected three times her initial number of cards.

**Step 2** Since both pools are leaking at the same rate (4 gallons/minute), we can set up equations for the amount of water in each pool at the initial observation and now.
- Small pool (4 minutes ago): x + 4t
- Big pool (4 minutes ago): 2(x + 4t)
- Small pool (now): x
- Big pool (now): 4x

**Step 3** We know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the amount in the small pool, so we can set up the equation:
4x = 2(x + 4t) - 4t

**Step 4** Simplify the equation:
4x = 2x + 8t - 4t
4x = 2x + 4t

**Step 5** Subtract 2x from both sides:
2x = 4t

**Step 6** Divide both sides by 2:
x = 2t

Calculate the weight of the redwood tree without termite damage:
- The tree is 200 feet tall
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds
- Number of 10-foot sections = 200 feet ÷ 10 feet = 20 sections
- Weight of the tree = 20 sections × 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds


### 2
Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by termites:
- Termites ate 30% of the wood
- Weight of eaten wood = 30% × 8,000 pounds = 0.3 × 8,000 pounds = 2,400 pounds

   - His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day
   - We need to find the total distance he covered in June (assuming 30 days)

2. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run daily
   - Additional distance = 1/5 × 5000 meters
   - Additional distance = 1000 meters

3. Calculate the new daily distance Tyson should run
   - New daily distance = Original daily distance + Additional distance
   - New daily distance = 5000 meters + 1000 meters
   - New daily distance = 6000 meters

4. Calculate the total distance Tyson covered in June
   - Total distance = New daily distance × Number of days in June
   - Total distance = 6000 meters × 30 days
   - Total distance = 180,000 meters

- The restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs and 50 tables with 3 legs


**Step 2** Calculate the total number of legs for tables with 4 legs
- Each table with 4 legs contributes 4 legs to the total

In May, the company hired 40 employees, each working 40 hours per week at a rate of $15 per hour.
To calculate the total amount paid in May:
- Number of employees in May = 40
- Hours worked per employee per week = 40
- Hourly rate = $15
- Weeks in May = 4 (assuming a full month)
- Total amount paid in May = 40 × 40 × $15 × 4 = $96,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, meaning 3/4 of the employees remained.
To calculate the number of employees in June:
- Number of employees in May = 40
- Fraction of employees whose contracts expired = 1/4
- Number of employees in June = 40 × (1 - 1/4) = 40 × 3/4 = 30

To calculate the total amount paid in June:
- Number of employees in June = 30
- Hours worked per employee per week = 40

- Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces.
- She cut the cake into 8 equal pieces.
- Rory and her mom each had one piece of the cake.


# 2. Calculate the weight of each piece
- Since the cake was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces.
- Weight of each piece = Total weight ÷ Number of pieces
- Weight of each piece = 20 ounces ÷ 8
- Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces


# 3. Determine the number of pieces remaining
- Rory and her mom each had one piece of the cake, so two pieces were consumed.
- Number of pieces remaining = Total pieces - Pieces consumed
- Number of pieces remaining = 8 - 2
- Number of pieces remaining = 6 pieces


# 4. Calculate the weight of the remaining cake
- To find the weight of the remaining cake, multiply the weight of each piece by the number of pieces remaining.
- Weight of remaining cake = Weight of each piece × Number of pieces remaining
- Weight of remaining cake = 2.5 ounces × 6

### 1
- Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount
- So, he will use 4 pounds of onions (2 pounds × 2)

### 2
- The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound
- The cost of onions will be: 4 pounds × $2.00 per pound = $8.00

### 3
- Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 per box
- The cost of beef stock will be: 2 boxes × $2.00 per box = $4.00

5. Calculate the total weight of all the feed
   * Total weight = Sugar cubes + Carrots + Hay + Oats
   * Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3,150 + 1,300 = 4,500 pounds

6. Calculate the number of trips needed
   * The farm truck can carry 2,250 pounds at a time
   * Number of trips = Total weight ÷ Truck capacity
   * Number of trips = 4,500 ÷ 2,250 = 2

Let's define the variables:
- Let `c` be the number of cookies Matt can have.
- Let `s` be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.


### 2
According to the given information:
- Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats.
- He can have two extra cookies for cleaning his room.


### 3
We can express the total number of cookies Matt can have as an equation:
- Total cookies = (Half the number of carrot sticks) + (Two extra cookies for cleaning his room)
- In mathematical terms: `c = (1/2) × s + 2`


### 4
We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we can substitute `c` with 5:
- `5 = (1/2) × s + 2`


### 5
To solve for `s`, we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
- `5 - 2 = (1/2) × s + 2 - 2`
- `3 = (1/2) × s`


### 6
Now, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate `s`:
- `2 × 3 = 2 × (1/2) × s`
- `6 = s`

**Step 1:** Determine the number of cups Judy bought.
- Judy bought a dozen cups.
- A dozen is equal to 12.

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of dishes Judy bought.
- Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups.
- Number of dishes = 2 × Number of cups

Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x. Then, according to the note on the jar:
- Red jelly beans = x - 1% of x = 0.99x
- Green jelly beans = x + 1% of x = 1.01x

### 2
We know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500. So, we can write an equation:
- Red + Blue + Green = 4500
- 0.99x + x + 1.01x = 4500
- 3x = 4500

### 3
Solve the equation to find the number of blue jelly beans:
- x = 4500 ÷ 3
- x = 1500
So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans in the jar.

### 4
Calculate the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans = 0.99 × 1500 = 1485
- Green jelly beans = 1.01 × 1500 = 1515

### 5
To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
- Difference = Green - Red
- Difference = 1515 - 1485 = 30

* For example, after 1 day, the height would be: 4 × 2^1 = 8 feet.

### 3
* Let's calculate the height for each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

  * Day 1: 4 × 2^1 = 8 feet
  * Day 2: 4 × 2^2 = 16 feet

1. Base price of the truck
   - The base price of the truck is given as $30,000.

2. King cab upgrade cost
   - The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500.

3. Leather seats cost
   - The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade.
   - One-third of $7,500 is $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500.

4. Running boards cost
   - The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats.
   - The leather seats cost $2,500, so the running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

5. Upgraded exterior light package cost
   - The upgraded exterior light package is given as $1,500.

6. Towing package cost
   - The cost of the towing package is not provided, so we will not include it in the calculation.

7. Total cost calculation
   - To find the total cost, add the base price and the costs of all the extra features.
   - Total cost = Base price + King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
   - Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

Understand the given information:
- Tim's current salary is $20,000 per month
- He gets a 5% raise
- He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary

### 2
Calculate the 5% raise:
- 5% of $20,000 = $20,000 × 0.05 = $1,000
- New monthly salary after raise = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Understand the given information:
- Christina records her mood every day for 30 days.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral.

### 2
Calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
- Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Determine the number of days left in the month:
- The first 24 days are accounted for (8 good, 8 bad, 8 neutral).
- There are 6 days left in the month (30 - 24 = 6).

### 4
Consider the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.
- This leaves 3 more days in the month (6 - 3 = 3).

### 5
Count the number of good days left in the month:
- Out of the remaining 3 days, we don't know how many are good.
- Therefore, the number of good days left in the month could be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

### 1
Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches:
- 8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches
- 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

### 2
Let x be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. Then, we can write an equation based on the given information:
- Length of Topher's shoe = 9 × Length of Bobby's shoe + 10
- 100 = 9x + 10

### 3
Solve the equation for x:
- 100 - 10 = 9x
- 90 = 9x
- x = 90 ÷ 9
- x = 10

# 1. Understand the given information
- The council has a total of 33 people.
- The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against the new regulation.

# 2. Let's define variables
- Let 'x' be the number of votes against the new regulation.
- Then, '2x' would be the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.

# 3. Set up an equation
- The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against the new regulation.
- Total votes = Votes in favor + Votes against
- 33 = 2x + x

# 4. Solve the equation
- 33 = 3x
- x = 33 ÷ 3
- x = 11

**Step 1:** Determine the number of students needing size extra-small shirts.
- Krissa needs to order 11 extra-small shirts for her preschool students.

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of students needing size small shirts.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
- Number of small shirts = 11 × 2 = 22

**Step 3:** Calculate the number of students needing size medium shirts.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
- Number of medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

**Step 4:** Calculate the number of students needing size large shirts.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium.
- Number of large shirts = 18 ÷ 2 = 9

**Step 5:** Calculate the number of students needing size extra-large shirts.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large.
- Number of extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

**Step 1:** Determine how long Jack can play with one quarter.
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.

**Step 2:** Calculate how long Jack's two friends who are worse than him can play with one quarter.
- Jack's two friends can play for half as long as Jack.
- Half of 20 minutes is 10 minutes.

**Step 3:** Calculate how long Jack's friend who is better than him can play with one quarter.
- Jack's friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack.
- 1.5 times 20 minutes is 30 minutes.

**Step 4:** Calculate the total number of minutes played by all four friends in one hour.
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- Two friends play for 10 minutes each, totaling 20 minutes.
- One friend plays for 30 minutes.
- Total minutes played in one hour = 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 minutes.

**Step 5:** Calculate the number of quarters used by all four friends in one hour.
- One hour is 60 minutes.
- In 60 minutes, Jack uses 3 quarters (60 ÷ 20 = 3).
- In 60 minutes, the two friends who are worse than Jack use 6 quarters each (60 ÷ 10 = 6), totaling 12 quarters.
- In 60 minutes, the friend who is better than Jack uses 2 quarters (60 ÷ 30 = 2).
- Total quarters used in one hour = 3 + 12 + 2 = 17 quarters.

**Step 6:** Calculate the total number of quarters used by all four friends in four hours.
- In one hour, they use 17 quarters.
- In four hours, they use 4 times as many quarters.
- Total quarters used in four hours = 17 × 4 = 68 quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used by Jack and his friends in four hours is:

- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.


# 2. Let's assign variables to the ingredients
- Let the amount of citrus zest be 'x' ounces.
- The amount of fragrance is also 'x' ounces.
- The amount of salt is '2x' ounces (twice as much as zest).
- The amount of sugar is also '2x' ounces (same as salt).

Let's assign variables to represent the number of cards each person has:
- Let x be the number of cards PJ has
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards

### 2
We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up an equation:
- x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

### 3
Simplify the equation:
- x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341
- 7x + 12 = 341

### 4
Solve the equation for x:
- 7x = 341 - 12
- 7x = 329
- x = 329 ÷ 7
- x = 47

### 5
Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can calculate how many cards Becca has:
- Becca has 3x + 12 cards
- Becca has (3 × 47) + 12 cards

**Step 1:** Determine the total amount of milk produced by the farmer's current cows per day.
- The farmer has 3 cows.
- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day.
- Total milk produced per day = 3 cows × 5 liters/cow = 15 liters

**Step 2:** Calculate the additional amount of milk needed to reach the target of 25 liters per day.
- Target milk production per day = 25 liters
- Additional milk needed = Target milk production - Current milk production
- Additional milk needed = 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

**Step 3:** Determine the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra milk.
- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day.
- Additional cows needed = Additional milk needed ÷ Milk per cow
- Additional cows needed = 10 liters ÷ 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

- The second glue stick has 2/3 left
- The third glue stick has 1/2 left
- Originally, each glue stick is 12 millimeters long

**Step 2** Calculate the unused portion of the first glue stick:
- Unused portion of the first glue stick = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6
- Unused length of the first glue stick = 5/6 × 12 mm = 10 mm

**Step 3** Calculate the unused portion of the second glue stick:

- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: a = f - 12

### 4
Substitute the relationships from step 3 into the equation from step 2:
(a + 25) + a + f = 85

### 5
Simplify the equation:
2a + f + 25 = 85

### 6
Substitute the relationship between Anne's and Fawn's books (a = f - 12) into the simplified equation:
2(f - 12) + f + 25 = 85

### 7
Solve the equation for f:
2f - 24 + f + 25 = 85
3f + 1 = 85
3f = 84
f = 28

### 1
The pool contains 10000 gallons of water.

### 2
Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
* Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 ÷ 2 = 5000 gallons.
* So, the tank contains 5000 gallons of water.

### 3
The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
* In 6 days, the total amount of water used will be: 500 gallons/day × 6 days = 3000 gallons.

### 4
To find the remaining water in the tank after 6 days, subtract the used water from the initial amount in the tank.
* Remaining water = Initial water in the tank - Used water
* Remaining water = 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons

**Step 1** Determine the number of occupied beds
- The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds
- 1/5 of the beds are occupied
- 1/5 of 1000 = 1000 ÷ 5 = 200 beds are occupied

**Step 2** Calculate the number of unoccupied beds before the outbreak

- Occupied beds = 200
- Unoccupied beds = Total beds - Occupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

**Step 3** Determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks
- 50 patients are admitted each day
- 2 weeks = 14 days

- Pat's flowers grow 12 inches (1 foot) wide.
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.


### 2
Calculate the total space needed for each plant:
- Space needed for each plant = Plant width + Space between plants
- Space needed for each plant = 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet


### 3
Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:
- Number of plants = (Length of flower bed) ÷ (Space needed for each plant)
- Number of plants = 111 feet ÷ 2.5 feet ≈ 44.4 plants
- Round down to 44 plants since we can't have a fraction of a plant.


### 4
Calculate the number of plants Pat needs to buy:
- Plants to buy = Total plants needed - Plants Pat already owns
- Plants to buy = 44 - 17 = 27 plants


### 5
Calculate the total cost of buying the additional plants:

### 1
Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.

### 2
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.
* Trey's laps = Bethany's laps + 4
* Trey's laps = 10 + 4 = 14 laps

### 3
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.
* Shaelyn's laps = Trey's laps ÷ 2
* Shaelyn's laps = 14 ÷ 2 = 7 laps

### 4
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
* Quinn's laps = Shaelyn's laps - 2
* Quinn's laps = 7 - 2 = 5 laps

### 5
To find how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
* Difference = Bethany's laps - Quinn's laps
* Difference = 10 - 5 = 5 laps

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. Since the second person took $80 more than the first, their share would be x + 80.

### 2
The third person took twice the amount of the second person. So, their share would be 2(x + 80).

### 3
The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. We can set up an equation:
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

### 4
Simplify the equation:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

- The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train
- The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour
- Therefore, the second train is traveling at 30 miles per hour (60 ÷ 2)

**Step 2** Calculate the distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours
- The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour
- The time elapsed is 3 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance for the first train = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

**Step 3** Calculate the distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours
- The second train is traveling at 30 miles per hour
- The time elapsed is 3 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance for the second train = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

**Step 4** Sum up the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them
- The trains are traveling in opposite directions
- The total distance between them is the sum of the distances traveled by each train
- Total distance = Distance of the first train + Distance of the second train

### 2
* On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed compared to her speed on the beach.
* Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as ""x"" miles per minute.
* Then, her speed on the sidewalk would be ""2x"" miles per minute.

### 3
* We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.
* Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time
* For the beach: 2 miles = x miles/minute × 40 minutes
* Solving for x: x = 2 miles ÷ 40 minutes = 0.05 miles/minute

### 4
* Now, let's calculate the time Grandma spends walking on the sidewalk.
* Using the same formula: Distance = Speed × Time
* For the sidewalk: 1 mile = 2x miles/minute × Time (let's call it ""t"" minutes)
* Substituting the value of x: 1 mile = 2 × 0.05 miles/minute × t minutes
* Simplifying: 1 mile = 0.1 miles/minute × t minutes
* Solving for t: t = 1 mile ÷ 0.1 miles/minute = 10 minutes

### 5
* To find the total time for Grandma's entire walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk.

### 1
- Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning.
- This means the probability of the first ticket winning is 0.2 or 20%.


### 2
- The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.
- To calculate the probability of the second ticket winning, multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by 3.
- Probability of the second ticket winning = 0.2 × 3 = 0.6 or 60%.


### 3
- To find the probability of both tickets being winners, multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.
- Probability of both tickets winning = Probability of first ticket winning × Probability of second ticket winning
- Probability of both tickets winning = 0.2 × 0.6 = 0.12


### 4
- Convert the probability from decimal to percentage by multiplying by 100.
- Probability of both tickets winning as a percentage = 0.12 × 100 = 12%

**Step 1** Determine the number of seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so if we subtract 5 from Jim's total, we'll get Carlos' total. Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

**Step 2** Find out how many seashells Carrey collected. The problem states that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. Since Carlos collected 22 seashells, Carrey must have collected 22 ÷ 2 = 11 seashells.

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of seashells collected by adding the amounts collected by each person. Total seashells = Jim's seashells + Carlos' seashells + Carrey's seashells. So, the total is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

**Step 4** Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three friends. Since there are 60 seashells in total, each person will get 60 ÷ 3 = 20 seashells.

### 1
- Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he can make 5 snowballs every 15 minutes.

### 2
- However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

### 3
- So, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is: 5 snowballs made - 2 snowballs melted = 3 snowballs.

### 4
- To find the time needed to have 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per 15 minutes:
  - Time needed = 60 snowballs ÷ (3 snowballs / 15 minutes)
  - Time needed = 60 ÷ (3 / 15)
  - Time needed = 60 ÷ (1 / 5)
  - Time needed = 60 × 5 = 300 minutes

**Step 3:** Determine the number of apples Walter gave to his sister.
- Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.
- 25% of 36 = 0.25 × 36 = 9 apples given to his sister.


**Step 4:** Calculate the number of apples Walter had left to sell to his uncle.
- Apples left to sell = Remaining apples after eating - Apples given to his sister
- Apples left to sell = 36 - 9 = 27 apples.


**Step 5:** Determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples.
- Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each.
- Money received = Number of apples sold × Price per apple
- Money received = 27 × $3 = $81.

**Step 1** Determine the conversion rate from telephone calls to dealership visits. Based on the given information, for every 25 calls, one person comes to the dealership.
Conversion rate (calls to visits) = 1 visit / 25 calls

**Step 2** Determine the conversion rate from dealership visits to car sales. The problem states that for every two customers visiting the dealership, one will buy a car.
Conversion rate (visits to sales) = 1 sale / 2 visits
