* The paper discusses the stability of quasiregular singularities in cross polarized versions of plane wave spacetimes.
* The authors consider the collision of two linearly polarized step electromagnetic waves and show that the resulting singularity is a quasiregular singularity.
* They propose a stability conjecture for quasiregular singularities, which states that if a test field is added to a background geometry with a quasiregular singularity, the singularity will remain unchanged if the test field is finite everywhere outside the singularity.
* The authors test the stability conjecture by adding a test scalar field to the background geometry and showing that the singularity remains unchanged.
* They also consider the effect of cross polarization on the singularity structure of the spacetime and show that the interior of the interaction region has no scalar curvature singularities.
* The authors analyze the singular points of the spacetime using the conformal curvature and show that the singularity structure remains unchanged in the cross polarized version of the problem.
* They consider the stability of quasiregular singularities by imposing a test scalar field in region II and show that the stress-energy tensor of the test field diverges as the quasiregular singularity is approached.
* The authors calculate the stress-energy tensor in a null dust frame and show that the non-zero components of the tensor diverge as the quasiregular singularity is approached.
* They conclude that the stability conjecture for quasiregular singularities is correct and that the singularity structure of the spacetime remains unchanged under cross polarization.",0

1. The paper discusses the non-local properties of quantum systems, specifically the three notions of non-locality: Bell non-locality, EPR non-locality, and separability.
2. Bell non-locality refers to the violation of the Bell inequality, which is a statistical test for locality. EPR non-locality is a more general concept that includes Bell non-locality as a special case.
3. Separability refers to the ability to describe the correlations between two parties using a product of local hidden variable models.
4. The paper introduces the concept of epr-steerability, which is a stronger form of non-locality that allows for the demonstration of entanglement via measurements on one party's system without trusting the other party's measurements.
5. The paper shows that epr-steerability is a necessary condition for the state to be entangled, but it is not sufficient on its own to determine entanglement.
6. The paper discusses the relationship between epr-steerability and the quantum steering ellipsoid, which is a geometric object that can be used to characterize the non-locality of a quantum state.
7. The paper finds a direct connection between epr-steerability and the quantum steering ellipsoid for the case where the bloch vectors vanish.
8. The paper gives a strong necessary condition for the epr-steerability of a large class of two-qubit states, which is conjectured to be also sufficient.
9. The paper concludes that epr-steerability is a more robust and useful concept than Bell non-locality for characterizing entanglement in quantum systems.

• The visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information has never been identified conclusively.
• In 1994, a concrete scheme was proposed for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field.
• The ground state of the array has the spin configuration shown in the figure, with the upspin state corresponding to the magnetic field direction and the downspin state corresponding to the opposite direction.
• When the two inputs are logic 1, the output must be logic 0 when the system reaches the ground state (anti-ferromagnetic ordering).
• However, there is a subtle issue because in the situation shown in figure 1(b), the difference between the two states is energy barrier, making the ground state of figure 1(a) a long-lived metastable state.
• If the input bit rate is high enough that the inputs change more rapidly than the time it takes for the metastable state to decay to the global ground state, we do not need to worry about this issue.
• The problem is that exchange interaction is bidirectional, which cannot ensure unidirectional flow of logic signal from the input to the output of the logic device.
• To enforce unidirectionality, desperate measures can be taken, such as holding the input at the first inverter to logic 0 and not letting go, which will ensure that the second cell follows its left neighbor.
• In 1996, a more elegant solution was proposed, inspired by the realization that in charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays, there is no inherent unidirectionality, yet charge is made to propagate from one device to the next unidirectionally through clocking.",0

• However, selecting an appropriate distance measure is crucial, but the selection criteria still depend largely on the nature of the data itself, especially in time series data.
• Although the Euclidean distance is commonly used to measure the dissimilarity between two time series, DTW distance is more appropriate and produces more accurate results.

• The paper discusses the evaluation of transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections in the antiferromagnetic (AF) state using a new method based on the random phase approximation (RPA).
• The method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, as well as spin vacancies and low-impurity concentrations.
• The method involves writing the time-ordered transverse spin propagator in frequency space and then obtaining spin correlations from the magnon mode energies using an appropriate contour integral in the lower or upper half-plane.
• The frequency integral is conveniently replaced by an appropriate contour integral in the lower or upper half-plane for the two cases of retarded (advanced) part of the time-ordered propagator, which yields positive (negative) mode energies.
• The transverse spin correlations are obtained from the magnon amplitudes on different sublattices, and the deviation at small @xmath3 is due to the neglect of single-particle excitations across the charge gap.
• The sublattice magnetization is obtained from the local spin operator, and the quantum spin-fluctuation correction simplifies to a single expression in the strong coupling limit.
• The @xmath3-dependence of sublattice magnetization is shown to interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits, approaching the spin wave theory (SWT) results.
• The method is found to be applicable in the whole range of vacancy concentration, and allows determination of the critical vacancy concentration at which the AF order parameter vanishes.

• The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is the most widely accepted theory for the phase transition in 2D systems, but it assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects.
• Recent studies have challenged the KTHNY theory by identifying first-order phase transitions in systems with different pair interactions, and the effect of dimensionality on the hexatic phase has been explored.
• The necessary equilibration time for the system to reach thermal equilibrium has been found to be strongly dependent on the measured quantity of interest, with local properties equilibrating rapidly but long-range relaxations taking significantly longer.</summary>",0

• The Kepler mission has discovered over 4,000 exoplanet candidates, including over 1,000 that are near-Earth-sized or larger.
• The discovery of small planets (<8 Earth radii) is ubiquitous, with over 40% of stars in the Kepler field hosting at least one small planet.
• The radii of small planets are often underestimated due to the presence of undetected stellar companions, which can dilute the transit signal and lead to incorrect planet radius estimates.
• The effect of undetected stellar companions on planet radius estimates depends on the multiplicity status of the host star, with the largest corrections occurring for planets orbiting secondary or tertiary stars.
• The correction factors for planet radius estimates can be calculated using isochrone fitting, which identifies the best-fit Dartmouth isochrone for the host star and then finds all stars along that isochrone with fainter absolute Kepler magnitudes.
• The correction factors can be used to correct for the underestimation of planet radii in the Kepler catalog, and future studies can use these corrections to improve the accuracy of exoplanet radius estimates.

• The observations are of the luminosity profiles of the clusters, which are modeled using @xmath0-body simulations.
• The simulations show that the expulsion of residual gas from star clusters has a significant impact on their dynamics, leading to a loss of mass and a change in the cluster's velocity dispersion.
• The authors define an effective star formation efficiency, which parameterizes how far out of virial equilibrium the cluster is after gas expulsion.
• They find that for young massive clusters, a significant fraction of the initial stellar mass is lost within a few million years after gas expulsion.
• The escaping stars are not lost instantaneously, but rather with a velocity of order of the initial velocity dispersion of the cluster.
• The authors confirm previous simulations that show that for higher star formation efficiencies, clusters are totally destroyed by gas expulsion, but for lower efficiencies, significant mass loss occurs, but a bound core remains.
• The study highlights the importance of considering the effects of gas expulsion on the dynamics of young massive star clusters in order to understand their evolution and longevity.",0

• The critical values of the lattice parameters above which the fm calculations show half-metallic character agree well with those reported by Galanakis and Mavropoulos.
• The hybridization gap is different and takes place in different energy regions in the two spin channels.
• The mixed alloys CrAs@xmath0Sb@xmath0 and CrAs@xmath0Se@xmath0 are half-metallic at lattice parameters above and below the critical values, respectively.
• The critical value for half-metallicity in CrSb is between 5.65 and 5.87, while for CrSe it is between 5.65 and 5.76.
• The total energy for ZnB2 CrAs is lower in the fm state for lattice parameters from 5.44 to 5.98, indicating the robustness of ferromagnetism in CrAs over a wide range of the lattice parameter.

• The point sources are found at close angular separations, and future high spatial and spectral resolution observations may be able to determine whether they are physically bound.
• The methanol masers are found closest to the brightest MIR point source (within the assumed 1 arcsecond pointing accuracy), and cooler, extended sources dominate the luminosity.
• The time scale for a source at the core edge to migrate to the center is comparable to the hot molecular core lifetime, so it is not possible to rule out large protostellar motions within the core.

6. The parameters of the QCM were sought by minimizing the integral average of the distance between the initial and output states, and the fidelity of the initial and output states on the real part of the Bloch sphere exceeds the value 5/6 too.
7. The choice of the parameters of the QCM is defined by the strategy of the eavesdropping, and there are many other variants of QCM, such as asymmetric QCM, without restrictions like ( [ ccm1 ] ) and ( [ ccm2 ] ).
8. The QCM produces states that depend on the parameters of the initial state only, and the set of the initial states is changing, one has to use another parametrization for this set.

• The phase field method is a popular numerical tool for simulating microstructure formation during solidification.
• The method relies on describing the geometry in terms of a phase field, which obeys partial differential equations.
• The phase fields are often simplified by assuming a thin interface limit, which ignores the effects of the finite interface thickness.
• However, this simplification can lead to errors in the simulations, particularly when dealing with thin interfaces.
• A solution to this problem is the introduction of an antitrapping current, which modifies the heat transfer across the interface and can eliminate the temperature jump.
• The antitrapping current can be derived by analyzing the one-sided model, where the diffusivity in the solid is zero.
• The generalization of the antitrapping current to the case of arbitrary diffusivities is possible, but it requires a more complex analysis.
• The thin-interface limit of the phase field model can be analyzed using matched asymptotic expansions, which reveal the effects of the finite interface thickness.
• The analysis shows that the temperature jump at the interface can be eliminated by adjusting the antitrapping current, but other thin-interface effects remain.",0

1. * The paper introduces a new approach to measure the distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered medium using the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light.
2. * The method is based on the measurement of the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources.
3. * The approach can measure the distance between the sources in the range of 10-500 nm with a precision limited by the microstructure of the scattering medium, but not by the diffraction barrier.
4. * The method is applicable to green's function retrieval in complex media, where the two-point field-field correlation of the background noise is not easy to measure.
5. * The fluctuations of the emitted power encode the interdistance between the sources, but the interdistance cannot be determined without solving a difficult inverse problem.
6. * An ensemble averaging over the configurations of the disordered medium can simplify the problem.
7. * The contrast of the power fluctuations is defined as the ratio of the variance of the total emitted power to the variance of the power emitted by a single point source.
8. * The power contrast can be written in terms of the local density of states and the cross density of states.
9. * Measuring the total emitted power requires a detection integrated over steradians, while measuring fluctuations of the intensity radiated in a given direction can be a more convenient approach in practice.

• The authors analyze the dependence of the average thickness of brushes of flexible, semiflexible, and rodlike diblock polyampholytes on the grafting density using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
• They find that the average thickness linearly depends on the grafting density regardless of the chains' flexibility.
• The strength of this dependence is considerably weaker in the case of the brush of flexible polyampholytes than in the other two cases.
• The authors also observe a separation of the anchored chains into two coexisting fractions in the cases of the brushes of semiflexible and rodlike polyampholytes.
• They use a simple scaling method to describe the linear dependence of the brush thickness on the grafting density for brushes of flexible chains.
• The persistence length of the chains, which determines their flexibility, exceeds their contour length for semiflexible and rodlike chains.
• The slopes of the linear dependence in the cases of two brushes of flexible chains are approximately the same and differ by a factor of two from those of the other two cases.
• The histograms of the brushes' equilibrium conformations at different grafting densities show similar behaviors for flexible, semiflexible, and rodlike chains.

• The Higgs field's interaction with spacetime curvature may affect the mass of fundamental particles, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons.
• The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) has been used to study the spectroscopy of a carbon-rich white dwarf, BPM 27606, which has a helium-dominated atmosphere and an effective temperature of around 100,000 K.
• The Higgs field's coupling to spacetime curvature arises naturally within the framework of interacting scalar fields in curved spacetime.
• The Lagrangian density for an interacting scalar field in a generic spacetime characterized by the metric tensor includes a term proportional to the Higgs field's mass parameter and a coupling constant to the Ricci scalar.
• The mass parameter and the self-coupling quartic coefficient of the Higgs field are important parameters in models that describe scenarios of scalar fields coupled to gravity.
• The Higgs field's mass is proportional to the yukawa coefficients of the fermion-Higgs Lagrangian density term, and its vacuum expectation value will become spacetime-dependent through the curvature scalar.
• The mass shift of fundamental fermions due to the Higgs field's interaction with spacetime curvature is not present for protons and neutrons, as their mass is primarily due to the gluonic fields, which are unaffected by the Higgs field.
• The only non-zero curvature scalar outside spherically symmetric masses is the Kretschmann invariant, and assuming a large value of the Planck length, the mass shift of order unity or lower can be achieved to compensate for Kretschmann invariants due to macroscopic curvature of any spacetime of astrophysical interest.

• ICE headquarters officials noted that officers at field offices near the U.S. southwestern border employ voluntary departure generally because of their proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border, which enables them to easily transport Mexican nationals to Mexico.
• The use of discretion at this stage is limited by clear policy and guidelines, and ICE attorneys and DRO officers can exercise discretion not to pursue proceedings in certain cases.
• DRO officers in field offices told us that DRO seeks to execute removal orders in the vast majority of cases, and supervisors in one DRO field office recalled a case in which a stay was granted to an aggravated felon who had a serious medical condition.

2. The Act established the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, which was intended to enable states to instantly and reliably determine various aspects of motor vehicles, such as validity of title documents, whether an automobile bearing a known identification number is titled in a particular state, and whether an automobile titled in a particular state is, or has been, junked or salvaged.
3. To implement the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, the Act required the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation to work together and establish a task force to study problems related to motor vehicle titling, registration, and salvage, and to recommend ways to solve these problems, including obtaining any national uniformity that is necessary in these areas and related resources.
4. The task force was also required to report to Congress by January 1, 1994, on the states' costs for providing a titling system, and by January 1, 1997, on those states that elected to participate in the system and on those states not participating, including the reasons for non-participation.
5. In October 1994, Transportation accepted most of the task force's recommendations, including the need for uniform definitions for terms such as salvage vehicles and uniform methods for titling vehicles, and the need for penalties to enforce compliance by participating states.
6. NHTSA contracted with AAMVA to identify the states' costs for implementing the titling system, and AAMVA surveyed the 50 states and the District of Columbia to obtain their estimated costs.

• The AMT is designed to ensure that individuals with high incomes pay a minimum amount of tax, and it applies to taxpayers who have income above a certain threshold, which is adjusted annually for inflation.
• The number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has been increasing rapidly due to inflation and tax reform legislation, and it is expected to continue growing in the future.
• The AMT will likely reach further down into the income distribution as the tax cuts in H.R. 1836 take effect, and the marriage penalty will be reduced for many taxpayers.

* Ipsilateral motor deficits have been found to persist chronically after the acute phase of stroke, with a correlation between motor and sensory deficits.
* Laboratory testing has revealed subtle motor deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb, which may be overlooked in clinical assessments.
* Kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb have been identified in various motor tasks, such as tracking, goal-directed movement, and tapping.
* Possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits include disrupted counterbalance between the two hemispheres, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal track, and differences in hemispheric functions.
* The correlation between ipsilateral motor and sensory deficits suggests that stroke patients may struggle with complex motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions.
* The primary sensory cortex (S1) conveys efferent projection to the posterior parietal cortex (Broca's areas 5 and 7), which is connected bilaterally through the corpus callosum.
* Disturbance of transcallosal transfer after unilateral brain damage may lead to ipsilateral sensory deficits.

• Although endoscopic resection can be a curative procedure for nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms (sdns), it remains technically challenging due to the high risk of severe adverse events (SAEs) including delayed perforation.
* Recently, laparoscopic and/or endoscopic full-thickness resection (FTR) has been reported to be a useful technique for the treatment of nonampullary sdns.
* Despite their minimally invasive nature, all FTR procedures are associated with the possibility of intraperitoneal tumor dissemination.
* To address this issue, the authors developed an alternative FTR method called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFR-L).
* In this study, the authors report on the resection of nonampullary sdns using LAEFR-L in 5 consecutive patients and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the procedure.
* The mean operative time was 173 minutes, and the mean diameter of the resected specimen was 24 mm, with a mean tumor size of 9 mm.
* Complete resection was achieved in all cases, and full-thickness resection was histologically confirmed.
* The authors conclude that LAEFR-L may be a promising technique for the treatment of nonampullary sdns that can achieve complete resection without peritoneal exposure of tumor cells or SAEs, and that prospective studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the procedure.

• The general public and policymakers have been slow to recognize the importance of invasion biology, with some critics calling for an end to the field.
• Critics argue that the problems caused by non-native species are overblown, and that native species can also have negative impacts on ecosystems.
• Invasion biology has been criticized for being xenophobic and for neglecting the rights of non-human species.
• Despite these criticisms, there is evidence that non-native species can have significant and long-lasting impacts on ecosystems.
• The lag effect of invasions, where the full impact of an introduced species is not seen for years or even decades, makes it difficult to manage invasions effectively.
• The subtlety of some invasive species' impacts can make it difficult to identify them and take action before they cause significant harm.
• Biosecurity measures, such as stricter interdiction procedures and improved early detection and rapid response, can be effective in preventing invasions.

* Approximately 25-45% of all vidian canal schwannomas are found in the head and neck.
* The most common symptoms of vidian schwannomas are damage to the vidian nerve itself, which can result in decreased lacrimation, corneal desiccation, and dryness of the nasal mucosa, as well as headaches and facial pain.
* Vidian schwannomas can also compress or extend into surrounding areas, causing facial muscle paralysis and cerebrospinal fluid leak.
* Four cases of biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannomas have been reported in the literature, with symptoms ranging from headache and facial palsy to oculomotor palsy and cerebrospinal fluid leak.
* Complete surgical resection is the traditional and curative management of peripheral nerve tumors, and recent advancements in transnasal endoscopic skull base approaches have made complete resection more feasible.
* Radiation therapy is also an alternative treatment option, and recent advances in imaging and radiation delivery offer more conformal treatment options with reduced side effects.

1. The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened up a new route for obtaining photoanode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
2. The method involves the use of electrodeposition of cuscn, a p-type wide-bandgap semiconductor, into highly crystallized thin films at low temperature.
3. The addition of soft Lewis basic NCS groups to the bath for electrodeposition of cuscn resulted in the formation of colored cuscn thin films incorporating n3 and fltc.
4. The electrodeposited cuscn / dye hybrid thin films exhibited dye-sensitized photocathodic properties, indicating the intimate chemistry between cuscn and dyes having soft basic anchors.
5. The mechanism of cuscn electrodeposition was poorly understood at the time of the previous work, so the conditions were not properly chosen to achieve hybrid thin films with a composition similar to that of ZnO / EY.
6. The use of rhodamine B (RB) as a structure directing agent (SDA) for the formation of nanostructure and as a cause of changes in crystallographic orientation of cuscn was explored.
7. The strategy showed positive results, with a clear effect of RB as an SDA for the formation of nanostructure and as a cause of changes in crystallographic orientation of cuscn.
8. However, it was not possible to extract the loaded RB molecules by any kind of post-treatment to obtain highly porous structure as in the case of ZnO / EY.

• Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood characterized by tonic seizures, atonic seizures, and other types of seizures.
• The second feature required by the definition of LGS is an interictal awake electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern consisting of slow spike waves (less than 3 Hz) usually with a generalized distribution.
• Other EEG features include paroxysms of low voltage fast activity during sleep and the presence of myoclonic, atypical absence, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
• The typical age of onset of LGS is between 2 and 5 years, and boys are affected more often than girls.
• The prognosis of LGS is poor, with regard to both seizure control and cognitive outcome.
• Risk factors for poor cognitive prognosis include symptomatic etiology, history of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, prior infantile spasms, and early age of seizure onset.
• Treatment of LGS is challenging, and no single medication has been shown to be effective in controlling all types of seizures.
• Valproic acid is considered the most useful initial medication for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS, although other medications may be tried as needed.
• Rufinamide, a triazole derivative granted orphan drug status for the adjunctive treatment of LGS, has shown promise in reducing seizure frequency in clinical trials.
• Rufinamide has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effectiveness, blocks seizures induced by subcutaneous strychnine, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, and has an excellent safety profile in animals.
• However, the mechanism of action of rufinamide is not fully understood, and drug interactions with other anticonvulsants used in LGS are possible.

• To reduce parasitic signals, the drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency, thus the amplitude of motion of the resonator was proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.
• A bias voltage at (+) through the gauges was used to down-mix their resistance change (occurring at the actuation frequency) and the low-frequency readout signal at was detected using a lock-in amplifier.
• Typical measurement values were 1.5 V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz.
• All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature.
• Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same setup, with the drive electrode disconnected.
• Measurements were taken with a lock-in amplifier, which also generated the drive and bias signals.
• The allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration, and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
• The phase of the measured signal, (t), was monitored for a certain amount of time and then transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.
• Close to the resonance frequency, this phase response was linear, f2qf0. Using the complete phase response of the resonator instead of this linearization does not significantly alter the allan deviation.

• RRSO: The meta-analysis found that RRSO is strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

• Magnitude of risk reduction: The magnitude of the risk reductions in women with BRCA1/2 mutations who have undergone RRSO compared with those who have not is unclear.

• Data limitations: The limitations of the currently available data regarding RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers include variable study designs, small sample sizes for individual studies, and short post-RRSO follow-up times in prospective studies.

• Breast cancer: Eight studies estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were treated with RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.49 (95% CI = 0.37 to 0.65).

• Gynecologic cancer: Six studies estimated the risk of gynecologic cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers treated with RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment, giving a summary HR estimate of 0.21 (95% CI = 0.12 to 0.39).
