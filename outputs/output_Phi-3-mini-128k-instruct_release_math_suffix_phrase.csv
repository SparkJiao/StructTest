2," To calculate the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the final value of the house after the repairs.

The house was initially worth $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we multiply the initial value by the percentage increase:

$80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

Now, we add the increase in value to the initial value to find the final value of the house:

$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so we subtract this amount from the final value of the house to find the profit:

4," To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed she has already given them.

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given so far is:

15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups

Now, we know that Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of feed per meal, and she has a flock of 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed needed for one meal is:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already given her chickens 40 cups of feed, she needs to give them the remaining amount of feed in the final meal. To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount needed for one meal:

60 cups (total needed for one meal) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

5," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the glasses considering the discount on every second glass.

First, let's find out how many glasses will be bought at full price and how many will be bought at the discounted price. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses and every second glass is discounted, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses will be bought at full price and how many will be bought at the discounted price.

16 glasses / 2 = 8 glasses at full price and 8 glasses at discounted price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the full-priced glasses:

8 glasses * $5/glass = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost of the discounted glasses. Since the discounted price is 60% of the full price, we can multiply the full price by 0.6:

$5 * 0.6 = $3

Now, let's calculate the cost of the discounted glasses:

8 glasses * $3/glass = $24

Finally, let's add the cost of the full-priced glasses and the discounted glasses to find the total cost:

$40 (full-priced glasses) + $24 (discounted glasses) = $64

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses.

7," To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart, and then calculate the time it takes to download the remaining file.

1. Calculate the amount of the file downloaded before the restart:
Since Carla has downloaded 40% of the file before the restart, we can find the amount of the file downloaded by multiplying the total file size by 40%.

200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB

2. Calculate the remaining file size:
Now, we need to find the remaining file size by subtracting the downloaded amount from the total file size.

200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

3. Calculate the time it takes to download the remaining file:
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can find the time it takes to download the remaining file by dividing the remaining file size by the download speed.

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

4. Add the time taken for the restart and the updates:
Finally, we need to add the time taken for the restart and the updates to the time it takes to download the remaining file.

9," To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked.

1. Regular pay:
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, and she worked 40 hours at this rate. So, her regular pay is:
Regular pay = Regular hourly rate * Regular hours worked
Regular pay = $10 * 40
Regular pay = $400

2. Overtime pay:
Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours). Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. So, her overtime pay rate is:

Overtime pay rate = $10 * 1.2
Overtime pay rate = $12

Now, we can calculate her overtime pay:
Overtime pay = Overtime pay rate * Overtime hours worked
Overtime pay = $12 * 5
Overtime pay = $60

3. Total earnings:
Eliza's total earnings for the week are the sum of her regular pay and her overtime pay.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so we multiply 60 by 3:
60 * 3 = 180 downloads

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%. To find the reduced number, we first calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads

Now, we know that 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, so we have:

10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters of orange drink left

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, we have a total of 9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink = 24 liters of mixed drink.

To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the proportion of water in the mixed drink. We can do this by adding the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then dividing by the total volume of the mixed drink:

g = s + 30

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can write another equation:

s + g = 110

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

35," To find the total points Mike scored, we first need to calculate how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes. We know that he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. To find the 25% increase, we multiply 4 points by 25% (or 0.25):

4 points * 0.25 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than in the first 20 minutes, which is:

4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we can add the points from both intervals to find the total points:

38," To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total time he spends running each week and then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's find out how much time John spends running on the other two days. Since he runs half as much on these days as he does on the first day, he runs for 1.5 hours each of these two days (3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours).

Now, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:

First day: 3 hours
Other two days: 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours

Total time spent running each week: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find out how fast John runs by dividing the total distance he runs each week by the total time he spends running:

1. Calculate the time it took Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = d / 10 mph

2. Calculate the time it takes Tom to travel back from 4 to 1 PM:

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he has 30 comic books, we can calculate the total weight of the comic books by multiplying the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books:

(1/4 pound/comic book) * 30 comic books = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag, and we've found that his comic books contribute 7.5 pounds to the total weight. To find out how much weight he needs to remove from his toys, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove by dividing the weight he needs to remove from his toys by the weight of one toy:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, to find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we add the number of instructions in both recipes:

Total instructions = 20 (first recipe) + 40 (second recipe) = 60 instructions

73," To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for all five cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 months to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Total cost of the cell phones without interest
Shiela bought 5 cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost without interest is:
5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Total interest for all five cell phones
A 2% interest will be charged for each unit, so the total interest for all five cell phones is:
$750 * 0.02 = $15

Step 3: Add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones
$750 (total cost) + $15 (total interest) = $765

Step 4: Divide the final amount by 3 months to find the monthly payment

Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3 per pot.
Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2 per pot.
Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2 per pot.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

75," To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

Level 1 (top level): 16 square feet
Level 2: 16 * 0.5 = 8 square feet
Level 3: 8 * 0.5 = 4 square feet
Level 4 (bottom level): 4 * 0.5 = 2 square feet

Now that we have the square footage of each level, we can find the average square footage by adding the square footage of all levels and dividing by the number of levels (4 in this case):

Average square footage = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4
Average square footage = 30 / 4
Average square footage = 7.5 square feet

76," To calculate the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to determine the total amount of dog food she will need for the first 180 days and then divide that by the number of cups in one bag.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:

180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

Now, we need to divide the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days by the number of cups in one bag:

180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.636 bags

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to buy 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

77," To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4. So, David does 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can divide the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2. So, Raymond does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Finally, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does. So, the difference is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

78," First, let's find out the cost per flower for each package.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (rounded to four decimal places).

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50.

Since the cost per flower for the package of 2 flowers is lower, it's the better price.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using the better price.

Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages of 2 flowers.

The total cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers is 9 * $1 = $9.

If Vincent bought the 3-flower packages, he would need 18 / 3 = 6 packages.

The total cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers would be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Now, let's find out how much Vincent saves by buying the 2-flower packages instead of the 3-flower packages.

The savings would be $15 - $9 = $6.

Result: Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

80," First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate this by multiplying 24 liters by 1/6:

24 liters * (1/6) = 4 liters

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, they got a total of:

4 liters (first girl) + 4 liters (second girl) = 8 liters

Now, let's subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters:

24 liters - 8 liters = 16 liters

Finally, we need to subtract the 6 liters of water that the boy got:

16 liters - 6 liters = 10 liters

84," To solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the given information. Let's denote the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L.

We know that the team played 22 games in total, so we can write the equation:

W + L = 22

We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write another equation:

W = L + 8

Now we can solve this system of equations. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine the L terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting L back into the second equation:

87," To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to determine her salary after the initial five years of service. Since the company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed for five years, Sylvie's salary after five years would be:


Initial salary: $600

Annual increase: 10% of $600 = $60


Sylvie's salary after five years:

Year 1: $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: $660 + $60 = $720

Year 3: $720 + $60 = $780

Year 4: $780 + $60 = $840

Year 5: $840 + $60 = $900


Now, Sylvie's salary after five years is $900. For the next three years, her salary will increase by $60 each year. So, her salary after three more years of service will be:


Year 6: $900 + $60 = $960

Year 7: $960 + $60 = $1020

Year 8: $1020 + $60 = $1080

89," To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we first need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since she invited 16 friends and expects 1/4 of them not to show up, we can calculate the expected number of attendees as follows:

Number of attendees = Total invited guests * (1 - Fraction not attending)
Number of attendees = 16 * (1 - 1/4)
Number of attendees = 16 * (3/4)
Number of attendees = 12

Now that we know there will be 12 attendees, we can calculate the number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags = Number of attendees * Gift bags per guest
Number of gift bags = 12 * 0.75

90," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for both adults and children.

First, let's find out how much potato salad an adult dinosaur will eat:
An adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.

Next, let's find out how much potato salad a child dinosaur will eat:
A child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs, so the total amount needed for adults is 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children:
There are 5 children, and each child eats 5 lbs, so the total amount needed for children is 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Finally, let's add the total amount needed for adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring:
Total amount needed = 200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

91," Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.

Now, to find the total number of pets the three have, we add their individual counts:

Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.

So, the three have a total of 28 pets.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
92," First, let's establish the relationships between the ages of the children. We know that James is 10 years old and that he is 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 11 years old.

Next, we know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Finally, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Since Amy is 9, Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

93," To solve this problem, we need to find out how much faster Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles compared to Lee, and then calculate his new time after improving his speed by 10%.

1. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. We also know that Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Gerald's original time would be 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.
3. Now, Gerald has improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he has saved, we need to calculate 10% of his original time: 10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.
4. Finally, we subtract the time saved from his original time to find his new time: 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

The answer is: 36 seconds.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
94," To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of cats and dogs in the neighborhood. We know that there are 60 dogs. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we can find the total number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats together.

Total number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Total number of dogs and cats = 180

According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the total number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Total number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

95," To solve this problem, we first need to find out the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since the total number of students is 200, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout. So, we can calculate the number of girls in the Girl Scout as follows:

Number of girls in Girl Scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:

Number of girls not in Girl Scout = Total girls - Girls in Girl Scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Harry slept 9 hours.

So, James slept (2/3) * 9 hours = 6 hours.

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

9 hours (Harry) - 6 hours (James) = 3 hours.

97," To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes she used to make 32 ounces of sauce.

Since each 16-ounce can loses half its volume when cooked into sauce, we can calculate the volume of sauce produced from one can:

16 ounces (original volume) * 0.5 (volume loss) = 8 ounces of sauce per can

Now, we can find out how many cans were used to make 32 ounces of sauce:

32 ounces (total sauce volume) / 8 ounces (sauce volume per can) = 4 cans

Since each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes, we can now calculate the total number of tomatoes used:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

Freda used 12 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
98," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. We also know that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x (first 15 minutes) + 20 (remaining 15 minutes).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam:

x + 20 = 30 - 5

The equation represents the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam (x + 20) being equal to the original number of cars (30) minus the cars that took an exit (5).

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 20 = 25
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

The answer is: 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}

First friend: 20 times
Second friend: 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 * 1/4 = 5 times more. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.
Third friend: 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is 60 * 10 = 600 times.
Fourth friend: 60 times

Now, we add the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:

101," To find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he needs to read. 

Total pages = Pages from Science textbook + Pages from Social Studies textbook + Pages from History textbook + Pages from Geography textbook
Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
Total pages = 39

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of pages.

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15
Remaining pages = 24

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

Average pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days

102," To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to consider his daily water intake and the difference in his weekend routine.

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, 1 glass for lunch, 1 glass for dinner, and 1 glass before bed. This totals to 4 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 glasses * 5 days = 20 glasses of water during the weekdays.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, 1 glass for lunch, and 1 glass before bed, but he has a soda with dinner instead. This totals to 3 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 glasses * 2 days = 6 glasses of water during the weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses John drinks during the weekdays and the weekends to find the total number of glasses he drinks in a week:

106," To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of each box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height.

Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we need to multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time he spent watching TV on these days: 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, we can subtract the time he spent watching TV on the other days from the total time to find out how much time he spent watching TV on Wednesday: 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

Now, we know that Frankie watched a 30-minute show on Wednesday, so we can convert that to hours: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours.

Finally, we can subtract the time he spent watching the 30-minute show on Wednesday from the total time he spent watching TV on that day to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched: 1.5 hours - 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide the time he spent watching 30-minute episodes by the length of each episode to find out how many episodes he watched: 1 hour / 0.5 hours = 2 episodes.

The final answer is 2 episodes.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

Henry baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so we subtract those extra cookies to find the intended amount:

115 cookies (before dropping) - 15 cookies (extra) = 100 cookies (intended amount).


Since Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, we divide the intended amount by 2 to find out how many cookies he made last year:

100 cookies (intended amount) / 2 = 50 cookies.

Cashback per gallon = $0.20
Total gallons = 10

Total cashback earned = Cashback per gallon * Total gallons
Total cashback earned = $0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Now, we need to subtract the total cashback earned from the initial cost of the gas.

Initial cost of gas = $3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

Final cost of gas after cashback = Initial cost of gas - Total cashback earned
Final cost of gas after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

111," To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed, the rate at which her boat was taking on water, and then calculate the total amount of water the boat took on during her journey.

1. First, we find the total distance Julia rowed. We know that it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore, and she rows 20 feet every 16 seconds. So, we can set up a proportion to find the total distance:

(20 feet / 16 seconds) = (Total distance / 64 seconds)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

20 * 64 = 16 * Total distance

1280 = 16 * Total distance

Total distance = 1280 / 16

Total distance = 80 feet

2. Next, we find the rate at which the boat was taking on water. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. So, we can set up a proportion to find the rate:

(2 liters / 10 feet) = (Rate * 80 feet)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

2 * 80 = 10 * Rate

160 = 10 * Rate

Rate = 160 / 10

Rate = 16 liters per 80 feet

3. Finally, we calculate the total amount of water the boat took on during Julia's journey. We know that the boat took on 16 liters of water for every 80 feet Julia rowed. Since she rowed a total of 80 feet, we can multiply the rate by the total distance:

Total water = Rate * Total distance

114," To solve this problem, we need to find the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We are given the following information:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as B.

From the first piece of information, we can write the following equation:

Jamal's phone capacity = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity
1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, we can solve for Brittany's phone capacity:

Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

From the second piece of information, we can write the following equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * B
300 = 50 * B

Now, we can solve for B:

B = 300 / 50
B = 6

So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

115," To calculate Sasha's profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will receive from selling the leftover boards.

1. Calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, so the total cost for these boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, so the total cost for these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover boards:
- Sasha has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, which she bought for $10 each. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the current selling price for these boards is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 each. So, the total revenue from selling these boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
- Sasha also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, which she bought for $16 each. The current selling price for these boards is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 each. So, the total revenue from selling these boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total revenue from selling the leftover boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

3. Calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

116," To solve this problem, we first need to understand the ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

The total parts in the ratio are 7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts.

Now, we know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. We need to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used.

To do this, we can set up a proportion:

(7 parts sugar / 20 total parts) = (x teaspoons sugar / 120 total teaspoons)

Now, we can solve for x:

7/20 = x/120

Cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20 * x

119," To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Adrien's salary was four years ago and then calculate how much it increased to four years later. After that, we can find out Lylah's salary four years ago and calculate how much it increased to four years later. Finally, we can add both salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

Step 1: Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. To find the new salary, we can multiply the old salary by 1.40 (100% + 40% = 140% = 1.40).
New Adrien's salary = $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000

Step 3: Calculate the percentage difference between Adrien's salary four years ago and four years later.
Percentage difference = (New salary - Old salary) / Old salary * 100%
Percentage difference = ($56,000 - $40,000) / $40,000 * 100% = 40%

Step 4: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. To find Lylah's salary, we can divide Adrien's salary by 1.30 (100% + 30% = 130% = 1.30).
Old Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 5: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
Since both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
New Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 * 1.40 = $43,077.12 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 6: Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.
Total salary = New Adrien's salary + New Lylah's salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077.12 = $99,077.12

140," To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 of which are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:

Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars = Semi-automatic cars
20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can use the following formula:

(Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100

Substituting the values we have:

(4 / 20) * 100 = 20%

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

141," To solve this problem, we need to first establish the relationship between the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queen bees.

Let's denote the number of queen bees as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so we can write this relationship as:
B = 2Q

Also, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write this relationship as:
W = 2B

Now, we know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write the equation:
Q + B + W = 700

We can substitute the relationships between the number of bees into this equation:
Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700

Simplifying the equation, we get:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
7Q = 700

Now, we can solve for Q:
Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queen bees, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q
B = 2 * 100
B = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B
W = 2 * 200
W = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

We know that the profit is $25, and the profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, we can find the total cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:
Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
Total cost = $10 - $25 = -$15

Since the total cost cannot be negative, there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

3. Calculate the total cost:
We know that the cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is:
Total cost per gallon = Cost of lemons + Cost of sugar
Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5

4. Calculate the number of gallons sold:
Since the total revenue per gallon is $10 and the total cost per gallon is $5, the profit per gallon is:
Profit per gallon = Total revenue per gallon - Total cost per gallon
Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

Now, we can find the number of gallons sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per gallon:
Number of gallons sold = Total profit / Profit per gallon
Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. Calculate the cost of lemons:
Now that we know they sold 5 gallons of lemonade, we can find the total cost of lemons by multiplying the cost of lemons per gallon by the number of gallons sold:
Cost of lemons = Cost of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons sold
Cost of lemons = $3 * 5 = $15

Half of Jan's age two years ago = (30 - 2) / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14 years old

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:

Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5 = 19 years old

Now, let's find Mark's current age:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can now find Jean's age:

184," To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the probabilities of the two events separately.

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the probabilities of these two events:

50% (probability of rolling a number greater than 3) - 25% (probability of rolling two even numbers in a row) = 25%

209," To solve this problem, we first need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since a dozen is equal to 12, half a dozen would be 6. Therefore, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups. So, the cost of each cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.

Jacket cost: $30
Shoes cost (2 pairs): 2 * $20 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting:

Babysitting earnings: 4 times * $5 = $20

Now, let's find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes:

Money needed: $70 (total cost) - $30 (total money available) = $40

Since Sara's parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn by dividing the money needed by the amount she earns per lawn mowing:

211," To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.

We know that:
1) Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3R.
2) Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5W.
3) Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so the total number of eggs produced by all chickens is 3R + 5W = 42.
4) Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so W = R + 2.

Now we can substitute the fourth equation into the third equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R + 10 = 42
8R = 32
R = 4

Perimeter = 2 * (7.5 miles)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the total distance Gary walks, we can find out how many hours he spends walking by dividing the distance by his walking speed.

213," Sloane counted 400 customers on the third day. Here's the explanation:

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which is 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers from the first and second days from the total number of customers.

So, 500 (total customers) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250 customers on the third day.

However, the question states that Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day on the second day, which means she counted 150 customers on the second day. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day should be 500 (total customers) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250 customers.

214," To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the water levels in the two pools and the rate at which they are leaking.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as S gallons and the initial amount of water in the big pool as B gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the following equation:

B = 2S (1)

Now, both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In the 4 minutes that have passed, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 * 2 = 32 gallons of water (since it has twice the initial amount of water).

After 4 minutes, the water levels in the pools are:

Small pool: S - 16 gallons
Big pool: B - 32 gallons

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write the following equation:

B - 32 = 4(S - 16) (2)

Now we have a system of two equations (1 and 2). We can solve this system to find the values of S and B.

First, substitute equation (1) into equation (2):

2S - 32 = 4(S - 16)

Now, solve for S:

2S - 32 = 4S - 64
32 - 64 = 4S - 2S
-32 = 2S
S = -16

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, there must be an error in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate our equations.

We made a mistake in equation (2). The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool after 4 minutes, so the correct equation should be:

B - 32 = 4(S - 16)

Now, substitute equation (1) into this corrected equation:

2S - 32 = 4(S - 16)

Now, solve for S:

2S - 32 = 4S - 64
32 - 64 = 4S - 2S
-32 = 2S
S = -16

Again, we have a negative value for S, which is not possible. The mistake lies in the fact that we are not considering the initial water levels correctly. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:

B = 2S (1)

Now, after 4 minutes, the small pool has lost 16 gallons, and the big pool has lost 32 gallons. The new water levels are:

Small pool: S - 16 gallons
Big pool: B - 32 gallons

The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now:

B - 32 = 4(S - 16) (2)

Now, substitute equation (1) into equation (2):

2S - 32 = 4(S - 16)

Now, solve for S:

2S - 32 = 4S - 64
32 - 64 = 4S - 2S
-32 = 2S
S = -16

Now, we know that Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 (total cost) ÷ $8.00 (hourly wage) = 44 hours

So, the total amount she will pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we know that she will pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay back in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years old.


Next, we know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so we can find Zack's age:

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.


Now, we need to calculate the average age of the three in three years. In three years, each person will be three years older, so we add 3 to each of their current ages:

Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years old.

Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years old.


To find the average age, we add their ages together and divide by the number of people:

Average age in three years = (24 + 66 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years old.

240," To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can write the equation:

John's candies = 2 * Robert's candies

We know that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

54 = 2 * Robert's candies

Now, we can solve for Robert's candies:

Robert's candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can write the equation:

James's candies = Robert's candies + 6

Substituting the value of Robert's candies:

James's candies = 27 + 6 = 33

Now, we can find the difference between John's and James's candies:

There are 3 classes with 20 students each, so there are a total of 3 * 20 = 60 students in the school.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, there are 60 * 0.5 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.

We know that the first class has 15 girls, so there are 20 - 15 = 5 boys in the first class.

The second class has 12 girls, so there are 20 - 12 = 8 boys in the second class.

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of boys in the first and second classes from the total number of boys in the school:

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's find out how many wolves and cougars Rick killed today:

- Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as C. According to the problem, Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night, so C = 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.
- Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * C = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's find the total number of animals Rick killed:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

Now, we need to distribute these 240 cows equally among the 10 stalls. To do this, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls: 240 / 10 = 24 cows per stall.

Remaining length = 200 feet - (200 feet * 0.30)
Remaining length = 200 feet - 60 feet
Remaining length = 140 feet

Now, we know that each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. To find the weight of the remaining 140-foot section, we can calculate it as follows:

Weight of remaining section = (Remaining length / Section length) * Weight per section
Weight of remaining section = (140 feet / 10 feet) * 400 pounds

First, let's find the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows, we can calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms as follows:

Number of bedrooms per house = 3
Number of windows per bedroom = 2
Total number of windows in bedrooms per house = 3 bedrooms * 2 windows = 6 windows

Since there are 2 houses, we need to multiply the total number of windows in bedrooms per house by 2:

Total number of windows in bedrooms for both houses = 6 windows * 2 houses = 12 windows

Next, let's find the total number of additional windows in both houses. Since there are 4 additional windows in each house, we can calculate the total number of additional windows as follows:

Number of additional windows per house = 4
Total number of additional windows for both houses = 4 windows * 2 houses = 8 windows

80 * (2/5) = 32 cards with the letter A.

Now, let's find out how many cards were left after removing the ones with the letter A:

80 - 32 = 48 cards remaining.

Next, we'll find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we multiply 48 by 1/2:

1. Time to dig a small hole: 3 minutes
2. Time to dig a large hole: 10 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time for each type of hole:

1. Time for 30 small holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
2. Time for 15 large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the total time for both types of holes:

Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Given that the sum of their current ages is 20, we can represent their ages as Mico's age (M) and Marco's age (Mar). So, M + Mar = 20.

Now, we want to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 years old, and Marco will be Mar + 10 years old. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (Mar + 10).

Since M + Mar = 20, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, substitute the value of R from the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

Now, we need to find the remaining length of the necklace that will be filled with sterling silver beads. We know that each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, so we subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches (sterling silver beads)

Next, we need to find out how many sterling silver beads are needed to fill this 17-inch length. Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can divide the total length of the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead:

307," To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks to find the weekly weight loss rate.

Joey's weekly weight loss rate = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Joey's weekly weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Joey's weekly weight loss rate = 2 pounds/week

Now that we know Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can determine how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply Joey's weekly weight loss rate by the number of weeks Sandy needs.

Sandy's time to lose the same amount of weight = Joey's weekly weight loss rate * Number of weeks Sandy needs
Sandy's time to lose the same amount of weight = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Sandy's time to lose the same amount of weight = 8 weeks

308," First, let's calculate the savings on each item:

1. Ice cream: The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold for $11. So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

2. Milk: The discount on a packet of milk is $0.5. So, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.

Now, let's calculate the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

1. Savings on ice cream: $2 (savings per tub) * 2 (number of tubs) = $4
2. Savings on milk: $0.5 (savings per packet) * 4 (number of packets) = $2

309," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of extra arms and legs a person will grow after drinking the serum for fifteen days.

First, let's find out how many extra arms the person will grow. Since the serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every three days, we can divide the total number of days (15) by the growth interval for arms (3):

Extra arms = 15 days / 3 days/arm = 5 arms

Now, let's find out how many extra legs the person will grow. Since the serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every five days, we can divide the total number of days (15) by the growth interval for legs (5):

Extra legs = 15 days / 5 days/leg = 3 legs

Now, we can add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs:

Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 arms + 3 legs = 8 limbs

Now, let's find the cost of the flight ticket:

Cost of a business suit: $100
5 times the cost of a business suit: 5 * $100 = $500
Flight ticket cost: $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the business trip:

Total cost of business suits and suitcases: $600 + $150 = $750
Total cost of the flight ticket: $1200
Total cost of the business trip: $750 + $1200 = $1950

315," To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, we first need to calculate the total number of people she initially invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each.

So, the total number of people invited from the 2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited from the 3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12 people.

Adding these two numbers together, we get the total number of people initially invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, we need to account for the people who couldn't come. We know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. So, 1/4 * 8 = 2 people had previous commitments.

Adding the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments, we get 8 + 2 = 10 people who couldn't come.

Finally, to find out how many people show up for Martha's party, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people initially invited: 24 - 10 = 14 people.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of poles:

(poles / wires) = (1 / 3)

Let's denote the number of poles as 'p'. Then, we can write the proportion as:

p / 45 = 1 / 3

To solve for 'p', we can cross-multiply:

3 * p = 45 * 1

3p = 45

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of 'p':

26 pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils in boxes
24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, let's find out how many boxes Meg needs. Meg has 46 pencils. Since we know that each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils, we can divide Meg's total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box to find out how many boxes she needs:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total number of employees
Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
Number of junior programmers = 40

Now, let's find out the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100, and we already know there are 40 junior programmers, we can calculate the number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of senior programmers = 60

Now, let's find out how much each senior programmer is paid. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can calculate this as follows:

Payment for each senior programmer = Payment for each junior programmer + $400
Payment for each senior programmer = $2000 + $400
Payment for each senior programmer = $2400

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the junior programmers per month:

373," To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to determine the value of the faulty equipment. We know that the faulty equipment represents 40% of the total value, which is $400,000.

So, we calculate the value of the faulty equipment as follows:

Faulty equipment value = 40% of $400,000
Faulty equipment value = 0.40 * $400,000
Faulty equipment value = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value to find the value of the functioning equipment:

Functioning equipment value = Total value - Faulty equipment value
Functioning equipment value = $400,000 - $160,000
Functioning equipment value = $240,000

The final answer is $240,000.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

From these 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each, so she collects 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

The other half of the sheep also consists of 15 sheep, and she gets 2 kg of milk from each of them. So, she collects 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk from these sheep.

In total, Mary collects 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.

377," To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and then calculate the number of apples she picked on Wednesday, which is double the number of apples picked on Tuesday. Finally, we will add up the apples picked on all three days.


From the information given, Lucy earned $56 on Monday by selling apples at $4 per apple. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide the total earnings by the price per apple:


Number of apples sold on Monday = Total earnings on Monday / Price per apple

Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4

Number of apples sold on Monday = 14 apples


On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means:


Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 24 apples


Now, we add the number of apples picked on all three days to get the total:


Total number of apples picked = Number of apples sold on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday

Total number of apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24

Total number of apples picked = 50 apples

380," To calculate Karan's monthly payment, we first need to find the total interest she will pay over the five months. The formula for calculating simple interest is:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

In this case, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% (or 0.10 as a decimal), and the time is 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to repay:

Total repayment = Principal + Interest
Total repayment = $3,650 + $1,825
Total repayment = $5,475

Finally, we divide the total repayment by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

Millie bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. If she sells all 36 cups, she will generate a total revenue of 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for Millie to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. So, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To calculate her profit per hour, we need to subtract her initial investment from her total revenue and then divide the result by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade.

Millie's initial investment is $18. Her total revenue is $36. So, her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, to find her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x. The total number of popsicles they have together is the sum of the popsicles each person has, which is 5x + 6x = 165.

Combining the terms, we get 11x = 165. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:

Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

1. Calculate the number of millipedes:
Nancy saw 90 spiders, and there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. So, we multiply the number of spiders by 1/3:
Millipedes = 90 * (1/3) = 30 millipedes

2. Calculate the number of stink bugs:
The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we multiply the number of millipedes by 2 and then subtract 12:
Stink bugs = (30 * 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

3. Calculate the total number of bugs:
Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

403," To calculate the energy saved, we first need to determine the energy used by the air conditioner before and after the reduction in usage time.

Before the reduction, Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day. So, the daily energy consumption is:

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

After the reduction, Mel uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours). So, the daily energy consumption is:

900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh)

Now, let's calculate the daily energy savings:

7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy savings by 30:

4500 Wh * 30 days = 135000 Wh

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), we can convert the energy saved to kilowatt-hours:

In May, the company hired 40 employees, each working 40 hours per week at a rate of $15 per hour. So, the weekly pay for each employee is:

40 hours/week * $15/hour = $600/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly pay for each employee is:

$600/week * 4 weeks/month = $2400/month

Now, we need to find out how many employees were still working in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that means 3/4 of the employees were still working. So, the number of employees still working in June is:

40 employees * 3/4 = 30 employees

The company still paid the same monthly rate of $2400 per employee in June. So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June is:

30 employees * $2400/employee = $72,000

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June:

May: 40 employees * $2400/employee = $96,000

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half of that amount, which is 15 apples, from the shortest trees. So, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + A (average).

Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. Since she didn't take any from the average trees, the total number of apples her sister gathered is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest).

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, the distance for the next two days is:
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:

425," Lillian has a total of 6 bird feeders (3 she built and 3 she bought). Let's assume each store-bought bird feeder attracts x birds. According to the information, each of Lillian's homemade bird feeders attracts x + 10 birds.

Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, we can set x = 20.

Now, we can calculate the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:
- Store-bought feeders: 3 * 20 = 60 birds
- Homemade feeders: 3 * (20 + 10) = 3 * 30 = 90 birds

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:
60 birds (store-bought) + 90 birds (homemade) = 150 birds

Result: 150 birds.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
426," To find out how much Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. Bagel cost: $4
2. Soup cost: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find out how much more, we multiply the cost of the bagel by 25% (or 0.25):
   $4 * 0.25 = $1
   So, the soup costs $1 more than the bagel. Therefore, the soup costs:
   $4 + $1 = $5
3. Cake cost: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find out the cost, we divide the cost of the bagel by 2:
   $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we add the cost of each item to find the total cost of the dinner:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11

So, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner.

427," Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny has as 'x'. He sells 2/3 of his cards, which means he sells (2/3)*x cards. The money he gets from selling these cards is $1.5*(2/3)*x = $1.0*x.

He keeps 1/3 of his cards, which means he keeps (1/3)*x cards. He also has $50 in spending cash. So, the total money he has is $1.0*x + $50.

We know that this total money is equal to the cost of the amusement park ticket, which is $100. So, we can set up the equation:

$1.0*x + $50 = $100

Solving this equation for 'x' gives us:

$1.0*x = $100 - $50
$1.0*x = $50
x = $50 / $1.0
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

428," To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared initially for 36 guests, with half of them having two hotdogs. Then, we'll calculate how many hotdogs were needed for the additional 4 guests, and finally, we'll find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

1. Initially, there were 36 guests, and half of them (18 guests) were supposed to have two hotdogs. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared initially is:

\[18 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs/guest} = 36 \text{ hotdogs}\]

2. Since 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, we need to find out how many additional hotdogs are needed for the extra 4 guests:

\[4 \text{ guests} \times 1 \text{ hotdog/guest} = 4 \text{ hotdogs}\]

3. Now, we add the initial number of hotdogs to the additional hotdogs needed:

\[36 \text{ hotdogs} + 4 \text{ hotdogs} = 40 \text{ hotdogs}\]

Since there were 40 guests and 40 hotdogs were prepared, all guests were able to have a second hotdog. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Now, we know that Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. To find out how many gallons of gasoline she needed, we can multiply the amount of gasoline in each container by 1/4:

3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons

Finally, we need to convert the gallons of gasoline to pints. There are 8 pints in 1 gallon, so we can calculate the number of pints Josey needed as follows:

434," To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money George spent on chips and then subtract that amount from his total spending to find out how much he spent on candy bars.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the chips.
George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost of the chips is:
3 bags * 40 cents/bag = 120 cents

Step 2: Convert George's total spending to cents.
George spent $5, which is equivalent to:
$5 * 100 cents/dollar = 500 cents

Step 3: Calculate the remaining money after buying chips.
Subtract the cost of the chips from George's total spending to find out how much he spent on candy bars:
500 cents - 120 cents = 380 cents

Step 4: Calculate the number of candy bars George bought.
Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:
380 cents / 75 cents/candy bar ≈ 5.07 candy bars

439," To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater as follows:

Time for Bernadette = 4 * Time for Wayne
Time for Bernadette = 4 * 4 minutes
Time for Bernadette = 16 minutes

Now, we know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the time it takes Bernadette to reach the theater to find out how much earlier she should leave than Wayne:

Earlier departure time for Bernadette = Time for Bernadette - 5 minutes
Earlier departure time for Bernadette = 16 minutes - 5 minutes
Earlier departure time for Bernadette = 11 minutes

440," To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length × Width

We are given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). However, we need to convert the length from yards to feet to match the units of the area. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can find the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet × Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width in the same units (feet), we can find the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet)

443," To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to determine how long it took him to complete the swim and bike ride.

1. Swim: Jon takes 40 minutes to complete the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes.

10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes

So, James takes 40 - 4 = 36 minutes to complete the swim.

2. Bike ride: Jon takes 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes) for the bike ride. James takes 5 minutes longer, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.

Now, we know that Jon finished the triathlon 10 minutes before James. We can use this information to find out how long it took James to complete the run.

Total time for Jon = Swim + Bike ride + Run
Total time for James = Swim + Bike ride + Run + 10 minutes

Let's denote the time it took James to complete the run as R.

So, we have:

40 (Jon's swim) + 80 (Jon's bike ride) + R (Jon's run) + 10 (Jon's lead) = 36 (James's swim) + 85 (James's bike ride) + R

Now, we can solve for R:

130 + R = 121 + R
R = 121 - 130
R = -9

Since the time cannot be negative, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

We know that Jon finished the triathlon 10 minutes before James, so we can set up the equation as follows:

Now, we can solve for R:

120 + R = 115 + R - 10
R = 115 - 10 - 120
R = -5

Again, we have a negative value for R, which is not possible. We made another mistake in our calculations. Let's try again.

Total time for Jon = Total time for James - 10 minutes

40 (Jon's swim) + 80 (Jon's bike ride) + R (Jon's run) = 36 (James's swim) + 85 (James's bike ride) + R - 10

Now, we can solve for R:

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P.

If you buy a movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately, the total cost would be:
$12 (movie ticket) + P (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $15 + P

If you buy the super ticket, you pay $20 and get popcorn and soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost in this case would be:

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Cost per balloon = $45

Now, we know that the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20 two days later. So, the new cost per balloon is:

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Increase in cost
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. We can do this by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons.

Volume = Length × Width × Height

For one raised bed, the volume is:

Volume = 8 feet × 2 feet × 2 feet = 32 cubic feet

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:

Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

Number of Bags = Total Volume / Volume per Bag

Number of Bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

1. Plane tickets:
Tom is buying 2 plane tickets, and each ticket costs $5000.
Total cost of plane tickets = 2 * $5000 = $10,000

2. Hotel cost:
The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.
First, let's find the increased price per day:
Increased price per day = Normal price per day + (20% of Normal price per day)
Increased price per day = $1500 + (0.20 * $1500)
Increased price per day = $1500 + $300
Increased price per day = $1800

Now, let's find the total cost of the hotel for 3 days:
Total hotel cost = Increased price per day * Number of days
Total hotel cost = $1800 * 3
Total hotel cost = $5400

3. Total trip cost:
Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip.

1. Calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has.
2. Calculate the number of girl Pomeranians.

Step 1: Calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has.
Jana has 27 puppies, and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find the number of Pomeranians, we multiply the total number of puppies by the fraction of Pomeranians:

Number of Pomeranians = Total puppies * Fraction of Pomeranians
Number of Pomeranians = 27 * (2/3)

Now, we simplify the expression:

Number of Pomeranians = (27 * 2) / 3
Number of Pomeranians = 54 / 3
Number of Pomeranians = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Step 2: Calculate the number of girl Pomeranians.
One-third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we multiply the number of Pomeranians by the fraction of girl Pomeranians:

Number of girl Pomeranians = Number of Pomeranians * Fraction of girl Pomeranians

Theory of Mind-Encouragement

Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to understand and attribute mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, to oneself and others. It involves recognizing that others have thoughts, feelings, and perspectives that may differ from one's own. Encouragement, on the other hand, is the act of providing support, motivation, and positive reinforcement to someone to boost their confidence, self-esteem, and overall well-being.

The connection between ToM and encouragement lies in the understanding that individuals have unique thoughts, feelings, and experiences that shape their behavior and responses. By recognizing and acknowledging these differences, we can provide tailored and effective encouragement that resonates with the individual's needs and aspirations.

ToM-Encouragement is a powerful approach that fosters empathy, understanding, and positive relationships. It involves:

1. Recognizing and respecting individual differences: Understanding that each person has their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and acknowledging these differences in our interactions.

2. Active listening: Paying attention to the person's words, tone, and non-verbal cues to better understand their perspective and emotions.

3. Empathy: Putting ourselves in the person's shoes and imagining how they might be feeling or thinking in a given situation.

4. Validation: Acknowledging and affirming the person's feelings, thoughts, and experiences, even if we may not fully understand or agree with them.

5. Positive reinforcement: Providing specific, genuine, and constructive feedback that highlights the person's strengths, progress, and achievements.

6. Goal-setting: Collaborating with the person to set realistic and meaningful goals that align with their values, interests, and aspirations.

7. Support: Offering practical and emotional support to help the person overcome challenges and obstacles, and celebrate their successes.

By incorporating ToM-Encouragement into our interactions, we can create a supportive and empowering environment that fosters personal growth, resilience, and well-being.

We know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Brett is currently 14 years old. So, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now in four years, we can set up the equation:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age

Let A represent Angela's current age. In four years, Angela's age will be A + 4. So, we can write the equation as:

A + 4 = 3 * 14

Now, we can solve for A:

A + 4 = 42
A = 42 - 4
A = 38

499," To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation where the total cost of the first venue equals the total cost of the second venue.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5 per person. So, the total cost for the first venue is:

Cost_1 = $200 + $5x

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per person, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests. So, the total cost for the second venue is:

Cost_2 = $25x

Now, we set the two costs equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for 'x', we first subtract $5x from both sides of the equation:

$200 = $25x - $5x

This simplifies to:

$200 = $20x

Now, we divide both sides by $20 to solve for 'x':

x = $200 / $20

x = 10

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. L + D + B = 43 (total insects collected)
2. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. D = 0.5B (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now, we can use these equations to solve for L.

First, let's express D in terms of B using equation (3):

D = 0.5B

Now, let's substitute D in equation (2) with 0.5B:

L = 0.5B + 7

Now, we can substitute L and D in equation (1) with their expressions in terms of B:

(0.5B + 7) + (0.5B) + B = 43

Combine the terms with B:

2B + 7 = 43

Now, let's solve for B:

2B = 43 - 7
2B = 36
B = 36 / 2
B = 18

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the value of D:

D = 0.5B
D = 0.5 * 18
D = 9

Finally, we can find the value of L:

L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Suzie bought a pack of grape gum for $2.

She paid half as much for the green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.

Now, we know that Suzie spent a total of $7 on gum. We can subtract the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum from the total to find out how much she spent on the strawberry gum.

$7 (total) - $2 (grape gum) - $1 (green apple gum) = $4

Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so we can divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by the number of packs to find the cost per pack.

House cost = 3 * Lot cost

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We can represent this with the equation:

House cost + Lot cost = $120,000

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

3 * Lot cost + Lot cost = $120,000

This simplifies to:

4 * Lot cost = $120,000

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

Lot cost = $120,000 / 4
Lot cost = $30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:

House cost = 3 * $30,000

527," To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the number of people and the time it takes to complete a task. In this case, the task is painting a house.

Let's start by finding out how long it takes for one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house. So, one person would take 5 days * 2 = 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, let's convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours.

Next, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since more people can complete the task faster, we can divide the total time it takes for one person by the number of people. So, 240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

528," To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have, and then add the number of sofas they have.

1. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of chairs she has by adding 2 to the number of sofas:

Chairs (Ophelia) = Sofas (Ophelia) + 2
Chairs (Ophelia) = 20 + 2
Chairs (Ophelia) = 22

2. Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has by multiplying the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3:

Chairs (Jenna) = Chairs (Ophelia) * 3
Chairs (Jenna) = 22 * 3
Chairs (Jenna) = 66

3. Now that we have the number of chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna, we can find the total number of chairs they have by adding the number of chairs each of them has:

Total chairs = Chairs (Ophelia) + Chairs (Jenna)
Total chairs = 22 + 66
Total chairs = 88

4. Finally, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have by adding the total number of chairs to the number of sofas Ophelia has (since Jenna's number of sofas is not given):

Total sofas and chairs = Total chairs + Sofas (Ophelia)
Total sofas and chairs = 88 + 20

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 if he hadn't bought the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we can find the number of CDs by dividing the total amount he could have spent on CDs ($44) by the cost of each CD ($4).

So, the number of CDs Tom could have bought is $44 / $4 = 11 CDs.

Since Tom already bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is 11 - 1 = 10 CDs.

8 weeks - 2 weeks (5 hours) - 1 week (6 hours) = 5 weeks (4 hours)

Now, we can calculate the total number of hours spent working out by multiplying the number of weeks by the hours spent each week and adding the hours from the weeks with different workout times.

(5 weeks * 4 hours) + (2 weeks * 5 hours) + (1 week * 6 hours) = 20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so there are 48 - 8 = 40 people left on the bus.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.
4. After the first stop, there are 40 (remaining passengers) + 40 (new passengers) = 80 people on the bus.

Now, let's move on to the second stop:

5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so there are 80 - 21 = 59 people left on the bus.
6. 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off, so 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus.

1. First, we find Jame's current age. Since Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, we can subtract 5 from 27 to find his current age:

27 - 5 = 22

So, Jame is currently 22 years old.

2. Next, we need to find the cousin's age in 8 years. We know that in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. First, we find Jame's age in 8 years:

22 + 8 = 30

Now, we find twice Jame's age in 8 years:

2 * 30 = 60

Finally, we subtract 5 from this value to find the cousin's age in 8 years:

60 - 5 = 55

So, the cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years.

3. Now, we need to find the cousin's current age. Since we know the cousin's age in 8 years, we can subtract 8 from 55 to find the cousin's current age:

55 - 8 = 47

So, the cousin is currently 47 years old.

4. Finally, we calculate the difference between the ages of Jame and his cousin:

47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25

1. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:

Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, let's find the total cost of the 2 monitors:

Total cost of monitors = Total cost - (Computer cost + Printer cost)
Total cost of monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Total cost of monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Total cost of monitors = $600

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, one monitor cost $300.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

Next, we know that each boy brought back 60 shells. So, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells each girl brought back. According to the problem, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, each girl brought back 60 shells (the same amount as the boys) + 4 * 60 shells (four times as many as the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age:

541," To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125. Since April has 30 days, the first half of the month consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the daily saving amount in the first half of the month as x. Therefore, the total saving in the first half of the month would be 15x.

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half. So, the daily saving amount in the second half of the month would be 2x.

The second half of the month also consists of 15 days, so the total saving in the second half of the month would be 15 * 2x = 30x.

Now, we know that the total saving in the first half and the second half of the month should add up to Elvis's monthly saving target of $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

45x = 1125

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 daily in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he needs to save:

To find the value of 'B', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

B = $100 / 5
B = $20

Now that we know Brad gets $20, we can find out how much Jeff gets by multiplying Brad's amount by 4:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, for two teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

568," To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we first need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

We know that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can set up the equation:

Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20

Substituting Richie's goals with 80, we get:

80 = Mark's goals + 20

Now, we can solve for Mark's goals:

Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Next, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can set up the equation:

Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45

Substituting Richie's goals with 80, we get:

80 = Anna's goals + 45

Now, we can solve for Anna's goals:

Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we have the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

1. Total revenue:
The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. Total cost:
The cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00/loaf ÷ 10 sandwiches/loaf = $0.30/sandwich.
The cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00/10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich.

The new carpet costs $12 per square foot. The area of the bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, which is 216 square feet. So, the cost of the new carpet is:
$12/square foot * 216 square feet = $2,592

2. Cost of the padding:
The padding costs $2 per square foot. The area of the bedroom is 216 square feet. So, the cost of the padding is:
$2/square foot * 216 square feet = $432

3. Cost of removing the old carpet:
The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet. The area of the bedroom is 216 square feet. So, the cost of removing the old carpet is:
$4/square foot * 216 square feet = $864

4. Cost of installing the new carpet:
The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. The area of the bedroom is 216 square feet. So, the cost of installing the new carpet is:

Percentage Error = (Actual Value - Expected Value) / Expected Value * 100

In this case, the actual value is 468 degrees (the temperature Maggie's oven actually reaches when set to 450 degrees), and the expected value is 450 degrees (the temperature Maggie's oven is supposed to reach when set to 450 degrees).

Percentage Error = (468 - 450) / 450 * 100 = 18 / 450 * 100 = 4%

Now that we know the percentage error, we can use this information to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set her oven to as T. We can set up the following equation:

Expected Value + (Percentage Error * Expected Value) = Desired Temperature
450 + (0.04 * 450) = 520

Solving for T:

450 + 18 = 520
T = 520 - 450 = 70

So, Maggie should set her oven to 70 degrees higher than the temperature she would normally set it to. Since she normally sets it to 450 degrees, she should set it to 450 + 70 = 520 degrees.

594," To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to determine how much protein he gets per day. Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can set up a proportion to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms:

(3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms) = (x grams of protein / 200 grams of mushrooms)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3 * 200 = 100 * x

600 = 100x

Dividing both sides by 10.

100 grams of protein.

Let's denote Jerry's current age problem.

Let's denote Jerry's current age as J.

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write this as:

J = 2 * (J - 5)

Now, let's solve for J:

J = 2J - 10
10 = 2J - J
10 = J

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

Now, we need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years. To do this, we simply add 3 to his current age:

596," To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we first need to find the cost of the implants and the crown. Since each implant costs $2000 and George needs 2 implants, the total cost for the implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000. The crown for one implant costs an extra $500, so the total cost for the crown is $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George makes $15 per hour at work, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we can divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

597," Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it can be represented as 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, which can be represented as 3x.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

6x = 180

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 180 / 6
x = 30

Now that we have the value of the smallest angle (x), we can find the measure of the largest angle (3x):

3x = 3 * 30
3x = 90

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

Colby has:
- 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, so 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, so 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels, which are worth 5 cents each, so 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, so 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 (quarters) + 60 (dimes) + 70 (nickels) + 15 (pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of cents by the cost of one gumball:

345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

For the cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
For the birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

4. In the third year, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games.
5. He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year, so that's 5 games for each of the 3 years, which is 15 games.

Now, let's add up all the games:

Initial games: 5
First year games: 12
Second year games: 24
Third year games: 48

603," To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour and then calculate the total amount of chocolate they both make in 12 hours.

First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to find the hourly rate:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds/hour

Now, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. So, we can multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by 3/4:

60 pounds/hour * (3/4) = 45 pounds/hour

Now that we know how many pounds of chocolates both Ruiz and Marissa make in an hour, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate they make together in 12 hours. To do this, we can add their hourly rates and then multiply by 12:

(60 pounds/hour + 45 pounds/hour) * 12 hours = 1050 pounds

So, Ruiz and Marissa make a total of 1050 pounds of chocolate together in 12 hours.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent at the arcade: $8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88.

606," To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month for all tires.
2. Divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per month to find out how many months the tire will last.
3. Convert the number of months to years.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month for all tires.
Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and the car rotates 725 times every 2 miles. So, we need to find out how many times the car rotates in 400 miles.

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles
Rotations per mile = 362.5 rotations/mile

Total rotations per month = Rotations per mile * Total miles driven per month
Total rotations per month = 362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles
Total rotations per month = 145,000 rotations

Step 2: Divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per month to find out how many months the tire will last.

Months before replacement = Total rotations a tire can undergo / Total rotations per month
Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations
Months before replacement ≈ 72.0

Step 3: Convert the number of months to years.

Years before replacement = Months before replacement / 12 months
Years before replacement = 72.0 months / 12 months
Years before replacement = 6 years

607," To find the cost per pump, we first need to determine the total number of pumps in the jumbo bottle. Since the directions say to use 2 pumps for 120 washings, we can assume that there are 2 pumps per wash. Therefore, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 2 pumps/wash * 120 washings = 240 pumps.

Now, we know that the jumpo bottle costs $24.00 and contains 240 pumps. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10

To express the cost per pump in cents, we multiply the dollar amount by 100:

Cost per pump = $0.10 * 100 cents/dollar
Cost per pump = 10 cents

Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.30 * $25 = $7.50

Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price of the shirt to find the discounted price.

Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, let's add the price of the shorts to the discounted price of the shirt to find the total cost of the outfit.

Total cost = $17.50 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $52.50

647," To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil and clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's find out how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he has to dig through 24 feet of soil. So, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Time_soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Now, let's find out how long it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He can dig half as fast through clay, which means his rate is 2 feet/hour (half of 4 feet/hour). He has to dig through 8 feet of clay.

Time_clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

400 = 1/2 * Green Hat Sales

To find the Green Hat Sales, we multiply both sides by 2:

Green Hat Sales = 400 * 2 = $800

Now, let's find out the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total Sales (Month 1) = Red Hat Sales + Green Hat Sales = $400 + $800 = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Total Sales (Month 2) = 3/4 * Total Sales (Month 1) = 3/4 * $1200 = $900

Finally, to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from both months:

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, so the cost of 1/2 pound of almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5. The cost of walnuts is $15 per pound, so the cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, so the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2. The cost of walnuts is $15 per pound, so the cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

680," To determine if Jack and the 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of all individuals and compare it to the elevator's maximum load capacity.


The average weight of an adult is given as 80 kg. If there are 9 adults in total (Jack plus 8 others), we can calculate the total weight as follows:


Total weight = Number of adults × Average weight per adult

Total weight = 9 adults × 80 kg/adult

Total weight = 720 kg


Now, we compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load capacity:


Maximum load capacity = 700 kg

Total weight = 720 kg


Difference = Total weight - Maximum load capacity

Difference = 720 kg - 700 kg

Difference = 20 kg


Therefore, Jack and the 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies they have:

682," To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final length of the dress to find the original length. We know that the final dress length is 140cm, which includes a 50% increase in length and an additional 20cm for the lace trim.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the increased length is 1.5x.

Adding the 20cm lace trim, the final dress length becomes 1.5x + 20cm.

We know that the final dress length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, we can solve for x:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

683," To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in each mode.

In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. Therefore, it takes him 60/2 = 30 minutes to mow half of the lawn in turtle mode.

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, it takes him 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half of the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time it took Chris to mow half of the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

687," To solve this problem, we first need to establish the relationships between the ages of the twins and the triplets. Let's denote the age of one triplet as 'x'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin would be 'x + 7'.

Given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, the combined ages of all the children would be the sum of the ages of the triplets and the twins. This can be represented as:

3x (ages of triplets) + 2(x + 7) (ages of twins) = 44

Now, we can solve this equation for 'x':

3x + 2x + 14 = 44
5x = 44 - 14
5x = 30
x = 30 / 5
x = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old. Now, we can find the age of one of the twins:

Now, we know that Manolo spent $3.20 in total for five lollipops and four candies. So, the cost of the four candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the four candies by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we want to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Rong's monthly savings = 20 coins

Neil's additional monthly savings = (2/5) * Rong's monthly savings
= (2/5) * 20 coins
= 8 coins

Now, let's find out Neil's total monthly savings:

Neil's monthly savings = Rong's monthly savings + Neil's additional monthly savings

691," First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

Next, let's find the total bill. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's represent the total bill as x. So, the heartworm check cost is 0.60 * x.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total bill:

$40 (vaccines) + 0.60 * x (heartworm check) = x (total bill)

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation:

$40 + 0.60 * x = x
$40 = x - 0.60 * x
$40 = 0.40 * x
x = $40 / 0.40
x = $100

712," To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how much candy each person eats in two weeks.

There are 14 days in two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks, she eats:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks, she eats:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

Now, we subtract the amount of candy each person ate from their initial amount of 100 pieces.

Ginger has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Amy has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

763," To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cases of shingles needed for each house and then determine the number needed for the third house.

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. According to the problem, the second house needs half the amount of the first house, so it needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it needs 2x cases.

Now, we know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + x/2 + 2x = 250

To solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. In this case, the common denominator is 2:

2x/2 + x/2 + 4x/2 = 250

Now, we can combine the fractions:

(2x + x + 4x) / 2 = 250

7x / 2 = 250

To isolate x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

7x = 500

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 7:

x = 500 / 7

x ≈ 71.43

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

x = 72 cases for the first house

779," To solve this problem, we need to find the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, and then add those distances together to find the total distance to their vacation spot.

First, let's find the driving speed. We know that they drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. So, the distance they drove can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_driven = 50 mph × 6 hours = 300 miles

Now, let's find the hiking speed. We know that they hiked at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is:

Half_speed = 50 mph / 2 = 25 mph

So, their hiking speed is:

Hiking_speed = Half_speed - 5 mph = 25 mph - 5 mph = 20 mph

Now, we can find the distance they hiked. We know that they hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour. So, the distance they hiked can be calculated as:

Distance_hiked = Hiking_speed × Time
Distance_hiked = 20 mph × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Finally, we can find the total distance to their vacation spot by adding the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:

Total_distance = Distance_driven + Distance_hiked
Total_distance = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles

780," To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate their individual scores based on the given information.

Let's assume Emma jumps on E enemies and collects B berries. Then, Ava jumps on E + 8 enemies and collects B + 3 berries.

Emma's score:
Score = (10 * E) + (5 * B) + (30 * 0) = 10E + 5B

Ava's score:
Score = (10 * (E + 8)) + (5 * (B + 3)) + (30 * (-4)) = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 - 120 = 10E + 5B - 25

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:

40 * 1/4 = 10 smart TVs

2. Analog TVs: Since one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, we multiply the total number of TVs sold (40) by 1/8:

40 * 1/8 = 5 analog TVs

Now, we know that Samwell sold 10 smart TVs and 5 analog TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:

814," To determine the total amount of money spent, we first need to calculate the total time each person played and then find out how many quarters were used for each person.

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long, which is 10 minutes per quarter.
3. One friend can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 30 minutes per quarter.

Now, let's convert the total playtime of 4 hours into minutes:
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Next, we'll calculate the number of quarters each person used:

1. Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
2. Each of the two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters per friend
3. The better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used:
Total quarters = Jack's quarters + (2 friends * their quarters) + better friend's quarters

Let's denote the amount of each ingredient as follows:
- Zest = Z
- Fragrance = F
- Salt = S
- Oil = O
- Sugar = Su

From the problem, we know that:
1. Z = F
2. S = Su
3. O = 2S
4. O = 2Z

Now, we can use these relationships to express all the ingredients in terms of Z:
1. F = Z
2. S = Z
3. O = 2Z

Since Tanya fills a 10-ounce jar each time, the total amount of all ingredients combined should equal 10 ounces:
Z + F + S + O + Su = 10

Substitute the relationships into the equation:
Z + Z + Z + 2Z + Z = 10
6Z = 10

Now, solve for Z:
Z = 10 / 6
Z = 5/3 ounces

Now that we have the value of Z, we can find the amount of oil (O) using the relationship O = 2Z:
O = 2 * (5/3)

Hours walked on the second day = 1/2 * Hours walked on the first day
Hours walked on the second day = 1/2 * 8 hours
Hours walked on the second day = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time Sandy walked in the two days by adding the hours walked on both days:

Total hours walked = Hours walked on the first day + Hours walked on the second day
Total hours walked = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total hours walked = 12 hours

To convert the total hours walked into minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

3. Add the additional amount Roy has saved to Anthony's total to find Roy's total savings.

Step 1: Determine how much money Anthony has.
Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate how much more Roy has saved compared to Anthony.
Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more Roy has saved, we can calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:
40% of Anthony's savings = 0.40 * Anthony's savings
40% of Anthony's savings = 0.40 * $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

Step 3: Add the additional amount Roy has saved to Anthony's total to find Roy's total savings.

We know that there are 20 students in total, 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is the total number of students minus the number of students who are good at only one subject.

Number of students good at both subjects = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)

Number of students good at both subjects = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only and the number of students who are good at both subjects.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both subjects

Total number of students good at math = 5 + 7 = 12

846," To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes to perform, including their time on stage and their time off stage. 

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is:

2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting stage) = 10 minutes per group

Now, we need to consider the intermission time. The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to 120 minutes (2 hours * 60 minutes/hour). We subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time:

120 minutes (total concert time) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes available for performances

Finally, we divide the available time for performances by the time each group takes:

110 minutes (available time for performances) / 10 minutes (time per group) = 11 groups

847," To solve this problem, we first need to determine the annual interest rate. The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. Therefore, the annual interest rate is 3/4 * $300 = $225.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

In this case, P = $300, R = $225/100 = 2.25 (since the rate is given in dollars, we need to convert it to a decimal), and T = 3 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

I = $300 * 2.25 * 3 = $2025

This is the total interest earned over 3 years. To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the original principal amount to the interest earned:

Total amount = Principal + Interest = $300 + $2025 = $2325

877," To find out how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, we first need to determine how many chickens he sold and then calculate the total revenue from those sales. After that, we can find out the cost of the chickens he sold by subtracting the desired profit from the total revenue.

1. Calculate the number of chickens sold:
Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.
Number of chickens sold = (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens

2. Calculate the total revenue from the chicken sales:
Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

3. Calculate the cost of the chickens sold:
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.

878," To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold is 32, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together.

32 (total glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 18 glasses

Now, we know that Micah and Mitchell sold 18 glasses together, and since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide this number by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold.

18 (Micah and Mitchell's glasses) ÷ 2 = 9 glasses

So, Micah sold 9 glasses and Mitchell also sold 9 glasses. Now, we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5 glasses

Total cost = Length of rope * Cost per meter
Total cost = 20 meters * $2/meter
Total cost = $40

Next, we need to calculate how much Sarah will spend on the new rope. Since the new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah has $40, we can find out how many meters of rope she can buy:

Meters of new rope = Total money / Cost per meter
Meters of new rope = $40 / $1.5/meter
Meters of new rope = 26.67 meters (rounded to two decimal places)

Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost of the new rope would be:

Cost of new rope = Meters of new rope * Cost per meter
Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter
Cost of new rope = $39

Finally, we can calculate how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:

He had $150 initially.

He spent $8 on popcorn and $2 on candy, so he spent a total of $8 + $2 = $10.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount: $150 - $10 = $140.

Next, we need to find out how much he spent on movies before the last day of the month.

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and each movie costs $10, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies.

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

James gets them for 40% off, so we need to calculate the discount amount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

Now, let's find the final cost after the discount:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs, so he sells them for $40. However, since he bought each CD for $15, he would have originally paid $75 for the 5 CDs (5 CDs * $15/CD = $75).

945," First, let's calculate the time James spends swimming the first 60% of the distance. The distance he swims is 60% of 20 miles, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time he spends swimming this distance is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time he spends resting on the island. He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the time he spends swimming the remaining 40% of the distance. The distance he swims is 40% of 20 miles, which is 0.4 * 20 = 8 miles. Since he swims at half the speed, his pace is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time he spends swimming this distance is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, let's add up all the times to find the total time it takes James to get across the lake. The total time is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy, and each copy costs $5.
So, the commission for each copy of the New York Times is 10% of $5, which is (10/100) * $5 = $0.50.

He sold 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

For the Wall Street Journal:
Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy, and each copy costs $15.
So, the commission for each copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15, which is (8/100) * $15 = $1.20.

He sold 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $1.20 = $12.

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days):

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Since 700 patients are admitted in 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be:

200 (initially occupied) + 700 (admitted patients) = 900 beds

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon: A + S + D = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: A = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught: S = 4D - 13

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A and S from equations (2) and (3) into equation (1):

(S + 5) + (4D - 13) + D = 339

Simplify the equation:

S + 5 + 4D - 13 + D = 339
S + 5D - 8 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation (3) into the simplified equation:

(4D - 13) + 5D - 8 = 339
9D - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides of the equation:

9D = 360

Now, divide both sides by 9:

D = 40

Now that we have the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe (D = 40), we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan (S) using equation (3):

S = 4D - 13

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

For gingerbread, Sunny sold a total of 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

For apple pie, Sunny sold a total of 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes.

Now, we'll calculate the total earnings for each item:

Gingerbread earnings: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
Apple pie earnings: 26 boxes * $15/box = $390

Finally, we'll add the earnings from both items to find the total earnings for two days:

Total earnings = Gingerbread earnings + Apple pie earnings
Total earnings = $150 + $390 = $540

Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. If she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, she will be outside a total of 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen for her entire vacation.

Now, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles she will need to pack. To do this, we will divide the total amount of sunscreen she needs (32 ounces) by the size of each bottle (8 ounces).

The discount on the blue car's price is 40% of $100, which is (40/100) * $100 = $40.

Now, we can find the price of the red car by subtracting the discount from the blue car's price: $100 - $40 = $60.

Finally, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the red and blue cars: $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

979," To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B.

We know that Emil is currently 19 years old, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation:

24 = 1/2 * (D + 5)

We add 5 to D because Emil will be 5 years older than he is now.

Solving for D, we get:

D = 2 * 24 - 5 = 43

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So we can write the equation:

24 = 2 * (B + 5)

We add 5 to B because Emil will be 5 years older than he is now.

Solving for B, we get:

B = 24/2 - 5 = 7

So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:

D + B = 43 + 7 = 50

Now, let's calculate the space needed for each plant, including the space between them. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, so the total space needed for each plant is 1 foot (width of the flower) + 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 2.5 feet.

Next, let's find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we'll divide the length of the flower bed by the space needed for each plant:

111 feet (length of the flower bed) / 2.5 feet (space needed for each plant) = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Now, let's calculate how many more plants Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 plants (total needed) - 17 plants (already owned) = 27 plants

They also have 10 carnations, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, the total soil needed for carnations is:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil needed for sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds

They have a 30-pound bag of soil, so we subtract the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total soil available:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect on low is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect on high is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

3. The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, during which the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

Now, we need to find the net cooling effect by subtracting the warming effect from the total cooling effect:

Total cooling effect = 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees
Warming effect = 4 degrees
Net cooling effect = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, the difference in years between the two times Bill saw the comet is 75 years.

So, we can set up the equation:

3F - F = 75

Solving this equation, we get:

2F = 75
F = 75 / 2
F = 37.5

So, Bill's father was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 37.5 = 112.5 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

However, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill saw the comet a second time 75 years after the first time, we can subtract 75 from Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time to find out his age when he saw the comet for the first time.

1) 4P = 64 (Peter's total chocolate bars)
2) 7M = 56 (Martha's total chocolate bars)

Now, we can solve these equations to find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes:

From equation 1:
P = 64 / 4
P = 16

From equation 2:
M = 56 / 7
M = 8

Now, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes:

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped:
3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the first day, so she pumped:
2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, so she pumped:
1/3 * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons

Now, let's find out the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:
Total water pumped = (Wanda's first day + Ms. B's first day) + (Wanda's second day + Ms. B's second day)

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write this relationship as:

S = 2L

Next, we know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which costs $4. Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is $4 * 3 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large and small stuffed animals is $120. We can write this as an equation:

$12L + $4S = $120

Now, we can substitute the value of S from the first equation into the second equation:

$12L + $4(2L) = $120

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$12L + $8L = $120

Combining like terms, we have:

$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20, we find the number of large stuffed animals sold:

L = $120 / $20 = 6

Now, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold by substituting the value of L into the first equation:

S = 2L = 2 * 6 = 12

1035," To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to determine how many bottles of soda he will place along the driveway. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet, we can divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Now that we know Richard will place 8 bottles of soda, we can calculate the total time it will take him to set off all the fountains. Since it takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each fountain:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

However, we need to consider that Richard will not need to travel to the next bottle after setting off the last fountain. Therefore, we need to subtract one second from the total time:

40 seconds - 1 second = 39 seconds

So, it will take Richard a total of 39 seconds to set of 39 seconds.

1038," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of loans Jim took and the total income he lost by not working while in college. Then, we will calculate how long it would take for his tripled income to cover these costs.

1. Calculate the total loans:
Jim took $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total loans are:
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

2. Calculate the total income lost:
Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college, and he didn't work for 4 years while in college, so the total income lost is:
$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

3. Calculate Jim's tripled income:
After college, Jim's income tripled, so his new annual income is:
$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

4. Calculate the time it takes to earn the equivalent of the loans and lost income:
Now, we need to find out how long it would take for Jim's tripled income to cover the total loans and lost income. We can set up an equation:

$75,000/year * x years = $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income)

Solving for x:

x = ($200,000 + $100,000) / $75,000/year

1039," To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric he requires. Since each piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.

Length of fabric: 6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width of fabric: 8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we need to calculate the area of each piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Area = Length × Width

For one piece of fabric:
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

1. Monday: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. Tuesday: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of Monday's delivery, we divide the number of letters delivered on Monday by 5:

425 / 5 = 85

Now, we add 17 to this number to find the total number of letters delivered on Tuesday:

85 + 17 = 102

3. Wednesday: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday, we multiply the number of letters delivered on Tuesday by 2:

102 * 2 = 204

Now, we add 5 to this number to find the total number of letters delivered on Wednesday:

204 + 5 = 209

Now that we have the number of letters delivered on each day, we can add them together to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

According to the problem, in the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls in the first set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls in the third set.

The total number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in all three sets is 19. We can write this as an equation:

x (second set) + (x + 4) (first set) + x/2 (third set) = 19

Now, let's solve for x:

x + x + 4 + x/2 = 19
2x + 8 + x = 38 (multiplying the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction)
3x + 8 = 38

Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400

Next, we calculate the total cost of mailing the small and big coupons separately.

Cost of mailing small coupons = 700 * $0.05 = $35
Cost of mailing big coupons = 1400 * $0.15 = $210

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost of mailing all the coupons.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 sandwiches, Sidney had 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs left.

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs.

1069," To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had issues, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = (1/4) * Total number of trucks
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = (1/4) * 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 5

Now, we know that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertilisers. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilisers is:

Number of trucks that delivered = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks with mechanical failures
Number of trucks that delivered = 20 - 5
Number of trucks that delivered = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks that delivered * Tons of fertiliser per truck
Total tons of fertiliser = 15 * 20
Total tons of fertiliser = 300

Now, let's consider the grocery store's promotion. For every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets another half-pound for free. Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he will get 3 half-pounds for free (one for each pound purchased).

So, Dennis will pay for 6 pounds of butter and receive 3 half-pounds for free, which is equivalent to 1.5 pounds. In total, he will have 7.5 pounds of butter (6 pounds + 1.5 pounds).

The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the cost of 6 pounds of butter is 6 * $4.00 = $24.00.

According to the problem, Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent 1/4 * M. Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent 1/3 * R.

After spending, they each had $60 left. So, we can write the following equations:

M - 1/4 * M = 60
R - 1/3 * R = 60

Now, let's solve these equations for M and R:

M * (1 - 1/4) = 60

M = 60 * (4/3)
M = 80

R * (1 - 1/3) = 60
R * (2/3) = 60
R = 60 * (3/2)
R = 90

Now that we know Maggie initially had $80 and Riza initially had $90, we can find out how much money they have left in total:

Total money left = (Maggie's initial money - Maggie's spent money) + (Riza's initial money - Riza's spent money)

4. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed all three monkeys for a week (7 days).
5. To find out how many bananas are eaten by all three monkeys in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7: 24 bananas/day * 7 days = 168 bananas/week.
6. Now, we need to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey each day. We know that 315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas are left for the third monkey for the entire week.

Now, we can find the total cost of the 15 roses by multiplying the cost per rose by the number of roses: $1.25 * 15 = $18.75.

Jenny arrived with five 5-dollar bills, which means she had a total of $25. To find out how much change she should receive, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount she had: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters make up $6.25. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we multiply the number of dollars by 4: $6 * 4 = 24 quarters.

Now, we need to account for the remaining 25 cents. Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar, we can divide the remaining cents by 25 to find out how many additional quarters are needed: 25 / 25 = 1 quarter.

1103," Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as J. According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is J/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (J/5) = J/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since there are 6 jellyfish that changed color, the remaining jellyfish that stay blue are J - 6.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of jellyfish:

Large jellyfish that change color + Small jellyfish that stay blue = Total jellyfish
(J/15) + (J - 6) = J

To solve for J, we first multiply the entire equation by 15 to eliminate the fractions:

J + 15(J - 6) = 15J

Now, distribute the 15:

J + 15J - 90 = 15J

1. Calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement:
Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary during retirement. So, the total amount she needs to save is:
$100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year

Since she plans to save for 20 years, the total amount she needs to save is:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000

2. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary. So, the amount she saves each year is:
$100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000

3. Determine how many more years Lauren needs to work:
To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

Since Lauren has already worked for some years, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked from the total number of years she needs to work.

2) A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
3) C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
4) C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

From equation 2, we know that A = M.

Substitute A for M in equation 1:

A + A + C + S = 56
2A + C + S = 56

Now, substitute C for S + 12 from equation 4:

2A + (S + 12) + S = 56
2A + 2S + 12 = 56

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2A + 2S = 44

Divide both sides by 2:

Now, substitute S for C - 12 from equation 4:

A + (C - 12) = 22
A + C - 12 = 22

Add 12 to both sides:

Valerie's salary = 1/2 * Brother's salary

We know Valerie's salary is $5000, so we can substitute that into the equation:

$5000 = 1/2 * Brother's salary

To find the brother's salary, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

$10000 = Brother's salary

Now that we know Valerie's brother earns $10000, we can find their combined salary:

Combined salary = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary
Combined salary = $5000 + $10000

1133," First, let's find out how fast Grandma walks on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we divide the distance by the time:

Speed on the beach = Distance / Time
Speed on the beach = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed on the beach = 0.05 miles per minute

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach
Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute
Speed on the sidewalk = 0.1 miles per minute

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

The cost of each pack of bagels is $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs, so the total cost before the discount is:

Total cost = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final cost:

Final cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Russell ordered 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels, so he ordered a total of:

Total bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

2. 6-year-old tree: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. 7-year-old tree: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. 8-year-old tree: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We will calculate the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree later.
5. 9-year-old tree: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. 10-year-old tree: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. Since it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Finally, we sum up the number of fruits produced in each year:

50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 2350 fruits.

1168," Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:

4B + B + Y = 37
5B + Y = 37

Next, we can substitute the second equation into the above equation:

5B + (B + 7) = 37
6B + 7 = 37

Now, we can solve for B:

6B = 37 - 7
6B = 30
B = 30 / 6
B = 5

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope using the first equation:

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P respectively. According to the problem, R = W = P.

We also know that half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is Y = 1/2 * 12 pints = 6 pints.

Now, we can write an equation for the total amount of paint used:

R + W + P + Y = 12 pints

Since R = W = P, we can rewrite the equation as:

First, let's find the area of one bedroom:
Area of one bedroom = length × width = 20 feet × 12 feet = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4:
Total area of bedrooms = 240 square feet × 4 = 960 square feet

Next, let's find the area of the living room. We know that it is 5 times bigger than one bedroom:
Area of living room = 5 × area of one bedroom = 5 × 240 square feet = 1200 square feet

Now, we have the area of the bedrooms and the living room. We also know that the rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Finally, we add all the areas together to find the total area of the house:
Total area of the house = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house

So, the new box has 20 more pods than the original box. Adding this to the original 100 pods, we get:

100 + 20 = 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box has 120 pods and costs $12. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run with the new box is equal to the number of pods in the box.

He used half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he used 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

After paying the bill, Thomas had 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

Thomas then tripled his money, so he had 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, Thomas converted all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount of money by 5.

1215," To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we first need to calculate the total volume of the jar, then find out how many jelly beans it can hold considering the packing efficiency, and finally estimate the number of red jelly beans based on his estimation.

1. Calculate the volume of the jar:
The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. So, the volume of the jar (V_jar) can be calculated as follows:

V_jar = length * width * height
V_jar = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches
V_jar = 540 cubic inches

2. Calculate the total number of jelly beans the jar can hold:
Tim knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. However, he also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. So, the volume of each jelly bean (V_jelly_bean) is:

V_jelly_bean = .15 cubic inches * 80%
V_jelly_bean = .12 cubic inches

Now, we can find out how many jelly beans the jar can hold (N_jelly_beans) by dividing the volume of the jar by the volume of each jelly bean:

N_jelly_beans = V_jar / V_jelly_bean
N_jelly_beans = 540 cubic inches / .12 cubic inches
N_jelly_beans = 4500 jelly beans

3. Estimate the number of red jelly beans:
Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the estimated number of red jelly beans (N_red_jelly_beans) can be calculated as follows:

N_red_jelly_beans = N_jelly_beans * 30%
N_red_jelly_beans = 4500 jelly beans * 30%
N_red_jelly_beans = 1350 red jelly beans

4. Calculate how far off Tim's guess was:
The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. So, the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans (Difference) can be calculated as follows:

According to the problem, we have the following relationship between the number of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes:

B = 5S - 4

We also know that the total number of ice cubes (strawberry and blueberry) is 116:

S + B = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

S + (5S - 4) = 116

Combine the terms with S:

6S - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:

6S = 120

Now, divide both sides by 6 to find the number of strawberry cubes:

S = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the first equation:

1266," To find out how much dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of food for each breed and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

1. Daily consumption for German Shepherds:
There are 3 German Shepherds, and each consumes 5 kilograms of food per day. So, the total daily consumption for German Shepherds is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

2. Daily consumption for Bulldogs:
There are 2 Bulldogs, and each consumes 3 kilograms of food per day. So, the total daily consumption for Bulldogs is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

3. Total daily consumption for all dogs:
Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to find the total daily consumption for all dogs: 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

4. Weekly consumption for all dogs:
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to find the weekly consumption: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

We are given that there are 54 red candies. The problem states that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, we can calculate the number of orange candies as follows:

Number of orange candies = 2 * Number of red candies
Number of orange candies = 2 * 54
Number of orange candies = 108

Next, we are told that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, we can calculate the number of yellow candies as follows:

Number of yellow candies = 1/2 * Number of red candies
Number of yellow candies = 1/2 * 54
Number of yellow candies = 27

Now, we can find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies = Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies
Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies = 54 + 108 + 27
Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies = 189

Finally, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:

The cost of the ice cream is $3.50.
The cost of the movie tickets is $7.50 each, and since she bought two tickets, the total cost for the tickets is $7.50 * 2 = $15.00.
The cost of the bracelet is $8.50.

Now, we can add all these expenses together:
$3.50 (ice cream) + $15.00 (movie tickets) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $27.00

Janet started with $40.00, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the amount she started with:

1303," First, let's find out how many holes the dog digs during Nate's vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, which is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Now, let's consider the situation after Nate gets home. The dog continues to dig 6 holes every night, and Nate fills in 9 holes a day. This means that the net number of holes dug each day is 6 (dug by the dog) - 9 (filled by Nate) = -3 holes.

Since the dog is digging fewer holes than Nate is filling, the total number of holes will eventually reach zero. To find out how many days it takes for the total number of holes to reach zero, we can divide the total number of holes dug during Nate's vacation by the net number of holes dug each day: 84 holes / 3 holes per day = 28 days.

Now, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 28 days / 7 days per week = 4 weeks.

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Butler High School enrollment = (3/4) * Norman High School enrollment
Butler High School enrollment = (3/4) * 4000
Butler High School enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference between the average enrollments at the two schools:

Let's start by finding out how many test tubes and Petri dishes Igor had:

1. Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so he had 16/2 = 8 test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, and Igor gathered two more than the number requested, so he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Now, let's find out how many beakers Igor had:

3. The total number of items Igor had on the lab bench was 29. We already know he had 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, so the remaining items must be beakers. Therefore, Igor had 29 - 8 - 16 = 5 beakers on the lab bench.

Since Igor had the correct number of beakers initially (7), we can now find out how many beakers he lost:

1310," To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.

Let's denote Vanessa's speed as V and Aaron's speed as A. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can write:

A = 2V

We also know that Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so if Aaron ran x miles, Vanessa ran 2x miles. Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can write:

2x = 4
x = 2

So, Aaron ran 2 miles.

Now, we know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Aaron, we have:

16 minutes = 2 miles / A

We already know that A = 2V, so we can substitute this into the equation:

16 minutes = 2 miles / (2V)

Now, we can solve for V:

16 minutes = 1 mile / V

V = 1 mile / 16 minutes

Now that we have Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Vanessa, we have:

Time = 4 miles / (1 mile / 16 minutes)

Time = 4 * 16 minutes

Time = 64 minutes

1. Calculate the earnings per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- They order 2 meals per reservation, costing $5 each. So, the total cost of meals per night is 6 reservations * 2 meals * $5 = $60.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total earnings per night are $60 (from meals) + $5 (from wine) = $65.

1313," To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons.

The vendor made a profit of 25% on the total cost price of $80. So, the profit amount is:

Profit = (Profit percentage / 100) * Total cost price
Profit = (25 / 100) * $80
Profit = 0.25 * $80
Profit = $20

Now, we add the profit to the total cost price to get the total selling price:

Total selling price = Total cost price + Profit
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

The vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100. To find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons

1. Calculate the discounted price of the radiator:
The radiator costs $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discounted price, we multiply the original price by the percentage that Mark will pay (100% - 80% = 20%).

Discounted price = $400 * 20% = $400 * 0.2 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
