The companion star has been identified as the k1v variable star V1333Aql, with an orbital period of 19 hours. The outbursts of Aql x-1 are generally characterized by a fast rise followed by a slow decay, with an equivalent bremsstrahlung temperature of 10 keV. The X-ray spectrum is soft with an equivalent bremsstrahlung temperature of 10 keV, and the outburst luminosity decreases rapidly, fading by about 30% in 11 hours. The outburst is characterized by a sharp decrease around mjd 50512, which is well described by an exponential decay with an 17-fold folding time. The spectrum is consistent with a black body temperature of 10 keV, but the radius decreases by a factor of 19 from the decay phase to quiescence. The ratio of the 0.510 keV luminosities in the power law and black body components decreases by a factor of five between the first bepposax observation and quiescence.

{"idx": 412, "result": 0, "generated": "* The Comanche program was established in 1983 to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet. The contractor team of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Helicopter Company were expected to design a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing the primary missions of armed reconnaissance and attack. Critical to achieving these capabilities are the successful development of advanced technologies, including composite materials, advanced avionics and propulsion systems, and sophisticated software and hardware. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals in order to realize significantly lower operating and support costs predicted for this program and achieve a wartime operational availability for the Comanche of 6 hours per day. * The Army's restructuring of the Comanche program continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required. The Army proposed, and was subsequently granted approval, to buy six \"early operational capability\" aircraft, in addition to the two prototypes that were to be acquired under the Secretary's decision. According to program officials, these aircraft are estimated to cost in excess of $300 million. The Army does not consider these aircraft as either prototype or low-rate initial production aircraft; however, program officials believe that when these aircraft are fielded, the Army will be able to better evaluate the Comanche's mission capability. * The Comanche was originally justified to the Congress as a relatively inexpensive aircraft. However, since 1985, the program has experienced significant increases in program acquisition unit cost. Funding reductions have caused the program to undergo significant restructuring, resulting in sharp decreases in planned acquisition quantities and lengthening of development schedules, thereby increasing Comanche program costs. * The Comanche program's uncertainties in software development and aircraft maintainability increase the risk that the aircraft will not perform successfully. We believe the restructuring provides additional time to resolve these issues before the decision to enter production is made. The Comanche will be the most computerized, software-intensive Army helicopter ever built. The Army estimates that about 1.4 million lines of code are required to perform and integrate mission critical functions. With additional ground support and training software to be developed, the total program will have more than 2.7 million lines of code. This compares to about 573,000 lines of code for the upgraded Apache attack helicopter with fire control radar.

{"idx": 474, "result": 0, "generated": "* Medicare is a federal health insurance program designed to assist elderly and disabled beneficiaries. It covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and certain home health services. Claims are paid by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers.\n* Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from that of most federal programs. Most federal agencies, under the Competition in Contracting Act and its implementing regulations known as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), generally may contract with any qualified entity for any authorized purpose so long as that entity is not debarred from government contracting and the contract is not for what is essentially a government function. Agencies are to use contractors that have a track record of successful past performance or that demonstrate a current superior ability to perform.\n* Medicare, however, is authorized to deviate from the FAR under provisions of the Social Security Act enacted in 1965. For example, there is no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts. Rather, intermediaries are selected in a process called nomination by provider associations, such as the American Hospital Association. When one of the local Blue plans declines to renew its subcontract, the Association nominates the replacement contractor.\n* Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms. Freeing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities able to perform needed tasks would enable Medicare to benefit from efficiency and performance improvements related to competition.

The tick was easily distinguished from Amblyomma nitidum and Amblyomma geoemydae, which are distributed in the far east Asia. The warm temperature and subtropical vegetation fauna are known to be a proper environmental condition for A. testudinarium. The tick was identified as a female adult of A. testudinarium based on morphological characteristics. The geographic range of distribution of A. testudinarium extends from the southern coastal area of Jeollanam-do to the southwestern costal area of the Korean peninsula, with a site for feeding chosen. The histopathology of skin responses to infection with the present female A. testudinarium showed that the dermis was infiltrated with various inflammatory cells associated with both acute and chronic reactions, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Infected canines repel eggs along with feces and infect soil, water, and vegetables. Humans can become infected accidentally by eating contaminated food or water, or by direct contact with infected dogs. The disease is common in most parts of the world, especially in countries with animal husbandry and close relationships with animals. Epidemiological, clinical, and pathological symptoms vary depending on age, gender, infection severity, cyst size, and involved organ. The prevalence rate of hydatidosis in humans in Iran has been reported as 11.5% to 13.7%, with a higher rate in cities like Mashhad, Ghoochan, Neishabour, and Fariman. The prevalence rate of hydatidosis in the intermediate host has been reported as 1.1% to 13.7%, with a higher rate in cities like Mashhad, Ghoochan, Neishabour, and Fariman.

{"idx": 658, "result": 0, "generated": "* Myosin Va (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n- terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain. Myova's directed movement is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in the motor's processive motion as each head takes 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required to activate the atpase activity of myova; however, in the presence of high calcium ( > 1 m), motor processivity is reduced and one or more calmodulin may dissociate from each lever arm. Single myova are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. Myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusion search. The structural domains that are critical to myova's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction.
