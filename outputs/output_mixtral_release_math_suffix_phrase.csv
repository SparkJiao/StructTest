2," First, we need to find the increased value of the house after repairs. We know that the value of the house increased by 150%, so:

Increased value = Original value + (Original value * Increase percentage)

However, we don't know the original value of the house. But we can find it using the information about the purchase price and Josh's investment in repairs. Since the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, this means that the cost of repairs is equal to 150% of the original value:

Cost of repairs = Original value * Increase percentage
$50,000 = Original value * 1.5

Now, let's find the original value:

Original value = Cost of repairs / Increase percentage
Original value = $50,000 / 1.5
Original value = $33,333.33

So, the original value of the house was approximately $33,333.33. Now, we can find the increased value:

Increased value = Original value + (Original value * Increase percentage)
Increased value = $33,333.33 + ($33,333.33 * 1.5)
Increased value = $33,333.33 + $50,000
Increased value = $83,333.33

Josh spent a total of $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs), which is $130,000.

The final answer is: Josh made a profit of approximately $83,333.33 - $130,000 = -$46,666.67. In other words, Josh had a loss of around $46,666.67.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

4," First, let's determine the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens throughout the day. She gives them 15 cups in the morning, 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total is:

15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups

Now, we know that Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per day, distributed across three meals. To find out how many cups Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to figure out how many cups of feed have already been given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon meals.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, so Wendi gives her chickens:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

In the morning and afternoon, Wendi has already given her chickens:

40 cups (morning + afternoon)

To find out how many cups are left for the final meal, we can subtract the number of cups already given from the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens each day:

60 cups (total daily feed) - 40 cups (morning + afternoon) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

8," First, let's calculate how far John traveled during the first 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance equals speed multiplied by time, so he covered 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

Next, since John spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, he didn't cover any additional distance during that time.

Then, John drove for another half-hour at a speed of 30 mph, covering 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.

Finally, John drove the remaining time of the 4 hours at 80 mph. Since he had already traveled 180 + 15 = 195 miles and spent 2 hours in traffic, he had 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours left to drive. During this time, he covered 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.

To find the total distance John is from home at the end of these 4 hours, we add the distances he covered during each segment: 180 miles (first segment) + 15 miles (third segment) + 120 miles (fourth segment) = 315 miles.

Next, we need to calculate Eliza's overtime earnings for the additional 5 hours she worked beyond the first 40 hours. Overtime is paid at a rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime rate is:

Overtime rate = Regular hourly rate * Overtime multiplier

Her overtime earnings would then be:

Overtime earnings = Overtime rate * Overtime hours
= $12/hour * 5 hours

12," To find out when Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to determine when the income from selling lemons exceeds the costs of watering, feeding, and planting the tree.

First, let's calculate the net profit per year:
Income from lemons = Number of lemons * Price per lemon
                              = 7 * $1.5
                              = $10.50

Annual costs = Watering and feeding cost
                     = $3

Net profit per year = Income from lemons - Annual costs
                             = $10.50 - $3
                             = $7.50

However, this net profit per year does not include the initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90. To account for this cost, we'll calculate the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost:

Years to cover initial cost = Initial cost / Net profit per year
                                          = $90 / $7.50
                                          ≈ 12

John had $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is $160 (for the video games) + $5 (the remaining money) = $165.

Now, we can find out how much money John got from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the total amount of money he spent from the total amount of money he received: $195 (money from Lego sets) - $165 (total spent) = $30.

However, the question asks how many Lego sets John still has, and we were given that he sold all his Lego sets. This means that John doesn't have any Lego sets left, as he sold all of them.

38," First, let's determine how many miles John runs on the two days when he runs half as much as the first day. Since he runs 3 hours on the first day, and half as much on the other two days, this means he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Now, let's calculate how many miles John runs on these two days. Since he covers 60 miles in a week, and runs for 3 hours on the first day, this means he runs 60/3 = 20 miles on the first day. On the other two days, he runs half as many miles, so he runs 20/2 = 10 miles on each of those days.

Next, let's calculate John's total running time in a week. He runs for 3 hours on the first day, and 1.5 hours on each of the other two days, for a total of 3 + 2*1.5 = 6 hours.

Finally, to find out how fast John runs, we can divide the total distance he covers in a week by his total running time. So, his speed is (60 miles) / (6 hours) = 10 miles per hour.

Now, we need to calculate how many miles Dana can travel while walking for two-thirds of the time and running for one-third of the time. 

First, let's find out how many hours she spends walking and running:
Walking time = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours
Running time = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours

Next, we'll calculate the distance she covers during each activity:
Walking distance = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles
Running distance = 12 miles/hour * 2 hours = 24 miles

John then bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 * 1.5 = $60 each.

Finally, we calculate the total amount John spent on red ties: $60 * 10 = $600.

The revenue from brownies = Price per brownie * Number of brownies sold
                         = $3 * 43
                         = $129

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones without the interest. Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each, so the total cost is 5 * $150 = $750.

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and Shiela bought 5 units. So, the total interest rate is 5 * 2% = 10%. However, this interest is for the whole amount, not for each month.

The payment will be made in 3 installments, so Shiela will pay 1/3 of the total amount plus interest each month. The total amount plus interest is $750 + $750 * 10% = $750 + $75 = $825.

So, each month, Shiela will pay 1/3 of $825. This is $825 / 3 = $275.

First, let's calculate the square footage of each level, starting from the top and moving downwards. The top level has a square footage of 16, and each level below it has half the square footage of the level above it. So:

Level 1 (top level): 16 square feet
Level 2: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
Level 3: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
Level 4 (bottom level): 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

To find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footage of all the levels and then divide by the number of levels. In this case, there are 4 levels, so:

Average square footage = (16 + 32 + 64 + 128) / 4

Simplifying that expression gives:

Next, let's calculate how much dog food Cecilia will need for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so there are 365 days - 180 days = 185 days left in the year after the first 180 days. During these 185 days, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day, so she will need 2 cups * 185 days = 370 cups of dog food.

Adding these two amounts together, Cecilia will need a total of 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups of dog food for the first year.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need to buy 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags of dog food to last for the first year.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2 of the laundry Sarah does.

So, if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then Raymond does (1/2) * 400 = 200 pounds of laundry.

                              = $7200

Next, we need to apply the 10% annual increase for each of the past five years. This is a 5% increase each year for two years, followed by a 5% increase in the third year, and then another 5% increase in the fifth year. We'll calculate the total increase over five years:

Increase in the 1st year = $7200 * 0.05 = $360
Increase in the 2nd year = $7560 * 0.05 = $378
Sylvie's salary after the 2nd year = $7560 + $378 = $7938

In the third year, there is no increase, so Sylvie's salary remains at $7,938.

In the fourth year, there is another 5% increase:
Increase in the 4th year = $7938 * 0.05 = $396.90 (rounded to $397)
Sylvie's salary after the 4th year = $7938 + $397 = $8335

In the fifth year, there is another 5% increase:
Increase in the 5th year = $8335 * 0.05 = $416.75 (rounded to $417)
Sylvie's salary after the 5th year = $8335 + $417 = $8752

Now, Sylvie has completed five years in the company, and we need to calculate her annual salary after three more years of service. From this point onward, Sylvie will receive a 10% increase every year. We'll calculate the total increase over these three years:

Increase in the 6th year = $8752 * 0.10 = $875.20 (rounded to $875)
Sylvie's salary after the 6th year = $8752 + $875 = $9627

Increase in the 7th year = $9627 * 0.10 = $962.70 (rounded to $963)
Sylvie's salary after the 7th year = $9627 + $963 = $10,590

Increase in the 8th year = $10,590 * 0.10 = $1,059

106," First, let's calculate the inner volume of one box. The volume of a rectangular box is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. So for one box, the inner volume would be:

Volume of 1 box = length * width * height
                = 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches
                = 120 cubic inches

However, the question states that the walls of the box are 1 inch thick. This means that the actual inner length, width, and height of the box are 4 inches (length - 2*1 inch thickness), 5 inches (width - 2*1 inch thickness), and 3 inches (height - 2*1 inch thickness) respectively.

So, the actual inner volume of one box would be:

Volume of 1 box = inner length * inner width * inner height
                = 4 inches * 5 inches * 3 inches
                = 60 cubic inches

Since John has 3 such boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes would be:

Total volume = Volume of 1 box * number of boxes
             = 60 cubic inches * 3
             = 180 cubic inches

The final answer is 180 cubic inches.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

2. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.
3. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.
4. So, in total, he watched 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours of 1-hour episodes.
5. He also watched some 30-minute shows, and we know he watched 7 hours of TV in total.
6. Therefore, the remaining time must have been spent watching 30-minute shows: 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

Now, we can find out how far from the shore Julia was when she started rowing:

Distance = Speed * Time
Julia's distance from the shore = 1.25 feet per second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Next, we need to determine how much water entered the boat during this time. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. So, for 80 feet:

115," First, let's calculate the original cost of all the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $10/board = $100

Next, since the price of lumber has increased by 50%, we need to find the new price per board. To do this, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

New price = Original price * (1 + Percentage increase)

In this case, the percentage increase is 50%, or 0.5 as a decimal:

New price = $10 * (1 + 0.5) = $10 * 1.5 = $15

So, the 2 x 4 x 10 boards that Sasha has leftover are now worth $15 each. If she sells them all, she'll make:

Profit from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = Number of boards * (Selling price - Original price)
= 10 boards * ($15 - $10)
= 10 boards * $5
= $50

Now, let's do the same calculation for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. There are five of them, and they originally cost $16 each.

First, we need to find the new price per board:

New price = $16 * (1 + 0.5) = $16 * 1.5 = $24

So, the 4 x 4 x 10 boards are now worth $24 each. If she sells them all, she'll make:

Profit from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = Number of boards * (Selling price - Original price)
= 5 boards * ($24 - $16)
= 5 boards * $8
= $40

Finally, to find the total profit Sasha makes from selling all the boards, we can add the profits from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:

Total profit = Profit from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Profit from 4 x 4 x 10 boards

116," To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we first need to understand the given ratio of 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

The total amount of sugar and water Katy used is given as 120 teaspoons + cups of water. But since we're only interested in the sugar, we'll focus on the 120 teaspoons part of the total.

The ratio tells us that sugar makes up 7 parts of the total, so to find the amount of sugar used, we multiply the total by 7/17 (since 17 is the sum of 7 and 13, the parts in the ratio).

So, the calculation would be: Amount of sugar = Total * (Sugar parts / Total parts)
= 120 * (7 / 17)
= 520 / 17

Therefore, the time it takes Steve to get home is 3 miles divided by 0.083 miles per minute, which is approximately 36 minutes.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, and he skateboards at 264 feet per minute. Using the same conversion as above, Tim's speed in miles per minute is 264/5280, which is approximately 0.05 miles per minute. Therefore, the time it takes Tim to get home is 2 miles divided by 0.05 miles per minute, which is approximately 40 minutes.

So, Steve will finish first and then wait for Tim. The difference in their finishing times is 40 minutes (Tim's time) minus 36 minutes (Steve's time), which is 4 minutes.

Now, we need to convert the length of baguettes from feet to inches because our total length is in inches. We know that there are 12 inches in a foot.

Total length of baguettes = Number of baguettes * Length of each baguette (in inches)

Total legs for mutant invertebrates = Invertebrates * Legs per invertebrate
                                                       = 3 * 10
                                                       = 30 legs

1. Student loans: The minimum payment is $300/month. Fifty percent more than this is $300 * 1.5 = $450/month.
2. Credit card: The minimum payment is $200/month. Fifty percent more than this is $200 * 1.5 = $300/month.
3. Mortgage: The minimum payment is $500/month. Fifty percent more than this is $500 * 1.5 = $750/month.

Now, let's add up these amounts to get Jessica's total monthly payment:

174," First, let's determine how much time it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato. Since it takes 1.5 minutes to peel and 5 seconds to cut, the total time is 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds. 

However, we need to make sure our final answer is in the same unit. Since the longest time given is in minutes, we should convert the 5 seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 or 0.083 minutes.

Now, add the time it takes to peel and cut one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.083 minutes = 1.583 minutes.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prep, we multiply the time it takes to prep one potato by 60: 1.583 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 94.98 minutes.

To make the answer more understandable, we can convert this to hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 94.98 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 34.98 minutes. Since we can't have a fraction of a minute in hours, we'll round up to the nearest minute, giving us 1 hour and 35 minutes.

175," First, let's determine how many gallons of lemonade Juan and Carlos sold. To do this, we'll use the information that they made $25 in profit and sell each glass for $0.50, getting 20 glasses per gallon.

First, let's find out how much money they made from selling lemonade:

Money from sold lemonade = Price per glass * Number of glasses
                           = $0.50 * (Number of gallons * 20 glasses per gallon)
                           = $0.50 * 20 * Number of gallons
                           = $10 * Number of gallons

Now, we know that their total profit was $25, so we can set up an equation to find the number of gallons sold:

Total profit = Money from sold lemonade - Cost of lemons and sugar
$25 = $10 * Number of gallons - Cost of lemons

To solve for the cost of lemons, we first need to find the number of gallons sold. We know that their profit is $25 more than the cost of lemons. Since they spend $3 on lemons for each gallon and $2 on sugar for each gallon, the total cost for each gallon is $5.

Let x be the number of gallons sold. Then, the cost of lemons is 3x. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

$25 = $10x - $5x
$25 = $5x
x = 5

So, Juan and Carlos sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we can find the cost of lemons:

Cost of lemons = Cost per gallon * Number of gallons
               = $3 * 5
               = $15

To find out how much money is left, we need to subtract this amount from Zaid's total salary: 6000$ - (5/12 * 6000$) = 6000$ - 2500$ = 3500$.

Next, we know that Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 3500$ is 1750$, so this is the amount that Zaid donates.

After donating, Zaid has 3500$ - 1750$ = 1750$ left.

Finally, we know that Zaid gives 200$ to his daughter and 700$ to his wife. So, from the 1750$ that he had left, he gives away 200$ + 700$ = 900$.

The amount of money that Zaid will have after all these expenses and donations is 1750$ - 900$ = 850$.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each of them has:

Next, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. There are three even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. Since the die roll is independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) or 1/4.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. So, the difference is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we divide the difference by the total probability (which is 1) and multiply by 100%. So, the answer is (1/4) / (1) * 100% = 25%.

186," Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Russell distributed 160 pieces of straw among the small rodents.
2. The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as R. So, 6R (the amount of straw given to the rats) should be less than or equal to 160 (the total amount of straw distributed).
3. The hamsters are kept alone in 10 cages, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. Since there are 10 cages, the number of hamsters is a multiple of 10. Let's denote the number of hamsters in each cage as H. Thus, 5H should also be less than or equal to 160.
4. We're asked to find the number of rats in each cage (R). To do this, we need to determine how many straws are used for the rats only, since the question doesn't ask for the number of hamsters or the number of straws given to the rabbits.
5. Since the total amount of straw distributed is 160, and the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits doesn't affect the number of rats in each cage, we can focus on the straw given to the rats.
6. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total amount of straw given to the rats should be a multiple of 6. The only way to distribute 160 straws among rats while giving each rat a multiple of 6 straws is if there are 26 rats in total (since 160 is 26 times 6).
7. Since the rats are kept in equal groups, we can now find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages: 26 rats / 3 cages = 8.67 rats/cage. However, this isn't possible since we can't have a fraction of a rat in a cage.

This contradiction indicates that the information provided in the question is inconsistent, and it's impossible to determine the number of rats in each cage with the given constraints.

187," Sure, I'd be happy to help with that!

This is a compound interest problem. Even though Mandy is only paying monthly, the interest is still being calculated based on the remaining balance each month, not the initial amount. 

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form, so 2% would be 0.02).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

However, in this case, we can simplify it a bit because Mandy is paying monthly, but the interest is still annual. So, we can think of each month as 1/12 of a year. Therefore, n = 12 (because the interest is compounded monthly), and t = 3/12 (since Mandy pays after 3 months).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

A = 100(1 + 0.02/12)^(12*3/12)
A = 100(1 + 0.00166667)^1

The total amount spent on both tickets and food is therefore T + (T - $4.50) = 2T - $4.50.

We know that they spent $20.25 on tickets, so 2T - $4.50 = $20.25. Solving for T, we get T = ($20.25 + $4.50) / 2 = $12.375, which means they spent $12.375 on tickets and $12.375 - $4.50 = $7.875 on food. So, the total amount spent on tickets and food is $12.375 + $7.875 = $20.25.

Next, let's find out how much they spent on the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so they spent $33 * 2 = $66 on the rides.

203," First, let's calculate how many slices of cheese Carl used for his sandwiches:

Number of sandwiches = 5 days (since he ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week)
Slices of cheese per sandwich = 2

So, total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = Number of sandwiches * Slices of cheese per sandwich
= 5 * 2
= 10 slices of cheese

Next, let's calculate how many slices of cheese Carl used for his omelets:

Number of omelets = 3 days (since he ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week)
Slices of cheese per omelet = 3 (since he used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich)

So, total slices of cheese used for omelets = Number of omelets * Slices of cheese per omelet
= 3 * 3
= 9 slices of cheese

Finally, adding the slices of cheese used for sandwiches, omelets, and the big dish of macaroni and cheese, we get:

Total slices of cheese used = Slices of cheese used for sandwiches + Slices of cheese used for omelets + Slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese
= 10 + 9 + 8

Next, we want to find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93. To do this, we first calculate the total number of points she needs for an average of 93 over six tests.

93 * 6 = 558

Then, we subtract the points she already has from the desired total.

558 - (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 558 - 438 = 120

Next, let's find out how much less twenty dozen cups cost compared to half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates would be 0.5 * 12 = 6 plates. If each plate costs $6000, then the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Now, we need to find the total cost of buying each cup. To do this, we'll divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 cups.

The longer sides measure 6 miles each, and the shorter sides measure 1.5 miles each. So, the total distance Gary walks is:

Distance = Longer side 1 + Longer side 2 + Shorter side 3 + Shorter side 4
= 6 miles + 6 miles + 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles
= 15 miles

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance at his walking speed. We are given that Gary walks at 3 miles per hour, so:

Each letter is 5 pages long, so in total, Mike writes 5 * 5 = 25 pages a week.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes Mike to write a page. He can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 25 pages, it will take him 25 * 6 = 150 minutes.

Finally, we convert this time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 150 minutes is equal to 150 / 60 = 2.5 hours.

Next, we add the 300 extra minutes Jason used this month:

450 minutes (call with boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Now, subtract the used minutes from Jason's total monthly plan to find out how many minutes he has left:

2. The problem states that this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, if we denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'f', we can write the equation: 28 = 2 * (f + f), because the number of fish in both aquariums is the same.
3. Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us: 28 = 2 * 2f, or 28 = 4f.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday and 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Next, we need to calculate the total calories Sue consumed. One cookie has 200 calories, so she consumed 20 * 200 = 4000 calories on Monday and 26 * 200 = 5200 calories on Tuesday.

Her sister, on the other hand, consumed 5 * 200 = 1000 calories on Monday and 13 * 200 = 2600 calories on Tuesday.

To find the total number of calories more that Sue consumed than her sister, we add up the calories Sue consumed and subtract the calories her sister consumed:

Sue's calories: 4000 (Monday) + 5200 (Tuesday) = 9200 calories
Sister's calories: 1000 (Monday) + 2600 (Tuesday) = 3600 calories

Now, Mr. Sylas wants to distribute these 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows he puts in each stall, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls: 240 cows / 20 stalls = 12 cows per stall.

However, the question asks for the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, not all 20 stalls. So, we simply multiply the number of cows per stall by 8: 12 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 96 cows.

200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections

Next, we need to calculate the weight of the tree after termites have eaten 30% of its wood. To find the weight of the tree post-termite damage, we first need to determine the weight of the tree before the termites. We know that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so the entire tree originally weighed:

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Termites have eaten 30% of this redwood's wood, so we need to find out the weight of the eaten wood:

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight to find the current weight of the tree:

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

So, Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits, and Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.

Flour needed for 36 cookies = Flour per dozen * Number of dozens
                             = 2 cups * 3
                             = 6 cups

Next, we need to calculate the amount of flour needed for baking the cookies tomorrow (30 cookies). Using the same rate as before, we can determine that:

Flour needed for 30 cookies = Flour per dozen * Number of dozens

= 48 cards

Half of these, 1/2, have the letter B:

Number of cards with B = Remaining cards * Fraction with B
= 48 * 1/2

Next, we need to find out how many cards have the letter C on them. To do this, we first find out how many cards do not have the letters A or B. We subtract the number of cards with A and B from the total number of cards:

Cards without A or B = Total cards - Cards with A - Cards with B
= 80 - 32 - 24

Five-eighths of these have the letter C:

Number of cards with C = Cards without A or B * Fraction with C

To find out how long it will take him to dig all the holes, we add the time it takes for the small holes and the large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we convert this time from minutes to hours. We know that 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

Let's denote Sam's current age as `s`. According to the problem, Ruby's current age is `6*s` (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam).

In 9 years, Sam's age will be `s + 9` and Ruby's age will be `6*s + 9`.

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write this as an equation:

`6*s + 9 = 3*(s + 9)`

Solving this equation for `s` gives:

`6*s + 9 = 3*s + 27`
`3*s = 18`
`s = 18 / 3`

70 spots (cobra) / 2 = 35 spots (mamba)

Now, we know there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park. To find the total number of spots all the snakes have, we need to multiply the number of spots each snake has by the number of snakes there are, and then add those two amounts together.

Spots from cobras = Number of cobras * Spots per cobra
= 40 cobras * 70 spots
= 2800 spots

Spots from mambas = Number of mambas * Spots per mamba
= 60 mambas * 35 spots
= 2100 spots

Total spots = Spots from cobras + Spots from mambas
= 2800 spots + 2100 spots
= 4900 spots

Half the number of spots is calculated by dividing the total number of spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = Total spots / 2

Topaz length = Number of gemstones * Length per gemstone
              = 8 * 1 inch
              = 8 inches

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads. We know that the total length of each necklace is 25 inches, so we subtract the length taken up by the topaz gemstones:

Beads length = Necklace length - Topaz length

310," First, let's calculate the total cost of the 6 business suits and 3 suitcases. The cost of a business suit is $100 and Theo buys 6, so the total cost for suits is 6 * $100 = $600. The cost of a suitcase is $50 and he buys 3, so the total cost for suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. 

The total cost of suits and suitcases is therefore $600 + $150 = $750.

Next, we need to find out the cost of the flight ticket. It costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so the cost is 5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Theo wants to save $2000 for this trip. So far, he has spent $750 on suits and suitcases and $1200 on the flight ticket, which totals to $750 + $1200 = $2000.

He has no other expenses mentioned, so this $2000 must be the amount he wants to save. Therefore, the amount he has left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners is the initial $6000 minus the $2000 he wants to save, which is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs consumed daily:

Eggs consumed daily = (Number of people eating three eggs * Eggs per person) + (Number of people eating two eggs * Eggs per person)
Eggs consumed daily = (3 * 3) + (2 * 2)
Eggs consumed daily = 9 + 4
Eggs consumed daily = 13

Next, to find out how many eggs are consumed in a week, we need to multiply the number of eggs consumed daily by seven (since there are seven days in a week):

Eggs consumed in a week = Eggs consumed daily * Days in a week
Eggs consumed in a week = 13 * 7
Eggs consumed in a week = 91

Given that the population of Chile 6 years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time, the population was 3000 * 17 = 51,000 people.

The problem states that the population of Chile 6 years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, if we denote the current population as P, then 6 years ago, the population was P/2. We know that at that time, the population was 51,000. Therefore, we have:

Now, to find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need together, we add the total number of pencils Meg has (46) to the total number of pencils Jam has (24), giving us 46 + 24 = 70 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, Jam and Meg will need 70 / 8 = 8.75 boxes. However, since they can't share a fraction of a box, they'll need to use 9 boxes in total to store all their pencils.

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total number of employees
= (2/5) * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are junior programmers, this means there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers each make $2000 per month, and there are 40 of them. So, the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is:

Money paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary per junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they each make $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is:

Money paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary per senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers:

Total amount of money paid to programmers = Money paid to junior programmers + Money paid to senior programmers

The smallest group has a size that is 10 less than each of the other groups, so it contains x - 10 students.

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into these three groups. Therefore, we can write an equation to represent this relationship:

345," To find the total number of legs, we first need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table. 

For the tables with 4 legs:
Number of legs = Number of tables * Legs per table
               = 40 tables * 4 legs
               = 160 legs

For the tables with 3 legs:
Number of legs = Number of tables * Legs per table
               = 50 tables * 3 legs
               = 150 legs

Then, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:

Total number of legs = Legs from 4-legged tables + Legs from 3-legged tables
                    = 160 legs + 150 legs
                    = 310 legs

Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box every day for 5 days, which is 4 cookies * 5 days = 20 cookies.
Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which is 1 cookie * 7 days = 7 cookies.

So, every week, Jenny sets aside 20 cookies for her son and 7 cookies for her husband, which is a total of 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in the bag, the number of cookies Jenny eats is the total number of cookies in the bag minus the number of cookies she sets aside for her son and husband.

Therefore, Jenny eats 36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies.

Discounted price for one shirt = Original price * Discount rate
Discounted price for one shirt = $30 * 0.6
Discounted price for one shirt = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts at this discounted price, we can now calculate the total cost:

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by the factory when they make silos. They sell 5 silos a day, with each silo making them $220. So, their daily revenue from silos is 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. This means they are making $100 more per day now.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the original amount and multiply by 100. Here, the original amount is the daily revenue from tractors, which was $1000. So, the percentage increase is ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

Time spent swimming = Boating time / 2
Time spent swimming = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time John spent watching shows. Each show was 2 hours, and he watched 3 shows, so:

Time spent watching shows = Show length * Number of shows
Time spent watching shows = 2 hours * 3 = 6 hours

We know that this time spent watching shows represents 30% of John's total vacation time. So, to find the total time, we can divide the time spent watching shows by 30% (or 0.3 as a decimal):

Total time = Time spent watching shows / 0.3
Total time = 6 hours / 0.3 = 20 hours

Now, we know that 40% of John's total vacation time was spent sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we can multiply the total time by 40% (or 0.4 as a decimal):

Now, let's add up all the money Annabelle has: her initial savings of $80, the $200 she earns from her first job, and the $75 she earns from her second job. This gives us a total of $80 + $200 + $75 = $355.

Finally, let's subtract this total amount from the cost of the phone to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save. The phone costs $400, so Annabelle still needs to save $400 - $355 = $45.

Mini-golf + Arcade tokens + Go-karts = $5 + $5 + $10*2 = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we need to find out how much of the $90 budget is left for friends. So, we subtract the cost for Morgan from the total budget.

Budget for friends = Total budget - Morgan's cost = $90 - $30 = $60

Finally, to find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we divide the budget for friends by the cost per friend for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. Since we don't know the number of friends yet, let's call it x.

Cost per friend = $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $10 (go-karts) * x = $20x

Budget for friends = Cost per friend * Number of friends
$60 = $20x * x

Now, we solve for x.

The cost of gumballs was $2, so Billy had $10 for candy: $10 - $2 = $8.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds Billy bought, we divide the total cost spent on candy by the cost per pound:

Pounds of candy = Cost of candy / Cost per pound

We know that the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles, and the train travels 50 miles less than that to get from the third city to the first city. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance the train travels in one complete trip (from the first city to the second city, then to the third city, and finally back to the first city) is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so the number of days it goes between services is 18000 / 675 = 26.67 days.

Collie bed stuffing = 10 pounds / 2
Collie bed stuffing = 5 pounds

Now, we know that Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds using 2 pounds of stuffing each and 3 collie beds using 5 pounds of stuffing each. To find out how much stuffing Mark needs in total, we can calculate as follows:

Total stuffing = (Chihuahua beds stuffing + Collie beds stuffing)
Total stuffing = (4 chi beds * 2 pounds/chi bed) + (3 collie beds * 5 pounds/collie bed)

380," To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five-month period. We can do this using the formula:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

where Principal is the amount borrowed ($3,650), Rate is the annual interest rate (0.10, or 10% expressed as a decimal), and Time is the duration of the loan in years (5 months ÷ 12 months/year ≈ 0.4167 years).

Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × 0.4167 ≈ $154.46

Since the loan requires equal payments every month, we can divide the total interest by the number of months to find the amount of each payment:

Monthly payment = Total interest ÷ Number of months

Monthly payment = $154.46 ÷ 5 ≈ $30.89

The ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. To find the actual numbers of popsicles, we can set up a proportion:

5/ (5+6) = x / 165

Where x is the number of popsicles Betty has, and 165 is the total number of popsicles they have together. Solving for x gives us:

x = (5/11) * 165
x = 75

So, Betty has 75 popsicles. To find out how many popsicles Sam has, we can use the given ratio again:

5 (Betty's popsicles) : 6 (Sam's popsicles) = 75 : y

We can solve for y by cross-multiplying:

5y = 6 * 75
y = 450 / 5
y = 90

So, Sam has 90 popsicles.

Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without bundle = $10/month * 2 = $20/month

With the bundle, Tim gets a 20% discount. To find the cost with the discount, we multiply the cost without the discount by (1 - discount rate).

Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with bundle = Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without bundle * (1 - discount rate)

Time spent recording = 4 hours / 2 (since she spent half as much time) = 120 minutes
Time spent editing = 90 minutes

Now, to find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we need to divide the editing time by the total work time and then multiply by 100%.

Total work time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
Total work time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 450 minutes

Percentage of time spent editing = (Editing time / Total work time) * 100%
Percentage of time spent editing = (90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100%
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2 * 100%
Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

Since a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns forms a square matrix, it means there are 6 columns and each column can hold as many books as there are rows. So, each column can hold 6 books. Therefore, the total number of books that can be placed in the shelving system is:

Number of columns * Books per column = 6 * 6 = 36 books

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. To calculate this, we first find double the number of books that can fit in the shelving system:

Double the number of books = 2 * 36 = 72 books

Now, add 20 books to this value:

Books Wendy will place = Double the number of books + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 books

However, Wendy already has the original 36 books in the shelving system. So, we need to find out how many more books Wendy needs to carry to reach the total of 92 books:

Mark earns $10 per day at his work. To find out how many days Mark needs to save $250, we can divide the total amount he needs to save by his daily earnings:

Number of days = Total savings needed / Daily earnings
Number of days = $250 / $10
Number of days = 25 days

However, we should also consider the $50 Mark already has in his bank account. Since he's already earned this money, we can subtract the number of days it would take him to earn this amount from our previous result:

Days saved due to initial balance = Initial balance / Daily earnings
Days saved due to initial balance = $50 / $10
Days saved due to initial balance = 5 days

So, the final number of days Mark needs to save is:

50000 candles * 1% (or 0.01) = 500 candles

However, we also know that 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We don't have information about how many of these candles will explode, but based on the given information, it's possible that some of these candles might explode.

But the question asks for the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode. Since there is no direct relationship between the two defects, we cannot determine the exact number of candles that will have both defects. Therefore, it's impossible to provide an exact number for this scenario.

From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples, and her sister took twice as many, so she got 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half as many apples as from the tallest trees, so she got 30 / 2 = 15 apples, and her sister took 3 times as many, so she got 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

Together, they have 60 (from tall trees) + 45 (from short trees) = 105 apples from the trees that Joanne also gathered apples from.

Since they gathered a combined total of 500 apples, and 105 of those apples were from the tallest and shortest trees, there must be 500 - 105 = 395 apples left.

For the first four days, Tom's daily distance was 200 kilometers. So, over four days, he made 200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, Tom only traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first four days. So, he made 0.3 * 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so that's zero kilometers.

So, in the first week, Tom made a total of 800 kilometers (first four days) + 240 kilometers (next two days) + 0 kilometers (the day after) = 1040 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. So, over seven days, he made 300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's calculate the number of cats left on the rock after the boats left:

Initial cats - Taken away = Left on the rock

Next, we need to determine how many cats ran after the mouse. Since 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, we can calculate this as:

Left on the rock * 3/5 = Cats that ran after the mouse
30 cats * 3/5 = 18 cats

Finally, to find out how many cats were left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the number of cats left on the rock before they ran after the mouse:

Next, let's find out how much Cole saved on each pair of jeans. Since he saved a total of $6, and saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he must have saved $6 / (1/3) = $18 from the tattered jeans.

Therefore, the tattered jeans were originally priced at $28, but were reduced by $18, meaning they were on sale for $28 - $18 = $10.

The jogger jeans, originally priced at $22, were reduced by an amount that, when added to $10, equals $6. Therefore, the jogger jeans were reduced by $6 - $10 = -$4. However, since it's not possible for the price to be increased by a negative amount, this means that the jogger jeans were not reduced in price at all.

Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $22 - $28 = -$6 more than the tattered jeans. However, since a negative cost doesn't make sense, we can say that the tattered jeans originally cost $6 more than the jogger jeans.

Next, we know that Kenny sold the rest of his cards to get $100 for the amusement park ticket and $50 for spending cash, for a total of $150. Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can find out how many cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money he got from selling the cards by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

Since Kenny kept n/3 cards and sold 100 - n/3 cards (because he kept n/3 cards), we can set up the following equation:

Total number of cards = Cards kept + Cards sold
n = n/3 + 100 - n/3

To solve for n, we can combine the terms with n/3:

n = n/3 + 100 - n/3 * 1
n = n/3 + 100 - n/3 * (1/3 * 3)
n = n/3 + 100 - n/9

Now, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying every term by 9:

9n = 9n/3 + 900 - n
9n = 3n + 900 - n
9n - 3n - n = 900

Then, the caterer prepared extra hotdogs for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs each. So, he prepared extra hotdogs for an additional 36 guests / 2 = 18 guests.

With the unexpected arrival of 40 guests, the total number of guests to be served is now 36 (original) + 40 (new) = 76 guests.

Among these 76 guests, 36 guests were prepared for with one hotdog, and 18 guests were prepared for with two hotdogs each. This accounts for 36 + 2 * 18 = 72 hotdogs.

However, there are only 76 guests, and the caterer has prepared 72 hotdogs in total. This means that 76 (total guests) - 72 (total hotdogs) = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon:

Bike time for James = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes

1. We know that together they collected 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so if we represent the number of insects David found as D, then Lily found D + 7 insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so if we represent the number of insects Bodhi found as B, then David found B/2 insects.
4. Adding up the number of insects each person found gives us the total number of insects: D + (D + 7) + B/2 = 43.
5. Since all three numbers represent whole insects, they must be integers. Therefore, we can multiply our equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 2(D + 7) + B = 86.
6. Rearranging the equation, we get B = 86 - 2D - 2(D + 7).
7. Since Bodhi also found a whole number of insects, the right side of the equation must be a multiple of 2 (because D and 7 are both integers). Testing some values for D, we find that when D = 14, the right side of the equation becomes B = 86 - 2(14) - 2(14 + 7) = 86 - 28 - 42 = 16, which is an integer.

1. Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
3. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy, we simply add up the individual rates:

Total quarts picked per hour = Quarts picked per hour by Tony + Quarts picked per hour by Bobby + Quarts picked per hour by Kathy + Quarts picked per hour by Ricky

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each boy as ""b"". Then, the number of seashells brought by the girls is ""b + 4b"" (which is equal to 5b, because they brought 4 times as many seashells as the boys plus their own share).

Since there are twice as many girls as boys, and each boy brought ""b"" seashells, and each girl brought ""5b"" seashells, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2 * b * 5b = 10b^2.

We know that the total number of seashells brought by both groups is 60 * number of boys = 60b.

Since the total number of seashells brought by both groups is the same as the number of seashells brought by the girls (because the girls brought all the seashells), we can write the equation 10b^2 = 60b and solve for b.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get b^2 = 6b.

Let x be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Then, in the second half, he wants to save 2x each day.

The total amount Elvis saves in the first half is 15x, and the total amount he saves in the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so the sum of what he saves in both halves should equal this target:

Combining the terms on the left side gives us:

Now, to find the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half (2x), we first need to determine the value of x:

x = $1125 / 45
x ≈ $25.00

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can now calculate 2x:

Now, to find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we multiply the number of buttons with two holes by the number of holes in each of those buttons, and do the same for the buttons with four holes:

Total holes = (Number of buttons with two holes * Holes per button) + (Number of buttons with four holes * Holes per button)

James wants candles for both of his sons' birthdays, so he needs two candles for the 12-year-old (one for each year) and two candles for the 4-year-old. That makes a total of 2 + 2 = 4 candles.

However, candles come in packs of 5. So, James needs to buy one pack and will have 1 extra candle. This means he actually bought 5 (from the pack) - 1 (the extra one) = 4 candles for his sons.

The pack of 5 candles costs $3, and since James is only using 4 of them, we might think he should only pay $2.40 (4/5 of the pack's price). But the store can't sell him 4 individual candles for less than the cost of a pack, so James still needs to pay the full price of $3 for the pack of 5 candles.

So, the time spent reading in the second week is:

Total pages / Pages per 1.5 minutes * 1.5 minutes/page
= 100 / 2 * 1.5
= 75 minutes

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night, so the total time spent reading in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (loaf cost) / 10 sandwiches per loaf = $0.30 per sandwich.
The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.
So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $0.30 (bread cost) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is $7.00 * 10 sandwiches = $70.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - ($3.30 * 10 sandwiches)
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00

Area = 216 square feet

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, and old carpet removal:

Carpet cost = Area * Cost per square foot
Carpet cost = 216 square feet * $12 per square foot
Carpet cost = $2592

Padding cost = Area * Cost per square foot
Padding cost = 216 square feet * $2 per square foot
Padding cost = $432

This means that the oven is consistently 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find out what temperature setting would result in a 4% increase from 520.

To do this, we multiply the desired temperature by 104% (or 1.04, since a percentage increase is mathematically the same as multiplying by a value slightly greater than 1) to find the temperature setting that would result in a 4% increase.

587," First, let's determine the number of blue jelly beans. Since the jar contains 4500 jelly beans in total, and the number of red and green jelly beans together should be 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, we can set up the following equations:

Blue jelly beans = b
Red jelly beans = r
Green jelly beans = g

Equation 1: b = 4500
Equation 2: r + g = 0.99 * b (since r + g is 1% less than b)

From Equation 1, we know that b = 4500. Now, let's substitute this value into Equation 2:

r + g = 0.99 * 4500
r + g = 4455

Next, we need to find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans (g - r). However, we only have the sum of r and g. To proceed, we need to make an assumption about the distribution of red and green jelly beans, as long as they follow the given conditions. Let's assume there are 'x' red jelly beans less than blue jelly beans, which means there are 'x' more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Our equation then becomes:
r = b - x
g = b + x

Now, we can rewrite our sum equation as:
(b - x) + (b + x) = 4455
2b = 4455
b = 2227.5

Since we cannot have half a jelly bean, this indicates that our initial assumption about the distribution of jelly beans might not result in exact whole numbers. However, we can still find an approximate answer by rounding b to the nearest whole number, which is 2228 (slightly more than 2227.5).

With this adjustment, our new equation for the number of red jelly beans is:
r = b - x = 2228 - x

And the number of green jelly beans is:
g = b + x = 2228 + x

Now, let's substitute the new value of b into the sum equation:
(2228 - x) + (2228 + x) = 4455
4456 = 4455 (which indicates a slight discrepancy due to rounding)

Finally, to find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we can use the original equation:
g - r = x + x = 2x

Since x represents the difference between the number of blue and red jelly beans, and there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, x is approximately 22 (0.01 * 2228).

Therefore, the number of more green jelly beans than red jelly beans is:

First, let's calculate how much weight Martin would lose if he ate Cheerios every day for breakfast for 5 weeks. We know he'd lose 1.25 pounds per week, so:

Weight change from Cheerios = Weight loss per week * Number of weeks
= 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks
= 6.25 pounds

Next, let's calculate how much weight Martin would gain if he ate donuts every day for breakfast for 5 weeks. He'd gain 1.75 pounds per week, so:

Weight change from donuts = Weight gain per week * Number of weeks
= 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks
= 8.75 pounds

Now, to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we subtract the weight change from Cheerios from the weight change from donuts:

Difference = Weight change from donuts - Weight change from Cheerios
= 8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds

Day 3: 8 x 2 = 16 feet

Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, so the beanstalk needs to be taller than 20 feet for it to be taller than the window. From the calculations above, we can see that the beanstalk reaches 16 feet by Day 3. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we know it will be taller than 20 feet by the next day.

First, let's figure out how old Jerry is now. The problem states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This means that the current Jerry's age is equal to the age he was 5 years ago, doubled.

So, if we denote Jerry's current age as J, then five years ago, Jerry's age was J/2.

Therefore, the age difference between Jerry now and Jerry 5 years ago is J - J/2 = J/2.

Since this difference is 5 years (because Jerry is now 5 years older than he was 5 years ago), we can write this as:

J/2 = 5

Solving for J, we find that Jerry's current age is J = 5 * 2 = 10 years.

Now, to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:

9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $27

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so he spent:

8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

$112 (basketball coach) - $27 (baseball coach) = $85

627," For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day, so that's 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.

On the fourth day, it pulled 4 fewer cars than the previous day, which was 10 cars. So that's 10 cars - 4 = 6 cars.

On the fifth day, it pulled 4 fewer cars than the previous day, which was 6 cars. So that's 6 cars - 4 = 2 cars.

On the sixth day, it again pulled 4 fewer cars than the previous day, which was 2 cars. So that's 2 cars - 4 = -2 cars. But a tow truck can't tow a negative number of cars, so we interpret this as zero cars towed on the sixth day.

On the seventh day, it towed no cars at all.

Adding up all the cars towed, we get: 30 cars (first three days) + 6 cars (fourth day) + 2 cars (fifth day) + 0 cars (sixth day) + 0 cars (seventh day) = 38 cars.

We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, Adam's height in feet is 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet.

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow 4 - 3.33 = 0.67 feet.

We are given that Adam grows 2 inches a year, which is equivalent to 2/12 = 0.167 feet per year.

To find out how many years Adam needs to grow to the required height, we divide the amount he needs to grow by his yearly growth:

Years until he is tall enough = Height difference / Yearly growth = 0.67 feet / 0.167 feet/year ≈ 4 years.

Cost to acquire one car = $25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost to acquire all the cars is:

Total cost to acquire = $7,500 * 10 = $75,000

Next, we need to calculate the profit James made on each car. This is the selling price minus the cost to acquire:

Profit per car = $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is:

Total profit = $17,500 * 10 = $175,000

Bob's speed is 55 mph and Tom's speed is 70 mph. Their combined speed is therefore 55 + 70 = 125 mph.

Now, we divide the distance between them (75 miles) by their combined speed (125 mph):

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 miles / 125 mph

Let's calculate the result:

His parents said they wouldn't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class. Since the current cost per class is $6, Manny can miss some classes without his parents refusing to sign him up again as long as the cost per class doesn't exceed $10.

Now, let's figure out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class reaches $10. If Manny misses a class, he doesn't have to pay for that class. However, the total cost remains the same. So, if Manny misses one class, the cost per class for the remaining classes would be $60 / 9, which is approximately $6.67. Manny can still miss one more class because $60 / 8 equals $7.50, which is still below the $10 limit.

When Manny misses three classes, the cost per class for the remaining classes would be $60 / 7, which is approximately $8.57. At this point, his parents would refuse to sign him up again because the cost per class has exceeded their limit of $10.

Therefore, Manny can miss a total of 3 classes before his parents tell him they won't sign him up again.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

Next, we are told that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 50 minutes (from cooking pork) + 30 minutes (from cooking rice) = 80 minutes. Half of the combined cooking time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Therefore, it took Finley 40 minutes to cook the beans.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound of almonds at $10/pound and 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15/pound. So, the cost of the first mixture is:

(1/2) * $10 + (1/3) * $15 = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound of almonds at $10/pound and 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15/pound. So, the cost of the second mixture is:

(1/5) * $10 + (1/3) * $15 = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:

$10 - $7 = $3

So, the mixture with 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture with 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

1. We know that Lee has only sheep and geese on his farm.
2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
3. If Lee has 20 heads in total, this means he has 20 sheep (since sheep and geese have one head each).
4. Now, let's calculate the number of legs for these 20 sheep. Since sheep have 4 legs, 20 sheep would have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
5. However, we know that the total number of animal legs is 70, not 80. This means that our initial assumption about all 20 heads being from sheep was incorrect.
6. Let's now assume that one of the heads belongs to a goose (since geese have 2 legs). This would mean that there are actually 19 sheep and 1 goose.
7. The total number of legs for these 19 sheep would be 19 * 4 = 76 legs, which is still more than the total of 70 legs.
8. Therefore, we need to reduce the number of sheep further. If we reduce the number of sheep by 1 (making it 18 sheep), the total number of legs for the sheep becomes 18 * 4 = 72 legs.
9. Adding the 2 legs of the goose gives us a total of 72 + 2 = 74 legs, which is still more than the total of 70 legs.
10. So, let's reduce the number of sheep by 1 more time. Now, we have 17 sheep with a total of 17 * 4 = 68 legs.
11. Adding the 2 legs of the goose gives us a total of 68 + 2 = 70 legs, which is equal to the total number of animal legs.

691," First, let's calculate the cost of the two vaccines. Since each vaccine is $20, the total cost for both would be:

2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Next, we need to find out what 60% of the total bill is for the heartworm check. To do this, we first need to know the total bill before the heartworm check is applied. Since the vaccines cost $40, the total bill before the heartworm check is:

$40 + heartworm check = total bill

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can set up the following equation:

0.6 * total bill = heartworm check

We already know that the heartworm check is $40 (since it's 60% of the total bill), so we can substitute this value into the equation:

0.6 * total bill = $40

To solve for the total bill, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.6:

total bill = $40 / 0.6
total bill ≈ $66.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now that we know the total bill, we can subtract the amount that John brought with him to find out how much he leaves with:

$66.67 - $125 = -$58.33

Colorado City's water = 40% of the Colorado River's water

Next, we need to determine how much of that water is not used for industrial purposes. Since 80% of Colorado City's water is used for industrial purposes, it means that 20% of the city's water is used for non-industrial purposes (residential, agricultural, etc.):

Non-industrial water = 20% of Colorado City's water

To find the percentage of the river's total water used for Colorado City's non-industrial purposes, we can divide the non-industrial water by Colorado City's water and multiply by 100:

Percentage of non-industrial water = (Non-industrial water / Colorado City's water) * 100

Substituting the values we found earlier:

Percentage of non-industrial water = (20% of Colorado City's water / Colorado City's water) * 100

Canceling out Colorado City's water:

Percentage of non-industrial water = 20% * 100

Percentage of non-industrial water = 2000%

However, this value is greater than 100%. This is because the question asks for the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, not just the percentage of Colorado City's water. Since Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, the actual percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes is:

Percentage of non-industrial water = (Non-industrial water / Total river's water) * 100

Substituting the values we found earlier:

Percentage of non-industrial water = (20% of Colorado City's water / Total river's water) * 100

Percentage of non-industrial water = (20% * 40%) * 100

Percentage of non-industrial water = 8% * 100

Percentage of non-industrial water = 800%

Result: 800%

Together, the cat and the dog eat nine sausages in 30 minutes, which is the same as eating 18/2 (or 9.5) sausages in 60 minutes. This is because the cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes, and during that time, the dog should have eaten half of one sausage (because the dog eats nine sausages in 20 minutes, and in 30 minutes, the dog would eat 15 minutes worth, or 15/20, which simplifies to 3/4 of a sausage; half of that is half a sausage).

So, the combined rate of sausage consumption is 9.5 sausages per hour. Now, to find the average time it takes for them to eat the sausages together, we need to find how long it takes to eat 9.5 sausages at a rate of 1 sausage per minute. That would be 9.5 minutes.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So, if we denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x (in inches), we can set up the following equation:

100 inches = 9x + 10 inches

Now, we need to solve this equation for x. To do this, first subtract 10 inches from both sides of the equation:

100 inches - 10 inches = 9x
90 inches = 9x

Next, divide both sides by 9:

90 inches / 9 = 9x / 9

This means that 4000 people had voted by midday and 1000 people hadn't voted yet (5000-4000).

Next, we need to find out how many people had voted by 16:00. We know that by 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, so:

Now, to calculate the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine what percentage of the total number of students 60% represents. To do this, we divide 60 by 100 to get 0.6.

Next, we multiply this decimal value by the total number of students in order to find out how many of them are boys in each class. We know that there are 80 students in total, so we perform the following calculation:

The total number of votes is equal to the total number of council members, which is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:

a + 2a = 33

Now, let's solve for ""a"":

3a = 33
a = 33 / 3
a = 11

So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation. Since there were twice as many votes in favor, we can now find this number:

1. First, 20% of the people think horse #2 will win. This means that 80% of the people are left to consider for horses #7 and #12.
2. Next, 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. So, we need to calculate 60% of 80% of the total number of people.
3. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the percentages of people who think horses #2 and #7 will win from the total number of people.

We can set up the equation as follows:

Number of people who think horse #12 will win = Total number of people - (20% of people + 60% of 80% of people)

Let N be the total number of people. Then, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

To find out how many puppies Jana has, we first need to determine how many Pomeranians Jana has in total. Since one third of them are girls and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the total number of Pomeranians by dividing the number of girls by one third:

Number of Pomeranians = Number of Pomeranian girls / (1/3)
= 6 / (1/3)
= 6 * 3/1
= 18

Now that we know Jana has 18 Pomeranians, we can figure out how many puppies she has in total by multiplying this number by the proportion of her puppies that are Pomeranians, which is two thirds:

Total number of puppies = Number of Pomeranians * (2/3)

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for the three houses is 250.
2. The second house needs twice as many shingles as the first house.
3. The third house needs double the number of shingles that the first house needs.

Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the first house. Then the second house needs 2x cases and the third house needs 2*x cases.

The total number of cases of shingles is the sum of the cases for each house, so we can write an equation as follows:
x (first house) + 2x (second house) + 2x (third house) = 250

Solving this equation:
x + 2x + 2x = 250
5x = 250
x = 50

So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles. According to the problem, the third house needs double the number of shingles that the first house needs, so:

Third house needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

So, Tatiana has a total of 4 hours (from Saturday) + 2 hours (from Sunday) = 6 hours left for soccer and video games.

Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. That is, she spends 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours on video games.

Now, subtract 5 miles per hour from 25 to find their hiking speed:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Next, we need to determine how long they were hiking. They spent 1.5 hours hiking.

Now, we can calculate the distance they hiked by multiplying their hiking speed by the time they spent hiking:

Distance hiked = Hiking speed * Time hiking
               = 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours

Since the Llesis family drove and hiked a total of 6 hours to reach their vacation spot, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, this means they spent 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours driving.

To find the distance they drove, multiply their driving speed by the time they spent driving:

Distance driven = Driving speed * Time driving

Since the total number of TVs sold was 40, and one-eighth and one-fourth of those were accounted for by analog and smart TVs, respectively, that means five-eighths of the total sales were OLED TVs (1 - 3/8 = 5/8).

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we multiply the total number of TVs by the fraction of TVs that were OLEDs:

Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs * Fraction of OLED TVs
= 40 * 5/8

However, the pipes will only freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. So, even though the temperature drops to 12 degrees, Carson still has a 20-degree buffer before the pipes freeze.

Each log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. Therefore, he needs to burn enough logs to maintain a temperature of at least 32 degrees inside the house. 

Given that the temperature drops by 33 degrees and each log raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we can calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn by dividing the required temperature increase (the absolute value of the temperature drop) by the heat produced by each log:

Logs needed = Absolute value of (final temperature - initial temperature) / Heat per log
Logs needed = |12 degrees - 32 degrees| / 5 degrees per log
Logs needed = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log
Logs needed = 4 logs

                          = $150

Now, let's calculate the selling price of these lollipops in total. Since they are sold at $0.8 each, we have:

Total selling price = Total lollipops sold * Selling price per lollipop
                            = 300 * $0.8
                            = $240

Finally, to find the profit from selling these lollipops, we subtract the total cost price from the total selling price:

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost price
           = $240 - $150
           = $90

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

1. Lana divides her 27 cups of tea into 3 rows. This means each row has 27/3 = 9 cups.
2. She divides these 9 cups equally between chamomile and mint tea in each row. So, there are 9/2 = 4.5 cups of either chamomile or mint tea per row.
3. However, since we can't have half cups in this context, let's look at the total number of chamomile and mint teas: 2 * 4.5 = 9 cups. This accounts for all the cups intended for chamomile and mint tea.
4. Lana uses the remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea, which is 15 cups.

Now, here's the key point: The question asks for the number of mint tea cups in each row, but it also states that the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row are equal. Since we know there are 4.5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, there must also be 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

The answer is: 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

During this 1-hour trip, the sloth spends 30 minutes (0.5 hours) traveling and 30 minutes eating. Let's denote the number of berries picked up during each trip as ""b."" Since the sloth eats for the same duration as he spends traveling, the number of berries remaining after 1 trip is also ""b.""

In 8 hours, the sloth will pick up:

8 * b = 24 berries

Next, we need to determine how much water is used from the tank each day. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we need to subtract the amount of water used each day from the initial amount in the tank:

He also saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on tickets for those days. He had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. He also had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy. 

In total, Colby has spent $50 (movies on Fri/Sat) + $56 (movies on other days) + $16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) = $130 of his $150 budget. 

On this last day, he wants to see a movie (which will cost $10), get popcorn (which will cost $8), and get a box of candy (which will cost $2), which will cost him a total of $10 (movie) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20.

So, how many movies can he see on this last day? He has $150 in total, he has already spent $130, and he plans to spend $20 more. That means he will have $150 - $130 = $20 left after this last day. Since the movie, popcorn, and candy will cost $20, he can afford to see one more movie.

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. We know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean (let's represent Jean's age as J). So, Paul's age is J + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age (P = P + J).

From point 3, we can deduce that Peter's age is twice the age of Jean plus 10 years (P = 2J + 10).

Now, we need to find an equation for the total combined age:

Total Age = Peter's Age + Paul's Age + Jean's Age
100 = P + (J + 10) + J

We already have an equation for P, so let's substitute it in:

100 = (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J

Solve for J:

100 = 4J + 30
70 = 4J
J = 17.5

Since ages are in whole numbers, Jean's age must be rounded to 17 or 18. However, we cannot determine the exact age based on the given information.

Now, let's find Peter's age using the equation P = 2J + 10:

If Jean is 17, then Peter is P = 2*17 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44

5. Adding all these up, we get the total points, which is 45. So, a + (a + 20) + (a + 10) = 45.
6. Solving this equation gives us a = 12.5. However, since we can't have half points in this context, there seems to be a mistake in the problem.

If we assume that the problem is correct and Bahati scored an integer number of points, then the total points would not be 45, but 46 (23 from Azibo, 13 from Dinar, and 20 from Bahati). However, without adjusting the problem, we can't derive the correct answer.

The final answer is: There seems to be a mistake in the problem as it's currently impossible for Azibo to score an integer number of points that fit the given conditions.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

= 150 pages

However, since the book is printed on both sides of each sheet, we need to divide this number by 2 to get the actual number of pages in the book:

However, we find out that she sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. But she also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she lost a total of 28 minutes of sleep.

To calculate how many minutes she spent sleeping in bed that day, we first need to convert her usual sleep duration from hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Then, we subtract the time she was awake during the night: 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept a total of 452 minutes in her bed that day.

Number of occupied beds = Total beds * Fraction occupied
Number of occupied beds = 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds

Next, let's determine how many beds will be occupied after 2 weeks (14 days) with 50 new patients admitted each day:

Additional occupied beds in 14 days = Patients admitted per day * Number of days
Additional occupied beds in 14 days = 50 * 14 = 700 beds

Now, let's find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

Total occupied beds after 14 days = Initial occupied beds + Additional occupied beds
Total occupied beds after 14 days = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, let's calculate the number of unoccupied beds:

4. The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, there were four times as many holes as there were at the end of the first day. So, at the end of the fourth day, there were 10 * 4 = 40 holes.
5. We know that they found the treasure on the fourth day, so the number of holes they dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day.

962," First, let's determine how much the travel costs excluding the 50% increase. Since Jen is visiting three countries, the total cost of supplies for all trips is divided among these three countries. Therefore, the cost for each country's travel, excluding the increase, is equal to the total supplies cost divided by 3.

Cost per country (excluding increase) = $400 / 3 ≈ $133.33

Now, we need to account for the 50% increase in the cost for each country's travel. To find the total cost after the increase, we multiply the cost per country (excluding increase) by 1.5 (since a 50% increase is equivalent to multiplying by 1.5).

Total cost per country = $133.33 * 1.5 ≈ $200

Finally, to find the total cost of travel for all three countries, we multiply the total cost per country by 3.

3. We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for D: (S + 5) + S + D = 339 => 2S + D = 334.
4. Substituting S = 4D - 13 into this equation gives us 2(4D - 13) + D = 334 => 8D - 26 + D = 334 => 9D = 360 => D = 40.
5. So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. Substituting D = 40 into S = 4D - 13 gives us S = 4*40 - 13 = 157.

First, let's find the distance the bird traveled during the first 10 hours while flying at 30 miles per hour in a southerly direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Next, let's find the distance the bird traveled during the 2 hours it flew at 18 miles per hour in a northerly direction:

Finally, let's find the distance the bird traveled during the last 5 hours while flying at 22 miles per hour in a southerly direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Now, let's add these distances together to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

Next, let's find the age of Nani's sister. She is 25% younger than Nani, so we need to find 25% of 8 and subtract that from 8. To find 25% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.25 (because 25% is equivalent to the fraction 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4, or 0.25). So, 8 * 0.25 = 2. Now, subtract 2 from 8 to get 6. This means Nani's sister is 6 years old.

Finally, to find the total age of all three family members, add their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30.

988," First, let's calculate how much money Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck, so:

Money for shoes = Jessica's monthly income * Percentage set aside
               = $2000 * 0.25
               = $500

Next, we need to figure out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. She spends $1000 on each pair, so:

Number of shoes per year = Money for shoes per month / Cost per shoe
                         = $500 / $1000
                         = 0.5

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. This means that she can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a month when she doesn't have enough for a full pair.

Over a year, she can buy 12 * 0.5 = 6 pairs of shoes, since she's setting aside money each month.

However, she can't buy a fraction of a shoe, so again, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. This means that she can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

989," First, let's determine how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = Total shrimp to peel / Shrimp peeled per minute
= 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute
= 15 minutes

Next, let's consider the sauteing process. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. However, since we want to saute the same 90 shrimp that she just peeled, we need to figure out how many batches this will take and if it will add any additional time.

Number of batches = Total shrimp to saute / Shrimp sauteed per batch
= 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per batch
= 3 batches

Since Emily doesn't need any time to finish one batch and start another (as implied by the original problem), the sauteing process will still take 10 minutes for all three batches.

Therefore, the total time required for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the sauteing time:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to saute
= 15 minutes + 10 minutes
= 25 minutes

For the first 3 hours, the air conditioner was on low, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. So, during this time, the room temperature decreased by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour. Therefore, during this period, the room temperature decreased by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

Afterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. Consequently, during these 2 hours, the room temperature increased by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, let's add up the total change in temperature during these stages:

Total change = Change on low + Change on high + Change after being turned off
= 6 degrees - 12 degrees + 4 degrees
= -2 degrees

The final temperature was 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the combined length of their howls:

Tobias + Chikote + Igneous = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by the number of seconds in a minute (60 seconds):

Now, let's calculate the average age of the group without considering Helene's age. We know that the total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Wilfred is 3 (Akbar's age) + 4 (Alessandro's age) + Wilfred's age. The sum of their ages is also given as 20. So,

3 + 4 + Wilfred's age = 20
Wilfred's age = 13

However, we must check if Helene's age conforms to this average age. The average age of the group, excluding Helene, is 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67 years. If Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, then her age should be approximately 6.67 * 2 = 13.34 years. But since ages are whole numbers, it's more reasonable to consider the average age as 6 years, making Helene's age 12 years (which is twice the average age).

With this adjusted average age, let's recheck if Wilfred's age (13 years) still holds. The total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene is now 3 (Akbar's age) + 4 (Alessandro's age) + 12 (Helene's age) = 19 years.

Walter's neighbors donated $500, so the lawyer's contribution based on that amount would be:

Lawyer's contribution from neighbors = Neighbors' donation * 3
Lawyer's contribution from neighbors = $500 * 3
Lawyer's contribution from neighbors = $1500

Walter also collected $1500 from an online fund. If we apply the same ratio, the lawyer's contribution based on the online fund would be:

Lawyer's contribution from online fund = Online fund * 3
Lawyer's contribution from online fund = $1500 * 3
Lawyer's contribution from online fund = $4500

Now, we add the lawyer's contributions from both sources:

Total lawyer's contribution = Lawyer's contribution from neighbors + Lawyer's contribution from online fund
Total lawyer's contribution = $1500 + $4500
Total lawyer's contribution = $6000

However, we know that the lawyer will only contribute $200 more than this amount to match Walter's expectation. Therefore, the final contribution from Walter's lawyer will be:

               = 180 minutes

Next, let's calculate how much time Doctor Jones spends on appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes, and he has 10 appointments, so:

Time on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
                    = 10 * 30 minutes

Doctor Jones is spending a total of 480 minutes on rounds and appointments. Since he is at the clinic for nine hours, which is 9 * 60 = 540 minutes, we can find out how much time he has left to update his records by subtracting the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic:

Time left = Total time at the clinic - Total time on rounds and appointments

Now, we can find out what fraction of a box one chocolate bar is by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of chocolate bars sold: 80 bars / 64 bars = 5/4.

Since one box is typically considered as a whole, we can infer that the 3/4 part of a box doesn't exist physically. However, based on the mathematical result, if we were to consider a box as 5 equal parts, then each part would represent 80/5 = 16 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per session. This would be the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, or $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Assuming the dance studio is rented for the same number of sessions each day and for all 7 days in a week, the total number of sessions per week would be 3 (days) * 7 (days) = 21 sessions per week.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month would be 21 (sessions per week) * 4 (weeks) = 84 sessions per month.

1017," First, let's determine how many pictures Olivia put into the selfie albums. We know that she created 3 selfie albums and put the same number of pictures in each album. So, the number of selfies is:

Selfies = Number of selfie albums * Pictures per album
Selfies = 3 * Number of pictures per album

Next, let's determine how many pictures Olivia put into the portrait albums. We know that she created 2 portrait albums and put the same number of pictures in each album. So, the number of portraits is:

Portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
Portraits = 2 * Number of pictures per album

Now, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures. This total number of pictures is the sum of the selfies and portraits:

Total pictures = Selfies + Portraits
72 = (3 * Number of pictures per album) + (2 * Number of pictures per album)

To solve for the number of pictures per album, we can factor out the common term:

72 = 5 * Number of pictures per album

Now, divide both sides by 5 to find the number of pictures per album:

Number of pictures per album = 72 / 5
Number of pictures per album = 14.4

Since Olivia can't put a fraction of a picture in an album, this means that she put 14 pictures in each album. Now, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits:

Selfies = 3 * 14
Selfies = 42

Portraits = 2 * 14
Portraits = 28

Result: Olivia had 42 selfies and 28 portraits.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

Price of large stuffed animal = 3 * $4 = $12

Teresa earned $120 from the sales, and the price of large stuffed animals is $12, so:

L * $12 = $120
L = $120 / $12

Now we know that with a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day. If there are 40 dwarves, then:

40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day

To find out how much ore they can mine in a month with 30 days, multiply the daily amount by the number of days:

1. There's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. So, there's a 50% chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework because of this.
2. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40%) that Marcus will still have to turn in his homework if the teacher gives an extension.
3. If the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, there's an 80% chance (100% - 20%) that Marcus will still have to turn in his homework if he doesn't get a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:

50% (substitute teacher) + 60% * 40% (normal teacher with extension) + 50% * 40% * 20% (normal teacher without extension and personal extension)

Finally, let's account for the socks. They cost $8, and Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Adding up all these costs, Alison spent $10 (for the top) + $15 (for the shorts) + $24 (for the shoes) + $6 (for the socks) = $55.

Number of tiles = Total area / Area per tile
Number of tiles = 200 sqft / 1 sqft
Number of tiles = 200

Now that we know 200 tiles are needed, we can calculate the total cost of the renovation. Each tile costs $12, so:

A king size set is equivalent to two twin sets because a standard king size sheet set includes two king size fitted sheets, just like a twin set includes one fitted and one flat sheet. So, when Greg washes a king set, it's the same as washing two twin sets.

In total, Greg washes the equivalent of 4 twin sets in one load (2 twin sets + 1 king set or 4 twin sets).

Now, let's calculate the number of loads per week:
- 4 twin sets + 1 king set = 5 sets of sheets
- Washed in lots of 4 sets = 5 ÷ 4 = 1.25 loads per week
- Since Greg can't do a fraction of a load, he'll have to do 2 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year to get the annual total:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. She was prescribed 30 pills and each pill costs $4. So, the cost for the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.

The parking cost is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, even if she stayed for less than 2 hours, she would still have to pay for 2 hours. Therefore, the cost for parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost. The total cost is $150 (doctor's consultation) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) + $200 (cast) = $582.

So, 14 pizzas were eaten by the glee club and 6 pizzas were left uneaten.

Next, let's find out how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of these, so:

Now, if Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for a week's supply, and there are three monkeys who eat a combined total of bananas per day, then the total number of bananas eaten in a day is 10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) = 24 bananas.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas needed for a week is 24 (bananas per day) * 7 (days) = 168 bananas.

However, Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas, which is more than what's needed for a week. This means that some bananas are left over each day, and the third monkey eats those leftovers.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas available each day: 

Bananas eaten by the third monkey = Total bananas - Bananas for the first two monkeys

The problem states that James walked halfway to the store before realizing he forgot something. This means that he had already covered half the distance between his home and the store. 

Since his home is 4 miles from the store, this means he had walked 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

The problem also states that James walks 4 miles per hour. Since speed is equal to distance divided by time (speed = distance/time), we can rearrange this formula to find time (time = distance/speed).

So, the time it took James to reach the point where he realized he forgot something is time = distance/speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

However, since James then had to walk back home, we need to add this time as well. Because the distance is the same, the time it took him to walk back home is also 0.5 hours.

Next, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from selling each type of bike. An MTB bike costs $500, so he earned 105 * $500 = $52,500 from MTB bikes. A BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB bike, so it costs $500 / 2 = $250. Therefore, Marcel earned 45 * $250 = $11,250 from BMX bikes. A Trekking bike costs $450, so Marcel earned 150 * $450 = $67,500 from Trekking bikes.

Finally, let's add up Marcel's earnings from all types of bikes to find his total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

Next, we need to account for the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He dedicates 1/16 of his weekly minutes to each of these days, so:

Extra learning time = (1/16 + 1/16) * total weekly minutes
= 1/8 * 1600 minutes
= 200 minutes

Now, we add his weekly class time and the extra learning time to find his total weekly study time:

Total weekly study time = class time + extra learning time

1. Ellen started with 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them and took 1 unshaken soda, leaving with her 1 shaken soda and 1 unshaken soda, for a total of 2 sodas.
2. This means that there are now 10 sodas left in the case: 3 shaken and 7 unshaken.
3. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas in the case, for a total of 7 sodas.
4. So, when Ellen's friend comes along, there are 7 sodas in the case, 2 of which are shaken.

To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of randomly picking a shaken soda. Probability is defined as the number of desired outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

In this case, the number of desired outcomes (shaken sodas) is 2, and the total number of possible outcomes (total sodas) is 7.

The probability (P) of picking a shaken soda is:

P(shaken soda) = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
P(shaken soda) = 2 / 7

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage = P(shaken soda) * 100
Percentage = (2 / 7) * 100

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 28.57%, or 28.57% if you want to include more decimal places.

Worker 1 and 2 produce 6 toys per hour, so in 10 hours they produce 6 * 10 = 60 toys each.
Worker 3 and 4 produce 4 toys per hour, so in 10 hours they produce 4 * 10 = 40 toys each.

So, the first 4 workers produce 60 + 60 + 40 + 40 = 200 toys in total.

The manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys, but even after the 10-hour shift, they still need 400 - 200 = 200 toys to fulfill the order.

The fifth worker works during these 10 hours as well, and they produce 20 toys in this time (since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys more to complete the order).

Now, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. Since they work for 10 hours and produce 20 toys, they must produce 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

His second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply Kory's dog's weight by 0.5:

0.5 * 60 pounds = 30 pounds

Now, to find the total weight of both Elijah's dogs, we add their weights together:

15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds

Finally, to find the total weight of both Elijah's and Kory's dogs, we add Elijah's dogs' weight to Kory's dog's weight:

Eggs painted by Arnold (A) = Eggs painted by Madeline (M)

And the total number of eggs painted by them is:

A + M = 56 / 2 (since the sum is divided by 2, it means that both Arnold and Madeline painted an equal share)
A + M = 28

Next, let's find out how many eggs Camden (C) and Sarah (S) painted together. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:

C = S + 12

And the total number of eggs painted by them is:

C + S = 30

Now, substitute the expression for C from the first equation into the second equation:

(S + 12) + S = 30
2S + 12 = 30
2S = 18
S = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted:

C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now, we can compare the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:

Difference in eggs painted = Camden's eggs - Arnold's eggs
Difference = 21 - A

However, we don't have a specific value for A, only that A + M = 28. Since A and M are equal, A = 14.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces. Again, converting this to pounds, we get 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

Finally, to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 12.5 pounds (crayons) + 12.5 pounds (boxes) = 25 pounds.

Logs = Total height / Height per log
= 80 feet / 4 feet
= 20 logs

Since 80% of the tree can be made into logs, this means that the 20 logs represent 80% of the tree. We can find out what 100% of the tree is by dividing the number of logs by 80% (or 0.8 in decimal form):

100% of tree = Number of logs / Percentage as a decimal
= 20 logs / 0.8
= 25 logs

This means that each log represents 100% of the tree / Number of logs = 25 logs, or 1 foot of the tree.

Since John cuts 5 planks from each log, and each log is 1 foot tall, this means that John gets 5 planks per foot of the tree.

To find out how much money John makes from selling all the planks, we can multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

Money made = Number of planks * Price per plank

4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15000 = $30000 per month.

To find out how much they all earn together, we add up their individual earnings: $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (her brother) + $30000 (their mother) = $45000.

First, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles, it means she walks 1 mile in 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes on the beach.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, which is 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:

The final temperature can be calculated using a weighted average, where the weight is the amount of water from each mug.

In this case, Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. To find the final temperature, we can use the following formula:

Final temperature = (T1 * w1 + T2 * w2) / (w1 + w2)

where T1 is the temperature of the first mug (33 degrees), w1 is the weight of the water from the first mug (4 ounces), T2 is the temperature of the second mug (unknown), and w2 is the weight of the water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Plugging in the values, we get:

Final temperature = (33 * 4 + T2 * 1) / (4 + 1)

We know that Donny can drink the water in the bottle, so the final temperature must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

40 <= (33 * 4 + T2 * 1) / 5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the denominator, we get:

200 <= 132 + T2

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

Next, since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected:

Carrey's seashells = Carlos' seashells / 2

Next, let's calculate how many carrots he eats during the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). There are 2 weekend days, and he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats in a weekend day is:

Carrots per weekend day = Carrots per day * Number of weekend days
= 5 carrots * 2 days

To do this, multiply the number of people (2300) by the percentage of the daily energy demand covered by one bottle (0.2):

2300 people * 0.2 = 460

This means that one bottle covers 460 ""person-demand-percentages"" (for the sake of simplicity) of the daily energy demand.

Next, we need to figure out how many person-demand-percentages 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people would be. To do this, multiply the number of people (2300) by 100% (or 1):

2300 people * 1 = 2300

Now, we can calculate how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people by dividing the total number of person-demand-percentages needed (2300) by the number of person-demand-percentages covered by one bottle (460):

2300 / 460 ≈ 5

Since 5 bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs for 1 person, we can now calculate how many bottles are needed for 2300 people:

5 bottles * 2300 people = 11,500 bottles

Since the Hortex company currently produces 4,200 bottles per day, we can now calculate how many more bottles they would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:

Now, let's find out the number of purple-wearing octuplets that also wear bows. Since 1/4 of the octuplets wear blue, the remaining 3/4 wear purple, and 1/3 of these wear bows. So, the fraction of purple-wearing octuplets with bows is (1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4.

Next, let's consider the total number of octuplets wearing bows. This includes both the blue-wearing octuplets (1/4) and the purple-wearing octuplets with bows (1/4). Therefore, the total fraction of octuplets wearing bows is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Finally, to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can divide the number of purple-wearing octuplets with bows by the total number of octuplets with bows:

Probability = Purple-wearing octuplets with bows / Total octuplets with bows

Face masks used in 1 day = Goes out per day * Mask changes per outing
= 3 * 2
= 6 face masks

To find out how many face masks he uses in two days, we need to multiply this daily usage by 2:

                                   = 400 * 0.6
                                   = 240 apartments

So, in total, John collects garbage from 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 240 (third complex) = 640 apartments.

He collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, and gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, his earnings from one apartment in a week are $0.40 * 3 = $1.20.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of fruits produced during the first 9 years. We know that a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the fruits of a 5-year-old tree, so it yields 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. Similarly, a 7-year-old tree yields 7 * 50 = 350 fruits, and an 8-year-old tree yields 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits. However, the tree doesn't produce any fruit in the ninth year. So, the total amount of fruits produced during the first 9 years is 150 + 350 + 800 = 1300 fruits.

Finally, to find the total amount of fruits produced during the first 10 years, we add the amount produced in the 10th year to the amount produced during the first 9 years: 1000 + 1300 = 2300.

Yellow rope = Blue rope + 7

We know that the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write an equation for the total length as:

Red rope + Blue rope + Yellow rope = 37

Now, replace the yellow rope with the expression we found earlier:

Red rope + Blue rope + (Blue rope + 7) = 37

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write this as:

Red rope = 4 * Blue rope

Now, we have three equations with three variables:
1. Red rope = 4 * Blue rope
2. Yellow rope = Blue rope + 7
3. Red rope + Blue rope + Yellow rope = 37

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's express the yellow rope in terms of the blue rope:

From equation 2, Yellow rope = Blue rope + 7

Substitute the yellow rope in equation 3:

Red rope + Blue rope + (Blue rope + 7) = 37
Red rope + Blue rope + Blue rope + 7 = 37
Red rope + 3 * Blue rope = 30

Now, substitute the red rope in terms of the blue rope from equation 1:

(4 * Blue rope) + 3 * Blue rope = 30
7 * Blue rope = 30

Now, divide both sides by 7 to find the length of the blue rope:

Blue rope = 30 / 7 ≈ 4.29 centimeters

Finally, substitute the length of the blue rope back into the equation for the red rope:

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as: C + 25 = (1/3) * W.

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables (W and C). To solve for C, we need to eliminate W. We can do this by manipulating the first equation to isolate W: W = 5C + 35.

Next, substitute this expression for W into the second equation: C + 25 = (1/3) * (5C + 35).

Solving this equation for C, we get:

1186," To find the total distance Sam ran in a week, we need to add up the distances he ran on each day. We know that:

* On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day.
* On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day.

To find the total distance, we can use the following equation:

Total distance = (Distance on Monday) + (Distance on Tuesday) + (Distance on Wednesday) + (Distance on Thursday) + (Distance on Friday)

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

Total distance = 3 miles + 5 miles + 3 miles + 5 miles + 3 miles

Adding up these distances, we get:

Total distance = 24 miles

1187," First, let's determine how many snowballs Jay loses every hour due to melting. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, in one hour (which has 4 quarters of 15 minutes each), Jay will lose:

Snowballs lost in 1 hour = Snowballs lost per 15 minutes * 4
= 2 * 4
= 8 snowballs

Now, we need to figure out how long it takes for Jay to make 60 snowballs, taking into account the ones that are melting. We'll add the number of snowballs Jay makes to the number he doesn't lose due to melting.

To have 60 snowballs after considering the melting, Jay needs to make:

Total snowballs = 60 (desired snowballs) + 8 (snowballs not lost to melting per hour)

Snowballs made per hour = 68

We know that Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour, so we need to determine how many hours it takes for him to make 68 snowballs:

Hours needed = Snowballs made / Snowballs made per hour
= 68 / 20
≈ 3.4 hours

However, since Jay can't have a fraction of an hour, we'll round up to the nearest whole hour. This accounts for the fact that, even though it takes slightly less than 3.4 hours to make 68 snowballs, Jay will still be losing snowballs to melting during that time.

Next, we need to find out the cost of coloring her hair, which is $40.

To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

1192," First, let's calculate Jen's earnings from her hourly rate. She works for 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, which amounts to:

Hours per week = Hours per day * Days per week
= 7.5 hours * 6 days
= 45 hours

Since April has 4 weeks, the total hours Jen works in April is:

Total hours in April = Hours per week * Weeks in April
= 45 hours * 4 weeks
= 180 hours

Her earnings from her hourly rate would be:

Earnings from hourly rate = Hourly rate * Total hours in April
= $1.5 * 180 hours
= $270

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance in a week. Since she has complete attendance for all 4 weeks in April, she will receive:

Additional earnings from attendance = Attendance bonus * Weeks in April
= $10 * 4 weeks
= $40

To find Jen's total earnings for April, we add her earnings from her hourly rate and her additional earnings from attendance:

Total earnings = Earnings from hourly rate + Additional earnings from attendance
= $270 + $40
= $310

So, Jen will receive a total of $310 for April.

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so the cost is $60/bottle * 1.5 = $90/bottle.

Finally, to find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: $90/bottle * 20 bottles = $1800.

Total students = Grades * Students per grade
= 6 * 10
= 60 students

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by the group size to find out how many groups there will be:

Number of groups = Total students / Students per group
= 60 / 8
= 7.5

Since we cannot have half a group, we'll round up to 8 groups to accommodate all 60 students.

Now, let's calculate the time needed for all students to try the escape room. Since every group uses their full 45 minutes, we can multiply the number of groups by 45 minutes:

Time = Number of groups * Time per group
= 8 * 45

First, let's break down the call into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the total cost for the first 16 minutes would be:

16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute. So, the total cost for the next 20 minutes would be:

Next, we need to calculate how much Charlie charges for the lessons with the veteran. Since the standard fee is reduced by 25%, this means that Charlie charges 75% of his standard fee. So, for each lesson with the veteran, Charlie earns:

Fee for veteran lessons = Standard fee * 75%

However, Archie gets a $3.00 discount on one bag. Therefore, the actual price he pays for the bag is:

1. The first side takes John 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each, for a total of 20 minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 minutes each. However, since John solves the fifth side instantly after the fourth side, we don't need to add the time for the fifth side.
4. Therefore, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is the sum of the times for the first, second, third, and fourth sides: 5 minutes + 20 minutes + 2.5 minutes = 27.5 minutes.

2. On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
3. On the third day, the number of people was twice the number of the second day, so he saw 70 * 2 = 140 people.
4. The rest of the days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, and we have information for the first three days, there are 7 - 3 = 4 remaining days.
5. So, the total number of people Conor saw on these 4 remaining days is 60 people/day * 4 days = 240 people.

To find the total number of people Conor saw that week, we add the number of people he saw on the first three days to the number he saw on the remaining 4 days:

Total people = People on day 1 + People on day 2 + People on day 3 + People on remaining days

So, the total area from small t-shirts is 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

For the medium t-shirts:
There are 8 medium t-shirts, each with an area of 4 square feet.
So, the total area from medium t-shirts is 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

For the large t-shirts:
There are 6 large t-shirts, each with an area of 6 square feet.
So, the total area from large t-shirts is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, to find the total area of the quilt, we add the areas from all three types of t-shirts:

Total area = Area from small t-shirts + Area from medium t-shirts + Area from large t-shirts
Total area = 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet

6. These 30 extra legs are divided by the 2 extra legs each cow has, which gives us 15 cows.
7. If there are 15 cows, then there must be 20 - 15 = 5 chickens.

So, the result is 5 chickens.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
1318," First, let's find out how many pieces of pizza are available in total. We know that there are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So:

Total slices = Pizzas * Slices per pizza
             = 7 * 8
             = 56 slices

Next, we need to divide this total number of slices equally among the 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends). To do this, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
                   = 56 / 4
                   = 14

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. However, since a whole pizza is 8 slices, this would mean that each person gets about 1 and 1/2 pizzas, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem, as it's not possible for 4 people to evenly share 7 pizzas if each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

The answer is: This is not possible given the information provided.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
